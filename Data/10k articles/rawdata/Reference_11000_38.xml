The '''Acropolis Museum''' ({{lang-el|Μουσείο Ακρόπολης}}, ''Mouseio Akropolis'') is an [[archaeological museum]] focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. The museum was built to house every artifact found on the rock and on the surrounding slopes, from the [[Greek Bronze Age]] to [[Roman Greece|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greece]]. It also lies over the ruins of a part of Roman and early Byzantine [[Athens]].

The museum was founded in 2003, while the Organization of the Museum was established in 2008. It opened to the public on 20 June 2009.&lt;ref name="Wonderful Greece"/&gt; Nearly 4,000 objects are exhibited over an area of 14,000 square metres. The Organization for the Construction of the new museum is chaired by [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Archaeology]], [[Dimitrios Pandermalis]].

==History==
The [[Old Acropolis Museum|first museum]] was on the Acropolis; it was completed in 1874 and underwent a moderate expansion in the 1950s. However, successive excavations on the Acropolis uncovered many new artifacts which significantly exceeded its original capacity.

An additional motivation for the construction of a new museum was that in the past, when Greece made requests for the return of the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles]] from the United Kingdom, which acquired the items in a controversial manner, it was suggested by some British officials that Greece had no suitable location where they could be displayed. Creation of a gallery for the display of the Parthenon Marbles has been key to all recent proposals for the design of a new museum.

===Competitions for the new museum===
[[Image:M01.jpg|thumb|250px|The archaeological site over which the new museum is built - the pink [[Museum of the Center for the Acropolis Studies|Weiler Building]] is seen top right, the two buildings scheduled for demolition are seen top left, with the hill of Lycabettus barely visible behind them]]
[[Image:Makrigianni037jqnfo.jpg|thumb|250px|Εarthworks in the archaeological site in Makrygianni, during the construction of the museum.]]

The first architectural competition to design a new museum was held in 1976 and was limited to participants from Greece. Both the 1976 competition and one that followed it in 1979 failed to produce any results mainly because the plots of land selected for the proposed constructions were deemed unsuitable.

In 1989, a third competition for the design of the new Acropolis Museum was announced that would be international. A choice of three possible sites was provided. This competition was won by the Italian architects, [[Manfredi Nicoletti]] and Lucio Passarelli. After delays throughout the 1990s, work on the construction of the museum based on this third design progressed to the stage of excavations for the foundations, but these were stopped due to apparently sensitive archaeological remains on the site, leading to annulment of the competition in 1999.  In retrospect, the location of the new museum was rather straightforward: the large lot of the unused "Camp [[Ioannis Makrygiannis|Makrygianni]]" [[Greek Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]] [[barracks]], opposite the [[Theater of Dionysus]].  The barracks were built on public land and a limited number of expropriations of surrounding private houses were needed to free up the necessary space.  The main building of the old barracks, the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] "Weiler Building", has been renovated and houses the [[Museum of the Center for the Acropolis Studies]].

The fourth competition had made no provision for the preservation of the ancient site. These were met to a degree only after local and international ([[ICOMOS]]) campaigners exposed this oversight and it became the final competition. The new plans were adjusted so that the building was elevated above ground, on pillars. Competition was open only to architectural practices by invitation and it was won by New York–based architect, [[Bernard Tschumi]], in collaboration with the Greek architect [[Michael Photiadis]].  Excavation has revealed two layers of modest, private roadside houses and workshops, one from the early Byzantine era and another from the classical era.  Once the layout and [[stratigraphy]] of the findings were established, suitable locations for the foundation pillars were identified.  These traverse the soil to the underlying [[bedrock]] and float on roller bearings able to withstand a [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale magnitude]] 10 earthquake.

As construction work neared completion, the operation to move the historic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] the {{convert|280|m|yd|sp=us|adj=on|lk=out}} distance from the Acropolis rock to the new museum started in October 2007, took four months, and required the use of three [[Crane (machine)#Fixed|tower cranes]] to move the sculptures across the distance without mishap. Greek officials expressed their hope that the new museum will help in the campaign for the return of the [[Parthenon Marbles]].&lt;ref name=BBC.15.10.2007&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7044407.stm BBC News], ''Cranes move Acropolis sculptures'', Retrieved on 2007-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APA.MPA.18.10&gt;[http://www.ana-mpa.gr/anaweb/user/selectlang?lang=el&amp;currpageurl=%2Fuser%2Fshowplain%3Fmaindoc%3D5726043%26maindocimg%3D5725562%26service%3D6 Athens Press Agency, Macedonian Press Agency]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204235524/http://www.ana-mpa.gr/anaweb/user/selectlang?lang=el&amp;currpageurl=%2Fuser%2Fshowplain%3Fmaindoc%3D5726043&amp;maindocimg=5725562&amp;service=6 |date=December 4, 2007 }}, ''New Acropolis Museum to open in stages in 2008'', Retrieved on 2008-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Acropolis and Acropolis Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|Parthenon (left) and Acropolis Museum (right).]]

The museum is located by the southeastern slope of the Acropolis hill, on the ancient road that led up to the "sacred rock" in classical times. Set only {{convert|280|m|yd|sp=us}},  away from the [[Parthenon]], and a mere {{convert|400|m|yd|sp=us}} walking distance from it, the museum is the largest modern building erected so close to the ancient site,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} although many other buildings from the last 150 years are located closer to the Acropolis. The entrance to the building is on [[Dionysiou Areopagitou Street]] and directly adjacent to the [[Akropoli metro station]] the red line of the [[Athens Metro]].

==The building==
The design by [[Bernard Tschumi]] was selected as the winning project in the fourth competition. Tschumi's design revolves around three concepts: light, movement, and a tectonic and programmatic element. Together these characteristics "turn the constraints of the site into an architectural opportunity, offering a simple and precise museum" with the mathematical and conceptual clarity of ancient [[Greece|Greek]] buildings.

The collections of the museum are exhibited on three levels while a fourth middle level houses the auxiliary spaces such as the museum shop, the café and the offices. On the first level of the museum there are the findings of the slopes of the Acropolis. The long and rectangular hall whose floor is sloping, resembles the ascension to the rock. Then, the visitor is found at the large trapezoidal hall which accommodates the archaic findings. On the same floor there are also the artifacts and sculptures from the other Acropolis buildings such as the [[Erechtheum]], the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] and the [[Propylaea]] and findings from Roman and early Christian Athens. Visitors are intended to see the latter during descent in order to keep the chronological order: they will first be directed to the top level, which displays the [[Parthenon]] marbles.

The top level of the Museum sits askew on the lower levels to achieve the same cardinal orientation of the ancient temple on the Acropolis.  The spacing of the columns of the Parthenon hall is the same as that of the ancient temple, and the use of glass walls on all four exterior walls allows the natural light to illumine the Parthenon marbles as they do on the ancient temple.  The 48 columns in the Parthenon hall mark the outline of the ancient temple and form a colonnade for the display of the Parthenon marbles. For ease of viewing, the pediment marbles are displayed at eye level in front of the end columns; the [[Metopes of the Parthenon|metopes]] are displayed on the columns, two per column, but not as high as in the ancient temple; and the [[Parthenon Frieze|frieze]] are displayed behind the metopes, forming a continuous band around the walls of a rectangular space set inside the columns, as in the ancient temple but not as high, again for ease of viewing.  From the north side of the Parthenon hall, one can see the ancient temple above on the Acropolis.

As the museum is built over an extensive archaeological site, the floor, outside and inside, is often transparent using glass and thus the visitor can see the excavations below. The museum also provides an amphitheatre, a virtual theatre and a hall for temporary exhibitions.

==Controversy==
[[File:New Acropolis Museum 5.jpg|thumb|250px|Archaeological site below the main entrance to the museum.]]

A controversy erupted over the plans of the new museum and whether it was appropriate to build it on the archaeological site in [[Makrygianni, Athens|Makrygianni]] neighborhood. Another concern was whether a large modern building would fit well into the landscape.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini November 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papathanasopoulos|first=G.|date=2002-11-12|title=Aντιπαράθεση για το Nέο Mουσείο Aκρόπολης|journal=[[Kathimerini]]|publisher=news.kathimerini.gr/|issue=Sunday November 10, 2002|language=Greek|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_1_10/11/2002_43463|accessdate=2009-05-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215004608/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_1_10/11/2002_43463|archivedate=February 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, another controversy erupted over the proposed demolition of two historic buildings. These are in front of the museum, numbers 17 and 19, Dionysiou Areopagitou Street,&lt;ref name=INTBAU&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.intbau.org/newsarchive2007.htm#Acropolis161007 |title=Acropolis Now: Call for help to save neoclassical architectural heritage of Athens |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-12-17 |work=International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture and Urbanism |publisher=intbau.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102182849/http://www.intbau.org/newsarchive2007.htm#Acropolis161007 |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; facing the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] (see picture, left).  Bernard Tschumi has been showing photographic images of the space in front of the museum edited to remove the two buildings and nearby four-story-tall trees. The [[Greece|Greek]] Government has had the two buildings de-listed historically  although one is [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]]&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and the other an example of [[Art Deco]] architecture.&lt;ref name=INTBAU/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Protests against the proposed demolition came from international agencies such as [[INTBAU]]&lt;ref name=INTBAU/&gt; and [[ICOMOS]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2891014.ece |title=Vangelis Papathanassiou fights Greek gods of demolition |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2007-11-23 |work=The Sunday Times |publisher=www.timesonline.co.uk |last=Campbell |first=Matthew | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of '''albinism in popular culture''', especially the portrayal of people with [[albinism]] in film and fiction, has been asserted by albinism organizations and others to be largely negative and has raised concerns that it reinforces, or even engenders, societal prejudice and discrimination against such people.&lt;ref name="noah1"&gt;[http://www.albinism.org/pressRelease/pressRelease2005-01-06.html "'Evil Albino' missing from 2004 movies. Will ''The Da Vinci Code'' revive the cliché?"], The National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation, 6 January 2005; accessed 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is sometimes referred to as the ''"evil albino" [[plot device]]''.&lt;ref name="noah1" /&gt;

The "evil albino" [[stereotype]] or [[stock character]] is a [[villain]] in [[fiction]] who is depicted as being albinistic (or displaying physical traits usually associated with albinism, even if the term is not used), with the specific and obvious purpose of distinguishing the villain in question from the heroes by means of appearance.&lt;ref name="noah1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinema4"&gt;[http://www.skinema.com/Evil3Albin1.html "Beyond the pale: Hollywood's unwritten rules for characters with albinism"], ''Skinema: Dermatology in the Cinema'', Dr. Vail Reese; accessed 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Traits of albinism commonly associated with the evil albino stereotype include pale skin, platinum blonde hair, and blue or pink-to-red eyes. Notably absent from most depictions is impaired vision, which is experienced by most real people with albinism.&lt;ref name="noah1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinema1"&gt;[http://www.skinema.com/SpotMediaMatrix1.html "Furor Over ''The Matrix: Reloaded''"], ''Skinema: Dermatology in the Cinema'', Dr. Vail Reese; accessed 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skinema2"&gt;[http://www.skinema.com/SpotMediaMatrix2.html "Furor Over ''The Matrix: Reloaded'' — Continued"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110151305/http://www.skinema.com/SpotMediaMatrix2.html |date=10 November 2014 }}, ''Skinema: Dermatology in the Cinema'', Dr. Vail Reese; accessed 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotype has become sufficiently well-recognized to attract satire and to be considered a [[cliché]].  In response to the "albino gunmen" characters in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', albinistic actor Dennis Hurley wrote, produced and starred in a [[short film]] parody, ''[[The Albino Code]]'', playing up the stereotypes, illustrating a typical example of real-world prejudice, and pointing out that the vision problems associated with albinism would make a successful career as a hitman highly improbable.  In ''[[The Big Over Easy]]'', author [[Jasper Fforde]] includes an "albino community" protest against albino bias among his fictional news clippings, most of which satirize stock characters and hackneyed plot devices.  ''Chicago Tribune'' movie reviewer Mark Caro says of this character type that it is someone "who looks albino and thus, in movie shorthand, must be vicious".&lt;ref name="CTribCaro"&gt;[http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-031222movies-review-mc-coldmountain,0,7819885.story "Movie review: ''Cold Mountain''"]; Caro, Mark; ''Chicago Tribune'' (online edition), date unspecified; accessed 13 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation]] (NOAH) has stated that there were a total of sixty-eight films from 1960 to 2006 featuring an "evil albino".&lt;ref name="CNN-DVC"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/17/film.davinci.protests/index.html "Early viewers pan ''Da Vinci Code'': Film's release also provokes widespread protests"]; no by-line; ''CNN.com'' "Entertainment" section / ''Associated Press Newswire'', 17 May 2006; accessed 13 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a number of real people with albinism have risen to fame {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see {{section link||Notable people with albinism}}, below}}, especially in popular music and fashion modeling (though, as in [[#autumn|the case of the Winter brothers]], may themselves be the subject of "evil albino" parody). Albino animals capture public imagination and wonder as zoo attractions, and even in the wild can attract popular, positive attention {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see {{section link||Notable albino animals}}, below}}.

==History of the "evil albino" stereotype==
The "evil albino" stereotype may also have its roots in [[Neolithic]] [[Eastern Europe]], where some cultures depicted [[Death (personification)|Death]] as a pallid woman with light hair.&lt;ref&gt;''The Language of the Goddess'', [[Marija Gimbutas]], 1989, page 198&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear of [[vampires]] and other legendary [[undead]] with a deathly [[pallor]], especially in European folklore, could also have contributed to albino bias.  The phenomenon may also have been influenced by attitudes towards people with albinism in Africa or Jamaica, where those with that condition are sometimes regarded as cursed or magical {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see {{section link||Folklore, urban legends and myths}}, below)}}.  [[Dermatology|Dermatologist]] Dr. Vail Reese theorizes that albino bias may be part of a broader Hollywood pattern of equating or at least linking skin disorders and appearance problems with villainy.&lt;ref name="skinema3"&gt;[http://www.skinema.com/Evil1Scars.html "Most movies that feature skin disease use it to represent evil"], ''Skinema: Dermatology in the Cinema'', Dr. Vail Reese; accessed 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation may be sought in respective ideals of ugliness — most "evil albinos" appear in works of fiction from the West. In fiction from Japan, where ideals call for as pale skin as possible, characters with albinism or associated traits are more frequently sympathetic&lt;ref name="LunaEterna1"&gt;[http://www.lunaeterna.net/popcult/anime_manga.htm "Japanese Anime and Manga"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040129143332/http://www.lunaeterna.net/popcult/anime_manga.htm |date=29 January 2004 }}, ''Albinism in Popular Culture'', by Luna Eterna, 1997–2006; accessed 8 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; than in American and British fiction.&lt;ref name="LunaEterna2"&gt;[http://www.lunaeterna.net/popcult/comics_eng.htm "American and British Comics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116234936/http://www.lunaeterna.net/popcult/comics_eng.htm |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''Albinism in Popular Culture'', by Luna Eterna, 1997–2006; accessed 8 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that [[Japanese popular culture]] has not depicted "evil albinos". However, such characters in Japanese fiction are often ''[[bishōnen]]'' or ''[[bishōjo]]'' whose beautiful appearance gives contrast to their evil character.  Use of albinistic features to indicate villains in Hollywood films appears to have begun in the 1960s, and may be related to the popularity of tanning (and thus a decrease in pale skin being seen as attractive) in this period.&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;

One of the oldest perceived literary examples of albino bias was [[H. G. Wells]]'s depiction of the main character in his 1897 science-fiction novel ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', who was able to become invisible using his scientific discoveries only because he already lacked natural pigmentation; aberrant even before his experimentation, he subsequently became completely deranged.

Albino bias is also alleged in modern times. For example, the 2003 Warner Bros movie ''The Matrix Reloaded'' featured two sociopathic characters with pale skin and white hair frequently interpreted to be albinos despite studio declarations that they are not.&lt;ref name="skinema2" /&gt;  Positive depictions of albinos in mass culture are rarer, though one example is the 1995 film ''[[Powder (film)|Powder]]'' which depicts an exceptionally gifted albinistic youth and the cruelty he endures from "normal" people because of his differences. In recent years, the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) has spoken out&lt;ref name="noah1" /&gt; against albino bias in the United States.  Albinistic actor Michael C. Bowman, of ''[[Me, Myself and Irene]]'', has said, "Kids all over this country are being affected in a very negative and harmful way because of the sloppiness and laziness of a writer in Hollywood."&lt;ref name="skinema2" /&gt;

==Albinism and fiction==
{{hatnote|1=Note: These lists do {{em|not}} include characters whose appearance is reminiscent of albininism, but for reasons other than actual albinism. These include but are not limited to aliens, the undead, magical beings, unusually-colored anime/manga characters, etc.  An exception is characters commonly perceived to be albinistic.&lt;!--"Commonly perceived" must be demonstrated by reliable sources per [[WP:RS]] on a case-by-case basis.--&gt;}}
&lt;!--Examples of characters already removed, and which will be deleted if added again without corroboration from reliable sources:
  * Alien races, as in "Stargate: Atlantis", ''I Come in Peace", and "Star Wars: Episode II"
  * Nosferatu and other flimic vampires; Solomon Grundy from "Green Lantern"; and other "living-dead"
  * Various anime/manga and game characters, like Albedo Piazzolla and Wilhelm in "Xenosaga", Ramirez/Zelos in "Skies of Arcadia"; Rei Ayanami in "Neon Genesis Evangelion" (Rei is said by one NON-AUTHORITATIVE source to be an albino, but the story itself says her appearance is the result of human-alien crossbreeding); Keel Lorenz also from "Evangelion" who has white hair and poor vision simply because he is very old; Yukishiro Enishi in "Rurouni Kenshin" (turned pale by grief); and many other such chars. with white or off-white hair and sometimes even red eyes, but normal skin tone, such as Sephiroth in "Final Fantasy VII" and Dark Bakura.
  * Zao, the genetically "bleached" Asian in "Die Another Day"; Geralt of Rivia in "The Witcher" series, a cat-eyed magical mutant of elvish descent.
  * Superhero mutants like La Lunatica in "X-Men 2099", and Punk Rocket in "Teen Titans"
Adding such characters because you think they "might" be albinos or "should" be considered albinos is disallowed [[WP:OR|original research]].
--&gt;
A number of movies, books and other works have been criticized&lt;ref name="noah1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinema1" /&gt; for '''albino bias''', as they associate the uncommon features of albinistic people (pale skin, white hair, and unpigmented eyes) with danger, terror, or criminality. Less frequently they are depicted as the harmless butt of jokes and ridicule, as maladjusted and undersocialized, or as "[[freak]]s".&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinema5"&gt;[http://www.skinema.com/Evil4Albin2.html "Book two of Hollywood's rules of albinism"], ''Skinema: Dermatology in the Cinema'', Dr. Vail Reese.&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also actually be portrayed positively, even heroically – a more recent counter-trend.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
In the 2012 Canadian movie [[war witch]] (rebelle) by Kim Nguyen, telling the story of a runaway child soldier in West Africa and an albino boy played by [[Serge Kanyinda]], albinos play an important role. The movie portrays an albino community.

He is a religious fanatic and an assassin who murders several people, although he repents at the end of the book, praying to God for mercy and forgiveness.  Critics have called the portrayal "damning", "hateful", and "cruelly stereotypical".&lt;ref name="Softpedia1"&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Da-Vinci-Code-Albinos-Murderer-Depiction-Was-Slammed-19949.shtml "''The Da Vinci Code'' Albinos&amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; Murderer Depiction Was Slammed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418162901/http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Da-Vinci-Code-Albinos-Murderer-Depiction-Was-Slammed-19949.shtml |date=18 April 2007 }}; Gheorghe, Adina; ''Softpedia Reviews'', 20 March 2006; accessed 13 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In defense, author Brown has pointed out that "Silas's skin color has nothing to do with his violent nature – he is driven to violence by others' cruelty... not by anything inherent in his physiology" and that he believes "the novel's portrayal of Silas is a compassionate exploration of how difficult albinism can be – especially for young people – and how cruelly societies can ostracize those of us who look different", going on to say he considers Silas to be the most sympathetic character in the story.&lt;ref name="Silas"&gt;[http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html Dan Brown's FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=16 January 2009 }} Retrieved on 21 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Burkina Faso|Burkinabé]] immigrant who, lacking a pituitary gland, harvested them from other African or African-American men to restore his skin tone. He is compared unfavourably to a vampire like creature from West African folklore (the eponymous Teliko) by a Burkinabé ambassador.

* The clairvoyant albino [[Juni Swan]] in [[Darren Shan]]'s "[[The Demonata]]" series is characterized by her deceptive and sadistic nature as well as her exceptional beauty. However, in ''[[Death's Shadow (novel)|Death's Shadow]]'', the seventh book of the series, she appears as a hideously deformed monster.

* Bigboy, the sadistic, ruthless chief of the prison guards in the Stephen Hunter novel ''Pale Horse Coming.''

* Olivia Presteign, the daughter of a powerful business man in [[Alfred Bester]]'s [[The Stars My Destination]], is responsible for numerous homicides along with various other crimes.  Her albinism renders her blind to the normal spectrum of light visible to humans, but she is able to see the infrared spectrum.
* The anime/manga Deadman Wonderland features two albinos named Chan and En as bodyguards to the main antagonist of the series, the director of Deadman Wonderland named Hagire Rinichirou. They are twin brother and sister, and are incredibly loyal to Hagire, seeing him as a father figure and killing people who merely insult him. There is also a third albino, one of the main characters, named Shiro, who appears an innocent and complacent young girl, but has a cruel and psychopathic alter ego knows as the Wretched Egg, which is Hagire's lifetime obsession.
* The Mark clones in [[Hitman: Blood Money]] are genetically-created assassins from the rival organization The Foundation.
* Shadow Prove from Bakugan New Vestroia is most probably albino. He often laughs at other peoples problems and tries to annoy but hates being insulted by Mylene, his companion. He is part of the evil organisation Vexos.
;Animals and other non-humanoid characters
*In ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', the main [[antagonist]], named Rudy, is a huge albino ''[[Baryonyx]]''. Unlike most other dinosaurs in the film, he is depicted as vicious, vindictive and entirely inimical.

Born once every few hundred years, they are always insane, tyrannical, and far larger than even the other gnawers. The only one featured in the series is Pearlpelt.  He is, however, an exception, as all the ''Underland'' humans are albinos, and they are generally portrayed favorably, with varying personalities. {{crossref|(See also ''Underland'' humans, below.)}}

===Subjects of ridicule and "freaks"===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
{{See also|#Film and television coverage of discrimination against albinism}}
In the last few decades, there has been an increase in the number albinistic characters who are mocked (sometimes by the actual works in which they appear, an instance of albino bias itself, and sometimes by other characters in a way that highlights albino bias).
&lt;!-- *** READ THE HTML COMMENT NEAR THE TOP OF THE "Fiction" SECTION BEFORE ADDING TO THIS LIST! *** --&gt;
* "Powder", the eponymous character in the movie ''[[Powder (film)|Powder]]''. The name can be seen as mocking or derogatory; however the depiction can be seen as positive in its portrayal of the effects of bias against those with albinism.&lt;ref name="skinema5" /&gt;
* Autumn Lynn Henderson, the sister of the protagonist in "Mercy Among the Children" by [[David Adams Richards]].  Already an outcast in their small New Brunswick town because of their father's reputation, she is further alienated during her adolescence due to her albinism.  Her brother (and protagonist) Lyle tries to make Autumn's life easier by purchasing a wig and contact lenses for her, but it helps very little in the treatment of her by the other children.
*Casper, a.k.a. "Whitey" or "Q-Tip"&lt;ref name="skinema2" /&gt; (played by [[Michael Bowman]]), in ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;  His [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|alleged real name is as mocking]] as his nicknames. He is the subject of a good deal of ridicule, which may be accurately representative of the casual discrimination that people with albinism are often made to suffer, and is accurately depicted as having impaired vision, and is a vital friend of the main characters. The genuinely albinistic actor "somewhat regrets" taking the role: "I worried that it was sending the wrong message."&lt;ref name="skinema2" /&gt;
* Cee-Cee, a character in "The Mediator" novel series by [[Meg Cabot]], is ridiculed by her classmates. Generally portrayed fairly accurately as a person with albinism, wearing protective clothing, sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses outdoors, though said to have purplish irises even though that is rare. While described supportively, as intelligent. On the other hand, Cee-Cee's aunt, who also has albinism, reads [[tarot cards]] and speaks with the dead.
* Harold Kline, in ''Ghost Boy'', a novel by [[Iain Lawrence]], is an albinistic youth who ran away from home and ended up working in the circus with the other "freaks", as people called them. His portrayal is supportive, but the "freak" label is not, even if accurately depicting biased attitudes.
* The hermaphrodite in [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''.&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
Neutral or at least morally uncertain depictions of persons with albinism are also somewhat common in literature and film, as anti-heroes, morally confused characters, or simply incidentally.

* [[Elric of Melniboné]], the main character of an eponymous series of fantasy novels and short stories by [[Michael Moorcock]] that began in 1961 with "The Dreaming City". Elric is described as handsome and intelligent, but physically weak without the aid of drugs and magic. In the book ''Stormbringer'', Elric's final battle saw him heroically defeating the evil forces of Chaos to become the last person alive before the rebirth of humankind. The author stated in 2004 that he had received no complaints with regards to his treatment of albinism since "after all, Elric is a hero (if somewhat flawed)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multiverse.org/fora/showthread.php?t=538 |title=Elric &amp; Albinism. - Moorcock's Miscellany |publisher=Multiverse.org |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717055216/http://www.multiverse.org/fora/showthread.php?t=538 |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elric also frequently murders in cold blood and is classified by some reviewers/critics as an anti-hero, even a protagonist–villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=4045 |first=Joe |last=Crowe |title=''Elric: Stealer of Souls'' Reviewed |work=Revolution Science Fiction |location=[[Drums, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=Revolution Web Development |date=25 April 2008 |access-date=16 December 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091129223826/http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=4045 |archive-date=29 November 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elric was based in part on the aforementioned M. Zenith. &lt;small&gt;''(See [[Elric of Melniboné|main article]] for further sources.)''&lt;/small&gt;
* "Snow", an albinistic psychic who achieves a messianic following, has his story told in ''[[Snow (Spock's Beard album)|Snow]]'', a [[concept album]] by [[progressive rock]] band [[Spock's Beard]].  The portrayal is ambiguous and unrealistic, and the character has a stereotypical moniker.
* "U.V.", played by non-albinistic actor [[Chad E. Donella]], in the film ''[[Disturbing Behavior]]''. He is not a villain, but a [[Stoner (cannabis)|stoner]] with a stereotypical nickname that refers to his skin sensitivity, while on the other hand has a clever sense of humor, is "hip", and is well-accepted by his friends.&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt; &lt;small&gt;''(See [[Disturbing Behavior|main article]] for additional sources.)''&lt;/small&gt;
* "The bride" (played by the genuinely albinistic&lt;ref name="skinema6"&gt;[http://www.skinema.com/Real3Genetic.html "Realistic Characters with Genetic Conditions"], ''Skinema: Dermatology in the Cinema'', Dr. Vail Reese; accessed 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Costa), in ''[[Nobody's Fool (1986 film)|Nobody's Fool]]'' (1986)&lt;ref name="imdbfool"&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0091642/fullcredits#cast "Full cast and crew for ''Nobody's Fool'' (1986)"], at IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; Depicted accurately, though possibly mostly for comedic effect, as requiring sunglasses under her veil at her outdoor wedding, and mocked behind her back as having landed a husband out of pity, but shown as engaging in a normal societal role.&lt;ref name="skinema6" /&gt;
* Snowdie McLain, an albinistic woman, is a central character in Eudora Welty's "[[The Golden Apples]]", a book of connected stories set in Mississippi. Other characters sometimes link Snowdie's albinism to her reserved manner or her perceived helplessness.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}&lt;!--None of this exposition tells us much about the character. How is the portrayal non-positive enough that it is in the neutral/ambiguous section?--&gt;
* [[Hinoto|Princess Hinoto]], in the [[X (manga)|''X'' manga and TV series and ''X-1999'' movie]]. While a heroine in the original comics and movie, she becomes a villain in the follow-up television series.  Has red eyes in some episodes, purplish in others.  Accurately portrayed as having vision problems, but also given deaf-muteness, lameness, and psychic powers.&lt;ref name="LunaEterna1" /&gt;
* "Whitey" (played by [[Robert Englund]]), in ''[[Buster and Billie]]''. He dyes his hair black, but is known by his nickname, which he wears on his hat.&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;
* The detective, in ''What's the Worst that Could Happen?''&lt;!-- (197?)--&gt;. Like the villain in ''Foul Play'', he wears all-white suits.&lt;ref name="skinema4" /&gt;
* Olympia Binewski, an albinistic, [[Alopecia totalis|bald]], [[Kyphosis|hunchbacked]] [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], from the 1989 novel ''[[Geek Love]]'' by [[Katherine Dunn]]. "Oly" is the narrator of the story, and as part of a family intentionally bred for defects for traveling carnival show purposes is no more or less "freakish" than the rest of the major characters; her albinism appears simply to have been selected at random by the author as a genetic abnormality to add to the list. ''(See [[Geek Love|main article]] for sources and further detail.)''{{Clarify|date=September 2007}}&lt;!--This was originally filed under the heroic/positive section. What is heroic or positive about this portrayal? The [[Geek Love]] article does not give any hint, and simply being the main character doesn't necessarily mean it is positive; cf. ''[[The Jackal]]'' for a (non-albinistic) example.--&gt;
*Cielle, a minor character in the flash animation film ''[[Broken Saints]]'', is an albinistic occultist with white dreadlocks and pink eyes who gives a prophetic tarot card reading to characters Raimi and Oran. Although Oran scorns her, she is not offended and claims that many people don't understand her condition.
*The personification of [[Prussia]] in the anime/webcomic [[Hetalia: Axis Powers]] is commonly perceived by fans of the series to be an albino, because of his red eyes and silver-white hair. Whether or not he actually albinistic has not been discussed in the series canon, however.
*Mr. Skimpole, a character in ''[[The Somnambulist]]'' at first seems evil, but is made more likable through his crippled son, whom he cares for (although the narrator insinuates that his son might be a fabrication, to make Skimpole seem more sympathetic).
* Kevin Smith, the silent, knife-wielding British assassin in [[Goichi Suda]]'s ''[[Killer7]]'' video game, one of the seven Smith personalities the player may control. Although a protagonist, the character's occupation as a murderer is not particularly heroic. &lt;small&gt;''(See [[Killer7|main article]] for sources).''&lt;/small&gt;
* Theokoles, "the Shadow of Death", is an albinistic, pink-eyed [[gladiator]] in the fifth episode, "Shadow Games" (2010), of the [[Starz (TV network)|Starz]] TV series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]''. He is depicted as a huge and greatly feared, savage warrior prone to blood-lust, "a beast that has never been tamed". Despite the fact that at least one review labels the character an "evil albino",&lt;ref name="TVTropes Spartacus"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitlelr67penz |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |title=Spartacus: Blood and Sand |work=TVTropes.com |location=[[Rice Lake, Wisconsin]]  |publisher=Gu Straley |year=2010 |access-date=3 March 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418213613/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitlelr67penz |archive-date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theokoles is also said to have won many fortunes and his freedom via his long-undefeated string of victories in the arena, for which he is respected as well as feared by other gladiators.
* The Underland humans from Suzanne Collins's "[[The Underland Chronicles]]" novel series are all albinistic, with violet eyes, since they live underground and are not exposed to the sun. They are portrayed as no different from any other race, with varying personalities. ''(See also The Banes, above.)''
* Hansberry in the film, [[A Guy Thing]] (2003).
*The Anime/manga series "[[Deadman Wonderland]]" features an albino character named Shiro (Which is Japanese for "White"). She is introduced as an absurdly strong but ditzy and kind girl who knew the main character Ganta as a child and was in love with him. It is later revealed that Shiro is a split personality. Her secondary persona is called the Wretched Egg, a violent, psychopathic murderer. The Wretched Egg persona becomes one of the main antagonists while the Shiro persona struggles in vain to retake control. This puts her in the odd position of being both the villain and a victim.
* Brynden Rivers, also known as Bloodraven for a birthmark on his neck, is an albino character in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' who, while a bastard of the Targaryen bloodline, decided to not side with his rebelling siblings against the throne long before the series begins. He loses an eye during said rebellion, and serves the realm afterwards. Later he is revealed to still be living, although it us unclear if he is a villain or not thus far.
* One of the ''sangomas'', or witchdoctors, in ''[[Shaka Zulu (TV series)|Shaka Zulu]]'' has albinism.
*In [[Games Workshop]]'s [[tabletop game]] "[[Horus Heresy (2010 board game)|The Horus Heresy]]" the Emperor's Children Space Marine legion is described as having a gene-seed defect that results in an "occasional incidence of albinism, and a shift in iris colour to violet in some recruits." The Emperor's Children are initially depicted as being obsessed with achieving personal perfection in all ways, though they seemed not to care about this defect. They were the only legion allowed to bear the Emperor's name, and the only legion allowed to bear his personal standard, the "Palatine Aquila." However, they were also one of the legions which betrayed the Imperium during the Horus heresy event. Whether or not this makes them evil is entire subjective, as arguments can be made for both the Imperium and the Traitor Legions being good or evil. It is unknown whether this gene-seed defect still exists in [[Warhammer 40,000]] (of which the Horus Heresy is a spin-off game.)
*In [[Kazuma Kamachi]]'s [[A Certain Magical Index]], Accelerator, is an esper with albinism due to his ability. At first he is portrayed as a villain in the story, but as the story progresses he is portrayed more of an anti-hero.

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 02.png|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[White Rabbit]] is arguably one of the most famous albino characters in literature.]]
* The [[White Rabbit]] from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.  (Although Carroll did not specifically state that the character is albinistic, and not all white rabbits are albinos in real life, both the [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|1951 adaptation]] and the [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|2010 Tim Burton re-imagining]], among other more obscure versions, depict him as an albino, with pink eyes.)  While the White Rabbit is timid and nervous, he is depicted as one of the saner and more intelligent denizens of Wonderland.
* In [[C.S. Lewis]]'s novel ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', the protagonist Ransom (an Englishman visiting [[Mars]]) encounters three species of intelligent [[Martians]]. One Martian individual is unpigmented.{{Clarify|date=September 2007}}&lt;!--AND...?  Tell us something about the character's portrayal.--&gt;

*In the ''[[Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' episode "Arabian Desert Danger", Penelope tries to cross a desert to donate a young albino [[camel]] to a [[zoo]] without having to put the animal in danger.
*Philip of Macedonia, Uncle Amos's pet crocodile from ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.
*In ''[[Flushed Away]]'', an albino rat named Whitey is one of the villain's henchmen; although he works for the villain, he comes across as friendly and good-natured with no malicious intent (making him an ambiguous example rather than a clearly negative one).

Persons with albinism are sometimes depicted heroically or otherwise positively, or at least accurately with regard to their condition and its medical and social results:

*Alexander Kramir, from the novel Lentara is a fairly accurately portrayed boy with Albinism who helps an alien race save the Earth and falls in love with an alien. He later fathers a child who will help save the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Michelle|title=Lentara|year=2010|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bibwit Harte, Queen Alyss's albino tutor from [[Frank Beddor]]'s [[The Looking Glass Wars]]. A human version of the [[White Rabbit]] ''(see above)'' from [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]], he has large, unusually sensitive ears, and his name is an [[anagram]] of "white rabbit."
* Dancy Flammarion, the monster-slaying heroine of [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]]'s ''Alabaster'' comics, as well as many prose stories by the author, including her novel ''Threshold'' and the short stories collected in [[Alabaster (short story collection)|''Alabaster.'']]
*[[Beowulf Shaeffer|Beowulf "Bey" Shaeffer]], hero of several stories in [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] series, from the planet We Made It, which is populated primarily by albinistic people due to a [[founder effect]] from the original colonists. &lt;small&gt;''(See [[Beowulf Shaeffer|main article]] for sources.)''&lt;/small&gt;
* Bran Davies, in "[[The Dark Is Rising]]" novel series, is a positive portrayal but somewhat inaccurate because the character lacks any vision problems.
* [[Bjørn Beltø]], an archaeologist in [[Tom Egeland]]'s Norwegian novel ''Sirkelens Ende'' (''Circle's End''), {{ISBN|82-03-18974-1}}, which pre-dates but is very similar to ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', which incidentally features an albinistic person in a negative role while Egeland's novel does the opposite.
* [[List of The Venture Bros. characters|Pete White]] in ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' animated series on "[[Adult Swim]]". An albinistic computer scientist and friend of Dr. Venture from his college years, he runs "Conjectural Technologies" with Master Billy Quizboy, Boy Genius. The name is stereotypical (as per superhero convention), but his intelligence is accentuated, and the character is not otherwise mocked, although Dr. Venture makes a reference in the pilot to an experiment gone awry with a device called an "albino bomb." This line does not seem to be canon though. In an earlier career as a TV quiz host, he wore a black wig and used makeup in an attempt to appear "normal", although this fear came less from discrimination than from his own desire to be popular.
* Misaki Saiki, an albinistic dominatrix, is the principle heroine in the ''[[Vulgar Ghost Daydream]]'' manga.  She speaks to ghosts for a special government agency, but such fantasy is common in the genre. &lt;small&gt;''(See [[Vulgar Ghost Daydream|main article]] for sources.)''&lt;/small&gt;
* Billy Raven of the "[[Children of the Red King]]" novel series, an albinistic orphan initially manipulated into helping a villain, is overall a sympathetic character. Realistically, he needs eyeglasses; unrealistically, he has the magic ability to talk to animals, although his supernatural abilities are said to not be related to his albinism (cf. "Snow" and "Powder", etc., above).
* [[Geralt of Rivia]] from Andrzej Sapowski's 'The Witcher' series.
* Whylas (played by Dennis Hurley who has albinism), in ''[[The Albino Code]]'', a 2007 short film parodying ''The Da Vinci Code''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Silas (as well as the ''Matrix Reloaded'' twins).  In the parody, Whylas has realistic vision problems that make him hilariously incompetent as an assassin, a job he doesn't want anyway, being just a regular guy.
* Setsuna Sakurazaki of the manga ''[[Negima!]]'' is stated to be an albino who regularly dyes her hair and wears contact lenses to hide her albinism. &lt;small&gt;''(See [[Setsuna Sakurazaki|main article]] for sources.)''&lt;/small&gt;
* Peter Smart in Adam Salter's 2007 novel ''The Platinum Prison'' ({{ISBN|978-1847534415}}) is an albinistic man, tortured by the label "albino", who "tries...to find his place in life and search[es] for acceptance and love" in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Salter 2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Platinum Prison |isbn=978-1-84753-441-5 |last=Salter |first=Adam |location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina]] |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu Ent]] |year=2007 |at=back cover blurb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Albino Pirate from [[Gideon Defoe]]'s ''[[The Pirates!]]'' series is a fan favorite character, noted for his kindness, youthful inexperience, and naivete. While his condition is occasionally exploited or misunderstood, he is always portrayed fairly, and his albinism is not the central focus of his character. (While his name, or lack thereof, seems to indicate otherwise, all the pirates are named for one noticeable feature, e.g. The Pirate With Gout or The Pirate With A Scarf.)
* [[List of Metal Gear characters|Strangelove]], an albino bisexual artificial intelligence developer from [[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]] series.
* The playable avatar from ''[[Fire Emblem Fates]]'' (named Corrin by default) has traits of [[albinism]], though this is only by default since this character can be customized.
* Sunny, the heroine of fantasy novel [[Akata Witch]] by [[Nnedi Okorafor]], is an American-born Nigerian girl with albinism who discovers her magical abilities and enters the world of the Leopard People.

* The ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' character Ajani Goldmane is an albino leonid (a race of fictional [[anthropomorphic]] [[lion]]s). Once saw as a bad omen from his own tribe for his condition, after the brother's death he became a "Planeswalker", a powerful being capable to travel to the other planes of the game's multiverse (a trait secluded to most of the other living beings).

====Comics====
* [[Albino (comics)|Albino]] is the alias of two Marvel Comics supervillains, Augusta Seger and Ulysses Counts. In Augusta Seger's backstory, he acquired the nickname "Albino" in school because of his pale skin, he grew up to become a criminal, and was recruited into the Power Men supervillain team and given a serum which allowed him to mimic others' superpowers. After Augusta was arrested, he accidentally transferred his powers to Ulysses Counts, his friend and old partner in crime, who gained the ability to phase through solid objects, used that power to escape from jail, and assumed the alias of Albino.

====Film====
* James, a character in ''[[Shortbus]]'', had a catchphrase, "I'm an albino!" that he used as a child star in a fictitious sitcom about a [[White people|white]] child growing up in a [[Black people|black]] family. In the film, he has grown up, and people use "I'm an albino!" as a greeting to him at parties. He and his partner also gleefully shout the phrase while having sex. At one party, a man with albinism comes up to James and talks to him, saying "I really am an albino" (although played by [[Reg Vermue]], who has normal pigment in real life).

====Music====
* "An albino" (along with "a [[mulatto]]") features prominently in the [[refrain|chorus]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana's]] hit song about teenage angst and high school factionalism, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".

====Television====
*''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' season 2, episode 1, titled "[[Albification]]", concerns "whitewashing" various unpleasant truths, and introduces L.O.A.N., a new (fictional) [[white supremacist]] organization, which strives to prevent the titular motorcycle club of the show from doing business with [[people of color]].

The book uses alleged firsthand accounts mailed to the authors to paint a picture of various locations in the U.S. (most notably [[Clifton, New Jersey]]) where aggregations of albinistic families were said to live in seclusion. The accounts tell tales of honking horns to try to bring the residents out of their houses, of gawkers being shot at by residents, and even of gangs of local albinistic [[vigilante]]s.

In some versions of the [[sewer alligator]] urban legends, the alligators supposedly became albinistic due to mutation (which is implausible due to the short time scale) and/or lack of exposure to sunlight (which erroneously conflates pallor due to lack of exposure to sunlight with albinism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.delorenzosdugout.com/urbanlegends.htm |work=New York Daily News Online |title=Tales From the Urban Crypt |access-date=8 January 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515224141/http://www.delorenzosdugout.com/urbanlegends.htm |archive-date=15 May 2008}}&lt;!--See if snopes.com has something on this; it would be a more reliable source, anyway.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television coverage of discrimination against albinism==
Due to a wave of [[persecution of people with albinism]] in some parts of [[Africa]] (especially [[Tanzania]] and neighboring countries) – including ritual murder and dismemberment for potions and good-luck charms – a number of [[documentary film]]s have been made about the problem. These include ''[[In My Genes]]'' ([[Kenya]], 2009), ''[[White and Black: Crimes of Color]]'' ([[Canada]]/Tanzania, 2010), and ''[[In the Shadow of the Sun (documentary)|In the Shadow of the Sun]]'' (Tanzania, 2013).  {{Crossref|(For more information, see {{section link|Persecution of people with albinism|Films highlighting persecution of albinism}}.)}}

Also released in 2013, [[White Shadow (film)|''White Shadow'']], an award-winning [[Germany|German]]–[[Italy|Italian]]–Tanzanian [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]], portrays the plight of albinistic Tanzanians and their efforts to avoid falling victim to witchdoctors' bounty hunters.

Outside the African context, the 2007 short film "Perception Is Not Reality: Portraying the REAL Truths About Albinism", dispelling Hollywood and urban-legend nonsense about the condition, was produced by Mashawna Thompson, editor of the ''Parent of a Child with Albinism'' blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perception Is Not Reality: Portraying the REAL Truths About Albinism |first=Mashawna |last=Thompson |date=1 August 2011 |orig-year=2007 |work=PerceptionIsNotReality.com |url=http://PerceptionIsNotReality.com |access-date=14 October 2015}} Originally released on the now-defunct OneTrueMedia.com platform.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome |work=Parent of a Child with Albinism |url= http://www.parentofachildwithalbinism.com/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150308090944/http://www.parentofachildwithalbinism.com/ |archive-date=8 March 2015 |access-date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new version, featuring over 40 different children with albinism, was released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perception is Not Reality |first=Mashawna |last=Thompson |date=31 May 2014 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHHz8IBAoW4 |website=YouTube |access-date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the aforementioned ''[[The Albino Code]]'' (2007) is to point out the absurdity of typical depictions of albinistic people in Western media.  In 2009, two [[African American]] albinistic [[fashion model]]s, [[Shaun Ross (model)|Shaun Ross]] and [[Diandra Forrest]], were the focus of an episode of the ''[[Tyra Banks Show]]'', and revealed the traumas they experienced growing up albinistic, before finding unexpected success in front of the camera.&lt;ref name="Tyra.com"&gt;{{cite web |date=2009 |title=Redefining Beauty: Shaun Ross |work=Tyra.com |url=http://www.tyra.com/view/story_06ABOUT_FACE |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091102091805/http://www.tyra.com/view/story_06ABOUT_FACE |archive-date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2015}} This short piece covers Banks's meeting Ross which led up to the episode. The site is now defunct, and no video is available from it (or even images), though the episode can be found on YouTube and similar sites. Exact airdate uncertain.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Anthony Rapp]] (of ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'') fronts a rock band called Albinokid, but is not albinistic, being a normally pigmented, blonde [[White people|Caucasian]].  Former Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]], known for his pale hair, has also been mistakenly called albino.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In general, platinum blonde ("towheaded") people with very pale skin can be mistaken for albinistic (and conversely, some forms of albinism can result in [[phenotypes]] so normal-looking that only genetic testing can reveal the albinistic genes).

Perhaps the most significant albino animal in history was [[Mocha Dick]], a [[sperm whale]] of the early 19th century that lived mostly near the island of [[Mocha (island)|Mocha]], off [[Chile]]'s southern Pacific coast, several decades before [[Herman Melville]] fictionalized him in the 1851 novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.  The real whale was renowned for being docile until attacked whereupon he became ferocious and capable of disabling smaller vessels. This made him widely feared among [[whaler]] crews, though also a target for adventurous captains, who engaged him in possibly as many as hundred or more sea battles before he was eventually killed.{{clear}}

'''Ambivalent prejudice''' is a [[Social psychology|social psychological]] theory that states that, when people become aware that they have conflicting beliefs about an [[ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] (a group of people that do not belong to an individual's own group), they experience an unpleasant mental feeling generally referred to as [[cognitive dissonance]]. These feelings are brought about because the individual on one hand believes in [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] virtues such as helping those in need, but on the other hand also believes in [[Individualism|individualistic]] virtues such as working hard to improve one's life.

Bernard Whitley and Mary Kite&lt;ref name="KiteMary"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kite |first1=Mary |last2=Whitley |first2=Bernard |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |location=Wadsworth |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2010}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contend that this dissonance motivates people to alter their thoughts in an attempt to reduce their discomfort. Depending on the situation or context that has primed them, people will give priority to either the positive beliefs or the negative beliefs, leading to a corresponding behavioral shift known as ''response amplification''.

==Theoretical framework==
According to [[Susan Fiske]], there are two underlying characteristics of [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] groups around the world:&lt;ref name = "Fiske2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fiske|first= Susan T.|date= January 2012|title= Managing Ambivalent Prejudices: Smart-but-Cold and Warm-but-Dumb Stereotypes|url= |journal= The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|publisher= |volume= 639|issue= 1|pages= 33–48|doi= 10.1177/0002716211418444|pmid= 24115779|pmc= 3792573}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the ideas that status predicts perceived competence and that cooperation predicts perceived warmth.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; Two combinations of competence and warmth produce ambivalent [[prejudice]]s. The combined perception of groups as warm but incompetent leads to pitied groups, such as traditional women or older people.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; The combined perception of groups as competent but cold leads to envied groups, such as nontraditional women or minority entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; Fiske uses this conception of prejudice to explain [[ambivalent sexism]], [[heterosexism]], [[racism]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] biases, [[ageism]], and [[classism]].&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt;

==Views==
According to Whitley and Kite, ambivalent prejudice comes from one person having both good and bad thoughts about an outgroup.&lt;ref name="KiteMary" /&gt; The example in their book ''The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination'' talks about [[race (human classification)|race]] and how some people often have ambivalent attitudes towards people of other races. This means that their behavior is also ambivalent: "sometimes it is positive, sometimes negative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kite |first1=Mary |last2=Whitley |first2=Bernard |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |location=Wadsworth |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2010 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irwin Katz said that ambivalent prejudice only occurs when the individual becomes aware of the conflicting attitudes, and, for most people, simply coming face-to-face with someone from the outgroup can cause this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=I |year=1981 |title=Stigma: A social psychological analysis |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Katz, this conflict of attitudes can cause problems with one's [[self-image]], because it seems as though one is not living up to all important values that one holds. This conflict can cause negative [[emotion]]s, which are expressed in negative behavior.

Irwin Katz and Glen Hass (1988) believed that contradicting American values are to blame for ambivalent prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.6.893 |title=Racial ambivalence and American value conflict: Correlational and priming studies of dual cognitive structures |year=December 1988 |last1=Katz |first1=Irwin |last2=Hass |first2=R. Glen |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=893–905}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first value is that hard work will always pay off and people get what they deserve, while the other is that all people are equal and that people should help the less fortunate. When this is applied to race, many people are torn. They see disadvantaged people of other races as not working hard enough to be worth as much as people of their own race, but they also understand that people of other race have a harder time financially and socially. These mixed emotions lead to ambivalence.

Tara MacDonald and Mark Zanna suggested that [[stereotype]]s were to blame for ambivalent prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167298244009 |title=Cross-Dimension Ambivalence toward Social Groups: Can Ambivalence Affect Intentions to Hire Feminists? |year=April 1998 |last1=MacDonald |first1=T. K. |last2=Zanna |first2=M. P. |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=427–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacDonald and Zanna, people can like others and respect others, the two emotions working independently of each other. When a person feels those things towards an entire group, it is because of stereotypes.  Therefore, a person can like and disrespect people of other races, due to certain stereotypes, or dislike but respect the same group of people for other stereotypes.

In a study testing the nature of ambivalent prejudice, Hisako Matsuo and Kevin McIntyre (2005)&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Matsuo |first1=Hisako |last2=McIntyre |first2=Kevin P.|date=August 12, 2005 |title=Ambivalent Prejudice toward Immigrants: The Role of Social Contact and Ethnic Origin |conference=Annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] |location=Marriott Hotel, [[Loews Philadelphia Hotel]], Philadelphia |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/2/0/1/1/pages20113/p20113-1.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied American attitudes toward [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant groups]]. He proposed that ambivalent prejudice stems from two views. There is the individualistic attitude that values the [[Protestant work ethic]], and this attitude is associated with more negative attitudes toward outgroups. The other view is an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] or humanitarian one, which is associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroups.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005/&gt;

==Measures==
Researchers use a variety of methods to measure ambivalent prejudice. The most widely used method is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) for sexism created by Glick and Fiske in 1996.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Boyle &amp; D. Saklofske (Eds.), ''Measures of Personality &amp; Social Psychological Constructs''. Elsevier/Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of all ingroup- outgroup relations, one group (men) has a much greater societal status. This is due to male ambivalence having three sources: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Social psychological measures of stereotyping and prejudice". In G. Boyle &amp; D. Saklofske (Eds.), ''Measures of Personality &amp; Social Psychological Constructs''. Elsevier/Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment measures an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism. The theory of ambivalent sexism postulates that male ambivalence has three sources: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality. Women who resist traditional gender roles are punished by hostile sexism which resembles old-fashioned sexism. The theory predicts resentment of nontraditional women along each dimension: dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt; Conversely, women who cooperate with traditional gender roles and relationships evoke benevolent sexism which comprises protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy. The ASI measures sexism along each of the six dimensions that compose hostile sexism and benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;

The ASI is a self-report measure composed of 22 items, 11 for each subscale: hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. The two subscales can be calculated separately, or they can be averaged together to get an overall measure of sexism.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt; The assessment consist of a series of statements with which respondents indicate their level of agreement on a 6-point Likert scale in which 0 = disagree strongly and 5 = agree strongly. Certain items are reversed coded so that agreement with the statement indicates lower levels of sexism and disagreement with the statement indicates higher levels of sexism. Example items from the ASI include:&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;

Below is a series of statements concerning men and women and their relationships in contemporary society that this study wrote for their subjects to evaluate.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;

Benevolent sexism subset:&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;
*People are often truly happy in life without being romantically involved with a member of the other sex.
*No matter how accomplished he is, a man is not truly complete as a person unless he has the love of a woman. 
*Men are complete without women.
*Every man ought to have a woman whom he adores. 
*Women should be cherished and protected by men.
*Women, as compared to men, tend to have a more refined sense of culture and good taste.
*Women, compared to men, tend to have superior moral sensibility.
*Many women have a quality of purity that few men possess.

Hostile sexism subset:&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;
*Women exaggerate problems they have at work. 
*Most women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist. 
*Women are too easily offended.
*Most women fail to appreciate fully all that men do for them.  
*Feminists are not seeking for women to have more power than men.
*There are actually very few women who get a kick out of teasing men by seeming sexually available and then refusing male advances.
Researchers use various other methods to measure different types of ambivalent prejudices. For example, the Modern Racism Scale measures aspects of ambivalent racism.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Sexism===
[[Ambivalent sexism]] reflects the duality of hostility towards women and the tendency for women to be rated more positively than men in surveys. Hostile sexism impacts nontraditional women who threaten male power, for example, female professionals and intellectuals, [[feminists]], and [[lesbians]]. Conversely, [[benevolent sexism]] protects women who adhere to traditional gender roles, such as housewives and secretaries. Fiske asserts that these two forms of sexism comprise ambivalence.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; On the one hand, women are viewed as competent but not warm, while on the other hand, they are viewed as warm but incompetent. In the workplace, nontraditional women tend to suffer from hostile sexism since they are viewed as competitors. As benevolent sexism includes perceived obligations of protection and help, it leads to women being viewed as less worthy of hiring, training, and promoting due to the concern of them being less able to effectively manage both personal and professional.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; Fiske contends that when addressing bias against women, both demeaning benevolence and dangerous hostility must be account for.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt;

===Racism===
Ambivalent racism depicts two contrasting reactions by [[whites]] toward [[black people|blacks]]. These competing evaluations include hostile (antiblack) sentiments and subjectively sympathetic but paternalistic (problack) sentiments.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; Problack attitudes attribute black disadvantage to larger social structures and factors including [[discrimination]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and lack of opportunities. In contrast, hostile antiblack racism, like old-fashioned racism asserts that "black people are unambitious, disorganized, free-riding, and do not value education."&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; Fiske states that "black [[Americans]] are viewed ambivalently mainly to the extent that white Americans simultaneously harbor a more subjectively positive and a more hostile attitude, which can flip from one polarity to the other, depending on individual differences in beliefs and on situational cues."&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt;

===Ableism===
Söder suggests that people do not have fixed cognitive assumptions or emotions about people with [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Soder1990&gt;{{cite journal |last= Söder|first= Mårten|date= 1990|title= Prejudice or Ambivalence? Attitudes Toward Persons with Disabilities|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02674649066780241|journal= Disability, Handicap &amp; Society|publisher= |volume= 5|issue= 3|pages= 227–241|doi= 10.1080/02674649066780241|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, people are ambivalent, so their behavior in any given situation will depend on the context. People have two contrasting ideas about people with disabilities; people devalue disabilities while maintaining a benevolent sympathy towards disabled people.&lt;ref name=Soder1990/&gt; This leads to a conflict between basic values held by wider society and moral dilemmas in concrete daily interactions with people with disabilities. Söder proposes an ambivalence model as a better method for evaluating interactions with and attitudes about disabled people as it better captures the totality of people's sentiments.&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005/&gt;

===Immigrants===
Matsuo and McIntyre applied the concept of ambivalent prejudice to [[immigrants]] and [[refugees]].&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005/&gt; They described attitudes toward immigrants and refugees as ambivalent since on the one hand they are perceived "sympathetically, as disadvantaged, and deserving of justice", but on the other hand, they are seen as "more likely to be involved in crime and a burden on the public system."&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005/&gt; Matsuo and McIntyre used a sample survey of college students to test egalitarianism and the [[Protestant work ethic]](PWE) and how it relates to perceptions of refugees.&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005/&gt; Participants completed survey questions regarding social contact, attitudes toward specific ethnic groups, general attitudes toward refugees, and the Humanitarianism/Protestant Work Ethic Scale. They found that the ambivalent attitudes toward refugees is based on the "dual maintenance of American values", egalitarianism and PWE. In testing the [[contact theory]], they found that only when contact is personal and cooperative does prejudice decrease.&lt;ref name=Matsuo2005/&gt;

==Response amplification==
In order to reduce the negative feelings brought about by cognitive dissonance, people may engage in response amplification.&lt;ref name="KiteMary" /&gt; Response amplification is defined by engaging in a more extreme response to a stigmatized individual in comparison to a similar but non-stigmatized individual than the situation calls for.&lt;ref name="KiteMary" /&gt;  This can include overdoing both positive responses and negative responses depending on whether the situation calls for a positive or negative response.&lt;ref name="KiteMary" /&gt;

For example, whites' evaluations of Blacks who are presented positively or negatively tend to be more extreme than evaluations of similar white individuals. Hass et al. (1991) had White students participate in an experiment where the student worked with either a white or black confederate to complete a task.&lt;ref name=Hass1991&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hass|first= R. Glen|last2= Katz|first2= Irwin|last3= Rizzo|first3= Nina|last4= Bailey|first4= Joan|last5= Eisenstadt|first5= Donna|date= February 1991|title= Cross-Racial Appraisal as Related to Attitude Ambivalence and Cognitive Complexity|url= |journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|publisher= |volume= 17|issue= 1|pages= 83–92|doi= 10.1177/0146167291171013|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confederate, instructed by the experimenter, caused either the failure or successful achievement of the task.&lt;ref name=Hass1991/&gt; After the task, the white students rated the confederate’s performance. Those who scored higher in ambivalence rated the black confederate more positively in the success condition but more negatively in the failure condition than the white confederate.&lt;ref name=Hass1991/&gt; David Bell and Victoria Esses (2002) conducted a study indicated that this response amplification only occurs when one believes that the ambivalent response is problematic.&lt;ref name=Bell2002&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bell|first= David W.|last2= Esses|first2= Victoria M.|date= August 2002|title= Ambivalence and Response Amplification: A Motivational Perspective|url= |journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|publisher= |volume= 28|issue= 8|pages= 1143–1152|doi= 10.1177/01461672022811012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ambivalent white Canadian students were given essays that emphasized the positivity or negativity of ambivalence (considering both the good and bad in a situation or person), only those in the negative condition engaged in response amplification.

In addition to racial contexts, response amplification has been found in multiple contexts including in cases of able bodied people interacting with disabled individuals, women and men rating members of the opposite sex, and ratings of female feminists.&lt;ref name="KiteMary" /&gt;

Leippe and Eisenstadt found that dissonance mediated changed may be more successful when an internal conflict already exists, that is, when individuals possess cognitive dissonance that can be a result of ambivalence.&lt;ref name=Leippe1994&gt;{{cite journal |last= Leippe|first= Michael R.|last2= Eisenstadt|first2= Donna|date= September 1994|title= Generalization of Dissonance Reduction: Decreasing Prejudice Through Induced Compliance|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 67|issue= 3|pages= 395–413|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.395|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three experiments, whites were encouraged to write essays regarding scholarship policies that would favor blacks. Writing the essay led to a more positive perception of the policy, as well as, in some cases, more positive attitudes towards blacks in general.&lt;ref name=Leippe1994/&gt; Ambivalent people were more likely to comply with writing a positive essay than non ambivalent people. As a result of writing the essay, participants felt cognitive dissonance which led them to engage in a sort of cognitive restructuring to further reduce the dissonance.&lt;ref name=Leippe1994/&gt; This meant engaging in more extended thinking that led to more positive beliefs about Blacks in general as well as about the specific policy. By inducing compliance in writing, they were able to induce a change in attitudes toward the target group.&lt;ref name=Leippe1994/&gt;

Fiske suggests several methods to mitigate ambivalent prejudice particularly in the context of business management.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; These methods mainly involve an increased awareness and recognition of the different types of prejudice.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; She states that not all prejudices are alike, but they do create predictable groups of stereotypes, emotional prejudices, and discriminatory tendencies. When working to counteract prejudice, the focus should be on the most stereotypically negative aspect for a group, for example, competence for older people.&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt; In addition, constructive contact, that involving cooperation and equal status in the setting, for example, between groups improves [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Fiske2012" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="918">'''Ars Apodemica''' is [[Guide book|travel advice literature]] which was significant in the period between the mid-16th and the late 18th century. 

[[Travelling]] was becoming more and more a widespread practice, so the need was felt of guidance for future travellers. Ars Apodemica writings gave also [[guideline]]s on how to systematise the knowledge acquired by travelling, in order to benefit the learned community (the Respublica Literarum). These writings (several hundred in number) can be read as [[milestone]]s in the formation of modern [[scientific method]]ology, but also as discourses on social practices of the period (e.g. the [[Grand Tour]]).

The '''Archives of Ontario''' ({{lang-fr|Archives publiques de l'Ontario}}) are the [[archives]] for the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]], Canada. Founded in 1903 as the '''Bureau of Archives''', the archives are now under the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (Ontario)|Ministry of Government and Consumer Services]]. The main offices of the archive are located at [[York University]] in Toronto.

==History==
[[File:Research tower and archives2.jpg|thumb|left|The York University Research Tower and Archives of Ontario building.]]

The Bureau of Archives, as it was originally known, was first located in the [[Ontario Legislative Building]]. The Archives moved to the [[Canadiana Building]] (14 Queen's Park Crescent West) on the [[University of Toronto]] campus in 1951, at which time it was known as the Department of Archives.  Relocated to 77 [[Grenville Street]] in 1972 its name was also changed to the Archives of Ontario.  The reading room at the Grenville building closed on March 26, 2009.

The official groundbreaking ceremony for the new Archives of Ontario building on the [[York University]] grounds, which also houses the York University Research Tower, was on April 30, 2007. The groundbreaking was attended by former Minister of Government Services [[Gerry Phillips]] and former York University President and Vice-Chancellor [[Lorna Marsden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.on.ca/MGS/en/News/131895.html "Construction begins on new home for the Archives of Ontario", ''Ministry of Government Services, Government of Ontario''] April 30, 2007. Accessed on 2008-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; The building was opened to the public on April 2, 2009 and is expected to be the site of the Archives for at least the next thirty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;https://plenarygroup.com/projects/north-america/archives-of-ontario&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the records of the Ontario government, the Archives also acquires records of private individuals and organizations that reflect Ontario's history. Notable private records include the [[fonds]] of [[Eaton's]], [[Conn Smythe]], and [[Moriyama and Teshima Architects]].

==List of Archivists of Ontario==
The head of the Archives has been known as the Archivist of Ontario since 1923, prior to that they were known as the Provincial Archivist.

'''Arthur Corbin Gould''' (1850&amp;ndash;1903) was an avid [[shooting|shooter]] and member of the [[Massachusetts Rifle Association]].  He published "The Rifle" [Riling 1160] in 1885. "The Rifle" was the forerunner to the official publication of the [[National Rifle Association]] "The Rifleman", later "American Rifleman". Mr. Gould later authored "The Modern American Pistol and Revolver, including a description of modern [[pistols]] and [[revolvers]] of American make; [[ammunition]] used in these arms; results accomplished; and shooting rules followed by [[United States|American]] marksmen" as well as "Modern American Rifles".  The former was the first English-language book devoted to pistol shooting.

[[File:Österreichisches Filmmuseum.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian Film Museum.]]
The '''Austrian Film Museum''' (German: Österreichisches Filmmuseum) is a [[film archive]] and [[museum]] located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It was founded by [[Peter Konlechner]] and [[Peter Kubelka]] in 1964 as a non-profit organization.

The collection comprises approximately 31,000 films from 1893 to the present and all genres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100618211034/http://www.yale.edu/slavic/resources/download/Dziga-Vertov-Short-Biography-MacKay-1.doc/en/collections/film_collection Film collection]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Founded in 1964 by Peter Konlechner and film artist Peter Kubelka, the Austrian Film Museum aimed to preserve films and present them to the public, affirming what they thought to be the two roles of film: "as the most important form of artistic expression in modernity and as the chief historiographical source of the 20th century."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmmuseum.at/jart/prj3/filmmuseum/main.jart?j-j-url=/en/about_us/history&amp;ss1=y|title=Filmmuseum - History|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort was financially supported through the Austrian government as well as the [[Vienna|City of Vienna]]. Private sponsors alongside the membership and admission fees have kept the establishment functioning. Within a year’s time of its inception, the Austrian Film Museum was inducted as a member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiafnet.org/pages/Divers/search.html|title=International Federation of Film Archives|website=www.fiafnet.org|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films preserved in the Austrian Film Museum were shown to the public in the museum’s own cinema, located in the Albertina building behind Vienna’s State Opera. In 1989, the “Invisible Cinema,” based on a concept of Peter Kubelka, allowed for viewers of films to be completely focused and concentrated on the viewing and listening of films. As of November 2002, the Austrian Film Museum has installed contemporary film and sound equipment to aid in the viewing of these historical films.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Leadership ==
From its inception, Konlechner and Kubleka remained as the co-directors until the end of 2001, when both retired. The role of director was then passed onto Alexander Horwarth. This job was then taken over by Michael Leobenstein on October 1, 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The board now consists of:

* Daniel Charim (Chairman)
* Boris Marte (Vice Chairman)
* Barbara Albert
* Peter Huemer
* Danny Krausz
* Peter Tscherkassky
* Peter Zawrel
* Peter Kubelka (Founding Member)

[[File:Barbara Hepworth Sculpture Garden, St Ives - geograph.org.uk - 11244.jpg|thumb|''[[Sphere with Inner Form]]'' at the Barbara Hepworth Museum, with [[Two Forms (Divided Circle)]] behind]]
The '''Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden''' in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], [[Cornwall]] preserves the 20th-century [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Barbara Hepworth]]'s studio and garden much as they were when she lived and worked there. She purchased the site in 1949 and lived and worked there for 26 years until her death in a fire on the premises in 1975.

==History==
[[File:Hepworth workshop.jpg|thumb|right|Hepworth's workshop left virtually untouched]]
The studio, known as Trewyn Studio, was purchased by [[Barbara Hepworth]] in 1949, and is typical of the stone-built houses in St Ives. Her living room is furnished as she left it, while the workshop remains full of her tools and equipment, materials, and part-worked pieces. The museum was opened by her family in 1976, after Barbara had left instructions to this effect in her will. It is the largest collection of her works that are on permanent display.&lt;ref name=StIves&gt;{{cite web |url=http://barbarahepworth.org.uk/st-ives/ |title=Barbara Hepworth: St Ives |publisher=Hepworth Estate |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptures featured at the museum (mainly in the secluded garden) were some of her favourites. Her workshop also includes a queue of uncut stones that one visitor has described as "still waiting for their moment in the shadow of her workshop". In 1950 she acquired two huge blocks of Galway limestone which she carved into her [[Festival of Britain]] commission, the [[Contrapuntal Forms]]. A set of photographs in the museum shows the progress of this project. Wood carving was done in an upstairs room, and the bronze statues she started casting in 1956 had their origins in the plaster prototypes she worked on in the upper of the two outside studios.&lt;ref name=StIves/&gt;

She was helped in the creation of the garden by her friend, the South African-born composer [[Priaulx Rainier]].

[[Barbara Hepworth]] died in a fire at this site in 1975, when she was aged 72.

The family passed the museum to the [[Tate]] gallery in 1980 and they still manage it.

[[Image:Coa coins.jpg|thumb|A certificate of authenticity with a coin set]]
A '''certificate of authenticity''' (COA) is a seal or small sticker on a proprietary [[computer program]], [[t-shirt]], [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]], or any other [[Souvenir|memorabilia]] or art work, especially in the world of [[computers]] and [[sports]], it is commonly a seal on paper authenticating a specific art work which and is made to demonstrate that the item is authentic. Computer COAs have a license number on them, which verifies that the program is a genuine, legal copy. Art work or posters come with a certificate of authenticity signed and sealed by a reputable appraiser or auction house.&lt;ref name = "MS-COA" &gt;{{cite web
| title = Certificate of Authenticity
| publisher = [[Microsoft]]
| url = https://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/licensing/antipiracy/Pages/COA_hologram.aspx
| access-date= 3 November 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COAs are mostly common in the art world. Generally speaking, a valid COA for an artwork will include specific details about the artwork like when and how it was produced, the names of people or companies involved in the artwork's production, the work's exact title, the dimensions of the art, and the names of reference books, magazines, or similar resources that contain either specific or related information about either that work of art or the artist. The COA should also state the qualifications and full contact information of the individual or entity that authored the certificate with his or her complete and current contact information. COAs have been a target of much controversy due to online auction sites where sellers are providing fake Certificates of Authenticity to market or sell their art works. The details below identify how to tell the difference and best practices for consumers to identify a real certificate from a fake.

COA's are commonly used on internet auction sites in order to provide "proof" that the signature on a signed item is genuine. However it is widely acknowledged that most of these COA's have simply been produced by fraudulent sellers in order to encourage the buyer to buy fake items. In almost all cases these COA's are worthless and have no traceability. It has been shown that around 90% of the COA's issued by these sellers do not even have the contact details of the person selling the item, or if they do they are often incorrect or have an address of a company that has long since disappeared.

Any COA is of no value at all unless it has the full contact details of the issuer. It is an offence under the Fraud Act 2006 (section 7) to create or use a COA in the sale of an autograph or similar item.  ''A person is guilty of an offence if he makes, adapts, supplies or offers to supply any article—
''(a)knowing that it is designed or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with fraud, or
(b)intending it to be used to commit, or assist in the commission of, fraud.''
''
In other words, if the seller is offering fakes with a COA, then he/she is committing more than one offence, and the offence of issuing a COA alone is a possible 12-month prison sentence.

{{original research|date=November 2011}}
'''Christian views on magic''' vary widely among [[Christian denomination|denominations]] and among individuals. Some [[Christian]]s actively condemn  any form of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] as [[Theistic Satanism|satanic]], holding that it opens the way for [[demonic possession]]. Others simply dismiss it as [[superstition]]. Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magical practices.

==Biblical references==
{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
There are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who "..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states "Do not allow a sorceress to live".

Some adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to "necromancer" and "[[necromancy]]" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the [[Tanakh]] comes from a root meaning "to whisper". Strong therefore concludes that the word means "to whisper a spell, ''i.e.'' to [[Incantation|incant]] or practice magic". The [[Contemporary English Version]] translates {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11|CEV}} as referring to "any kind of magic".

==Early Christianity==
{{See also|Early Christianity}}

The [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] includes sorcery in a list of "works of the flesh".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Galatians|5:19-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disapproval is echoed in the ''[[Didache]]'',&lt;ref name=Didache&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching of the twelve Apostles, tr. from the 'editio princeps' of Bryennios, by A. Gordon|year=1884|page=7|url=//books.google.com/books?id=Sp8CAAAAQAAJ|author=Apostles didachē|accessdate=20 October 2013|format=Original from Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; a very early book of church discipline which dates from the mid-late first century.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}): ''Didache''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval views==
{{See also|Witch trials in the Early Modern period}}
{{Expand section|Aquinas et al. on magic|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3096.htm --&gt;
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Christian Churches did not conduct witch trials.&lt;ref name=InnerDemons&gt;Cohn, Norman: "Europe's Inner Demons: The Demonization of Christians in Medieval Christendom." London: Sussex University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic [[Council of Paderborn]] in 785 explicitly outlawed the very belief in witches, and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] later confirmed the law. Among [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] concentrated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], belief in witchcraft was widely regarded as ''deisidaimonia''—[[superstition]]—and by the 9th and 10th centuries in the [[Western Christianity|Latin Christian West]], belief in witchcraft had begun to be seen as [[heresy]].

However, towards the end of the [[Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[early modern period]] (post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]), belief in witchcraft became more popular and witches were seen as directly in league with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]]. This marked the beginning of a period of [[witch hunt]]s among early [[Protestantism|Protestants]] which lasted about 200 years, and in some countries, particularly in North-Western Europe, thousands of people were accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}.

The [[Inquisition]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had conducted trials against supposed witches in the 13th century, but these trials were to punish [[heresy]], of which belief in witchcraft was merely one variety.&lt;ref name="InnerDemons"/&gt; Inquisitorial courts only became systematically involved in the witch-hunt during the 15th century: in the case of the [[Madonna Oriente]], the Inquisition of [[Milan]] was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 and in 1390 confessed to have participated in a type of [[white magic]].

Not all Inquisitorial courts acknowledged witchcraft. For example, in 1610 as the result of a witch hunting craze the Suprema (the ruling council of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) gave everybody an Edict of Grace (during which confessing witches were ''not'' to be punished) and put the only dissenting inquisitor, [[Alonso de Salazar Frías]], in charge of the subsequent investigation. The results of Salazar's investigation was that the Spanish Inquisition did not bother witches ever again though they still went after heretics and [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;1978 "A witch with three toes too many"; Out of this World Encyclopedia 23:9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Luther===
[[Martin Luther]] shared some of the views about witchcraft that were common in his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first1 = Susan C. | last1 = Karant-Nunn
 | first2 = Merry E. | last2=  Wiesner-Hanks
 | title = Luther on Women: A Sourcebook | location = Cambridge | publisher =  Cambridge U. Press | year = 2003 | pages = 228
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When interpreting Exodus 22:18,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible, King James, Exodus#Chapter 22|Exodus 22:18]]&lt;/ref&gt; he stated that, with the help of the devil, witches could steal milk merely by thinking of a cow.&lt;ref&gt;''Sermon on Exodus, 1526'', ''WA'' 16, 551 f.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]] he taught that witchcraft was a sin against the second commandment&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, [http://www.ProjectWittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/little.book/web/book-1.html#b &lt;cite&gt;Luther's Little Instruction Book&lt;/cite&gt;], Trans. Robert E. Smith, (Fort Wayne: Project Wittenberg, 2004), &lt;cite&gt;Small Catechism&lt;/cite&gt; 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and prescribed the Biblical penalty for it in a "table talk":

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 25 August 1538 there was much discussion about witches and sorceresses who poisoned chicken eggs in the nests, or poisoned milk and butter. Doctor Luther said: "One should show no mercy to these [women]; I would burn them myself, for we read in the Law that the priests were the ones to begin the stoning of criminals."&lt;ref&gt;''WA Tr'' 4:51–52, no. 3979 quoted and translated in Karant-Nunn, 236. The original Latin and German text is: "25, Augusti multa dicebant de veneficis et incantatricibus, quae ova ex gallinis et lac et butyrum furarentur. Respondit Lutherus: Cum illis nulla habenda est misericordia. Ich wolte sie selber verprennen, more legis, ubi sacerdotes reos lapidare incipiebant.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern views==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], belief in the powers of witches and sorcerers to harm began to die out in the West. But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological—that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].

It was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;Hayes, Stephen. 1995. Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery, in Missionalia, Vol. 23(3) November. Pages 339-354.  {{cite web |url=http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415185117/http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM |archivedate=2007-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was further complicated by the rise of [[new religious movements]] that considered witchcraft to be a religion. This view does not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not believed to exist in [[Wicca]] and other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of the Army, "Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains": "It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in "Satan", "the Devil", or any similar entities."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian opposition to witchcraft===
Several Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that "Warlocks are enemies of God" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''[[Jesus Camp]]''.

Among Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed "Transformations" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off "territorial spirits" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee, called upon God to protect Sarah Palin, as Muthee laid hands on Palin, from "every form of witchcraft".

In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.

===Magic in literature===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}
Magic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.

In literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Clarke. "Profiles of The Future", 1961 (Clarke's third law)&lt;/ref&gt; Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first chronological book of ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power available on other worlds, not on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately lead to the destruction of life there.

==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and witchcraft==
{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}
From 15th to 19th century, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santería]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity. There are also those who practice a combination of Neopagan/Wiccan and Christian beliefs. Other modern syncretic traditions include mesoamerican folk healing traditions, such as the ''curandisimo'' practices found in Mexico, and Andean folk healing traditions of Peru and Bolivia.

The '''''Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña''''' (or '''''Crónica pinatense''''') is an [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] [[chronicle]] written in [[Latin language|Latin]] around before 1359 in the monastery of [[San Juan de la Peña]] at the behest of [[Peter IV of Aragon]]. It was the first general history of Aragon and was probably designed both to justify the royal prerogatives of the [[Crown of Aragon]] against the baronage and to match the comparable [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] work of a century earlier, the ''[[Estoria de España]]''. Between 1369 and 1372, [[Navarro-Aragonese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] translations were produced.

The ''Chronicle'' is a compilation from various sources, some more historically solid than others. Though named after the monastery of San Juan, it was only partially compiled there. As early as 1345 Peter IV had asked the monasteries of San Juan and [[Ripoll]] to begin compiling material for a general history of the realm. Ripoll's only contribution was a version of the 1162 ''[[Gesta comitum Barchinonensium]]'' updated to 1310. Only those sections (approximate a third) dealing with events specific to the monastery were probably written in it. The monks of San Juan relied heavily for the history of Spain up to 1137 on ''De rebus Hispaniae'', the work of the Navarrese [[Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada]]. The materials compiled at Ripoll and San Juan were eventually sent to [[Barcelona]] to be worked together. A finished copy of the work was sent by the king to the [[Cathedral of Valencia]] in 1372 and this original still resides in the cathedral library.

A modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation by Antonio Ubieto Arteta appeared in 1964, an [[English language|English]] translation by Lynn H. Nelson in 1991.

Technical variations of [[Linux distribution]]s include support for different hardware devices and systems or software package configurations. Organizational differences may be motivated by historical reasons. Other criteria include security, including how quickly security upgrades are available; ease of [[package management]]; and number of packages available.

These tables compare each active and noteworthy distribution's latest stable release on wide-ranging objective criteria. It does not cover each operating system's [[operating system advocacy|subjective merits]], branches marked as unstable or beta, nor compare Linux distributions with other operating systems.

== General ==
&lt;!-- Keep improper and unabbreviated words lower case. Keep dates in YYYY format.

== Technical ==
The table below shows the default file system, but many Linux distributions support some or all of [[ext2]], [[ext3]], [[ext4]], [[Btrfs]], [[ReiserFS]], [[Reiser4]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], [[XFS]], [[GFS2]], [[OCFS2]], and [[NILFS]]. It is possible to install Linux onto most of these file systems. The ext file systems, namely ext2, ext3, and ext4 are based on the original Linux file system.

File systems have been developed by companies to meet their specific needs, by hobbyists, or adapted from [[Unix]], Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems. Linux has full support for XFS and JFS, [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] (the [[DOS]] file system), and [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]], the main file system for the [[Macintosh]]. Support for Microsoft [[Windows NT]]'s [[NTFS]] file system has been developed and is now comparable with other native Unix file systems. CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs' [[ISO 9660]] and [[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF) are supported.

Unlike other operating systems, Linux and Unix allow any file system regardless of the medium it is stored on, whether that medium is a magnetic disk, an optical disk (CD, DVD, etc.), a USB flash memory key, or even contained within a file located on another file system. Similarly, many C compilers (mainly [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC)), init systems (mainly [[sysvinit]]), desktop environments and window managers are widely supported.

==Package management and installation==
Information on features in the distributions. Package numbers are only approximate. Some distributions like Debian tend to separate tools into different packages - usually stable release, development release, documentation and debug. Also counting the source package number varies. For debian and rpm based entries it is just the base to produce binary packages, so the total number of packages is the number of binary packages. For arch based entries, it is additional. E.g. Arch Linux provides 11'000 + 47'000 packages, i.e. 58'000 packages.
&lt;!-- In each table, link one instance of terms, remove other WP:REPEATLINK(s). --&gt;

The ''Coping With'' series of books is a series of books aimed at 11- to 16-year-olds, written by [[Peter Corey]] and published by [[Scholastic Hippo]]. The first book, ''Coping with Parents'', was released in 1989, and the series continued until 2000, with the last book being ''Coping with Cash''. The books take a humorous look at issues which affect teenagers and how to cope with these issues. The books are all generally built using the same basic structure:

* The first chapter is generally addressed to the reader ''before'' buying the book and persuading them to buy it.
* The author then introduces the (fictional) team of researchers who helped him write the book. Usually, the team includes '[[Elderado Dingbatti]]', an escaped lunatic who frequently falls in love with pieces of furniture and confuses himself with [[Eldorado (soap opera)|Eldorado]], the unsuccessful soap opera.
* Then follows a humorous description of how the subject of the book (such as education or currency) has developed through the ages.
* After this follows the A-Z section, which usually takes up most of the book. This section contains various elements related to the book's subject, arranged alphabetically. Every letter is used, which results in 'cheat' subjects only tenuously linked to the book itself e.g. "''[[Zoological]] Friend (pet)''" or "''Xams (Exams): If your spelling is this bad, maybe higher education isn't for you!''".
* Finally, the book ends with appendices and an afterword from the author.

The titles in the series, in order, are:

== The Television Show ==

The books success led to, in 1994, a one-off television special on [[Channel 4]] called ''Coping with Grown-ups'', shown as part of Channel 4's ''Look Who's Talking'' strand, featuring shows made by children. This was followed by ''Coping With Christmas'' in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1996/childrens/childrens-drama|publisher=[[BAFTA]]|access-date=2016-01-03|title=Children's Drama in 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 6-part series across the 1997-1998 new year: ''Holidays'', ''School'', ''Cool'', ''Relatives'', ''Girls'', ''Boys''. These won multiple awards, including a [[BAFTA]].

[[English law|In England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;Within the UK, [[Scots law|Scotland has a different legal system]] to England and Wales.&lt;/ref&gt; '''County Court judgments''' (CCJs) are legal decisions handed down by the [[County Court (England and Wales)|County Court]].&lt;ref name=govuk&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt gov.uk Web site: County court judgments for debt, Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Judgments for monetary sums are entered on the statutory [[Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines]],&lt;ref name=register&gt;[http://www.trustonline.org.uk/ Web site of Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines]&lt;/ref&gt; which is checked by credit reference agencies to assess the credit-worthiness of individuals.

An alleged debtor is sent postal notification of an impending County Court case, and has fourteen days to respond, by paying the money, admitting owing a smaller sum, denying owing it, or going to a court hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/respond-to-court-claim-for-money gov.uk Web site: Respond to a court claim for money]&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no response judgement will be granted against the debtor.

If the debtor does not make payment in response to a CCJ, the creditor may apply for a charging order, which would secure the debt on a property. Creditors can also apply for an attachment of earnings which would oblige the debtor's employer to deduct monies from their salary and send them to the court. A third-party debt order would oblige a third party who holds money belonging to the debtor (for example a bank) to pay the debt. It is also possible to have the court appoint a [[County Court bailiff]] to collect the debt. A bailiff is an official of the court who has some powers to seize goods and sell them at auction to settle a debt.

Once a CCJ has been entered, if not paid in full within thirty days it is kept on record for six years by the register and [[Credit bureau|credit reference agencies]] (CRAs); there is no way to expunge the record of a correctly granted CCJ, although later payment will be recorded. The record is removed after six years. The [[Office of Fair Trading]] warned about credit repair companies that offer, for a fee, quick-fix schemes purported to remove a file from the CCJ register.&lt;ref name=blaug/&gt; In some cases a CCJ is made against someone who did not receive the notification of the court case, often due to it being sent to an incorrect or former address, and is not aware of the judgement; this may lead to unexpected refusal of credit. Checking of the Register or CRA records will find such cases.

The records can be checked by anybody on payment of a small fee.&lt;ref name=register/&gt; When a person applies for credit or finance, potential creditors normally check CRA records, refusing applicants considered to have a bad [[credit history]]; a CCJ on record makes it much more difficult to obtain finance through the normal channels. Some lenders will lend to people with CCJs against them, but usually on unfavourable terms, e.g. through a very expensive [[payday loan]].

If regular payments to the court are being made this is recorded on the credit file in addition to the record of the CCJ, and goes some way to lessen the negative credit rating impact. Once the full amount owed is repaid the CCJ is marked as 'satisfied', but remains on file. The record of a CCJ which is satisfied within one month can be removed altogether on application to the Register (and hence the CRAs).&lt;ref name=blaug&gt;[http://www.youblawg.com/debt-recovery/ccjs-explained-how-to-avoid-years-of-inconvenience CCJ's explained: How to avoid years of inconvenience]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art''''' was a single-volume reference work published in the mid-19th century by [[Longman|Longman's]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and by [[Harper Bros.]] in the United States. At the time it was considered a highly successful compendium of general but scholarly information.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, S. Padraig, 1922- ''Anglo-American general encyclopedias: a historical bibliography, 1703-1967'' New York : Bowker, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a trend toward cheaper, smaller reference works targeted at the middle and working classes.

The first edition was published in 1842 with 1352 pages. It was reprinted in 1845, 1847, 1848 and 1851. A second, revised edition was published in 1852 in 1423 pages. It was expand to three volumes in 1866. The final edition was published in 1875 in three volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

The original editor in chief [[William Thomas Brande]] and associate editor was [[Joseph Cauvin]]. Upon Brandes death in 1866, Sir [[George William Cox]] took over as editor.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first ed. was reprinted by [[Harper (publisher)|Harpers]] in the US in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Harper's Book of Facts'' ==

Harper's later published a successor called ''[[Harper's book of facts]]'' in 1895 with an updated edition in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Coyote''' (the [[Coyote]])&lt;ref&gt;"el" is Spanish for "the" (in Italy and Brazil "o"), the German and Scandinavian novels mostly were published without prefix&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a fictional character very similar to [[Zorro]] (El Zorro), [[Fox|the Fox]], although acting several years later (when California had transformed to be a part of the United States' [[Timeline of the American Old West|"Wild West"]]). He first appeared in a Spanish ''[[:es:Novela del oeste|Novelas del Oeste]]'' ("Stories of the West") Number 9 [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] novel in 1943, written by Carter Mulford,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinterest.se/pin/477663104206002738/ ''El Coyote'' in Novelas del Oeste] at pinterest.se, with images of lots of Mallorquĭ novels (including his pseudonyms) by different publishers (note the "Batlle" signature for Batet)&lt;/ref&gt; one of several pseudonyms of the successful Spanish author [[:es:J. Mallorquí|José Mallorquí y Figuerola]] (1913-1972) from [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;from p.239, López, Enrique Ávila ''MODERN SPAIN - Understanding modern nations'', ABC-CLIO, USA Dec 2015, 978-1-61069-600-5:&lt;br&gt;  
"José Mallorquí Figuerola (1913-1972) was the best selling writer of Spain's 20th century. Although relatively unknown among Spanish academia, Mallorquí  was the pioneer of Spanish pulp fiction. He started as a translator of Agatha Christie and Earl Derr Bigger's works for Molino Publisher. Mallorquí also created a series of novels inspired by the Wild West, including ''[[Tres hombres buenos]]'', ''Jibaro'', and ''Miss Moniker''. He brought to Spain the American pulp magazine "Weird Tales" and was a pioneer on radio shows with series such as ''Los Bustamante'', ''Dos Hombres Buenos'', and ''El Coyote''. The latter derived from his short novel ''El Coyote'' (1943) written under the pseudonym Carter Mulford. The figure of El Coyote would become the main character of more than 190 novels and (ed: as much) comics, and several movie adaptions. Mallorquí was a great aficionado of North American history as well as the role of Spain in the conquest of America. Like many great storytellers of his caliber, Mallorquí put emphasis on the adventure, making his writing educational while also entertaining."&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was issued by the Spanish publishing house [[:es:Editorial Molino|Editorial Molino]]. Mallorquí now started writing a series of extremely popular novels, with the character ''[[:es:El Coyote|"El Coyote"]]'' in the head role, for [[:es:Ediciones Cliper|Ediciones Cliper]].

==The Hero and the Novels==
'''[[California]]''' was incorporated into the US in 1848 as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] 1846–1848 (after some turbulent years as part of Mexico and even twice as a short-lived independent republic), and registered as the 31st State of the United States in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;The very first capital of California was [[Monterey]], in the old [[Alta California]] under Spain and Mexico. Soon after the U.S. take-over, [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] was chosen, later [[Vallejo, California | Vallejo]] was a short-lived capital – and in 1854 [[Sacramento]] became the capital. Mallorquí spelt it Monterrey (as the city in Mexico). [[Baja California]] is the northern part of Mexico's [[Baja California Peninsula]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''César de Echagüe''' (the III – with Mexican and Spanish roots) was a wealthy, elegant [[Californio]] nobleman, resident at the large 40.000 hectare (100.000 acres) [[Ranchos of California|ranch]], Rancho San Antonio,&lt;ref&gt;Fictive – not the [[San Antonio Valley]] outside San Francisco, but inspired from the [[San Antonio Heights]] in the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] two [[San Bernardino County, California|counties]]&lt;/ref&gt; just north-east of [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelascoyote.blogspot.se/search/label/001%20-%20El%20Coyote Los Angeles population] and synopsis of the original "El Coyote" novel; L.A. population '''1830''': 770, '''1850''': 1.610, '''1870''': 5.730&lt;/ref&gt; He had an affable, charming appearance – lazy, comfortable, cynical and sceptic, and with false [[superficiality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelascoyote.blogspot.se/p/personajes.html "El Coyote" Personajes] J.

'''The stories''' continued the mythical traditions of [[Robin Hood]], [[Dick Turpin]], and [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]] – published in 1905, which was the very first popular novel with the "double identity" plot. [[Dime novel]] detective [[Nick Carter (literary character) | Nick Carter]] debuted in 1886. [[Tarzan]] was introduced in 1912, and [[Zorro]] found its way to the public in 1919, but El Coyote became even bigger – in Spain. Among other early famous, often masked American novel and/or radio heroes were [[The Shadow]], debuting 1930 (and 1931), plus [[The Phantom Detective]], [[Doc Savage]], [[The Spider]] and [[Lone Ranger]] in 1933, and [[Green Hornet]] in 1936. Some of the very early comic strip [[List of superhero debuts | superheroes]] were [[Buck Rogers]] introduced in 1928, [[Dick Tracy]] 1931, and [[Flash Gordon]] in 1934. The most famous comic book (or strip) hero is [[Superman]] originated in 1933 (and commercially published in 1938). In 1934 [[Mandrake the Magician|Mandrake]] debuted, and in 1936 [[Phantom (comics)|the Phantom comic strip]] ([[The Phantom]]). [[Batman]] and the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] entered in 1939. [[Captain America]] and the originals of  [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], [[Green Lantern]] and [[Daredevil (Lev Gleason Publications)|Daredevil]] made their debuts in 1940.

===Coyote's appearance===
'''Coyote''' wore a black (mostly illustrated as dark blue, also in the comics – and sometimes brown) Mexican, decorated [[charro]] costume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/cultura/libros/2016-04-09/luis-alberto-de-cuenca-el-coyote-78626/ Louis Alberto on Coyote] with several clips of the 1998 Mario Camus and César Mallorquí (son of José) movie "La vuelta del Coyote" and links to two earlier films, "El Coyote" and "El vengador de California"&lt;/ref&gt;  He had high black boots (mostly outside the trousers) and a decorated sombrero, a black shirt – neither blue nor red – although most drawings show a white shirt (on the Scandinan covers blue), with a black (sometimes shown as red or blue) silk scarf or a red tie. He also had a broad black silk belt (sometimes illustrated as a red silk one – although mostly as an American brown belt), plus two holstered revolvers hanging low on a "double" ammunition belt. Some illustrations show only one revolver with ammunition belt and holster – others two revolvers on one holster. He also had a knife – and a rifle, a lasso and a Mexican [[serape|sarape]] on his horse – and he wore gloves. The mask covered more of his upper face than shown on most of the fine drawings by Francisco Batet (and especially by several others). The Scandinavian covers presented a relatively large mask (illustrated by [[Harald Damsleth]]). In at least one of the early pulps Mallorquí wrote he wore "Mexican peasant clothes" (black – shown brown on some early illustrations).&lt;ref&gt;Some of the very early novels (and the first drawings by Batet)&lt;/ref&gt; Coyote had two "marks" – one was shooting at an ear lobe of his villains, one was a drawing of a wolf's head on messages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/98343820@N03/albums/with/72157642272832383 Novelas Coyote – Ed.

===The original Spanish novels===
'''The novel series''' mostly comprised the years from December 1851 (and with Cliper number 6 from early 1865) to around 1875. Published in Spain, they originally consisted of 120 volumes 1944–1951 – the last titled ''Alias el Coyote'' in March 1951. The novels were not always strictly chronological.&lt;ref&gt;Coyote expert Ramón Charlo tried to sort the novels chronological in one of his books on Mallorquí (on Planeta deAgostini) and Coyote (three on Padilla – characters, places, and facts) [http://www.fantascienza.net/vegetti/Coyote/Rifer.htm – reference books of 2000–2005]&lt;/ref&gt; One example was the 1850/1852 (extended, 6 pesetas) story ''[[Joaquin Murrieta|El diablo, Murrieta]] y el Coyote'',&lt;ref&gt;Cliper number 100 ''El diablo, Murrieta y el Coyote'' (diablo is not the later "El Diablo" – diablo here is Murrieta)&lt;/ref&gt; Cliper novel number 100. The original novel number 115, ''El hogar de los valientes'', and its sequel, takes us back to around 1855, before Jr. was born. There was also the very late ''La gloria de don Goyo'' (which told a story of April 1865 – late civil war era soon after César's "second arrival" in Los Angeles, where the [[Bella Union Hotel|Bella Union]] and [[Fort Moore]] were two frequently featured establishments in the novels). A late original Cliper novel, the six-year-celebration novel ''La casa de los Valdez'' and its sequel, told a story César picked up in Spain in 1857 about César I (his grandfather arriving in California in 1767 – the story begins and ends in 1872 at home at the San Antonio ranch). Simultaneously published were 10 Numero Extra (1945–1946), including a reedited version of the original 1943 pulp ''El Coyote'' (issued as Edicion Cliper Extra #0 in 1945) and the Especial of 1946 noted below (no numbering at all). The Extras told stories of pre-1851, early  (and also late) 1850s and mid/late 1860s. Later came 62 "reformed" Nuevo Coyote (still on Cliper 1951–1953)&lt;ref&gt;Nuevo Coyote #35 ''El Hombre Tras La Máscara'', a late novel featuring César, Guadalupe, Bienvenido (who had taken over Alberes' role at the San Antonio ranch, where the hosts held weekly poker playing events), César Jr, Leonorin, Anita, Yesares, Mateos, los Lugones and Adelia (mid 1870s), where César is accused having had love affairs, not only with Ginevra St. Clair, but also with Princess Irina, Analupe de Monreal, and Thalia Coppard (from an earlier Nuevo Coyote, ''El hijo de Thalia Coppard''), and finds César Jr getting very upset about it&lt;/ref&gt; – the first published in mid 1951 (''Vuelve el Coyote'') and telling later, new stories – some intervening in the old chronology (some relating to 1872) – and with a pocket size, turning from 19,7x14,7&amp;nbsp;cm and 64 pages to 15,5x10,7&amp;nbsp;cm and 128 pages.&lt;ref&gt;The first 130 novels had the text in two columns – the Nuevo Coyotes in one (with issue numbers 51 and 52 lacking the "Nuevo stamp")&lt;/ref&gt; The last Nuevo Coyote was titled ''Los asesinos llegan a Monterrey'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/313385465/Jose-Mallorqui-El-Coyote-192-Los-Asesinos-Llegan-a-Monterrey ''Los asesinos llegan a Monterrey''] text&lt;/ref&gt; aka El Coyote ''Los asesinos van a Monterrey''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todocoleccion.net/comics-pulp/el-coyote-nuevo-asesinos-llegan-monterrey-por-jose-mallorqui~x38378409 ''Los asesinos van a Monterrey''] cover and inside&lt;/ref&gt;

===International publishing===
'''The early "Coyote" novels''' were published in 16 countries in nine different languages.&lt;ref&gt;After the first issues in Spain from 1944 followed Italy (1947), Argentina (1948), Austria and Germany (1949),  England (1951, only o total of 11 novels were published), France (14 issues on Librairie Moderne) and Norway (1952), Denmark (probably around 1953), Finland (1953), Sweden (1954), Brazil (1956), and Portugal (1968, ten issues) – plus Mexico (Ediciones Cliper), Belgium (Librairie Moderne) and Switzerland (German publisher). [http://www.fantascienza.net/vegetti/Coyote/AltreLingue.htm Coyote international publishers]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy published all 192, often with the same covers as Cliper and with the later ones (with non-Cliper covers) illustrated by Emilio Uberti (and especially Sergio Tarquinio inside).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantascienza.net/vegetti/Coyote/index.htm "Catalogo El Coyote"] by Ernesto Vegetti at fantascienza.net with 13 different countries' editions presented and [http://www.fantascienza.net/vegetti/Coyote/Cron1.htm the international publications]. Actually only 47 of the 51 Swedish flagged novels were issued (so the flags at ''La hacienda tragica'', ''La ley de los Vigilantes'', ''Al servicio del Coyote'', and ''De tal palo...'' should not be there)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany published 84 novels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodoldwest.ch/main/romane/romanhefte/coyote/coyote.html The original first 74 German Coyote pulps] (out of 84) at "Good Old West"&lt;/ref&gt; mostly with Batet's original Cliper illustrations – plus reeditions (different publishers) with new illustrators.

The illustrations on the Scandinavian editions, by [[Harald Damsleth]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dast.nu/artikel/big-jim-bill-ben-cactus-jim-och-coyote-om-flytande-granser-mellan-namn-pa-hjaltar-bokserier-och-bocker Harald Damsleth] at www.dast.nu&lt;/ref&gt; are by many ranked as the finest. Only one of the Cliper cover illustrations was "recycled" in Scandinavia – the original Cliper cover of ''Huracán sobre Monterrey'' was "covered" by Damsleth in the Swedish (and Norwegian) versions of ''Plomo en una estrella'', which actually was a circa 1874 story, featuring the father and his grown-up son in [[San Lorenzo Valley]] (fictional Farish City), not fitting chronologically with the other later Swedish novels. Brazil, often Batet and Bernal covers (but also several others),&lt;ref&gt;[http://gibiraro.com.br/persona.asp?id=457 Novels of Brazil] at Gibi Raro&lt;/ref&gt; published all novels in different editions, except for the high-ranked (extended, 6 pesetas) Extra-Especial on the elder ''Don César de Echagüe''.&lt;ref&gt;Italy, Austria, Finland (and possibly Mexico) were the only countries outside Spain, who published this unique extra novel (fantascienza.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Although''' the Extras, numbered 0-8, and the Extra-Especial (no number at all – 6 pesetas) on Ediciones Cliper – all issued during the very first years (1945–46) – did not have any of the other first 120 novels' issue numbers, they have later "entered" the 192 numbering – just like the "Nuevo Coyote" series (which was originally numbered 1-62 on Cliper).&lt;ref&gt;The order of the Extras' original publishings (in comparison to the regular issues) are approximative (with differing information given in later presentations).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main Plot and Characters ==

'''César was born''' in [[Los Angeles]] (originally called [[Pueblo de Los Ángeles|"el Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles"]]), which he left around late 1843 for Mexico and later Havana (Cuba) to study and "become a man". He "officially" returned in December 1851, described in the very first novel, ''El Coyote'', although operating as El Coyote in California several times before that, secretly leaving Mexico during his years abroad.

===César de Echagüe alias "El Coyote"===
'''In Mallorquí's first novel''', ''El Coyote'', one can trace that César must have been born around 1827 (the novel says he was 25 by his arrival in Los Angeles in late 1851, probably via [[Los Angeles River | el Rio Porciuncúla]].&lt;ref&gt;No absolute year of birth is given in the novels, although different, conflicting, ages are mentioned several times throughout the stories (in ''El otro "Coyote"'', an around 30 year old César is mentioned, and that story takes place in early 1865). Mallorquǐ deliberately may have made Coyote a bit younger after 1865&lt;/ref&gt; One can read about Coyote's debut in ''La primera aventura del Coyote''.&lt;ref&gt;In the novel César looks back 23 years from around 1869/1870. The date of the early happenings in the story is somewhat conflicting - it tells a story of 1846 and January 1847 (when California/Mexico was at war with the United States). Other novels tells us César was in Mexico or Cuba in 1846, leaving the San Antonio ranch in around 1843 (so it looks like one of César’s  secret visits to California, even though the novel says he was at home here)&lt;/ref&gt; an early Extra novel,&lt;ref&gt;The ten Extras of the Novelas Coyote - Edition Cliper (1945-1946)&lt;/ref&gt; where César was inspired by a masked female actress and by the Zorro legend when he started operating as El Coyote.&lt;ref&gt;In the very early novel ''Huracán sobre Monterrey'' (a story of around 1855 - and in the first ''El Coyote'') Mallorquí writes César "officially" was abroad for eight years up to December 1851, meaning he left his family around 1843 (maybe yet another try by Mallorquí to make Coyote a bit younger after the first novels)&lt;/ref&gt; Coyote later told his son, "El Cuervo", in the stories on César Jr's adventures of late 1972 (when Jr was around 17 years old), that "El Coyote" debuted even younger than  his son, long before aged 20.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics: 1827 plus 16 equals 1843 (and 1831 plus 16 equals 1847). His second absence, from 1857, also lasted for almost exactly eight years&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coyote's original family===
'''Coyote's father''', who had experienced the turbulent years of Spanish and Mexican California, was Don César de Echagüe (II), who found out Coyote's true identity just prior to his death soon after César's first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;in the Extra-Especial Cliper novel&lt;/ref&gt; César's sister Beatriz (aka Beatrice) was born in 1833 - she married [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] resident, political employee and member of the U.S. government, Edmond Greene (aka Edmonds or Edmons, nicknamed Edmondo), who spoke fluent Spanish. Edmond found out Coyote's true identity in late 1851 - and Beatriz probably a bit later. They settled in Washington in 1853 (although later often visiting California).&lt;ref&gt;Several novels in the series feature César, and later also Guadalupe, visiting Washington, and meeting [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant (1869-77)]] - the first time already in 1869&lt;/ref&gt; César's first wife Leonor de Acevedo (aka Leonora/Leonore) was born around 1830 (on yet another big ranch nearby San Antonio - and was betrothed to César already as a child). She became aware of Coyote's double identity by the end of the very first written novel. They married in 1852 during an almost two years period of Coyote retirement. She died around 1856, when César Jr was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjfarmer.com/secret/contributors/wallace.htm Roberto Barreiro on César Jr] in later years, and his connections to [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]], where Barreiro states the birth of César Jr to 1855 - and refers to a story of César Jr after 1887. Jr marries Wallace (unknown first name) and they go to Spain for a honeymoon, where a son James is born, who becomes Jim Wallace ("subbing" for Nick Carter in Spanish Molino pulps). He also states that El Coyote more or less retired for good in around 1875 to concentrate on his ranch together with Jr&lt;/ref&gt; Jr called himself El Cuervo (no mask), the [[Common raven|Raven]], from around late 1872 - although he later abandoned it. César (Coyote) left Los Angeles again directly after his wife's death (even travelling to Europe and Spain) for several years (handing over the child-care to maiden Guadalupe Martinez).

===Coyote's second wife===
'''César was abroad''' again (Europe this time) during 1857-early 1865. Long before his official return in the spring of 1865 César secretly worked as Coyote, and outside California as unmasked José Martinez, after only a few years abroad - one adventure was specifically dated 1859, ''La sombra del Coyote'' (with a preface of 1849). At least for a while during the [[American Civil War|civil war]] (1861–65) César secretly worked as a neutral Union (northern) Commander at a [[San Carlos, San Diego|San Carlos]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] fortress under the alias of "Delharty" (shortly before his second return to L.A. in early 1865 - encouraged by Edmond Greene to return home), working to keep [[California in the American Civil War|California out of the war]], helping both northernness and southernness in ''El Capataz del Ocaso'' and its sequels (where César looks back from the mid 1870s to the last year of the war). César Jr was reported eight years of age in 1865. Guadalupe was nicknamed Lupe/Lupita (aka Guadelupe).&lt;ref&gt;The Swedish Coyote novels and its original Spanish editions&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Julian (aka Julián) Martinez, Coyote's very first close allied (from 1851) and chief servant (and foreman) at César's father Don César's ranch. Julian died just prior to Guadalupe's marriage. Lupe was born in 1835 and married César around late 1870 - in ''El Diablo en Los Angeles''. She and Julian had known of César's double identity from very early on - Julian was told by Coyote (probably even before 1851 - and Lupe found out by "accidental coincidence" in 1853 - ''La vuelta del "Coyote"''). César's and Lupe's child Leonorin was born in 1871 - and fosterchild Eduardito (Gómez de la Mata) that same year (in ''Rapto''). Guadalupe later became de Torres (Julian's real name) and suddenly - in early/mid 1872 (''El código del Coyote'' and its sequels) - was even much richer than César, inheriting a huge ranch (Rancho del Todo) in [[Coahuila]] in north Mexico, where she had to spend several months each year with her daughter (the formal heiress) to claim her rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todocoleccion.net/libros/el-coyote-personajes-por-ramon-charlo-29x21-206-paginas~x45920874 Ramón Charlo] El Coyote - Los Personajes, Padilla Libros, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1874 she gave birth to a son (''Apostando su vida'', original novel N° 87).

===Coyote's allies===

'''Coyote''' had some interesting early allies (friends). Among the first (besides Julian) were the Lugones brothers - los Lugones - Juan, Timoteo, Evilio, and Leocadio (originally four, but Leo died early) and the old Indian woman Adelia (aka Adela). They helped Coyote from the very first beginning through all the years, and did not know about Coyote's real identity. Two other characters, though, knew - Ricardo Yesares and Matias Alberes. Yesares (from [[Paso Robles]] in [[San Luis Obispo]]), Coyote's sub/double throughout the years from 1865 (who Coyote had saved from "unfair" hanging that year) debuted in ''El otro "Coyote"'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/205700429/Mallorqui-Jose-El-Coyote-007-El-otro-Coyote ''El otro Coyote''] E-book replica preview at de.scribd.com - the novel of César's return to L.A. in 1865 (with several more preview replicas to find)&lt;/ref&gt; ediciones Cliper number 6 - the first adventure of Coyote's "second arrival". Ricardo was born around 1839/40, and married Serena Morales in Los Angeles in 1866, where he had become the owner of [[Charles III of Spain|Posada (hotel) del Rey Don Carlos III]] (Coyote's new and  "secret headquarters").&lt;ref&gt;with secret passage from Yesares' office to at least one of the guest rooms (to which Yesares directed the villains staying in the hotel)&lt;/ref&gt; Coyote's closest allied from 1865 was César's servant (and "bodyguard"), the dumb Indian Matias Alberes (who even sometimes acted as a third Coyote, and was a Coyote allied at least up to around 1874 - he even was featured with Pedro Bienvenido in ''Los apuros de don César'' and later novels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantascienza.net/vegetti/Coyote/Pers.htm Characters in early Coyote pulps] with illustrations of several characters (as presented in different editions of the novels)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gunman Mario Lujan (who initially was an enemy of Coyote in ''Al servicio del Coyote'') helped him several times in later novels (and ended up as foreman at the San Antonio ranch). César Jr (the heir of the Acevedo farm) had two good friends in Joao da Silveira and César de Guzmán.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibralfaro.uma.es/opinion/pag_1743.htm A Portuguese and a Spaniard], who had "ridden" with young Mexican Diego de Abriles in several early pulps, written by Mallorquí under the pseudonym of Amadeo Conde on Molino 1942-1947, [http://noveladeloeste.blogspot.se/2009/07/tres-hombres-buenos.html ''3 hombres buenos''],  [http://www.fulltv.tv/movies/tres-hombres-buenos.html and a movie in 1963]. The two adventurers later "rode again" in further pulps in the long-running ''Dos hombres buenos'' Cid novel series [http://www.todocoleccion.net/tebeos-clasicos/dos-hombres-buenos-ed-cid-ano-1955-j-mallorqui-coleccion-100-novelas-1-edicion~x40048609 (around 100 volumes)] from 1955 for several years (also in a radio show).&lt;/ref&gt; He met them in around late 1872 (''El Cuervo en la pradera''). The skilled Indian Pedro Bienvenido (who was some kind of mind-reader) became an important allied of Coyote and his son César de Echagüe y Acevedo soon after (debuting in ''La reina del valle'' and its earlier and later sequels, also featuring Analupe de Monreal).&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Coyote novels, Lindqvists Förlag, Stockholm-Sweden, 46 volumes published 1954-1960&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early Coyote characters===

'''Several''' of the novels' characters appeared throughout the series. Among them, Fray Jacinto at the mission station [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan de Capistrano]], who knew of Coyote's identity (and tried to get César to marry Lupe - he was the only one knowing Julian's true background). He was murdered in late 1872. Later there was Fray Anselmo at [[San Benito County|San Benito de Palermo]]. Don Goyo Paz fought in the Mexican-American war and was a ranchowner not too far from San Antonio - los Lugones were hired bodyguards at Don Goyo's, whose son Gregorio Paz was to marry Guadalupe, but "El Diablo" forced César to marry her instead. There were solisitor José Covarrubias, doctor Garcia Oviedo, and Los Angeles sheriff Teodomiro Mateos - sheriff twice (1860s and 1870s), and in later years one of César's best friends. Former civil war spy Ginevra St. Clair appeared in 1869 (''El exterminio de la Calavera'', where César fell in love with her, but she died). There also were three more adventurers who appeared in several novels - Chris Wardell, "El Diablo" (Juan Nepomuceno Mariñas), and "Princess Irina" (Odile Garson - she debuted in ''Otra lucha'' in early 1870, and soon tried to charm César, but ended up as the partner of "El Diablo" after César's marriage). All three started out as some kind of enemies of Coyote.  Anita was Guadalupe's maiden, and [[San Francisco]] chief [[vigilante]] Captain Farrell became a good friend of Coyote.&lt;ref&gt;"Frisco" was much larger than L.A. in those days and had almost 25 times the population in 1870, with 30.000 in 1850&lt;/ref&gt; Another noble ranchowner was Don Rómulo Hidalgo (with his son Justo - his father was murdered around 1871). In the novels there were of course also a lot of villains -  Coyote's worst and toughest enemy probably was Robert Toombs (featured in ''Guadalupe'' and its sequels around 1872).&lt;ref&gt;All the characters are picked from the original 130 pulps. The datings are either picked directly from the novels or approximately interpreted through the stories' chronology (dates are sometimes slightly conflicting in the various novels)&lt;/ref&gt; Several novels were adventures in sequels (one special long one was Coyote´s adventures with Analupe De Monreal around 1873).

The '''Field Marshals' Hall''' of the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] was built to honor [[Imperial Russia]]'s greatest military leaders—Russian generals who attained the rank of [[List of Russian Field Marshals|Field Marshal]]. (The only higher rank was that of [[Generalissimo#Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union|Generalissimo]], attained by four generals and, in the Soviet period, bestowed on [[Joseph Stalin]]).

This great hall and the adjacent throne room are part of the suite of rooms that were created in the western part of the Winter Palace for Tsar Nicholas I in 1833 by architect [[Auguste de Montferrand]].{{r|Hermitage}}

The great fire, which destroyed the interior of the Winter Palace, began in this hall on 17 December 1837. It destroyed all in its path for over thirty hours.{{r|History}} Following the fire, the hall was rebuilt in its original style by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]].

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its recreated decoration by Stasov.

'''''Fun with Radio''''' is a book by [[Gilbert Davey]] first published in 1957 by [[Edmund Ward Ltd]] (London). At a time when [[radio receiver]]s were still very expensive, and portable radios still a rarity ([[transistors]] were just being introduced), the book introduced many youngsters, mainly boys, to radio construction, and in some cases a career in radio or [[electronics]]. Radio construction was, in the early years of broadcasting, a very popular hobby among boys. By the time he published 'Fun with Radio', Davey already had a huge following among readers of the ''[[Boy's Own Paper]]'', where he was said to be the most popular contributor on practical subjects among its readers, and in that same year he presented a series on BBC Television's ''Studio 'E''' which reportedly brought him 26,000 letters within a few days of the first broadcast &lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.daveysradios.org.uk/gwd.html Gilbert Davey's Radio Sets - Gilbert Davey page.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert Davey had a career as an insurance official, and was an amateur in the field of radio, but his enthusiasm and straightforward writing with clear detailed diagrams inspired many youngsters.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.daveysradios.org.uk/gwd.html Gilbert Davey's Radio Sets - Gilbert Davey page.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Six editions of the book were published, the final one in 1978.  Davey also wrote ''Fun with Short Wave Radio'', ''Fun with Transistors'', ''Fun with Hi-Fi'', and ''Fun with Silicon Chips in Modern Radio'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1274913.Gilbert_Davey List of titles by Gilbert Davey]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover general view of the agriculture of Somerset.jpg|thumb|''General View of the Agriculture of Somerset'']]
The '''''General View''''' series of county surveys was an initiative of the [[Board of Agriculture (1793–1822)|Board of Agriculture]] of Great Britain, of the early 1790s. Many of these works had second editions, in the 1810s.

The Board, set up by [[Sir John Sinclair]], was generally a proponent of [[enclosure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[S:Landholding in England/Chapter 19]]&lt;/ref&gt;

William Marshall, who had written the Central Highlands survey, was a rival of Arthur Young, and at odds with him over the surveys. He wrote at length about the reports in 1808 to 1817, producing a five-volume ''Review'', generally critical of the reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gerow Gazley|title=The Life of Arthur Young, 1741-1820|pages=499–500|year=1973|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Humphrey Marshall|title=A review of the reports to the Board of agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwwHAAAAQAAJ|year=1808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Marshall|title=A Review and Complete Abstract of the Reports to the Board of Agriculture from the Southern and Peninsular Departments of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5dgAAAAcAAJ|year=1817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Shirreff, John|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Lester's ''History of British Implements and Machinery applicable to Agriculture'' (1811) drew heavily on extracts from the surveys, where those covered [[agricultural implement]]s.

The '''''Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language of the Language Center''''' (Indonesian: ''Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia Pusat Bahasa'' (abbreviated in English and Indonesian as '''''KBBI''''')) is the official dictionary of the [[Indonesian language]]. Produced by the Language Center of the [[Indonesia]]n [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], it is considered canonical as a measure of which words have been formally incorporated into Indonesian.

The dictionary was first published in 1988, and launched at the Congress on the Indonesian Language. The first edition contained 62,000 entries, the second in 1991 had 72,000, and the third in 2000 had 78,000.  The current, fourth edition was released in 2008 and contains 90,000 entries; it is available online. The language it records is formal; it omits words that are considered slang or foreign, and its aim is [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]]. The authors note that "the compilation of a dictionary constitutes an effort of language codification which becomes part of standardization of a language."&lt;ref name=dam&gt;"[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/02/15/a-sophistication-unfolds-a-new-dictionary.html A sophistication unfolds in a new dictionary]" Nikolaos van Dam, ''Jakarta Post'' 15/02/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary has been criticised for being too selective, and excluding words that are in common use.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; Continual work is done towards future versions, to ensure the dictionary remains relevant to changes in the Indonesian language, and the authors are open to criticism and advice on how the work might accurately reflect Indonesian.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; Writing in the [[Jakarta Post]], Setiono Sugiharto states the "KBBI should be appreciated as a byproduct of work by Indonesian scholars who persistently show their commitment to the development of the Indonesian lexicon"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/04/04/kbbi039-praise-critique-a-language-user.html 'KBBI': Praise, critique from a language user]", Setiono Sugiharto, ''Jakarta Post'' 04/04/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai has also heavily influenced the forms of colloquial English spoken in Thailand ([[Tinglish]]).

My Dr. Father I must only say that this is a good place and A good Country for if one place does not Suit A man he can go to Another and can very easy please himself But there is one thing that’s Ruining this place Especially the Frontirs towns and Cities where the Flow of Emmigration is most, the Emmigrants has not money Enough to Take them to the Interior of the Country which oblidges them to Remain here in York and the like places for which Reason Causes the less demand for Labour and also the great Reduction in wages.

'''Margaret McCarthy''' ({{birth based on age as of date|23|1849|09|07|noage=1}} – death date unknown) was an [[Irish Americans|Irish migrant to the United States]].

On September 22, 1850, she wrote a letter to her family, as a guide for other [[emigration|emigrants]].&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayolibrary.ie/en/LocalStudies/Emigration/LetterSamples/|title=Letter Samples|publisher=Mayo County Library|accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gilded Age in New York, 1870-1910|first=Esther|last=Crain|date=September 27, 2016|isbn=9780316353687|page=211|publisher=Hachette Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56yTCwAAQBAJ|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained that once in the United States, [[American frontier|moving west]] was very expensive, though she did not know that those who did go rarely had an improved standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern American Metropolis: A Documentary Reader|first=David M.

There was long discussion of the desirability of establishing a national gallery in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;Over 40 years until it finally opened: ''Art in Berlin, 1815&amp;ndash;1989'', Exhibition catalogue, High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia, Seattle: University of Washington, 1989, {{ISBN|9780939802609}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3rtPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Berlin+National+Gallery&amp;dq=Berlin+National+Gallery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l87LT52zBKa-2AXS543bCw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBDgK p. 59].&lt;/ref&gt; particularly during [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|the period of revolutionary nationalism around 1848]], and it became an increasingly serious proposition from 1850, when publications appeared advocating it.&lt;ref name=Keisch8&gt;Claude Keisch, ''The Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin'', London: Scala / Munich: Beck, 2005, {{ISBN|9783406526756}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApOj7UXAPkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlPLT_yKN4To2QX8oZnaCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=decision%20was%20taken%20to%20establish%20the%20Nationalgalerie&amp;f=false p. 8].&lt;/ref&gt; From the start it was bound up with the ambitions of [[Prussia]] and the wish for Berlin to become a capital of world renown.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard Vieregg, ''Vorgeschichte der Museumspädagogik: Dargestellt an der Museumsentwicklung in den Städten Berlin, Dresden, München und Hamburg bis zum Beginn der Weimarer Republik'', Museen, Geschichte und Gegenwart 2, Münster: Lit, [1991], {{ISBN|9783886607624}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CNYus1_Y38C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Geschichte+der+Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jtDLT9-hOuWg2QW67oHbCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Richard%20Fischers%20Beitrag%20%27Zur%20Gr%C3%BCndung%20einer%20Nationalgalerie%27&amp;f=false p. 42] {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was finally taken in 1861, after the death of the banker and art patron [[Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener]], who bequeathed his extensive collection (262 artworks) to the then Prince Regent, the future King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in the hope of catalysing the formation of a gallery of "more recent" art.&lt;ref name=Keisch8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud'' Volume 5 ''Pleasure Wars'', New York/London: Norton, 1998, {{ISBN|9780393045703}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmZhMjac60IC&amp;pg=PA291 p. 184].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vieregger25&gt;Vieregger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CNYus1_Y38C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Geschichte+der+Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jtDLT9-hOuWg2QW67oHbCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Wagener&amp;f=false p. 25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil Kueschke, "Die Nationalgalerie in Berlin", ''Unsere Zeit'' NF XIII.2 (1877) 241&amp;ndash;66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UqkmAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 p. 242] {{de icon}}: "zu einer nationalen Galerie heranzuwachsen, welche die neuere Malerei auch in ihrer weitern Entwickelung darstellt".&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was initially known as the ''Wagenersche und Nationalgalerie'' (Wagener and National Gallery) and was housed in the buildings of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Kueschke, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UqkmAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 p. 243].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich August Stüler]] began working on a design for a gallery building in 1863, based on a sketch by William I's father, King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]].&lt;ref name=Keisch7&gt;Keisch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApOj7UXAPkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlPLT_yKN4To2QX8oZnaCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=based%20on%20a%20sketch%20by%20the%20king&amp;f=false p. 7].&lt;/ref&gt; Two years and two failed plans later, his third proposal was finally accepted. Stüler died before planning was completed and [[Carl Busse (architect)|Carl Busse]] handled the remaining details in 1865. In 1866, by order of the king and his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], the ''Kommission für den Bau der Nationalgalerie'' (Commission for the construction of the national gallery) was created.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Maaz, ed.

In 1872 the structure was completed and interior work began. The opening took place on March 22, 1876 in the presence of William I, who was by then German Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Kueschke, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UqkmAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=22.+M%C3%A4rz+1876+Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUnST4i3AYrE0QHVoOSLAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=22.%20M%C3%A4rz%201876%20Nationalgalerie%20Berlin&amp;f=false p. 241].&lt;/ref&gt;

The building, today the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]], resembles a Greco-Roman [[temple]] (a form chosen for its symbolism that, it has been pointed out, is not well suited to displaying art)&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sheehan, "Aesthetic Theory and Architectural Practice: Schinkel's Museum in Berlin", in David Wetzel, ed., ''From the Berlin Museum to the Berlin Wall: Essays on the Cultural and Political History of Modern Germany'', Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1996, {{ISBN|9780275954451}}, pp. 11&amp;ndash;30, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNtBpfNwwNwC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Geschichte+der+Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2a_LT5ygHKrq2AW9xOnaCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20certain%20grandeur%20and%20perhaps%20even%20a%20quirky%20charm&amp;f=false p. 26].&lt;/ref&gt; and is stylistically a combination of late Classicism and early [[Neo-Renaissance]]. It was intended to express "the unity of art, nation, and history", and therefore has aspects reminiscent of a church (with an apse) and a theatre (a grand staircase leading to the entry) as well as a temple. An [[equestrian statue of Frederick William IV]] tops the stairs, and the inside stairs have a frieze by [[Otto Geyer]] depicting German history from prehistoric times to the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Keisch7/&gt; The inscription over the door reads "To German art, 1871" (the year of the founding of the Empire, not the year the gallery was completed).&lt;ref name=Keisch9&gt;Keisch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApOj7UXAPkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlPLT_yKN4To2QX8oZnaCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Peter%20Cornelius&amp;f=false p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank B.

===Until 1933===
The first director of the National Gallery was [[Max Jordan (art historian)|Max Jordan]], who was appointed in 1874, before the building was completed.&lt;ref name=Vieregger25/&gt; When the building opened, in addition to Wagener's collection, it contained over 70 [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]]s for friezes on mythological and religious subjects by [[Peter von Cornelius]]; high-ceilinged galleries were designed to accommodate them.&lt;ref name=Keisch9/&gt; Wagener's collection was not limited to German art; in particular, it included Belgian artists who were popular at the time; and under Jordan the gallery's holdings rapidly came to include an unusually large collection of sculpture and a drawings department.&lt;ref name=Keisch9/&gt; However, Jordan was hampered throughout his tenure by the Regional Art Commission, which was made up of representatives of the academic art establishment and resisted all attempts to acquire modernist art.&lt;ref name=Roters187&gt;Eberhard Roters, "The Birth Pangs of Modernism", in ''Berlin/New York: Like and Unlike: Essays on Architecture and Art from 1870 to the Present'', ed. Josef Paul Kleihues and Christina Rathgeber, New York: Rizzoli, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8478-1657-5}}, pp. 180&amp;ndash;93, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, he was succeeded as director by [[Hugo von Tschudi]], formerly assistant head of the Berlin museums under [[Wilhelm von Bode]].&lt;ref name=Roters187/&gt; Although he had previously had no association with modern art, he was fired with enthusiasm for [[Impressionism]] on a visit to Paris where he was introduced to the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], and became determined to acquire a representative collection of Impressionist art for the National Gallery. When the commission vetoed his requests, he secured the patronage of a large number of wealthy bourgeois art collectors, most of them Jewish.&lt;ref name=Roters188&gt;Roters, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; He also rearranged the exhibition spaces, putting many items in storage to make room for works by [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] as well as the earlier [[John Constable|Constable]] and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]]. One of the first, soon after Tschudi took up the post, was Manet's ''[[In the Conservatory]]'';&lt;ref name=Schultern/&gt; in 1897, the Berlin National Gallery became the first museum in the world to acquire a painting by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]].&lt;ref&gt;Emily D. Bilski, ''Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890&amp;ndash;1918'', Exhibition catalogue, Berkeley: University of California / New York: Jewish Museum, 1999, {{ISBN|9780520924512}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cGSr7jHwnBkC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=Berlin+National+Gallery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qs7LT6nbGeGJ2AWhy8XaCw&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCQ#v=snippet&amp;q=first%20museum%20director%20in%20the%20world%20to%20acquire&amp;f=false p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt; This moved the gallery decisively away from emphasis on Prussia and the rest of the German Empire. In response to complaints from the academic connoisseurs, William II decreed in 1899 that all acquisitions for the National Gallery must have his personal authorisation; Tschudi initially complied and rehung the old works, but the imperial decree proved unenforceable, prompting the Kaiser to build public monuments to his power instead. In 1901, at the inauguration of the memorials on the [[Siegesallee]], he gave a speech denouncing "gutter art" which became known as the ''Rinnsteinrede'' (gutter speech).&lt;ref name=Roters188/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C.

Tschudi also had a great appreciation for the [[German Romanticism#Visual artists|German Romantics]], many of whose paintings were included in Wagener's original bequest.&lt;ref name=Schultern&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46477771.html "Magere Schultern"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 9 September 1968 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keisch31&gt;Keisch, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition of 100 years of German art at the National Gallery in 1906 contributed to reawakening interest in artists such as [[Caspar David Friedrich]].&lt;ref name=Keisch31/&gt; This was also an interest shared by Tschudi's successor, [[Ludwig Justi]], who was director from 1909 to 1933 and added to the gallery's holdings in early 19th-century German painting.&lt;ref name=Keisch31/&gt;

In 1919, after the abolition of the Prussian monarchy, the gallery acquired the Crown Prince's Palace (''[[Kronprinzenpalais]]'') and used it to display the modern art. This became known as the Neue Abteilung (New Department) or National Gallery II, and met the demand by contemporary artists for a Gallery of Living Artists.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, ''Art treasures of the Berlin State Museums'', New York: Abrams, 1965, {{OCLC|475266}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=ffXQT7qlOqjL2QXAp_iCDw&amp;id=tZwzAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=National+Gallery+Berlin+Crown+Prince%27s+Palace&amp;q=in+1919%2C+by+the+acquisition+for+exhibition+purposes+of+the+former+Kronprinzenpalais+%28Crown+Prince%27s+Palace%29#search_anchor p. 65].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spirit&gt;Françoise Forster-Hahn, ''Spirit of an Age: Nineteenth-Century Paintings from the Nationalgalerie, Berlin'', Exhibition catalogue, [[National Gallery, London]], [[National Gallery of Art, Washington]], London: National Gallery, 2001, {{ISBN|9781857099607}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=SP7QT7uSFojg2gXQy8GWDw&amp;id=8udOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Nationalgalerie+II%2C+Kronprinzenpalais&amp;q=ln+1919+Justi+secured+the+Kronprinzenpalais+%28Crown+Prince%27s+palace%29%2C+which+had+now+lost+its+purpose%2C+as+an+outhouse+of+the+Nationalgalerie+for+contemporary+art.+Until+its+closure+by+the+National+Socialists+in+1937+the+works+shown+there#search_anchor p. 55].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Ladd, ''The Companion Guide to Berlin'', Woodbridge, Suffolk/Rochester, New York: Companion Guides/Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2004, {{ISBN|9781900639286}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MY0udx6aJroC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=National+Gallery+Berlin+Crown+Prince%27s+Palace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ffXQT7qlOqjL2QXAp_iCDw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; It opened with works by the [[Berlin Secession]]ists, the Impressionists and the [[Expressionism|Expressionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Joan Weinstein, ''The End of Expressionism: Art and the November Revolution in Germany, 1918&amp;ndash;19'', Chicago: University of Chicago, 1990, {{ISBN|9780226890593}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bwgTcfxyzokC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=Geschichte+der+Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2a_LT5ygHKrq2AW9xOnaCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Gallery%20of%20Living&amp;f=false p. 85].&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first state promotion of Expressionist works, which were unpopular with large numbers of the public,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M.

After the Second World War, the gallery and the other museums on [[Museum Island]] were located in the Soviet Occupation Zone which became East Berlin. The National Gallery's collection, much of it confiscated and then returned by the various occupying powers, was split between East and West and had been further diminished by the war; 19th-century paintings from the former annexe had been destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name=Schultern/&gt; While the Alte Nationalgalerie building was renovated, in the Western sector, paintings were initially housed in [[Charlottenburg Palace]]. The city of Berlin (West) founded a new museum of 20th-century art in 1949;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46171728.html "Echter Mies"], ''Der Spiegel'', 21 August 1963 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was eventually merged with the Western branch of the National Gallery,&lt;ref name=Schultern/&gt; and West Berlin then created its own cultural centre, the [[Kulturforum]], which included the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] (New National Gallery), a modernist building designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. This opened on 15 September 1968 and initially exhibited the full range of 19th and 20th-century art.&lt;ref name=Jubilee&gt;Roland Keitsch, [http://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/berlin/jubilaeum-einer-berliner-institution-peter-klaus-schuster-5812374.bild.html "Rückblick auf die tollsten und chaotischsten Ausstellungen: Neue Nationalgalerie hat Geburtstag"], ''[[Bild]]'', 15 September 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.H.

The [[Friedrichswerder Church]], a Gothic landmark designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], was ruined in the war; between 1979 and 1986 it was restored, and it was then reopened in September 1987, as part of the celebrations of Berlin's 750th anniversary, as an annexe of the National Gallery displaying 19th-century sculpture. There is a Schinkel museum in the gallery.&lt;ref name=church&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/smb/sammlungen/details.php?objID=19&amp;n=1&amp;r=5&amp;p=1 Collection - History], Friedrichswerder Church, [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]], [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation|Preußischer Kulturbesitz]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schuster&gt;Peter-Klaus Schuster, ''Die Alte Nationalgalerie'', Berlin: Berlin: SMB-DuMont, 2003, {{ISBN|9783832173708}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=tcHTT4LCH8r50gGxs9m5Aw&amp;id=m6npAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Friedrichswerdersche+Kirche+Nationalgalerie+1987&amp;q=September+1987+als+Filiale+der+Nationalgalerie+er%C3%B6ffnet.#search_anchor p. 45].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[German reunification]], the old building was extensively renovated&lt;ref&gt;Hans Belting, ''The Germans and Their Art: A Troublesome Relationship'', New Haven: Yale University, 1998, {{ISBN|9780300076165}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qBU-V3TNPXsC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Geschichte+der+Nationalgalerie+Berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2a_LT5ygHKrq2AW9xOnaCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20Gallery&amp;f=false pp. 106&amp;ndash;07] has pictures of the exterior under renovation and says that the question of exhibiting East German art had yet to be resolved.&lt;/ref&gt; and the new building is now used for 20th-century art and the old building for 19th-century art.

In 1996, while the Alte Nationalgalerie was still being slowly renovated, two further exhibition spaces were added for modern art. In September, the [[Berggruen Museum]], housing [[Heinz Berggruen]]'s collection of modern classics, especially focussed on Picasso, opened in the western of a pair of neoclassical buildings opposite the Charlottenburg Palace, like the Alte Nationalgalerie designed by Friedrich August Stüler as realisations of sketches by Frederick William IV; it had housed the West Berlin Museum of Antiquities until that collection was returned to Museum Island after German reunification.&lt;ref name=Retter&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9109819.html "Die unheimlichen Retter"], ''Der Spiegel'', 28 October 1996 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/smb/standorte/index.php?p=2&amp;objID=2976&amp;n=11 Museum Berggruen], [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]], [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation|Preußischer Kulturbesitz]].&lt;/ref&gt; Berggruen initially leased the collection to the Berlin State Museums for a ten-year period, but in 2000 sold it to them for a small fraction of its assessed value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/archiv/?dig=2006/12/16/a0264 "Ein Giacometti zum Abschied"], ''[[Tageszeitung]]'', 16 December 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]], formerly a museum of technology but ruined in the war, opened after a six-year renovation as the ''Museum für Gegenwart'', housing contemporary art, initially most from [[Erich Marx]]'s collection.&lt;ref name=Retter/&gt;

In 2008, the [[Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection]] of 20th-century art opened in the eastern Stüler building, which had housed the Egyptian Collection until it moved back to Museum Island. The collection is on a ten-year lease from the ''Stiftung Sammlung Dieter Scharf zur Erinnerung an Otto Gerstenberg'' (foundation of the Dieter Scharf collection in remembrance of Otto Gerstenberg), which focusses on the fantastic and the surreal and was built by Dieter Scharf based on some of the works in his grandfather Otto Gerstenberg's collection.&lt;ref name=Scharf&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/smb/news/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=19270 Opening of the Collection Scharf-Gerstenberg "Surreal Worlds", Collection Scharf-Gerstenberg, National Gallery, 11 July 2008], News, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz, retrieved 4 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kunstjuwel&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/kunstjuwel-fuer-berlin/1275044.html "Kunstjuwel für Berlin"], Zeitung heute, ''Der Tagesspiegel'', 10 July 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, it was announced that the Old Masters currently displayed in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] in the Kulturforum would be moved out to make way for a representative permanent exhibition of modern art, for which the Neue Nationalgalerie does not have adequate space.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Lapp, [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Berlin%E2%80%99s-20th-century-art-to-gain-space-of-its-own/25198 "Berlin’s 20th-century art to gain space of its own: The director of the Nationalgalerie, Udo Kittelmann, gets the green light to rehang Gemäldegalerie with modern masters"], ''The Art Newspaper'', 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thunnus (Neothunnus)''''' is a [[subgenus]] of [[ray-finned]] [[bony fish]]es in the [[Thunnini]], or [[tuna]], [[tribe (biology)|tribe]].  More specifically, ''Neothunnus'' is a subgenus of the [[genus]] ''[[Thunnus]]'', also known as the "true tunas".  ''Neothunnus'' is sometimes referred to as the '''yellowfin group''', and comprises three species:

;subgenus ''Thunnus (Neothunnus)''
* ''[[Thunnus albacares|T. albacares]]'' &lt;small&gt;(Bonnaterre, 1788)&lt;/small&gt; – [[yellowfin tuna]]

An '''online encyclopedia''' is an [[encyclopedia]] accessible through the [[internet]], such as [[Wikipedia]]. The idea to build a free encyclopedia using the Internet can be traced at least to the 1994 [[Interpedia]] proposal; it was planned as an encyclopedia on the Internet to which everyone could contribute materials. The project never left the planning stage and was overtaken by a key branch of old printed encyclopedias.

== Digitization of old content ==
===Wikisource===
There are a lot of old encyclopaedia and dictionaries of national biographies on [[Wikisource]] both in English and other languages. The completion of these encyclopaedias vary and the quality of the content varies from proof read, to poor quality text with many [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) errors.

===Others===
Many encyclopaedias are available at the Internet Archive. Although the original text is viewable the machine readable text is often poor  with may OCR errors.

In January 1995, [[Project Gutenberg]] started to publish the [[ASCII]] text of 
the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th edition (1911), but disagreement about the method halted the work after the first volume. For trademark reasons this has been published as the ''[[Gutenberg Encyclopedia]]''. Project Gutenberg has restarted work on digitising and proofreading this encyclopedia; as of June 2005 it had not yet been published. Meanwhile, in the face of competition from rivals such as [[Encarta]], the latest ''Britannica'' was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a CD-ROM and later as an online service.#

In 2001, ASCII text of all 28 volumes was published on [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1911encyclopedia.org/ |title=LoveToKnow Classic Encyclopedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010927163517/http://1911encyclopedia.org:80/ |archivedate=21 September 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by source; a copyright claim was added to the materials included. The website no longer exists.

Other digitization projects have made progress in other titles. One example is ''[[Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)]]'' digitized by the [[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/e/easton/ebd/ |title=Easton's Bible Dictionary by Easton |accessdate=2003-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803070823/http://www.ccel.org/e/easton/ebd/ |archivedate=2003-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful digitization of an encyclopedia was the [[Bartleby.com|Bartleby Project]]'s online adaptation of the ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ |title=Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001 |accessdate=2002-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020205073950/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ |archivedate=2002-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in early 2000 and is updated periodically.

==Creation of new content==
Another related branch of activity is the creation of new, free contents on a volunteer basis. In 1991, the participants of the [[Usenet]] newsgroup &lt;tt&gt;alt.fan.douglas-adams&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=alt.fan.douglas-adams&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg |title=alt.fan.douglas-adams |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; started a project to produce a real version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a fictional encyclopedia used in the works of [[Douglas Adams]]. It became known as Project Galactic Guide. Although it originally aimed to contain only real, factual articles, policy was changed to allow and encourage semi-real and unreal articles as well. Project Galactic Guide contains over 1700 articles, but no new articles have been added since 2000; this is probably partly due to the founding of [[h2g2]], a more official project along similar lines.

The '''Oran fatwa''' was a ''[[responsa|responsum]]'' [[fatwa]], or an Islamic legal opinion, issued in 1504 to address the crisis that occurred when [[Islam in Spain|Muslims]] in the [[Crown of Castile]] (in Spain) were [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|forced to convert]] to Christianity in 1500{{ndash}}1502.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}} The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the [[sharia]] (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266&lt;!-- "It is particularly intriguing in that it grants comprehensive dispensation to Muslims living under the Inquisition to dissimulate{{snds}}to conform outwardly to Christianity in their daily lives, performing acts that are expressly forbidden in Islamic law, if necessary, just as long as they do this with the internal knowledge that these acts are ordinarily forbidden and without relinquishing their internal conviction."--&gt;}} It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the [[salat|ritual prayers]], the [[zakat|ritual charity]], and the [[wudu|ritual ablution]], and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]], and consuming pork and wine.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=61–62}}

The fatwa enjoyed wide currency among Muslims and [[Morisco]]s (Muslims nominally converted to Christianity and their descendants) in [[History of Spain#Early Modern Spain|Spain]], and one of the surviving [[aljamiado]] translations was dated at 1564, 60{{nbsp}}years after the original fatwa.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} The fatwa has been described as the "key [[Kalam|theological]] document" to understand the practice of Spanish Muslims following the [[Reconquista]] up to the [[expulsion of the Moriscos]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266}} The author of the fatwa (''mufti'') was [[Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah]], a North African scholar of Islamic law of the [[Maliki]] school.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=296}} The fatwa was termed the "[[Oran]] fatwa" by modern scholars, due to the word "Al-Wahrani" ("of Oran") that appears in the text as part of the author's name.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=273}}

The influence of the fatwa was limited to Spain.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} Outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the predominant opinion upheld the requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to emigrate, or even choose [[martyrdom in Islam|martyrdom]], when the orthodox observance of the religion became impossible.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=152}}

== Background ==
{{see|Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain}}
Islam has been present in Spain since the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the eighth century. At the beginning of the twelfth century, the Muslim population in the Iberian Peninsula&amp;nbsp;— called "[[Al-Andalus]]" by the Muslims&amp;nbsp;— was estimated to number up to 5.5&amp;nbsp;million, among whom were [[Arabs]], [[Berbers]] and indigenous converts.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=40}} In the next few centuries, as the Christians pushed from the north in a process called ''[[reconquista]]'', the Muslim population declined.{{sfn|Harvey|1992|p=9}} At the end of the fifteenth century, the ''reconquista'' culminated in the [[Granada War|fall of Granada]], and the total number of Muslims in Spain was estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 out of the total Spanish population of 7 to 8&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=40}} Approximately half of the Muslims lived in the former [[Emirate of Granada]], the last independent Muslim state in Spain, which had been annexed to the [[Crown of Castile]].{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=40}} About 20,000 Muslims lived in other territories of Castile, and most of the remainder lived in the territories of the [[Crown of Aragon]].{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=40–41}}

[[File:The Moorish Proselytes of Archbishop Ximenes, Granada, 1500.jpg|thumb|Forced conversions to Christianity was the background of the fatwa. This 1873 painting depicts the mass baptism of Muslims in Granada by [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]].]]

Prior to the completion of the ''reconquista'', the defeated Muslims were generally given [[freedom of religion]] as terms of their surrender. For example, the [[Treaty of Granada]], which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of forced conversion triggered [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499–1501)|a series of Muslim rebellions]] in Granada (1499–1501).{{sfn|Coleman|2003|p=6&lt;!--quote=Outraged by Cisneros's efforts and his reported use of torture, Granada's Muslims in December 1499 rose up in an open rebellion that quickly spread to the nearby Alpujarras Mountains.--&gt;}}{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=59}} The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=35}} They were given the choice to remain and accept [[baptism]], to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=48}} The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in uprooting one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the inability to pay the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=48}}

Some Muslims, especially those living near the [[Andalusia|southern coast]], took the option of exile,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=48–49}} but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to believe and practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=49}} The population converted ''en masse'', and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=74}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=57}} The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=57}} These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the [[Morisco]]s.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}} As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food and beverages [[Islamic dietary laws|forbidden]] by Islamic law.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=49–52}}

=== Previous Islamic legal opinions ===
Prior to the Oran fatwa, the predominant position of Islamic scholars had been that a Muslim could not stay in a country where rulers made proper religious observance impossible.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=63–64}} Therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave, when they were able to do so.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} Even before the systematic forcible conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from erosion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=56}} Notably, the contemporary North African scholar [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], who was considered the leading authority on the subject of Muslims in Spain,{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=298}} wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=56}} Further, Al-Wansharisi urged severe punishment for the Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in [[Jahannam|hell in the afterlife]].{{sfn|Hendrickson|2009|p=25}}

== Authorship ==
The surviving translations of the fatwa give the name of the author in various slightly different forms. All of them are thought to be derived from the [[Arabic name]] Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani, with some adding the name 'Ubaydallah, which might be a pious formula meaning "the little servant of God".{{sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=270–271}} The author's [[Nisba (onomastics)|nisba]]&amp;nbsp;— the part of his name that indicates place of origin&amp;nbsp;— ''al-Wahrani'' ("of Oran") refers to the city of [[Oran]] ({{lang-ar|وهران}},{{nbsp}}''Wahran'') in modern-day [[Algeria]], then part of the [[Zayyanid dynasty|Zayyanid]] [[kingdom of Tlemcen]].{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2008}} Thus, the author is often referred to as "the ''Mufti'' of Oran" and the document is called "the Oran fatwa", even though there appeared to be no indication that the fatwa was issued in Oran or that the author resided or had an official authority in Oran.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=273}} [[Devin J. Stewart|Devin Stewart]], an academic specialist in [[Islamic studies]], identified the author as [[Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah|Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani]] (b.{{nbsp}}unknown{{snds}}d.{{nbsp}}1511 in [[Fez]]), a [[Maliki]] jurist who had studied in Oran and [[Tlemcen]] and probably issued the fatwa in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] while a professor of Islamic law there.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=296}}

Al-Wahrani drafted the fatwa in response to a request of legal opinion, in other words, as a ''[[responsa|responsum]]'', to Muslim petitioners who wished to learn if they could continue to live in Christian Spain.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266}}{{sfn|Garcia-Arenal|Rodríguez Mediano|2013|p=290}} The recipient of the fatwa is not named.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}} The commonly accepted date of the composition of the fatwa is 1{{nbsp}}[[Rajab]] 910{{nbsp}}AH, as this was the date that appears in most of the surviving manuscripts.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=270}} This day in the [[Islamic calendar]] corresponds to around 8{{nbsp}}December 1504.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=269}} One manuscript added "3{{nbsp}}May 1563" in addition to 1{{nbsp}}Rajab 910, which would have been a date conversion error, but both Stewart and the historian [[L.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Harvey]] have suggested that the 1563 date might have been the time of the translation.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=269}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} One other manuscript gives "Rajab{{nbsp}}909", which was probably a copying error.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=270}}

== Content ==
The opening of the fatwa displayed sympathy to the Muslims of Spain, who kept their religious faith despite the suffering and risk that this posed them. The ''mufti'' (author of the fatwa) exhorted that they continue to adhere to the religion of Islam and instruct it to their children when the latter reached maturity.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}}

The fatwa reaffirmed the obligation of Spanish Muslims to perform the [[salat|ritual prayers]] (''salat''), the [[zakat|ritual charity]] (''zakat''), and the ritual ablution (''[[ghusl]]''), even if they could not be performed in the correct form.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} It described the obligation of the ritual prayers{{snds}}normally performed by standing, bowing, [[prostration|prostrating]], and sitting in a prescribed sequence{{snds}}even if done only by making slight movements.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayers{{snds}}normally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed times{{snds}}when they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} It also provided instructions for performing the [[tayammum|ritual dry ablution]] (''tayammum'') when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the [[wudu|ritual ablution]] (''wudu'') that is ordinarily required before performing the ''salat''.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} When ''tayammum'' was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}}

The fatwa also maintained the Islamic obligation to give the ritual charity (''zakat''){{snds}}normally calculated and distributed in a specific manner prescribed by the [[sharia]] (Islamic law){{snds}}even if this could only be done by showing generosity to a beggar.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} It affirmed the obligation of the ritual ablution (''ghusl''), "even though by plunging into the sea".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}}

The fatwa permitted Muslims outwardly to participate in Christian rituals and worship, so long as they inwardly considered them to be forbidden. When the Muslims had to prostrate to Christian "idols", they were to internally desire to perform the Islamic prayer, even if not actually [[Qibla|facing Mecca]], and when they bowed down to the "idols", they were to focus their attention toward [[God in Islam|Allah]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} When obliged to commit [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]], such as cursing [[Muhammad]], or accepting [[Jesus]] as the [[God the Son|son of God]] or [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|God's wife]] [''[[sic]]''], the fatwa instructed them to do so, and to employ "whatever stratagems" they could to negate their meaning whenever possible. For example, the fatwa suggested mispronouncing the name of Muhammad, or intending to curse someone else with a similar name, when being required to curse the prophet.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=62}}

The fatwa also allowed Spain's Muslims to consume [[alcohol in Islam|wine]], [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|pork]], and other things normally forbidden by the sharia, as long as the Muslims did not intend to take advantage of them and rejected them in their hearts.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=61–62}}{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=177}} The fatwa reaffirmed the permissibility of a Muslim man [[Interfaith marriage in Islam|marrying a Christian woman]], under the reasoning that both Muslims and Christians were [[People of the Book]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=62}} Marriage between a Muslim woman and a Christian man was to be avoided unless under duress, and while doing so the Muslims should "cleave firmly to the belief that that is forbidden".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=62}}

At the end of the fatwa, the author encouraged the Muslims to write to the ''mufti'' about anything else that presented difficulty to them, so that he could give further legal opinions. The fatwa discreetly did not name any specific recipient, and instead designated the persons it was addressed to by "''al-guraba''" (those living abroad) yet near to Allah".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}}

== Reactions ==
=== Impact in Spain ===
[[File:La Expulsión en el Puerto de Denia. Vicente Mostre.jpg|thumb|The opinion in the fatwa had a lasting impact in the Morisco community until their [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expulsion from Spain]] in 1609{{ndash}}1614, depicted in ''The Expulsion at the Port of [[Denia]]'' by Vicente Mostre, 1613.]]

The fatwa appeared to enjoy wide currency within the Muslim and Morisco community in various kingdoms of Spain, for it was translated and copied as late as 1563 and 1609.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} The full geographical reach of the text is unknown, but it appeared to be originally addressed to the Muslims (or Moriscos) of Castile as a response to their forced conversions in 1500–1502.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} After the forced conversion was extended to the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s, the fatwa likely circulated there, too.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}

The opinion formed the basis of the Moriscos' Islamic status and practices for more than a century, until [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|their expulsion]] in 1609–1614.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} This led to a non-traditional form of Islam, in which one's internal intention (''[[niyya]]''), rather than external observation of rituals and laws, was the defining characteristic of one's Islam.{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=153}} Generations of Moriscos were born and died within this religious climate.{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=153}} Hybrid or undefined religious practice featured in many Morisco texts.{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|pp=153–154}} For example, the works of the Morisco writer known as "the [[Young Man of Arévalo]]", written c.{{nbsp}}1530s described [[crypto-Muslim]]s using Christian worship as replacement for regular Islamic rituals, as recommended in the fatwa.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=185}}

The influence of the fatwa was limited to Spain.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the predominant opinion continued to uphold the unbending requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to leave any country, or even choose [[martyrdom in Islam|martyrdom]], where approved observance of the religion became impossible.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=152}}

=== Scholarly analysis ===
Modern scholars of Spanish Islamic history stressed the historical importance of the fatwa. Harvey called it "the key theological document" for the study of Spanish Islam following the forced conversions, a description which Stewart repeated.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266}} Mercedes García-Arenal and Fernando Rodríguez Mediano, historians of Spain and Western Muslims, described the fatwa as "famous" and called it "one of the most important theological texts of later Spanish Islam".{{sfn|Garcia-Arenal|Rodríguez Mediano|2013|p=290}} Spanish literature scholar María del Mar Rosa-Rodríguez considered the fatwa important because it officially documented "the existence of religiosities that do not depend on traditional ritual practice".{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=157}}

Harvey and Stewart said that the fatwa was a departure from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=63–64}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=266, 298–299}} Notably, the Maliki scholar [[al-Wansharisi]], the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=299}} Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=299}} Recipients of this fatwa would be able to stay put, outwardly conforming to Christianity and not see themselves as abandoning their faith.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} The fatwa addressed the recipient as "''al-guraba''", a word that means "outsiders" or "those living abroad", but this word also appears in several [[hadith]]s (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=63}} The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably.{{sfn|Hendrickson|2009|p=25}}

Harvey did not consider the fatwa as a permanent and universal relaxation of the sharia; instead, the sender and the recipients of the fatwa must have seen its provisions as temporary expedients under extraordinary circumstances intended to help the Muslims of Spain through the crisis.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} The fatwa began by affirming in orthodox terms the obligations of all Muslims,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=61}} and ended by expressing hopes that Islam may again be practised openly without ordeals, tribulations and fear.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=63}} The ''mufti'' and many Moriscos expected or hoped that the crisis to end at some not-too-distant time.{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=152}} Rosa-Rodriguez noted that the fatwa stated a hope that the "Noble Turks" would soon intervene and end the religious persecution in Spain, a reference to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s growing power in the Mediterranean at the time.{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=151–152}} This hope did not materialise, and the religious persecution in Spain continued, causing the fatwa's recommendations to become the normal way of practicing Islam for generations.{{sfn|Rosa-Rodríguez|2010|p=152}}

Harvey also noted that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic religious duties, while usually a ''responsum'' fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=60}} The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=65}}

=== In popular culture ===
[[Amin Maalouf]]'s 1986 novel ''[[Leo Africanus (novel)|Leo Africanus]]'' features a fictionalised version of the fatwa. In the novel, Muslim exiles from Granada and the local [[ulama]] (Islamic scholars) held meetings in Fez to provide counsel to the Muslims in Granada, who sent letters describing their persecution and their dilemma. Amid the meetings, the protagonist of the novel witnessed the "man from Oran" delivering a speech similar in content to the Oran fatwa.{{sfn|Maalouf|1998|pp=115–116}}

== Surviving manuscripts ==
[[File:Sistinehall.jpg|thumb|The Vatican Library, which houses the only surviving Arabic copy of the fatwa]]

As of 2006, there are four known surviving manuscripts containing the fatwa. One of them is an Arabic copy, discovered by [[Muhammad Abdullah 'Inan]] in [[Vatican City|the Vatican]] in 1951 and kept in the Borgiano collection of the [[Vatican Library]].{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266}} The other three were translations to [[aljamiado|Spanish written in the Arabic script]] (''aljamiado''). One of them was kept in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]], and one in [[Madrid]], Spain.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=266–267}} The third ''aljamiado'' translation used to be in Madrid, but its location is currently unknown.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=267}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=300}}

Since the discovery, the texts have been transcribed or translated into modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=266}} Historian L.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Harvey provides a near-complete English translation in his book ''Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1615''.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=267}}

Pararaton opens with a formal incarnation of the founder of [[Singhasari]] kingdom (1222–1292), [[Ken Arok]] (or Ken Angrok).&lt;ref name="Johns1964"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of the manuscript is the story of Ken Arok's career before his accession to the throne in 1222. This part is clearly [[mythical]] in character. There then follow a number of shorter narrative fragments in chronological order. Many of the events recorded here are dated. Towards the end the pieces of history become shorter and shorter and are mixed with [[genealogy|genealogical]] information concerning the members of the royal family of [[Majapahit]].

The edition of the text published by J.L.A. Brandes furnishes an alternative title: ''Serat Pararaton atawa Katuturanira Ken Angrok'' ("The Book of Kings, or the Record of Ken Angrok", but the original manuscripts only give the basic title: "Pararaton". Since the oldest [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in the [[manuscript]]s contains the date 1522 Saka (1600 CE), the final part of the text must have been written between 1481 and 1600 CE.

== Prelude ==
Pararaton commences with a brief prelude telling how Ken Arok incarnated himself in which he became the king.&lt;ref name="Johns1964"/&gt; He offered himself as a [[human sacrifice]] to [[Yama#Yamadipati|Yamadipati]], the Javanese Door God, in order to save himself from death. As a reward, he was promised that upon his death he would return to [[Vishnu]]'s heaven and be reborn as a superior king of Singhasari.

The promise was fulfilled. Ken Arok was begotten by [[Brahma]] of a newly-wed [[peasant]] woman. On his birth, his mother laid him in a [[graveyard]] where his body, effulgent with light, attracted the attention of Ki Lembong, a passing thief. Ki Lembong adopted him, raised him and taught him all of his arts. Ken Arok indulged in [[gambling]], plunder and rapine. In the manuscript, it is written as such that Ken Arok was saved many times by [[divinity|divine]] intervention. There is a scene in Mount Kryar Lejar wherein gods descend in conference and ''Batara Guru'' ([[Shiva]]) declares Ken Arok his son. Ken Arok is also destined to bring stability and power to Java.

The prelude of Pararaton is followed by the meeting of Ken Arok with [[Lohgawe]], a [[Brahmin|Brahmanian]] who came from [[India]] to make sure Batara Guru's instructions were fulfilled. It was Lohgawe who asked Ken Arok to meet [[Tunggul Ametung]], ruler of [[Tumapel]]. Ken Arok then killed Tunggul Ametung to gain possession of Ametung's wife, [[Ken Dedes]], and also the throne to Singashari.

== Analysis of the manuscript ==

Some parts of Pararaton cannot be accounted as historical facts. Especially in the prelude, fact and fiction, fantasy and reality go together. Scholars such as [[Cornelis Christiaan Berg|C. C. Berg]] argued that texts such as these are entirely supernatural and ahistorical, and intended not to record the past, but instead determine future events.{{efn | group=lower-roman |1=&lt;ref&gt;C.

The manuscript was written under the nature of Javanese kingship. For Javanese, it is the function of the ruler to link the present with the past and the future and to give human life its appropriate place in the [[cosmos|cosmic]] order. The king, in the Javanese realm, is the sacral embodiment of the total state, just as his palace is a microcosmic copy of the macrocosmos.&lt;ref name="Johns1964"/&gt; The king (and a founder of a [[dynasty]]) possesses an innate divinity to a far higher degree than ordinary men.

Ras compared the Pararaton with the Sanskrit [[Canggal inscription]] (732 CE), the Śivagŗha (Siwagrha) inscription (856 CE), the Calcutta Stone (1041 CE) and the Babad Tanah Jawi (1836 CE). These show clear similarities in character, structure and function and also similarity with texts from the Malay [[historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Ras|J.J. Ras]], 2001, ''Sacral kingship in Java''. In: Marijke J. Klokke and Karel R. van Kooij (eds.), Fruits of inspiration. Studies in honour of Prof. J.G. de Casparis, pp. 373-388.

It describes a violent volcanic eruption in 416 AD in the [[Sunda Strait]] area, though the known eruption nearest this date was that of Krakatoa in 536: see [[Krakatoa#416 AD event|416 AD eruption of Krakatoa]].

'''Social integration''' is the process during which newcomers or minorities are incorporated into the social structure of the host society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alba|first=Richard|last2=Nee|first2=Victor|date=1997|title=Rethinking Assimilation Theory for a New Era of Immigration|url=|journal=International Migration Review|volume=31, 4|pages=826–874|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social integration, together with economic integration and identity integration, are three main dimensions of a newcomers' experiences in the society that is receiving them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A higher extent of social integration contributes to a closer social distance between groups and more consistent values and practices.

Bringing together various ethnic groups irrespective of language, caste, creed, etc., without losing one's identity. It gives access to all areas of community life and eliminates segregation.

In a broader view, social integration is a dynamic and structured process in which all members participate in dialogue to achieve and maintain peaceful social relations. Social integration does not mean [[forced assimilation]]. Social integration is focused on the need to move toward a safe, stable and [[just society]] by mending conditions of [[social disintegration]], [[social exclusion]], social fragmentation, exclusion and [[polarization (politics)|polarization]], and by expanding and strengthening conditions of social integration towards peaceful social relations of coexistence, collaboration and [[group cohesiveness|cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"PeaceDialogue". UN News Center. UN, n.d. Web. 02 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of integration ==
Integration was first studied by Park and Burgess in 1921 through the concept of assimilation. They defined it as "a process of interpenetration and fusion in which persons and groups acquire the memories, sentiments, and attitude of other persons and groups and, by sharing their experience and history, are incorporated with them in a common cultural life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to the Science of Sociology|last=Park|first=Robert E.|last2=Burgess|first2=Ernest|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=735|orig-year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars offered an assimilation theory, arguing that immigrants would be assimilated into the host society economically, socially and culturally over successive generations,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; others developed a multiculturalism theory, anticipating that immigrants could maintain their ethnic identities through the integration process to shape the host society with a diversified cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City|last=Glazer|first=Nathan|last2=Moynihan|first2=Daniel P.|publisher=MIT Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extending from the assimilation theory, a third group of scholars proposed a segmented integration theory, stressing that different groups of migrants might follow distinct trajectories towards upward or downward mobility on different dimensions, depending on their individual, contextual and structural factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert|date=1992|title=Second Generation Decline: Scenarios for the Economic and Ethnic Futures of Post-1965 American Immigrants|url=|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=15|pages=173–92|via=|doi=10.1080/01419870.1992.9993740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Portes|first=Alejandro|last2=Zhou|first2=Min|date=|title=The New Second Generation: Segmented Assimilation and Its Variants among Post-1965 Immigrant Youth|url=|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=530|pages=74–98|via=|doi=10.1177/0002716293530001006|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurements of social integration ==
Compared with other dimensions of integration, social integration focuses more on the degree to which immigrants adapt local customs, social relations, and daily practices. It is usually measured through social network, language, and intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring Immigrant Assimilation in the United States|last=Vigdor|first=Jacob|publisher=NY: Manhattan Institute, Civic Report No. 53|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used indicator of social integration is social network, which refers to the connection that immigrants build with others in the host society. While some researchers use the total number of immigrants’ friends as a measure, others use the frequency of interaction with friends. One thing worthy noting is that more and more studies differentiate local friends from immigrant friends because the former is considered more important in integrating immigrants into the local society than the latter.

Language is another important variable to access the degree of immigrants’ social integration. A higher level in grasping local language results in more chances to communicate with local people and a better understanding of local culture. A typical question used in survey is as “Do you understand the local people’s language?”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Wenfei Winnie|last2=Fan|first2=C. Cindy|date=2012|title=Migrant Workers Integration in Urban China Experiences in Employment, Social Adaptation, and Self-Identity|url=|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|volume=53|pages=731–749|via=|doi=10.2747/1539-7216.53.6.731}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for instance, the fluency of English is an widely used indicator and can be easily found in a report on immigration.

Intermarriage is also an indicator of social integration. For those who are unmarried, they will be asked: “Would you consider marrying a local people?”; for those married, question will be like “Would you like your children to consider marrying a local people?”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Answers to these questions are a good predictor of immigrants’ willingness to be integrated into the host society.

==Examples==
In many instances education is used as a mechanism for social promotion. Neither education nor work can be ensured without a form of law. In relation to tolerant and open societies, members of minority groups often use social integration to gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the [[mainstream]] of society with cultural institutions such as churches and civic organizations. Mass media content also performs a social integration function in mass societies.

The 2005 documentary ”Utan gränser – en film om idrott och integration” (''Without Borders - A Film About Sports and Integration'') was a film described by Swedish newspaper [[Aftonbladet]] as "a documentary on how to succeed with integration" of migrants into Swedish society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nilsson|first1=Christoffer|last2=Melin|first2=Eric|title=Swedish terror suspect was in movie about successful integration - Terrormisstänkt svensk var med i film om lyckad integration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22616250.ab|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=Aftonbladet|date=15 April 2016|language=Swedish|quote=As an eleven-year-old Osama Krayem participated in a documentary on how to succeed with integration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "social integration" first came into use in the work of French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]. He wanted to understand why rates of suicide were higher in some social classes than others. Durkheim believed that [[society]] exerted a powerful force on individuals. He concluded that a people's beliefs, values, and norms make up a collective consciousness, a shared way of understanding each other and the world.

==Uses==
A 2012 research review found that [[Working class|working-class]] students were less socially integrated than [[Middle Class|middle-class]] students at university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research | url = | journal = Journal of Diversity in Higher Education | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 22–38 | doi=10.1037/a0026162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/working-class-students-are-left-out-at-university Working-Class Students are Left Out at University] Mark Rubin's Social Psychology Research, retrieved 29 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research also shows that immigrants should be independent and proactive in order to achieve better social integration in their host countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Watt | first2 = S. E. | last3 = Ramelli | first3 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Immigrants' social integration as a function of approach-avoidance orientation and problem-solving style | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 498–505 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For further information, see here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/immigrants-should-be-independent-and-proactive-to-achieve-better-social-integration|title=Immigrants Should Be Independent and Proactive to Achieve Better Social Integration - Mark Rubin's Social Psychology Research|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sami,N.,Habib, S.E.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a demographic and cultural standpoint, recent longitudinal studies suggest that social isolation or integration has shown to increase in older Spanish individuals, especially those whom may be suffering from neurocognitive disorders such as dementia and overall cognitive decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zunzunegui|first1=et, al.|title=Social Networks, Social Integration, and Social Engagement Determine Cognitive Decline in Community-dwelling Spanish Older Adults|url=http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/S93.full.pdf+html|website=www.psychcgerontology.oxfordjournals.org|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has a Social Integration Branch, which is a part of the [[Division for Social Policy and Development]] (Department of Economic and Social Affairs). It also issues a quarterly publication named ''Bulletin on Social Integration Policies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/sib/ |title=UNDESA - Division for Social Policy and Development (DSPD) |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Alliance of Civilizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaoc.org/%20Official%20Webpage%20]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative works on Migration and Integration as a key for intercultural understanding.

'''Softpedia''' is a [[website]] from [[Romania]] that indexes information and provides primarily software information and downloads. Its main sections are [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[MacOS|Mac]], [[Linux]], Games, [[Device driver|Drivers]], Mobile, Webscripts, and News. It also covers technology and science topics from both external and in-house sources, and it provides software and game reviews.

==Website==
Wherever possible, it includes one or more screenshots of each application, often showing the application's menus to help illustrate its features. Unlike most other freeware websites, who are publishing mainly just information supplied by the author via e.g. Robosoft (a freeware publication tool), all product reviews at Softpedia are hand-written by professional reviewers working for the company itself. 

Softpedia reviews feature both a 5-star reviewer‘s choice, as well as a public 5-star product voting that‘s open to every website visitor. Softpedia‘s products are sorted in various categories, and users can sort their category of choice by latest / most popular / most favourite downloads. As well, freeware and commercial offerings (shareware) are clearly separated from each other, according to the product license. Virtual awards are granted and displayed for adware, spyware and commercial-free applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Finances-Business/Predicted-Desire.shtml#status|title=Download Startup Product Manager 3.48|work=softpedia|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Softpedia does not repack software for distribution. It provides direct downloads of software in its [[software distribution|original distribution form]], links to [[software Developer|developers]]' downloads, or both. In contrast to many other freeware websites though, Softpedia are hosting themselves. They allow to download the freeware and shareware products from their own Server, automatically scanned for viruses and malware, where appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''''West v Secretary of State for Scotland''''' 1992 SC 385 (IH), 1992 SLT 636, (also reported as ''West v Scottish Prison Service'', 1992 SCLR 504&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanmitchell.info/uploads/Judicialreview.pdf|title=Introduction to Judicial Review in Scotland|last=Sutherland|first=Robert|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the leading case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardbuxton.co.uk/v3.0/node/47|title=cited the leading Scottish case, West v Secretary of State for Scotland 1992 SC 385|last=Lord MacFadyen|date=23 April 1999|publisher=Richard Buxton Solicitors|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[judicial review in Scotland]] and sets out in detail the present law. It sets a contrast to the position on [[judicial review in England]].

The petitioner complained that on being moved from his employment at one prison to another, he had been told that his moving expenses would be paid, but that they were not. The respondent said that the terms of his employment were that he was to be mobile, and that as a Crown employee his terms of employment were variable at the instance of the crown. 
Held: Wherever there is an excess or abuse of the power or jurisdiction which has been conferred on a decision-maker, the Court of Session has the power to correct it.

==Judgment==
The [[Court of Session]] held that does not require that the decision complained should have any [[public law]] element in order to be reviewable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… the Court of Session has power, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, to regulate the process by which decisions are taken by any person or body to whom a jurisdiction, power or authority has been delegated or entrusted by statute, agreement or any other instrument &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The public or private nature of the inferior body or tribunal is not decisive, nor is it necessary to enquire whether the decision of the inferior body or tribunal is administrative in character. The essential point is that a decision-making function has been entrusted to that body or tribunal which it can be compelled by the court to perform… The essential feature of all these cases is the conferring, whether by statute or private contract, of a decision-making power or duty on a third party to whom the taking of the decision is entrusted but whose manner of decision-making may be controlled by the court.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;[''per'' Lord President Hope at page 650, emphasis added].

Crucially, in [[Scots administrative law]] the competency of an application to the supervisory jurisdiction

&lt;blockquote&gt;… does not depend upon any distinction between public law and private law, nor is it confined to those cases which English law has accepted as amenable to judicial review... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Significance==
The [[law of Scotland]] is different from the [[law of England]] on this matter: see, for England, ''[[R v Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of Great Britain ex parte Wachmann]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 1 WLR 1036&lt;/ref&gt; in which Simon Brown J held that a decision of the Chief Rabbi to terminate a rabbi’s employment was not reviewable: to attract the court’s supervisory jurisdiction, there must be ‘not merely a public but ''potentially a governmental interest in the decision-making power in question''.’ [at page 1046, emphasis added].

'''''What Bird is That? A Guide to the Birds of Australia''''' is a book first published in 1931 by [[Angus &amp; Robertson]] in [[Sydney]].  Authored and illustrated by [[Neville William Cayley]], it was Australia’s first fully illustrated national [[field guide]] to birds, a function it served alone for nearly 40 years. In 1960 it was rated the all-time [[bestseller|best seller]] in Australian [[natural history]].

==Beginnings==
''What Bird Is That?'' was originally published in [[octavo]] format (239 x 158&amp;nbsp;mm), containing 340 pages bound in green [[buckram]], with a [[dust jacket]] illustrated with a painting of a [[laughing kookaburra]] seated on and within a large red [[question mark]]. It contains 36 coloured plates of paintings of Australian birds by the author, as well as several [[black-and-white]] photographic plates of habitat. There were numerous reprints and revised editions in various formats produced well into the 1980s.

The first edition was sponsored by the [[Gould League|Gould League of Bird Lovers of New South Wales]] of which Cayley was a Council member. In return for its sponsorship, Cayley offered the Gould League four tenths of his 10% book royalty. However, initial sales were slow and in 1935 he sold his entire share to the League for £300.&lt;ref&gt;David Roberts, Peter and Tribe (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was extolled fulsomely by S.R. Thomas, of [[Department of Education and Communities (New South Wales)|the NSW Department of Education]], as follows;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''What Bird is That?'' is the most comprehensive and informative bird book published in the Commonwealth – if not in the world.  The coloured plates are a triumph not only of the genius and imagination of the artist – our own Neville Cayley on whom has fallen so fittingly the mantle of his famous father – but also of the block-maker’s and printer’s art.  The publishers have done nothing finer of its kind.

The life-like portrayals of our feathered friends, together with the succinct but compendious descriptive information, will place within easy reach of the bird lover, a most valuable ''[[vade mecum]]'' of bird and bush lore for out of doors as well as a thing of beauty for the library."&lt;ref&gt;Cayley (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cayley’s aim in creating this work was to make available a book that would encourage and help people to learn about and appreciate Australia’s remarkable and unique bird life. He saw and responded to a need for a simple book that was accessible to the non-specialist [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]]. Each species was illustrated in colour and the birds were organised according to their usual [[habitat]]. The accompanying text included brief notes on distribution, breeding and behaviour.

While initial sales were poor, history tells us that Cayley had accurately discerned a market need and successfully responded to it. During [[World War II|WWII]] sales accelerated and Cayley’s first collection, reprinted time and time again, eventually became a household name among birdwatchers and the book was recognised as an Australian classic.

The original sponsorship of ''What Bird is That?'' proved a great investment for the Gould League, who benefited from the sale of its numerous reprints and revised editions. By 1960, it was rated the all-time best seller in Australian natural history and is still in print today.

==Cayley's "big bird book"==
While sales and stature of Cayley’s original collection continued to grow, the prolific artist and [[ornithology|ornothologist]] Cayley was working on a much more ambitious project – his so-called “big bird book”. From about 1918, he was creating illustrations of subspecies, plumage stages and eggs (now lost) of all known [[Birds of Australia|Australian birds]]. The project was incomplete at the time of his death in 1950, although the illustrations were all but finished.

===1984 edition===
The ornithologist Terence Lindsey revived Cayley’s plans in the 1980s, creating the last and most significant revision of ''What Bird is That?'' It was published in 1984 and incorporated all of Cayley’s paintings created over many years for his vision of releasing a “big bird book” and included a revised [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. In the 53 years since its first edition, more than a hundred new bird species had been identified in Australia. [[Binomial nomenclature|Scientific names]] had been changed and groups of birds had been reordered. Lindsey brought ''What Bird is That?'' up-to-date with the latest birding conventions of the time, as well as contributing a valuable supplementary list of birds and a scholarly catalogue of Cayley’s paintings.

===2011 edition===
The ''Signature Edition What Bird is That?'' was published by Australia's Heritage Publishing in 2011, the latest release of Cayley’s “big bird book” complete with Lindsey’s revisions. It is 832 pages, features 769 birds and includes all 460 of Cayley’s full-colour paintings, many showing groups of related birds. New to this edition was an accompanying [[e-book]] ''What Bird Call is That?'', which identifies and illustrates 101 birds from ''What Bird is That?'', as well as providing sound files of each featured bird’s distinctive call. The sound files were provided by David Stewart.

==Popular culture==
''What Bird is That?'' plays a central role in Australian author Nick Earls' 1999 young adult novel ''[[48 Shades of Brown]]''. The 48 shades refers to the number of distinct browns used by Cayley to describe bird plumage colours.

'''William Sellers''' (September 19, 1824 – January 24, 1905) was a mechanical engineer, manufacturer, businessman, and inventor who filed more than 90 patents, most notably the design for the [[United States Standard thread|United States standard screw thread]].  As president of the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Sellers proposed the adoption of a system of screw threads which was easier for ordinary mechanics and machinists to cut than a similar design by [[Joseph Whitworth]]. For many years, he led the [[machine tool]] firm of '''William Sellers &amp; Co.''', which was a very influential [[machine tool builder]] during the latter half of the 19th century.

==Family==
Sellers was born in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania]] to John and Elizabeth (Poole) Sellers, into a [[Quaker]] family full of industrial and manufacturing innovators.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884 |author=Scharf, John Thomas and Thompson Westcott |publisher=L. H. Everts &amp; co. |year=1884 |pages=2263–2264 |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofphilade03scha#page/2264/mode/2up |accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His cousins include [[George Escol Sellers]] (1808–1899), an inventor holding patents for a hill-climbing locomotive, a pulp-paper process, converting steamboats to coal, and removing brine from salt water, and [[Coleman Sellers II]] (1827–1907), a five-term president of the Franklin Institute, who was instrumental in harnessing [[Niagara Falls]] for electricity.

Sellers was married  in 1849 to Mary Ferris (1820–1870), with whom he had three children, Katherine (1852–1917), William (1856–1933), and Frances (1858–1859).  He married again in 1873 to Amélie Haaszm (1842–1929), with whom he had another three children, Alexander (1875–1957), Richard (1881–1942), and Christine (1882–-1884). He died in his hometown on January 24, 1905 at the age of 81.

==Career==
[[File:William Sellers and Co.png|thumb|William Sellers &amp; Co.&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue, Hamilton, 16th and 17th Streets]]
After receiving a private education in a family-run school, he began apprenticing at age fourteen with his uncle, J. Morton Poole, in a machine shop near [[Wilmington, Delaware]].  After seven years, he moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to run the shops of what eventually became the [[Corliss Steam Engine]] Company. Returning to West Philadelphia to start his own machine company, he eventually formed a partnership with his brother-in-law Edward Bancroft (1811–1855) in 1848. After Bancroft's death in 1855, Sellers incorporated as William Sellers &amp; Co., which continued to operate until 1947 when it was sold to the Consolidated Machine Tool Corporation and relocated to [[Rochester, New York]].

In 1847 Sellers was elected a member of the Franklin Institute, where he served as a member of the Board of Managers from 1857 to 1861 and again from 1864 to 1892, and as president from 1864 to 1867.
At a meeting on September 15, 1864, he presented a uniform system of screw threads which with its angle and its flat top and bottom differed from Whitworth's British standard. Within a few years, the system had been adopted by the government workshops, leading railroad companies, prominent machine tool builders and others, under the various names of the United States, Sellers, or Franklin Institute Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1767">The '''Zagreb Points''' ({{lang-hr|Zagrebačke punktacije}}) was the name of a resolution released on November 7, 1932, in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] which condemned Serb hegemony in that country and called for a return to political life as it was in 1918.

The document was released after the [[January 6th Dictatorship]] of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] resulted in new administrative subdivisions and a new royal constitution. It had the backing of the [[Croatian Peasant Party|Peasant]]-[[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Democrat]] Coalition and the [[Party of Rights]]. The document resulted in other parties producing the [[Novi Sad Points]], [[Sarajevo Points]] ([[Yugoslav Muslim Organization]]) and [[Ljubljana Points]] ([[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovene People's Party]]) to voice their demands for an end to the dictatorship. [[Croatian Peasant Party]] leader [[Vladko Maček]] was imprisoned for three years as a direct result of the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=66697|title=Zagrebačke punktacije|encyclopedia=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|language=hr|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
