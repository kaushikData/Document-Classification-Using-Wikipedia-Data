'''ASC Purple''' was a [[supercomputer]]  installed at the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, CA]]. The computer was a collaboration between [[IBM]] Corporation and Lawrence Livermore Lab. Announced November 19th, 2002, it was installed in July 2005 and decommissioned on November 10th, 2010. The contract for this computer along with the [[Blue Gene|Blue Gene/L]] supercomputer was worth US $290 million. As of November 2009, the computer ranked 66th on the [[TOP500]] supercomputer list.

It was a redundant ring of [[POWER5]] [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] servers. 196 of these machines were connected together. The system contained 12,544 POWER5 [[microprocessor]]s in total with 50 [[terabyte]]s of total memory and 2 [[petabyte]]s of total disk storage. The system ran IBM's [[AIX operating system|AIX]] 5L [[operating system]]. The computer consumed 7.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] of electricity, including cooling. It has a theoretical processing speed of 100 [[Flops|teraflops]]. 

It was built as stage five of the [[Advanced Simulation and Computing Program]] (ASC) started by the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] to build a simulator to replace live [[nuclear weapon|WMD]] testing following the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|moratorium]] on testing started by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992 and extended by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Amodal perception''' is the [[perception]] of the whole of a physical structure when only parts of it affect the sensory receptors. For example, a table will be perceived as a complete volumetric structure even if only part of it—the facing surface—projects to the retina; it is perceived as possessing internal volume and hidden rear surfaces despite the fact that only the near surfaces are exposed to view. Similarly, the world around us is perceived as a surrounding plenum, even though only part of it is in view at any time. Another much quoted example is that of the "dog behind a picket fence" in which a long narrow object (the dog) is partially occluded by fence-posts in front of it, but is nevertheless perceived as a single continuous object. Albert Bregman noted an auditory analogue of this phenomenon: when a melody is interrupted by bursts of white noise, it is nonetheless heard as a single melody continuing "behind" the bursts of noise.

Formulation of the theory is credited to the [[Belgian]] psychologist [[Albert Michotte]] and [[Fabio Metelli]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] psychologist, with their work developed in recent years by [[E.S. Reed]] and the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestaltists]].

Modal completion is a similar phenomenon in which a shape is perceived to be occluding other shapes even when the shape itself is not drawn. Examples include the triangle that appears to be occluding three disks and an outlined triangle in the [[Kanizsa triangle]] and the circles and squares that appear in different versions of the [[Koffka cross]].

Humans are motivated to assign causes to their actions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G. B. (2005). Social cognition: Understanding self and others. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[social psychology]], '''attribution''' is the process by which individuals explain the causes of behavior and events. Models to explain this process are called '''attribution theory'''.&lt;ref name="social psy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kassin |last2=Fein |last3=Markus |title=Social Psychology |location=Wadsworth |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=Eighth international |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8400-3172-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological research into attribution began with the work of [[Fritz Heider]] in the early 20th century, and the theory was further advanced by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]].

==Background==
[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Fritz Heider]] is often described as the early-20th-century "father of attribution theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Catherine |title=Social Psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-25026-5 |page=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920s dissertation, Heider addressed the problem of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]]: why do perceivers attribute the properties such as color to perceived objects, when those properties are mental constructs? Heider's answer that perceivers attribute that which they "directly" sense – vibrations in the air for instance – to an object they construe as causing those sense data. "Perceivers faced with sensory data thus see the perceptual object as 'out there', because they attribute the sensory data to their underlying causes in the world."&lt;ref name=Malle&gt;{{cite book |last=Malle |first=Bertram F. |title=How the Mind Explains Behavior: Folk Explanations, Meaning, and Social Interaction |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-13445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

Heider extended this idea to attributions about people: "motives, intentions, sentiments&amp;nbsp;... the core processes which manifest themselves in overt behavior".&lt;ref name=Malle/&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

==Types==

===External===
External attribution, also called situational attribution, refers to interpreting someone's behavior as being caused by the situation that the individual is in. For example, if Jacob's car tire is punctured he may attribute that to a hole in the road; by making attributions to the poor condition of the highway, he can make sense of the event without any discomfort that it may in reality have been the result of his bad driving.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heider. F|year=1958|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|location=New York|publisher= Wiley|isbn=9780898592825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal===
The process of assigning the cause of behavior to some internal characteristic, rather than to outside forces.
This concept has overlap with the Locus of control, in which individuals feel they are personally responsible for everything that happens to them.

==Theories and models==

===Common sense psychology===
From the book ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations'' (1958), Fritz Heider tried to explore the nature of [[interpersonal relationship]], and espoused the concept of what he called "[[common sense]]" or "[[naïve psychology]]". In his theory, he believed that people observe, analyze, and explain behaviors with explanations. Although people have different kinds of explanations for the events of human behaviors, Heider found it is very useful to group explanation into two categories; Internal (personal) and external (situational) attributions.&lt;ref name=Lilien-1&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lilienfeld |first=Scott O. |last2=Lynn |first2=Steven Jay |last3=Namy |first3=Laura L. |last4=Woolf |first4=Nancy J. |title=Psychology: A Framework For Everyday Thinking |place= |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2010 |chapter=Social Psychology |page=380 |isbn=978-0-205-65048-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an internal attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the individual's characteristics such as ability, personality, mood, efforts, attitudes, or disposition. When an external attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the situation in which the behavior was seen such as the task, other people, or luck (that the individual producing the behavior did so because of the surrounding environment or the social situation). These two types lead to very different perceptions of the individual engaging in a behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |pages=106–108 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondent inference===
{{Main|Correspondent inference theory}}
Correspondent inferences state that people make inferences about a person when their actions are freely chosen, are unexpected, and result in a small number of desirable effects.&lt;ref name="social psy"/&gt; According to [[Edward E. Jones]] and Keith Davis' correspondent inference theory, people make correspondent inferences by reviewing the context of behavior. It describes how people try to find out individual's personal characteristics from the behavioral evidence. People make inferences on the basis of three factors; degree of choice, expectedness of behavior, and effects of someone's behaviors. For example, we believe we can make stronger&amp;nbsp;assumptions&amp;nbsp;about a man who gives half of his money to charity, than we can about one who gives $5 to charity. An average person would not want to donate as much as the first man because they would lose a lot of money. By donating half of his money, it is easier for someone to figure out what the first man's personality is like. The second factor, that affects correspondence of action and inferred characteristic, is the number of differences between the choices made and the previous alternatives. If there aren't many differences, the assumption made will match the action because it is easy to guess the important aspect between each choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lipe|first1=Marlys G|title=Counterfactual reasoning as a framework for attribution theories|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=a455fc14-9779-4b61-91d9-828e8eff368b%40sessionmgr4010&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=1991-21263-001&amp;db=pdh|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covariation model===
{{Main|Covariation model}}
The covariation model states that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a behavior occurs and absent when it does not. Thus, the theory assumes that people make causal attributions in a rational, logical fashion, and that they assign the cause of an action to the factor that co-varies most closely with that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Harold H. |authorlink=Harold Kelley |chapter=Attribution Theory in Social Psychology |editor-first=David |editor-last=Levine |title=Nebraska Symposium on Motivation |location= |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |volume=15 |issue= |pages=192–238 |year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Kelley]]'s covariation model of attribution looks to three main types of information from which to make an attribution decision about an individual's behavior. The first is ''consensus information'', or information on how other people in the same situation and with the same stimulus behave. The second is ''distinctive information'', or how the individual responds to different stimuli. The third is ''consistency information'', or how frequent the individual's behavior can be observed with similar stimulus but varied situations. From these three sources of information observers make attribution decisions on the individual's behavior as either internal or external. There have been claims that people under-utilise consensus information, although there has been some dispute over this.&lt;ref name="Attribution Theory"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Attribution Theory|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/attribution-theory.html|website=Simply Psychology|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several levels in the covariation model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus is when many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus is when very few people can agree. High distinctiveness is when the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness is when the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency is when the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency is when the event or area of interest goes away quickly.&lt;ref name="Attribution Theory"/&gt;

===Three-dimensional model===
[[Bernard Weiner]] proposed that individuals have initial affective responses to the potential consequences of the intrinsic or extrinsic motives of the actor, which in turn influence future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiner |first=B. |year=1992 |title=Human Motivation: Metaphors, Theories and Research |location=Newbury Park, CA |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=0-7619-0491-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a person's own perceptions or attributions as to why they succeeded or failed at an activity determine the amount of effort the person will engage in activities in the future. Weiner suggests that individuals exert their attribution search and cognitively evaluate casual properties on the behaviors they experience. When attributions lead to positive affect and high expectancy of future success, such attributions should result in greater willingness to approach to similar achievement tasks in the future than those attributions that produce negative affect and low expectancy of future success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munton |last2=Silvester |last3=Stratton |last4=Hanks |title=Attributions in Action |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-98216-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, such affective and cognitive assessment influences future behavior when individuals encounter similar situations.

Weiner's achievement attribution has three categories:
# stable theory (stable and unstable)
# [[locus of control]] (internal and external)
# controllability (controllable or uncontrollable)

Stability influences individuals' expectancy about their future; control is related with individuals' persistence on mission; causality influences emotional responses to the outcome of task.

==Bias and errors==
While people strive to find reasons for behaviors, they fall into many traps of biases and errors. As Fritz Heider says, "our perceptions of causality are often distorted by our needs and certain [[cognitive biases]]".&lt;ref name="social"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Donelson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher=Brooks/Cole |year=1987 |isbn=0-534-06744-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of attributional biases.

===Fundamental attribution error===
{{Main|Fundamental attribution error}}
The fundamental attribution error describes the habit to misunderstand dispositional or personality-based explanations for behavior, rather than considering external factors. The fundamental attribution error is most visible when people explain and assume the behavior of others. For example, if a person is overweight, a person's first assumption might be that they have a problem with overeating or are lazy and not that they might have a medical reason for being heavier set.&lt;ref name="Social Psychology Textbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Catherine |title=Social Psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-25026-5 |page=118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When evaluating others' behaviors, the situational context is often ignored in favor of the disposition of the actor to be the cause of an observed behavior. This is because when a behavior occurs attention is most often focused on the person performing the behavior.  Thus, the individual is more salient than the environment and dispositional attributions are made more often than situational attributions to explain the behavior of others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, when evaluating one's own behavior, the situational factors are often exaggerated when there is a negative outcome while dispositional factors are exaggerated when there is a positive outcome.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The core process assumptions of attitude construction models are mainstays of social cognition research and are not controversial—as long as we talk about "judgment". Once the particular judgment made can be thought of as a person's "attitude", however, construal assumptions elicit discomfort, presumably because they dispense with the intuitively appealing attitude concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwarz |first=N. |year=2006 |title=Attitude Research: Between Ockham's Razor and the Fundamental Attribution Error |journal=[[Journal of Consumer Research]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=19–21 |doi=10.1086/504124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture bias===
{{Main|Culture bias}}
Culture bias is when someone makes an assumption about the behavior of a person based on their cultural practices and beliefs. People in [[individualist]] cultures, generally [[Anglo-America]] and Anglo-Saxon European societies, value individuals, personal goals, and independence. People in [[collectivist]] cultures see individuals as members of groups such as families, tribes, work units, and nations, and tend to value conformity and interdependence. In other words, working together and being involved as a group is more common in certain cultures that views each person as a part of the community. This cultural trait is common in Asia, traditional Native American societies, and Africa. Research shows that culture, either individualist or collectivist, affects how people make attributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hongyin Wang |script-title=zh:跨文化心理学导论 |trans-title=Introduction to the Cross-Culture Psychology |location= |publisher=Shanxi Normal University Press |year=1993 |isbn=7-5613-0864-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from individualist cultures are more inclined to make fundamental-attribution error than people from collectivist cultures. Individualist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior due to their internal factors whereas collectivist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior to his external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perrius|first1=Chris|title=Individualism, collectivism, and attribution|url=https://blog.nationalequityproject.org/2011/03/11/individualism-collectivism-and-attribution/|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that individualist cultures engage in [[self-serving bias]] more than do collectivist cultures, i.e. individualist cultures tend to attribute success to internal factors and to attribute failure to external factors. In contrast, collectivist cultures engage in the opposite of self-serving bias i.e. self-effacing bias, which is: attributing success to external factors and blaming failure on internal factors (the individual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual and Cultural Differences in Person Perception|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/socialpsychology/chapter/6-3-individual-and-cultural-differences-in-person-perception/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor/observer difference===
People tend to attribute other people's behaviors to their dispositional factors while attributing own actions to situational factors. In the same situation, people's attribution can differ depending on their role as actor or observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |last2=Nisbett |title=The Actor and the Observer: Divergent Perceptions of the Causes of Behavior |location=New York |publisher=General Learning Press |year=1971 |isbn=0-382-25026-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a person scores a low grade on a test, they find situational factors to justify the negative event such as saying that the teacher asked a question that he/she never went over in class. However, if another person scores poorly on a test, the person will attribute the results to internal factors such as laziness and inattentiveness in classes. The theory of the actor-observer bias was first developed by E. Jones and R. Nisbett  in 1971, whose explanation for the effect was that when we observe other people, we tend to focus on the person, whereas when we are actors, our attention is focused towards situational factors. The actor/observer bias is used less frequently with people one knows well such as friends and family since one knows how his/her close friends and family will behave in certain situation, leading him/her to think more about the external factors rather than internal factors.{{original research inline|date=February 2015}}

===Dispositional attributions===
{{Main|Dispositional attribution}}
Dispositional attribution is a tendency to attribute people's behaviors to their dispositions; that is, to their personality, character, and ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew |title= The ultimate attribution error: Extending Allport's cognitive analysis of prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=5|issue=4|year=1979 | pages=461–476 |doi=10.1177/014616727900500407 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248047301_The_Ultimate_Attribution_Error_Extending_Allport's_Cognitive_Analysis_of_Prejudice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, when a normally pleasant waiter is being rude to his/her customer, the customer may assume he/she has a bad temper. The customer, just by looking at the attitude that the waiter is giving him/her, instantly decides that the waiter is a bad person. The customer oversimplifies the situation by not taking into account all the unfortunate events that might have happened to the waiter which made him/her become rude at that moment. Therefore, the customer made dispositional attribution by attributing the waiter's behavior directly to his/her personality rather than considering situational factors that might have caused the whole "rudeness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |last2=Folkes |title=Attribution Theory: Applications to Achievement, Mental Health, and Interpersonal Conflict |location= |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1990 |isbn=0-8058-0531-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
Self-serving bias is attributing dispositional and internal factors for success, while external and uncontrollable factors are used to explain the reason for failure. For example, if a person gets promoted, it is because of his/her ability and competence whereas if he/she does not get promoted, it is because his/her manager does not like him/her (external, uncontrollable factor). Originally, researchers assumed that self-serving bias is strongly related to the fact that people want to protect their self-esteem.  However, an alternative information processing explanation is that when the outcomes match people's expectations, they make attributions to internal factors. For example, if you pass a test you believe it was  because of your intelligence; when the outcome does not match their expectations, they make external attributions or excuses. Whereas if you fail a test, you would give an excuse saying that you did not have enough time to study.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; People also use defensive attribution to avoid feelings of vulnerability and to differentiate themselves from a victim of a tragic accident.&lt;ref name="Shaver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaver |first=Kelly G. |title=Defensive Attribution: Effects of Severity and Relevance on the Responsibility Assigned for an Accident |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=1970 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–113 |doi=10.1037/h0028777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative version of the theory of self-serving bias states that the bias does not arise because people wish to protect their private self-esteem, but to protect their self-image (a self-presentational bias). This version of the theory would predict that people attribute their successes to situational factors, for fear that others will disapprove of them looking overly vain if they should attribute successes to themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

For example, it is [[just-world hypothesis|suggested]] that coming to believe that "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people" will reduce feelings of vulnerability {{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}. This belief would have side-effects of [[blaming the victim]] even in tragic situations.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; When a mudslide destroys several houses in a rural neighborhood, a person living in a more urban setting might blame the victims for choosing to live in a certain area or not building a safer, stronger house. Another example of attributional bias is [[optimism bias]] in which most people believe positive events happen to them more often than to  others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. For example, smokers on average believe they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.&lt;ref name="Roesch and Amirkham, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roesch |last2=Amirkham |title= Boundary Conditions for Self-serving Attributions: Another Look at the Sports Pages |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |location= |publisher=  |year=1997 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=245–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb00631.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229546801_Boundary_Conditions_for_Self-serving_Attributions_Another_Look_at_the_Sports_Pages1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive attribution hypothesis===
{{Main|Defensive attribution hypothesis}}
The defensive attribution hypothesis is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] term referring to a set of beliefs held by an individual with the function of defending themselves from concern that they will be the cause or victim of a mishap. Commonly, defensive attributions are made when individuals witness or learn of a mishap happening to another person.  In these situations, attributions of responsibility to the victim or harm-doer for the mishap will depend upon the severity of the outcomes of the mishap and the level of personal and situational similarity between the individual and victim.  More responsibility will be attributed to the harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe, and as personal or situational similarity decreases.&lt;ref name="Shaver" /&gt;

An example of defensive attribution is the [[just-world hypothesis]], which is where "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people". People believe in this in order to avoid feeling vulnerable to situations that they have no control over. However, this also leads to blaming the victim even in a tragic situation.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; When people hear someone died from a car accident, they decide that the driver was drunk at the time of the accident, and so they reassure themselves that an accident will never happen to them. Despite the fact there was no other information provided, people will automatically attribute that the accident was the driver's fault due to an internal factor (in this case, deciding to drive while drunk), and thus they would not allow it to happen to themselves.

Another example of defensive attribution is [[optimism bias]], in which people believe positive events happen to them more often than to others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. Too much optimism leads people to ignore some warnings and precautions given to them. For example, smokers believe that they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.&lt;ref name="Roesch and Amirkham, 1997"/&gt;

==Application==

Attribution theory can be applied to juror decision making. Jurors use attributions to explain the cause of the defendant's intent and actions related to the criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moskowitz, G. B.|year=2005|title=Social cognition: Understanding self and others|location=New York, NY|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781593850852}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attribution made (situational or dispositional) might affect a juror's punitiveness towards the defendant.&lt;ref name=Sommers&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sommers, S. R.|author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Race in the courtroom: Perceptions of guilt and dispositional attributions|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=26|issue=11|pages=1367–1379|doi=10.1177/0146167200263005|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/sommersLab/documents/raceRealSommersEllsworth2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When jurors attribute a defendant's behavior to dispositional attributions they tend to be more punitive and are more likely find a defendant guilty&lt;ref name=Sommers/&gt; and to recommend a death sentence compared to a life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cochran, J. K.|author2=Boots, D. P.|author3=Heide, K.

==In clinical psychology==

Attribution theory has had a big application in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Antaki, C.|editor2=Brewin, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=Attributions and psychological change: Applications of attributional theories to clinical and educational practice|location=London|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale developed a theory of the depressive attributional style, claiming that individuals who tend to attribute their failures to internal, stable and global factors are more vulnerable to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abramson, L. Y.|author2=Seligman, M. E.|author3=Teasdale, J. D. |lastauthoramp=y|year=1978|title=Learned helplessness in humans: critique and reformulation|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=87|issue=1|pages=49–74|pmid=649856|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ef52/775276f83a46162a9b364335d9ee5ee73b99.pdf|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) has been developed to assess whether individuals have the depressogenic attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peterson, C.|author2=Semmel, A.|author3=Von Baeyer, C.|author4=Abramson, L. Y.|author5=Metalsky, G. I.|author6=Seligman, M. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=The attributional style questionnaire|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=6|issue=3|pages=287–299|doi=10.1007/BF01173577}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ASQ has been criticized, with some researchers preferring to use a technique called Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE) in which an individual's ordinary writings are analysed to assess whether s/he is vulnerable to the depressive attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schulman, P.|author2=Castellon, C.|author3=Seligman, M. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1989|title=Assessing explanatory style: The content analysis of verbatim explanations and the attributional style questionnaire|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=27|issue=5|pages=505–509|pmid=2818415|url=https://diamitch.home.xs4all.nl/artikels%20reveraat/science.pdf|doi=10.1016/0005-7967(89)90084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned helplessness===
{{Main|Learned helplessness}}
The concept of learned helplessness emerged from animal research in which psychologists [[Martin Seligman]] and Steven F. Maier discovered that dogs classically conditioned to an electrical shock which they could not escape, subsequently failed to attempt to escape an avoidable shock in a similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maier |last2=Seligman |title=Learned Helplessness: Theory and Evidence |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=3–46 |year=1976 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.105.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that learned helplessness applied to human psychopathology. In particular, individuals who [[Explanatory style|attribute]] negative outcomes to internal, stable and global factors reflect a view in which they have no control over their situation. It is suggested that this aspect of not attempting to better a situation exacerbates negative mood, and may lead to clinical depression and related mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=Martin |title=Helplessness: On Depression, Development, and Death |publisher=Freeman/Times Books/Henry Holt &amp; Co |year=1975 |isbn=0-7167-0752-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual salience==
{{Main|Perceptual salience}}
When people try to make attributions about another's behavior, their information focuses on the individual. Their perception of that individual is lacking most of the external factors which might affect the individual. The gaps tend to be skipped over and the attribution is made based on the perception information most salient. The most salient perceptual information dominates a person's perception of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |pages=113–114 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals making behavioral attributions about themselves, the situation and external environment are entirely salient, but their own body and behavior are less so. This leads to the tendency to make an external attribution in regard to their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huffman |title=Psychology in Action |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |page=622 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Attribution theory has been criticised as being mechanistic and [[reductionist]] for assuming that people are rational, logical, and systematic thinkers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The fundamental attribution error, however, demonstrates that they are [[cognitive miser]]s and [[motivated tactician]]. It also fails to address the social, cultural, and historical factors that shape attributions of cause. This has been addressed extensively by [[discourse analysis]], a branch of psychology that prefers to use qualitative methods including the use of language to understand psychological phenomena. The [[linguistic categorization theory]] for example demonstrates how language influences our attribution style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23283">'''Category utility''' is a measure of "category goodness" defined in {{Harvtxt|Gluck|Corter|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Corter|Gluck|1992}}. It attempts to maximize both the probability that two objects in the same category have attribute values in common, and the probability that objects from different categories have different attribute values. It was intended to supersede more limited measures of category goodness such as "[[cue validity]]" ({{Harvnb|Reed|1972}}; {{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}}) and "collocation index" {{Harv|Jones|1983}}. It provides a normative [[information-theoretic]] measure of the ''predictive advantage'' gained by the observer who possesses knowledge of the given category structure (i.e., the class labels of instances) over the observer who does ''not'' possess knowledge of the category structure.  In this sense the motivation for the ''category utility'' measure is similar to the [[Information gain in decision trees|information gain]] metric used in [[decision tree]] learning. In certain presentations, it is also formally equivalent to the [[mutual information]], as discussed below.  A review of ''category utility'' in its probabilistic incarnation, with applications to [[machine learning]], is provided in {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005|pp=260–262}}.

==Probability-theoretic definition of Category Utility==
The [[probability-theoretic]] definition of ''category utility'' given in {{Harvtxt|Fisher|1987}} and {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005}} is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
CU(C,F) = \tfrac{1}{p} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(c_j) \left [\sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik}|c_j)^2 - \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik})^2\right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt; is a size-&lt;math&gt;n\ &lt;/math&gt; set of &lt;math&gt;m\ &lt;/math&gt;-ary  features, and &lt;math&gt;C = \{c_j\} \ j=1 \ldots p&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;p\ &lt;/math&gt; categories.  The term  &lt;math&gt;p(f_{ik})\ &lt;/math&gt; designates the [[marginal probability]] that feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; takes on value &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt;, and the term  &lt;math&gt;p(f_{ik}|c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt; designates the category-[[conditional probability]] that feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; takes on value &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt; ''given'' that the object in question belongs to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt;.

The motivation and development of this expression for ''category utility'', and the role of the multiplicand &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tfrac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; as a crude overfitting control, is given in the above sources.  Loosely {{Harv|Fisher|1987}}, the term &lt;math&gt;\textstyle  p(c_j) \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik}|c_j)^2&lt;/math&gt; is  the expected number of attribute values that can be correctly guessed by an observer using a [[probability-matching]] strategy together with knowledge of the category labels, while &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p(c_j) \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik})^2&lt;/math&gt; is the expected number of attribute values that can be correctly guessed by an observer the same strategy but without any knowledge of the category labels.  Their difference therefore reflects the relative advantage accruing to the observer by having knowledge of the category structure.

== Information-theoretic definition of the Category Utility ==
The [[information-theoretic]] definition of ''category utility''  for a set of entities with size-&lt;math&gt;n\ &lt;/math&gt; binary feature set  &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;,  and a binary category  &lt;math&gt;C = \{c,\bar{c}\}&lt;/math&gt; is given in {{Harvtxt|Gluck|Corter|1985}} as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
CU(C,F) = \left [p(c) \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|c)\log p(f_i|c) + p(\bar{c}) \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|\bar{c})\log p(f_i|\bar{c}) \right ] - \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i)\log p(f_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(c)\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[prior probability]] of an entity belonging to the positive category &lt;math&gt;c\ &lt;/math&gt; (in the absence of any feature information), &lt;math&gt;p(f_i|c)\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional probability]] of an entity having feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; given that the entity belongs to category &lt;math&gt;c\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(f_i|\bar{c})&lt;/math&gt; is likewise the conditional probability of an entity having feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; given that the entity belongs to category &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p(f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt; is the prior probability of an entity possessing feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; (in the absence of any category information).

The intuition behind the above expression is as follows: The term  &lt;math&gt;p(c)\textstyle  \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|c)\log p(f_i|c)&lt;/math&gt; represents the cost (in bits) of optimally encoding (or transmitting) feature information when it known that the objects to be described belong to category &lt;math&gt;c\ &lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, the term  &lt;math&gt;p(\bar{c})\textstyle  \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|\bar{c})\log p(f_i|\bar{c})&lt;/math&gt; represents the cost (in bits) of optimally encoding (or transmitting) feature information when it known that the objects to be described belong to  category &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt;.  The sum of these two terms in the brackets is therefore the [[weighted average]] of these two costs.  The  final term, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle  \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i)\log p(f_i)&lt;/math&gt;, represents the cost (in bits) of optimally encoding (or transmitting) feature information when no category information is available.  The value of the ''category utility'' will, in the above formulation, be negative (???).

=== Category Utility and Mutual Information ===
It is mentioned in {{Harvtxt|Gluck|Corter|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Corter|Gluck|1992}} that the category utility is equivalent to the [[mutual information]].  Here we provide a simple demonstration of the nature of this equivalence.  Let us assume a set of entities each having the same &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;  features, i.e.,  feature set &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;, with each feature variable having cardinality  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. That is, each feature has the capacity to adopt any of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; distinct values (which need ''not'' be ordered; all variables can be nominal); for the special case &lt;math&gt;m=2&lt;/math&gt; these features would be considered ''binary'', but more generally, for any &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, the features are simply ''m-ary''.  For our purposes, without loss of generality, we can replace feature set &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with a single aggregate variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; that has cardinality &lt;math&gt;m^n&lt;/math&gt;, and adopts a unique value &lt;math&gt;v_i, \ i=1 \ldots m^n&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to each feature combination in the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\otimes F&lt;/math&gt;.  (Ordinality does ''not'' matter, because the mutual information is not sensitive to ordinality.)  In what follows, a term such as &lt;math&gt;p(F_a=v_i)&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;p(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the [[probability]] with which &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; adopts the particular value &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;.  (Using the aggregate feature variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; replaces multiple summations, and simplifies the presentation to follow.)

We assume also a single category  variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, which has cardinality &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to a classification system in which there are &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; non-intersecting categories.  In the special case of &lt;math&gt;p=2&lt;/math&gt; we have the two-category case discussed above.  From the definition of [[mutual information]] for discrete variables, the mutual information &lt;math&gt;I(F_a;C)&lt;/math&gt; between the aggregate feature variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; and the category variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; 
I(F_a;C) = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j) \log \frac{p(v_i,c_j)}{p(v_i)\,p(c_j)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[prior probability]] of feature variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; adopting value &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(c_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal probability]] of category variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; adopting value &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p(v_i,c_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[joint probability]] of variables &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; simultaneously adopting those respective values.  In terms of the conditional probabilities this can be re-written (or defined) as

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
I(F_a;C) &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j) \log \frac{p(v_i|c_j)}{p(v_i)} \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \left [\log p(v_i|c_j)- \log p(v_i) \right ] \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i) \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j) \log p(v_i) \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \log p(v_i) \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j)  \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} p(v_i) \log p(v_i)   \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we will rewrite the original [[Category utility#Definition of the Category Utility|definition of the category utility]] from above, with &lt;math&gt;C = \{c,\bar{c}\}&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
CU(C,F) = \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{c_j \in C}   p(f_i|c_j) p(c_j) \log p(f_i|c_j) - \sum_{f_i \in F} p(f_i) \log p(f_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation clearly has the same '''form''' as the (&lt;span style=color:blue;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;) equation expressing the mutual information between the feature set and the category variable; the difference is that the sum &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{f_i \in F}&lt;/math&gt; in the ''category utility'' equation  runs over independent binary variables &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the sum &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{v_i \in F_a}&lt;/math&gt; in the mutual information runs over ''values'' of the single &lt;math&gt;m^n&lt;/math&gt;-ary variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt;.  The two measures are actually equivalent then ''only'' when the features &lt;math&gt;\{f_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, are ''independent'' (and assuming that terms in the sum corresponding to &lt;math&gt;p(\bar{f_i})&lt;/math&gt; are also added).

== Insensitivity of category utility to ordinality ==
Like the [[mutual information]], the ''category utility'' is not sensitive to any ''ordering'' in the feature or category variable values.  That is, as far as the ''category utility'' is concerned, the category set &lt;code&gt;{small,medium,large,jumbo}&lt;/code&gt; is not qualitatively different from the category set &lt;code&gt;{desk,fish,tree,mop}&lt;/code&gt; since the formulation of the ''category utility'' does not account for any ordering of the class variable.  Similarly, a feature variable adopting values &lt;code&gt;{1,2,3,4,5}&lt;/code&gt; is not qualitatively different from a feature variable adopting values &lt;code&gt;{fred,joe,bob,sue,elaine}&lt;/code&gt;.  As far as the ''category utility'' or  ''mutual information'' are concerned, ''all'' category and feature variables are ''nominal variables.''  For this reason, ''category utility'' does not reflect any ''[[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]'' aspects of "category goodness" that might be based on such ordering effects.  One possible adjustment for this insensitivity to ordinality is given by the weighting scheme described in the article for [[mutual information]].

== Category "goodness": Models and Philosophy==
This section provides some background on the origins of, and need for, formal measures of "category goodness" such as the ''category utility'', and some of the history that lead to the development of this particular metric.

===What makes a good category?===
At least since the time of [[Aristotle]] there has been a tremendous fascination in philosophy with the nature of [[concept]]s and [[universals]].  What kind of ''entity'' is a concept such as "horse"?  Such abstractions do not designate any particular individual in the world, and yet we can scarcely imagine being able to comprehend the world without their use.  Does the concept "horse" therefore have an independent existence outside of the mind?  If it does, then what is the locus of this independent existence?  The question of locus was an important  issue on which the classical schools of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] famously differed.  However, they remained  in agreement that universals  ''did'' indeed have a mind-independent existence. There was, therefore, always a ''fact to the matter'' about which concepts and universals exist in the world.

In the late [[Middle Ages]] (perhaps beginning with [[William of Ockham|Occam]], although [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] also makes a much earlier remark indicating a certain discomfort with the status quo), however, the certainty that existed on this issue  began to erode, and it became acceptable among the so-called [[nominalists]] and [[empiricists]] to consider concepts and universals as strictly mental entities or conventions of language.  On this view of concepts—that they are purely representational constructs—a new question then comes to the fore: ''Why do we possess one set of concepts rather than another?''  What makes one set of concepts "good" and another set of concepts "bad"?  This is a question that modern philosophers, and subsequently [[machine learning]] theorists and cognitive scientists, have struggled with for many decades.

===What purpose do concepts serve?===
One approach to answering such questions is to investigate the "role" or "purpose" of concepts in cognition.  Thus, we ask: ''What are concepts good for in the first place?''  The answer provided by {{Harvtxt|Mill|1843/1936|p=425}} and many others is that classification (conception) is a precursor to ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'':   By imposing a particular categorization on the universe, an organism gains the ability to deal with physically non-identical objects or situations in an identical fashion, thereby gaining substantial predictive leverage  ({{Harvnb|Smith|Medin|1981}};{{Harvnb|Harnad|2005}}). As [[J.S. Mill]] puts it {{Harv|Mill|1843/1936|pp=466–468}},

{{quotation|The general problem of classification... [is] to provide that things shall be thought of in such groups, and those groups in such an order, as will best conduce to the remembrance and to the ascertainment of their laws... [and] one of the uses of such a classification that by drawing attention to the properties on which it is founded, and which, if the classification be good, are marks of many others, it facilitates the discovery of those others.}}

From this base, [[J.S. Mill|Mill]] reaches the following conclusion, which foreshadows much subsequent thinking about category goodness, including the notion of ''category utility'':

{{quotation|The ends of scientific classification are best answered when the objects are formed into groups respecting which a greater number of general propositions can be made, and those propositions more important, than could be made respecting any other groups into which the same things could be distributed. The properties, therefore, according to which objects are classified should, if possible, be those which are causes of many other properties; or, at any rate, which are sure marks of them.}}

One may compare this to the "category utility hypothesis" proposed by {{Harvtxt|Corter|Gluck|1992}}: "A category is useful to the extent that it can be expected to improve the ability of a person to accurately predict the features of instances of that category."   Mill here seems to be suggesting that the best category structure is one in which object features (properties) are maximally informative about the object's class, and, simultaneously, the object class is maximally informative about the object's features.  In other words, a useful classification scheme is one in which we can use category knowledge to accurately infer object properties, and we can use property knowledge to accurately infer object classes.  One may also compare this idea to [[Aristotle]]'s criterion of ''counter-predication'' for definitional predicates, as well as to the notion of concepts described in [[formal concept analysis]].

===Attempts at formalization===
A variety of different measures have been suggested with an aim of formally capturing this notion of "category goodness,"  the best known of which is probably the "[[cue validity]]". Cue validity of a feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the conditional probability of the category given the feature ({{Harvnb|Reed|1972}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|1978}}), &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt;, or as the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate ({{Harvnb|Edgell|1993}};{{Harvnb|Kruschke|Johansen|1999}}), &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)-p(c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, these measures quantify only inference from feature to category (i.e., ''cue validity''), but not from category to feature, i.e., the ''category validity'' &lt;math&gt;p(f_i|c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;.  Also, while the cue validity was originally intended to account for the demonstrable appearance of ''[[basic categories]]'' in human cognition—categories of a particular level of generality that are evidently preferred by human learners—a number of major flaws in the cue validity quickly emerged in this regard ({{Harvnb|Jones|1983}};{{Harvnb|Murphy|1982}};{{Harvnb|Corter|Gluck|1992}}, and others).

One attempt to address both problems by simultaneously maximizing both feature validity and category validity was made by {{Harvtxt|Jones|1983}} in defining the "collocation index" as the product &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i) p(f_i|c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;, but this construction was  fairly ''ad hoc'' (see {{Harvnb|Corter|Gluck|1992}}).  The ''category utility'' was introduced as a more sophisticated  refinement of the cue validity, which attempts to more rigorously quantify the full inferential power of a class structure.  As shown above, on a certain view the category utility  is equivalent  to the [[mutual information]] between the feature variable and the category variable. It has been suggested that categories having the greatest overall  ''category utility'' are those that are not only those "best" in a normative sense, but also those human learners prefer to use, e.g., "basic" categories {{Harv|Corter|Gluck|1992}}.  Other related measures of category goodness are "cohesion" ({{Harvnb|Hanson|Bauer|1989}};{{Harvnb|Gennari|Langley|Fisher|1989}}) and "salience" {{Harv|Gennari|1989}}.

A '''chemical property''' is any of a material's properties that becomes evident during, or after, a [[chemical reaction]]; that is, any quality that can be established only by changing a substance's [[chemical substance|chemical identity]].&lt;ref&gt;William L. Masterton, Cecile N. Hurley, "Chemistry: Principles and Reactions", 6th edition. Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning, 2009, p.13 [https://books.google.com/books?id=teubNK-b2bsC&amp;pg=PT39 (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt; Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance; the substance's [[chemical structure|internal structure]] must be affected greatly for its chemical properties to be investigated. When a substance goes under a chemical reaction, the properties will change drastically, resulting in [[chemical change]]. However, a [[catalysis|catalytic]] property would also be a chemical property.

Chemical properties can be contrasted with [[physical properties]], which can be discerned without changing the substance's structure. However, for many properties within the scope of [[physical chemistry]], and other disciplines at the boundary between [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], the distinction may be a matter of researcher's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. [[Material properties]], both physical and chemical, can be viewed as [[supervenient]]; i.e., secondary to the underlying reality. Several layers of superveniency{{clarify|date=August 2012}} are possible.

Chemical properties can be used for building [[chemical classification]]s. They can also be useful to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances. [[Materials science]] will normally consider the chemical properties of a substance to guide its applications.

'''Crown sprouting''' is the ability of a [[plant]] to regenerate its [[shoot|shoot system]] after destruction (usually by fire) by activating dormant vegetative structures to produce regrowth from the [[root crown]] (the junction between the root and shoot portions of a plant).&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Sampson&lt;/ref&gt; These dormant structures take the form of [[lignotuber]]s or basal [[epicormic buds]]. Plant species that can accomplish crown sprouting are called '''crown resprouters''' (distinguishing them from [[Resprouter|stem or trunk resprouters]]) and, like them, are characteristic of fire-prone habitats such as [[chaparral]].&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knox, Kirsten J. E. |author2=Morrison, David A. | year = 2005 | title = Effects of inter-fire intervals on the reproductive output of resprouters and obligate seeders in the Proteaceae | journal = Austral Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–413 | doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01482.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to plant fire survival strategies that decrease the [[flammability]] of the plant, or by requiring heat to [[germinate]], crown sprouting allows for the total destruction of the above ground growth. Crown sprouting plants typically have extensive root systems in which they store nutrients allowing them to survive during fires and sprout afterwards. Early researchers suggested that crown sprouting species might lack species genetic diversity; however, research on [[Gondwana]]n shrubland{{Clarify|date=March 2011|reason=What is a "Gondwanan shrubland"?  The linked article of "Gondwana" does not mention it.}} suggests that crown sprouting species have similar genetic diversity to seed sprouters.&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Bond, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[genus|genera]], such as ''[[Arctostaphylos]]'' and ''[[Ceanothus]]'', have species that are both resprouters and not, both adapted to fire.

[[California Buckeye]], ''[[Aesculus californica]]'', is an example of a western United States tree which can regenerate from its root crown after a fire event, but can also regenerate by seed.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3737">'''[[DARPA|LifeLog]]''' was a project of the [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] of the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD). According to its bid solicitation pamphlet, it was to be "an [[ontology]]-based (sub)system that captures, stores, and makes accessible the flow of one person's experience in and interactions with the world in order to support a broad spectrum of associates/assistants and other system capabilities". The objective of the LifeLog concept was "to be able to trace the 'threads' of an individual's life in terms of events, states, and relationships", and it has the ability to "take in all of a subject's experience, from phone numbers dialed and e-mail messages viewed to every breath taken, step made and place gone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pentagon Explores a New Frontier In the World of Virtual Intelligence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/30/us/pentagon-explores-a-new-frontier-in-the-world-of-virtual-intelligence.html?src=pm&amp;gwh=C39232292790FE3ED00B94B118A98CA1&amp;gwt=pay|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=May 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and capabilities ==

LifeLog aimed to compile a massive electronic [[database]] of every activity and relationship a person engages in. This was to include credit card purchases, web sites visited, the content of telephone calls and e-mails sent and received, scans of faxes and postal mail sent and received, instant messages sent and received, books and magazines read, television and radio selections, physical location recorded via wearable GPS sensors, biomedical data captured through wearable sensors. The high level goal of this data logging was to identify "preferences, plans, goals, and other markers of intentionality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/PIP_03-30.html PIP 03-30] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030603173339/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/PIP_03-30.html |date=June 3, 2003 }}, DARPA's bid solicitation for LifeLog (now offline) at the [[Internet Archive]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The DARPA program was canceled in 2004 after criticism from civil libertarians concerning the [[privacy]] implications of the system. 

Generically, the term ''lifelog'' or ''flog'' is used to describe a storage system that can automatically and persistently record and archive some informational dimension of an object's (object lifelog) or user's (user lifelog) life experience in a particular data category.

News reports in the media described LifeLog as the "diary to end all diaries—a multimedia, digital record of everywhere you go and everything you see, hear, read, say and touch".&lt;ref name=usalifelog&gt;{{cite news|title=Your life at your fingertips — courtesy of the Pentagon|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2003-06-02-lifelog_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=20 December 2013|date=2 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to U.S. government officials, LifeLog is not connected with [[Total Information Awareness]].&lt;ref name=usalifelog/&gt;

[[File:Response surface metodology.jpg|thumb|Design of experiments with full [[factorial design]] (left), [[response surface]] with second-degree polynomial (right)]]

The '''design of experiments''' ('''DOE''', '''DOX''', or '''experimental design''') is the design of any task that aims to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The term is generally associated with [[experiments]] in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to the design of [[quasi-experiment]]s, in which [[naturalistic observation|natural]] conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.

In its simplest form, an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions, which is represented by one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]], also referred to as "input variables" or "predictor variables." The change in one or more independent variables is generally hypothesized to result in a change in one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]], also referred to as "output variables" or "response variables." The experimental design may also identify [[controlling for a variable|control variables]] that must be held constant to prevent external factors from affecting the results. Experimental design involves not only the selection of suitable independent, dependent, and control variables, but planning the delivery of the experiment under statistically optimal conditions given the constraints of available resources.  There are multiple approaches for determining the set of design points (unique combinations of the settings of the independent variables) to be used in the experiment.

Main concerns in experimental design include the establishment of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[Reproducibility|replicability]]. For example, these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the independent variable, reducing the risk of measurement error, and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of [[statistical power]] and [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]].

Correctly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering. Other applications include marketing and policy making.

==History==

===Systematic clinical trials===
{{original research|section|date=September 2015}}
{{primary sources|section|date=September 2015}}
In 1747, while serving as surgeon on [[HMS Salisbury (1746)|HMS ''Salisbury'']], [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]] carried out a systematic clinical trial to compare remedies for [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name="ADC1997"&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dunn | first =Peter | title =James Lind (1716-94) of Edinburgh and the treatment of scurvy  | journal =Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition | volume =76 | issue = 1| pages =64–65 | publisher =British Medical Journal Publishing Group | location =United Kingdom |date = January 1997| url =http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/76/1/F64 | doi = 10.1136/fn.76.1.F64| pmc =1720613 | accessdate =2009-01-17 | pmid=9059193}}&lt;/ref&gt; This systematic clinical trial constitutes a type of DOE.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{dubious|date=September 2015}}

Lind selected 12 men from the ship, all suffering from scurvy. Lind limited his subjects to men who "were as similar as I could have them," that is, he provided strict entry requirements to reduce extraneous variation. He divided them into six pairs, giving each pair  different supplements to their basic diet for two weeks. The treatments were all remedies that had been proposed:
*   A quart of cider every day.
*   Twenty five gutts (drops) of [[vitriol]] (sulphuric acid) three times a day upon an empty stomach.
*   One half-pint of seawater every day.
*   A mixture of garlic, mustard, and horseradish in a lump the size of a nutmeg.
*   Two spoonfuls of vinegar three times a day.
*   Two oranges and one lemon every day.

The citrus treatment stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one (cider) showed some effect of its treatment.  The remainder of the crew presumably served as a control, but Lind did not report results from any control (untreated) group.

===Statistical experiments, following Charles S. Peirce===
{{Main|Frequentist statistics}}
{{See also|Randomization}}
A theory of statistical inference was developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883), two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics.

===Sequences of experiments===
{{Main|Sequential analysis}}
{{See also|Multi-armed bandit problem|Gittins index|Optimal design}}
The use of a sequence of experiments, where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments, including the possible decision to stop experimenting, is within the scope of [[Sequential analysis]], a field that was pioneered&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, N.L. (1961). "Sequential analysis: a survey." ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', Series A. Vol. 124 (3), 372&amp;ndash;411. (pages 375&amp;ndash;376)&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Abraham Wald]] in the context of sequential tests of statistical hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, A. (1945) "Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses", [[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]], 16 (2), 117&amp;ndash;186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Chernoff]] wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs,&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt; while [[Minimisation (clinical trials)|adaptive designs]] have been surveyed by S. Zacks.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, S. (1996) "Adaptive Designs for Parametric Models". In: Ghosh, S. and Rao, C. R., (Eds) (1996). "Design and Analysis of Experiments," ''Handbook of Statistics'', Volume 13. North-Holland. {{ISBN|0-444-82061-2}}.  (pages 151&amp;ndash;180)&lt;/ref&gt; One specific type of sequential design is the "two-armed bandit", generalized to the [[multi-armed bandit]], on which early work was done by [[Herbert Robbins]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1952-09620-8 | last1 = Robbins | first1 = H. | year = 1952 | title = Some Aspects of the Sequential Design of Experiments | url = | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 527–535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisher's principles==

A methodology for designing experiments was proposed by [[Ronald Fisher]], in his innovative books: ''The Arrangement of Field Experiments'' (1926) and ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' (1935).  Much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods.  As a mundane example, he described how to test the [[lady tasting tea]] [[hypothesis]], that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. These methods have been broadly adapted in the physical and social sciences, are still used in [[agricultural engineering]] and differ from the design and analysis of [[computer experiment]]s.

;Comparison
:In some fields of study it is not possible to have independent measurements to a traceable [[Standard (metrology)|metrology standard]].  Comparisons between treatments are much more valuable and are usually preferable, and often compared against a [[scientific control]] or traditional treatment that acts as baseline.

;[[Randomization]]
:Random assignment is the process of assigning individuals at random to groups or to different groups in an experiment, so that each individual of the population has the same chance of becoming a participant in the study. The random assignment of individuals to groups (or conditions within a group) distinguishes a rigorous, "true" experiment from an observational study or "quasi-experiment".&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008), ''Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd edition)'', Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive body of mathematical theory that explores the consequences of making the allocation of units to treatments by means of some random mechanism (such as tables of random numbers, or the use of randomization devices such as playing cards or dice). Assigning units to treatments at random tends to mitigate [[confounding]], which makes effects due to factors other than the treatment to appear to result from the treatment.

:The risks associated with random allocation (such as having a serious imbalance in a key characteristic between a treatment group and a control group) are calculable and hence can be managed down to an acceptable level by using enough experimental units. However, if the population is divided into several subpopulations that somehow differ, and the research requires each subpopulation to be equal in size, stratified sampling can be used. In that way, the units in each subpopulation are randomized, but not the whole sample. The results of an experiment can be generalized reliably from the experimental units to a larger [[statistical population]] of units only if the experimental units are a [[Sampling (statistics)|random sample]] from the larger population; the probable error of such an extrapolation depends on the sample size, among other things.

;[[Replication (statistics)|Statistical replication]]
:Measurements are usually subject to variation and [[measurement uncertainty]]; thus they are repeated and full experiments are replicated to help identify the sources of variation, to better estimate the true effects of treatments, to further strengthen the experiment's reliability and validity, and to add to the existing knowledge of the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dr. Hani|title=Replication study|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/replication-study.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain conditions must be met before the replication of the experiment is commenced: the original research question has been published in a [[peer-review]]ed journal or widely cited, the researcher is independent of the original experiment, the researcher must first try to replicate the original findings using the original data, and the write-up should state that the study conducted is a replication study that tried to follow the original study as strictly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Burman|first=Leonard E.|title=A call for replication studies|url=http://pfr.sagepub.com|journal=[[Public Finance Review]] | volume=38 |accessdate=27 October 2011|author2=Robert W. Reed |author3=James Alm |pages=787–793|doi=10.1177/1091142110385210|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Blocking (statistics)|Blocking]]
:Blocking is the non-random arrangement of experimental units into groups (blocks/lots) consisting of units that are similar to one another. Blocking reduces known but irrelevant sources of variation between units and thus allows greater precision in the estimation of the source of variation under study.

;[[Orthogonality#Statistics.2C econometrics.2C and economics|Orthogonality]]
[[File:Factorial Design.svg|thumb|Example of orthogonal factorial design]]
:Orthogonality concerns the forms of comparison (contrasts) that can be legitimately and efficiently carried out. Contrasts can be represented by vectors and sets of orthogonal contrasts are uncorrelated and independently distributed if the data are normal. Because of this independence, each orthogonal treatment provides different information to the others. If there are ''T'' treatments and ''T'' – 1 orthogonal contrasts, all the information that can be captured from the experiment is obtainable from the set of contrasts.

;[[Factorial experiment]]s
:Use of factorial experiments instead of the one-factor-at-a-time method.  These are efficient at evaluating the effects and possible [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] of several factors (independent variables). Analysis of [[experiment]] design is built on the foundation of the [[analysis of variance]], a collection of models that partition the observed variance into components, according to what factors the experiment must estimate or test.

==Example==
[[File:Balance à tabac 1850.JPG|right|240px]]
This example is attributed to [[Harold Hotelling]].&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[[Herman Chernoff]], ''Sequential Analysis and Optimal Design'', [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] Monograph, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  It conveys some of the flavor of those aspects of the subject that involve combinatorial designs.

Weights of eight objects are measured using a [[pan balance]] and set of standard weights.  Each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan vs. any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium. Each measurement has a [[errors and residuals in statistics|random error]].  The average error is zero; the [[standard deviation]]s of the [[probability distribution]] of the errors is the same number σ on different weighings; errors on different weighings are [[statistical independence|independent]].  Denote the true weights by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_1, \dots, \theta_8.\,&lt;/math&gt;

We consider two different experiments:

# Weigh each object in one pan, with the other pan empty.  Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the measured weight of the object, for ''i'' = 1, ..., 8.
# Do the eight weighings according to the following schedule and let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the measured difference for ''i'' = 1, ..., 8:

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcc}
&amp; \text{left pan} &amp; \text{right pan} \\
\hline
\text{1st weighing:} &amp; 1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6\ 7\ 8 &amp; \text{(empty)} \\ 
\text{2nd:} &amp; 1\ 2\ 3\ 8\ &amp; 4\ 5\ 6\ 7 \\
\text{3rd:} &amp; 1\ 4\ 5\ 8\ &amp; 2\ 3\ 6\ 7 \\
\text{4th:} &amp; 1\ 6\ 7\ 8\ &amp; 2\ 3\ 4\ 5 \\
\text{5th:} &amp; 2\ 4\ 6\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 3\ 5\ 7 \\
\text{6th:} &amp; 2\ 5\ 7\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 3\ 4\ 6 \\
\text{7th:} &amp; 3\ 4\ 7\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 2\ 5\ 6 \\
\text{8th:} &amp; 3\ 5\ 6\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 2\ 4\ 7
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

: Then the estimated value of the weight ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is

:: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_1 = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + Y_4 - Y_5 - Y_6 - Y_7 - Y_8}{8}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Similar estimates can be found for the weights of the other items. For example

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\theta}_2 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 - Y_3 - Y_4 + Y_5 + Y_6 - Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_3 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 - Y_3 - Y_4 - Y_5 - Y_6 + Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_4 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_3 - Y_4 + Y_5 - Y_6 + Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_5 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_3 - Y_4 - Y_5 + Y_6 - Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_6 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 - Y_3 + Y_4 + Y_5 - Y_6 - Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_7 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 - Y_3 + Y_4 - Y_5 + Y_6 + Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_8 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + Y_4 + Y_5 + Y_6 + Y_7 + Y_8} 8.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The question of design of experiments is: which experiment is better?

The variance of the estimate ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if we use the first experiment.  But if we use the second experiment, the variance of the estimate given above is σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/8.  Thus the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item, and estimates all items simultaneously, with the same precision. What the second experiment achieves with eight would require 64 weighings if the items are weighed separately. However, note that the estimates for the items obtained in the second experiment have errors that correlate with each other.

Many problems of the design of experiments involve [[combinatorial design]]s, as in this example and others.&lt;ref name="yout_Howt"&gt;{{Cite web

==Avoiding false positives==
[[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are an inherent hazard in many fields. A good way to prevent biases potentially leading to false positives in the data collection phase is to use a double-blind design. When a double-blind design is used, participants are randomly assigned to experimental groups but the researcher is unaware of what participants belong to which group. Therefore, the researcher can not affect the participants' response to the intervention.  
Experimental designs with undisclosed degrees of freedom are a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Simmons| first = Joseph|author2=Leif Nelson |author3=Uri Simonsohn | title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359–1366| publisher = Association for Psychological Science| location = Washington DC| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate = 29 January 2012| pmid = 22006061}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  This can lead to conscious or unconscious "[[p-hacking]]": trying multiple things until you get the desired result.  It typically involves the manipulation - perhaps unconsciously - of the process of [[statistical analysis]] and the degrees of freedom until they return a figure below the p&lt;.05 level of statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate=2014-06-12 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  So the design of the experiment should include a clear statement proposing the analyses to be undertaken. P-hacking can be prevented by preregistering researches, in which researchers have to send their data analysis plan to the journal they wish to publish their paper in before they even start their data collection, so no data manipulation is possible (https://osf.io). Another way to prevent this is taking the double-blind design to the data-analysis phase, where the data are sent to a data-analyst unrelated to the research who scrambles up the data so there is no way to know which participants belong to before they are potentially taken away as outliers.

Clear and complete documentation of the experimental methodology is also important in order to support replication of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Discussion topics when setting up an experimental design==
An experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, Mellenberg &amp; Hand (2008) "Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion"&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Some of the following topics  have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section:

# How many factors does the design have, and are the levels of these factors fixed or random?
# Are control conditions needed, and what should they be?
# Manipulation checks; did the manipulation really work?
# What are the background variables?
# What is the sample size. How many units must be collected for the experiment to be generalisable and have enough [[Statistical power|power]]?
# What is the relevance of interactions between factors?
# What is the influence of delayed effects of substantive factors on outcomes?
# How do response shifts affect self-report measures?
# How feasible is repeated administration of the same measurement instruments to the same units at different occasions, with a post-test and follow-up tests?
# What about using a proxy pretest?
# Are there lurking variables?
# Should the client/patient, researcher or even the analyst of the data be blind to conditions?
# What is the feasibility of subsequent application of different conditions to the same units?
# How many of each control and noise factors should be taken into account?

The independent variable of a study often has many levels or different groups. In a true experiment, researchers can have an experimental group, which is where their intervention testing the hypothesis is implemented, and a control group, which has all the same element as the experimental group, without the interventional element. Thus, when everything else except for one intervention is held constant, researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change. In some instances, having a control group is not ethical. This is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups. In some cases, independent variables cannot be manipulated, for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease, or testing the difference between genders (obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to). In these cases, a quasi-experimental design may be used.

==Causal attributions==
In the pure experimental design, the independent (predictor) variable is manipulated by the researcher - that is - every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population, and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable. Only when this is done is it possible to certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the outcome variables are caused by the different conditions. Therefore, researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible. However, the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation. In those cases, researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn't allow for it. For example, in observational designs, participants are not assigned randomly to conditions, and so if there are differences found in outcome variables between conditions, it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes, that is - a third variable. The same goes for studies with correlational design. (Adér &amp; Mellenbergh, 2008).

==Statistical control==
It is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments.  When this is not possible, proper blocking, replication, and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Bisgaard, S (2008) "Must a Process be in Statistical Control before Conducting Designed Experiments?", ''Quality Engineering'', ASQ, 20 (2), pp 143 - 176&lt;/ref&gt;
To control for nuisance variables, researchers institute '''control checks''' as additional measures.  Investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences (e.g., source credibility perception) do not skew the findings of the study.  A [[manipulation checks|manipulation check]] is one example of a control check.  Manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned.

One of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of [[spurious relationship|spurious]], intervening, and [[antecedent variable]]s. In the most basic model, cause (X) leads to effect (Y). But there could be a third variable (Z) that influences (Y), and X might not be the true cause at all. Z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for. The same is true for [[intervening variable]]s (a variable in between the supposed cause (X) and the effect (Y)), and anteceding variables (a variable prior to the supposed cause (X) that is the true cause). When a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for, the relation is said to be a [[zero order (statistics)|zero order]] relationship. In most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes (X1, X2, X3). In most designs, only one of these causes is manipulated at a time.

==Experimental designs after Fisher==
Some efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by [[Raj Chandra Bose]] and K. Kishen in 1940 at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], but remained little known until the [[Plackett–Burman design]]s were published in ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1946. About the same time, [[C. R. Rao]] introduced the concepts of [[orthogonal array]]s as experimental designs. This concept played a central role in the development of [[Taguchi methods]] by [[Genichi Taguchi]], which took place during his visit to Indian Statistical Institute in early 1950s. His methods were successfully applied and adopted by Japanese and Indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by US industry albeit with some reservations.

In 1950, [[Gertrude Mary Cox]] and [[William Gemmell Cochran]] published the book ''Experimental Designs,'' which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.

Developments of the theory of [[linear model]]s have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers. Today, the theory rests on advanced topics in [[linear algebra]], [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design|combinatorics]].

As with other branches of statistics, experimental design is pursued using both [[frequentist statistics|frequentist]] and [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian]] approaches: In evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs, [[frequentist statistics]] studies the [[sampling distribution]] while [[Bayesian statistics]] updates a [[Bayesian probability|probability distribution]] on the parameter space.

Some important contributors to the field of experimental designs are [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]], [[R. A. Fisher]], [[Frank Yates|F. Yates]], [[C. R. Rao]], [[R. C. Bose]], [[Jagdish N. Srivastava|J. N. Srivastava]], [[Shrikhande S. S.]],  [[D. Raghavarao]], [[William G. Cochran|W. G. Cochran]], [[Oscar Kempthorne|O. Kempthorne]], W. T. Federer, V. V. Fedorov, A. S. Hedayat, [[John Nelder|J. A. Nelder]], [[Rosemary A. Bailey|R. A. Bailey]], [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|J. Kiefer]], W. J. Studden, A. Pázman, F. Pukelsheim, [[David R. Cox|D. R. Cox]], H. P. Wynn, A. C. Atkinson, [[G. E. P. Box]] and [[Genichi Taguchi|G. Taguchi]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The textbooks of D. Montgomery, R. Myers, and G. Box/W. Hunter/J.S.

==Human participant constraints==
Laws and ethical considerations preclude some carefully designed 
experiments with human subjects.  Legal constraints are dependent on 
[[Human subject research|jurisdiction]].  Constraints may involve 
[[institutional review board]]s, [[informed consent]] 
and [[confidentiality]] affecting both clinical (medical) trials and 
behavioral and social science experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of toxicology, for example, experimentation is performed 
on laboratory ''animals'' with the goal of defining safe exposure limits 
for ''humans''.&lt;ref&gt;

"... if no one knows which therapy is better, there is no ethical 
imperative to use one therapy or another." (p 380)  Regarding 
experimental design, "...it is clearly not ethical to place subjects 
at risk to collect data in a poorly designed study when this situation 
can be easily avoided...". (p 393)

'''Electric Time Company''', founded in 1928, is a manufacturer of [[tower clock|tower]] and [[street clock]]s marketed worldwide.

==History==
Electric Time Company was founded in 1928 and incorporated in the state of [[Massachusetts]] in 1932. It was founded by a salesman for the [[Self Winding Clock Company]] and [[Telechron]] of [[Ashland, Massachusetts]]. Originally part of [[Telechron]] it progressed from an office in Boston, Massachusetts to manufacturing facilities in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]; [[South Natick, Massachusetts]]; and, currently, a {{convert|50000|sqfoot|m2}} manufacturing facility in [[Medfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electrictime.com/history|title=About|author=|date=|work=electrictime.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Electric Time produces approximately 1000 clocks annually and is the largest maker of custom outdoor clocks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Electric Time Company Large Clock Manufacturer. 'Chronicle.' January 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric Time produces [[Clock tower|tower clocks]], post clocks, and [[bracket clock]]s.  Electric Time has many clock installations throughout the world, ranging from Brazil to Turkey to Europe.  Some notable installations are [[Wrigley Field]], [[Tiffany &amp; Co]], [[Disneyworld]], [[Disneyland]] and the [[Great American Ball Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundrysquare.biz/aboutTower.html|title=About the Clock Tower|author=|date=|work=foundrysquare.biz|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrostatics}}
'''Electric charge''' is the [[physical property]] of [[matter]] that causes it to experience a [[force]] when placed in an [[electromagnetic field]]. There are two types of electric charges; ''positive'' and ''negative'' (commonly carried by [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s respectively). Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as ''{{Visible anchor|neutral|neutral}}''. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called [[classical electrodynamics]], and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]]. 

Electric charge is a [[conservation law (physics)|conserved property]]; the net charge of an [[isolated system]], the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge, cannot change. Electric charge is carried by [[subatomic particle]]s. In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by [[electron]]s, and positive charge is carried by the [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[atom]]s. If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter, it will have a negative charge, if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. Charge is ''[[charge quantization|quantized]]''; it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the [[elementary charge]], ''e'', about {{val|1.602|e=-19|u=coulombs}},{{physconst|e|ref=only}} which is the smallest charge which can exist free (particles called [[quark]]s have smaller charges, multiples of {{sfrac|1|3}}''e'', but they are only found in combination, and always combine to form particles with integer charge). The [[proton]] has a charge of +''e'', and the [[electron]] has a charge of −''e''.

Electric charges create an [[electric field]], if they are moving they also generate a [[magnetic field]]. The combination of the electric and magnetic field is called the [[electromagnetic field]], and its interaction with charges is the source of the [[electromagnetic force]], which is one of the four [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in physics. The study of charged particles, and how their interactions are mediated by [[photons]], is called [[quantum electrodynamics]].

The [[SI derived unit]] of electric charge is the [[coulomb]] (C) named after  French physicist [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]]. In [[electrical engineering]], it is also common to use the [[ampere-hour]] (Ah); in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], it is common to use the elementary charge (''e'' as a unit). Chemistry also uses the [[Faraday constant]] as the charge on a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons. The symbol ''Q'' often denotes charge.

==Overview==
[[File:Electric field point lines equipotentials.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram showing field lines and [[equipotential]]s around an [[electron]], a negatively charged particle. In an electrically neutral [[atom]], the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons (which are positively charged), resulting in a net zero overall charge]]

Charge is the fundamental property of forms of matter that exhibit [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many [[charged particle|subatomic particles]]. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge ''e''; we say that electric charge is ''[[charge quantization|quantized]]''. [[Michael Faraday]], in his [[electrolysis]] experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. [[Robert Millikan]]'s [[oil drop experiment]] demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge. It has been discovered that one type of particle, [[quark]]s, have fractional charges of either −{{sfrac|1|3}} or +{{sfrac|2|3}}, but it is believed they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free-standing quarks have never been observed.

[[Convention (norm)|By convention]], the charge of an [[electron]] is negative, ''−e'', while that of a [[proton]] is positive, ''+e''. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. [[Coulomb's law]] quantifies the electrostatic [[force]] between two particles by asserting that the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and [[inverse-square law|inversely proportional to the square]] of the distance between them. The charge of an [[antiparticle]] equals that of the corresponding particle, but with opposite sign.

The electric charge of a [[macroscopic]] object is the sum of the electric charges of the particles that make it up. This charge is often small, because matter is made of [[atom]]s, and atoms typically have equal numbers of [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s, in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.

An ''[[ion]]'' is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). ''Monatomic ions'' are formed from single atoms, while ''polyatomic ions'' are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.

During formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral ''ionic compounds'' electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.

Sometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as [[static electricity]]. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing [[amber]] with [[fur]] or [[glass]] with [[silk]]. In this way non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of ''[[conservation of charge]]'' always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.

Even when an object's net charge is zero, charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external [[electromagnetic field]], or bound polar molecules). In such cases the object is said to be [[polarization density|polarized]]. The charge due to polarization is known as [[bound charge]], while charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called ''free charge''. The motion of electrons in conductive [[metal]]s in a specific direction is known as [[electric current]].

==Units==
The [[International System of Units|SI]] derived unit of [[quantity]] of electric charge is the [[coulomb]] (symbol: C). The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that passes through the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of an [[electrical conductor]] carrying one [[ampere]] for one [[second]].&lt;ref name=CIPM1946&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/1946/2/ |publisher=BIPM |title=CIPM, 1946: Resolution 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit was proposed in 1946 and ratified in 1948.&lt;ref name=CIPM1946/&gt; In modern practice, the phrase "amount of charge" is used instead of "quantity of charge".&lt;ref name=SIBrochure&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of charge in 1 electron ([[elementary charge]]) is approximately {{val|1.6|e=-19|u=C}}, and 1 coulomb corresponds to the amount of charge for about {{val|6.24|e=18|u=electrons}}. The symbol ''Q'' is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge. The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an [[electrometer]], or indirectly measured with a [[galvanometer|ballistic galvanometer]].

After finding the [[charge quantization|quantized]] character of charge, in 1891 [[George Johnstone Stoney|George Stoney]] proposed the unit 'electron' for this fundamental unit of electrical charge. This was before the discovery of the particle by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as {{em|elementary charge}}, {{em|fundamental unit of charge}}, or simply as {{em|e}}. A measure of charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge ''e'', even if at [[macroscopic scale|large scales]] charge seems to behave as a [[real number|real quantity]]. In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; for example in the charging of a [[capacitor]], or in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].

The unit [[Faraday constant|faraday]] is sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gambhir |first1=RS |last2=Banerjee |first2=D |last3=Durgapal |first3=MC |title=Foundations of Physics, Vol. 2 | date=1993 |publisher=Wiley Eastern Limited |location=New Dehli |page=51 |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=r-Qpy0KQayIC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. 96485.33289(59) C.

In systems of units other than SI such as [[cgs]], electric charge is expressed as combination of only three fundamental quantities (length, mass, and time), and not four, as in SI, where electric charge is a combination of length, mass, time, and electric current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From ancient times, persons were familiar with four types of phenomena that today would all be explained using the concept of electric charge: (a) [[lightning]], (b) the [[torpedo fish]] (or electric ray), (c) [[St Elmo's Fire]], and (d) that [[amber]] rubbed with [[fur]] would attract small, light objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1954 |title=The development of the concept of electric charge: Electricity from the Greeks to Coulomb |url= |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=1 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first account of the {{em|amber effect}} is often attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician [[Thales of Miletus]], who lived from c. 624 – c. 546 BC, but there are doubts about whether Thales left any writings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Grady |first=Patricia F. |date=2002 |title=Thales of Miletus: The Beginnings of Western Science and Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com?id=ZTUlDwAAQBAJ|location= |publisher=Ashgate |page=8 |isbn= 1351895370|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his account about amber is known from an account from early 200s.&lt;ref name=DL/&gt; This account can be taken as evidence that the phenomenon was known since at least c. 600 BC, but Thales explained this phenomenon as evidence for inanimate objects having a soul.&lt;ref name=DL&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_I#Thales_24 Lives of the Eminent Philosophers by Diogenes Laërtius, Book 1, §24]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there was no indication of any conception of electric charge. More generally, the ancient Greeks did not understand the connections among these four kinds of phenomena. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as [[hair]]. They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an [[electric spark]] to jump,{{citation needed|reason=cannot find any source for this claim|date=April 2018}} but there is also a claim that no mention of electric sparks appeared until late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1953 |journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=21|issue=5 |doi=10.1119/1.1933449|page=348|title=The Prenatal History of Electrical Science|bibcode=1953AmJPh..21..343R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property derives from the [[triboelectric effect]].
In late 1100s, the substance [[jet (lignite)|jet]], a compacted form of coal, was noted to have an amber effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1953 |journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=21|issue=5 |doi=10.1119/1.1933449|page=351|title=The Prenatal History of Electrical Science|bibcode=1953AmJPh..21..343R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the middle of the 1500s, [[Girolamo Fracastoro]], discovered that [[diamond]] also showed this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1953 |journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=21|issue=5 |doi=10.1119/1.1933449|page=353|title=The Prenatal History of Electrical Science|bibcode=1953AmJPh..21..343R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some efforts were made by Fracastoro and others, especially [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to develop explanations for this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Roller356&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1953 |journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=21|issue=5 |doi=10.1119/1.1933449|page=356|title=The Prenatal History of Electrical Science|bibcode=1953AmJPh..21..343R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[astronomy]], [[mechanics]], and [[optics]], which had been studied quantitatively since antiquity, the start of ongoing qualitative and quantitative research into electrical phenomena can be marked with the publication of ''[[De Magnete]]'' by the English scientist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roche|first1=J.J.|title=The mathematics of measurement|date=1998|publisher=The Athlone Press|location=London|isbn=0387915818|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, there was a small section where Gilbert returned to the amber effect (as he called it) in addressing many of the earlier theories&lt;ref name=Roller356/&gt;, and coined the [[New Latin]] word ''electrica'' (from {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} (ēlektron), the [[ancient Greek|Greek]] word for ''amber''). The Latin word was translated into English as {{em|electrics}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1954 |title=The development of the concept of electric charge: Electricity from the Greeks to Coulomb |url= |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=6–7 |isbn=}}&lt;br&gt;

Gilbert was followed in 1660 by [[Otto von Guericke]], who invented what was probably the first [[electrostatic generator]]. Other European pioneers were [[Robert Boyle]], who in 1675 stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a [[vacuum]]; [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], who in 1729 classified materials as [[electrical conductor|conductors]] and [[electrical insulation|insulators]]. In 1733 [[Charles François de Cisternay du Fay]], inspired by Gray's work, made a series of experiments (reported in ''Mémoires de l'[[Académie Royale des Sciences]]''), showing that more or less all substances could be 'electrified' by rubbing, except for metals and fluids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roller |first1=Duane |author-link1= |last2=Roller |first2=D.H.D.|date=1954 |title=The development of the concept of electric charge: Electricity from the Greeks to Coulomb |url= |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=40 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, which he expressed in terms of a two-fluid theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparkmuseum.com/BOOK_DUFAY.HTM Two Kinds of Electrical Fluid: Vitreous and Resinous – 1733.

It is arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative. Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a glass rod after being rubbed with silk.&lt;ref&gt;Roald K. Wangsness (1986) ''Electromagnetic Fields'' (2nd Ed.). Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-81186-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the foremost experts on electricity in the 18th century was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who argued in favour of a one-[[fluid theory of electricity]]. Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter; for example, he believed that it was the [[glass]] in a [[Leyden jar]] that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained too little of the fluid it was {{em|negatively}} charged, and when it had an excess it was {{em|positively}} charged. For a reason that was not recorded, he identified the term {{em|positive}} with vitreous electricity and {{em|negative}} with resinous electricity. [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] independently arrived at the same explanation at about the same time (1746).

It is now known that the Franklin–Watson model was fundamentally correct. There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge.&lt;ref name="one-kind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/one-kind-of-charge.htm |title=One Kind of Charge |last=Denker |first=John |date=2007 |website=www.av8n.com/physics |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205132208/http://www.av8n.com/physics/one-kind-of-charge.htm |archive-date=2016-02-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, just knowing the charge is not a complete description of the situation. Matter is composed of several kinds of electrically charged particles, and these particles have many properties, not just charge.

==The role of charge in electrostatics==
{{Confusing section|reason=section title was created in a guess about the intention of this paragraph, maybe this material needs two or more sections|date=April 2018}}
All bodies are electrified, but may appear not electrified because of the relatively similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment. An object further electrified + or – creates an equivalent or opposite charge by default in neighboring objects, until those charges can equalize. The effects of attraction can be observed in high-voltage experiments, while lower voltage effects are merely weaker and therefore less obvious. Coulomb's law has a corollary for acceleration in a gravitational field. See also [[Casimir effect]].

==The role of charge in static electricity==
[[Static electricity]] refers to the electric charge of an object and the related [[electrostatic discharge]] when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.

===Electrification by friction===
{{Further|Triboelectric effect}}
{{Close paraphrasing|section|source=https://archive.org/details/ATreatiseOnElectricityMagnetism-Volume1|free=yes|date=November 2014}}
When a piece of glass and a piece of resin—neither of which exhibit any electrical properties—are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated, they attract each other.

A second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these phenomena:
*The two pieces of glass repel each other.
*Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin.
*The two pieces of resin repel each other.

This attraction and repulsion is an ''electrical phenomenon'', and the bodies that exhibit them are said to be ''electrified'', or ''electrically charged''. Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by friction. The electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.

If a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to be ''vitreously'' electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be ''resinously'' electrified. All electrified bodies are either vitreously or resinously electrified.

An established convention in the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention—just as it is a matter of convention in [[mathematical diagram]] to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.

No force, either of attraction or of repulsion, can be observed between an electrified body and a body not electrified.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1891) ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', pp. 32–33, Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of charge in electric current==
[[Electric current]] is the flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge. The most common [[charge carriers]] are the positively charged [[proton]] and the negatively charged [[electron]]. The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak of the ''[[conventional current]]'' without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.

At the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an [[electric current]], including: a flow of electrons; a flow of electron [[electron hole|holes]] that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles ([[ion]]s or other charged particles) flowing in opposite directions in an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[solution]] or a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

Beware that, in the common and important case of metallic wires, the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the [[drift velocity]] of the actual charge carriers; i.e., the electrons. This is a source of confusion for beginners.

{{Flavour quantum numbers}}

==Conservation of electric charge==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Conservation law (physics) --&gt;
{{Main|Charge conservation}}
The total electric charge of an [[isolated system]] remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from [[gauge invariance]] of the [[wave function]]. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current [[continuity equation]]. More generally, the rate of change in [[charge density]] ''ρ'' within a volume of integration ''V'' is equal to the area integral over the [[current density]] '''J''' through the closed surface ''S'' = ∂''V'', which is in turn equal to the net [[electric current|current]] ''I'':
:{{oiint|preintegral=&lt;math&gt;- \frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho \, \mathrm{d}V = &lt;/math&gt;|intsubscpt=&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \partial V&lt;/math&gt;|integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J \cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf S = \int J \mathrm{d}S \cos\theta = I.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Thus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:
:&lt;math&gt;I = -\frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The charge transferred between times &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{f}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by integrating both sides:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \int_{t_{\mathrm{i}}}^{t_{\mathrm{f}}} I\, \mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the net outward current through a closed surface and ''Q'' is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.

==Relativistic invariance==
Aside from the properties described in articles about [[electromagnetism]], charge is a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[charge invariance|invariant]]. This means that any particle that has charge ''Q'', no matter how fast it goes, always has charge ''Q''. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of ''one'' [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) is the same as ''two'' [[deuterium]] nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/zna.1999.54.issue-10-11/zna-1999-10-1113/zna-1999-10-1113.pdf|title=Relativistic invariance of electric charge|last= Jefimenko |first=O.D.|date=1999|journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A |volume=54 |issue=10–11|pages= 637–644 |doi=10.1515/zna-1999-10-1113|access-date=11 April 2018|bibcode=1999ZNatA..54..637J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/248688/how-can-we-prove-charge-invariance-under-lorentz-transformation|title=How can we prove charge invariance under Lorentz Transformation?|website=physics.stackexchange.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1992|last=Singal|first=A.K.|title=On the charge invariance and relativistic electric fields from a steady conduction current|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019290982R|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=162|issue=2|pages=91–95|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(92)90982-R|issn=0375-9601|bibcode=1992PhLA..162...91S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1891">'''Ernst August Girschner''', usually just ''' Ernst Girschner''' (29 October 1860 – 28 April 1914) was a [[Germany|German]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Diptera]].

Girschner was born (and died) in [[Torgau]], [[Province of Saxony]]. He taught at the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in Torgau.  Girschner described many new species of Diptera but made much more important contributions notably formalising the use of [[chaetotaxy]] in [[Calyptratae]] "it was the merit of Mr. E. Girschner to give to Chaetotaxy a much greater development and application than it had had before, and to treat it as a sine qua non of descriptive dipterology. His enviable talent for drawing enabled him to illustrate his papers by diagrams more eloquent than any descriptions'' &lt;ref name= "Osten-Sacken, C. R. 1903" &gt;''' Osten-Sacken, C.

Most relevant websites do not come up in the top results because designers and engineers do not cater to the way ranking algorithms work currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ambient Findability|last=Morville|first=Peter|publisher=Oreilly|year=2005|isbn=978-0-596-00765-2|location=Sebastopol, CA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance can be determined from the first law of [[e-commerce]], which states "If the user can’t find the product, the user can’t buy the product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nngroup.com/reports/ecommerce|title = E-Commerce user experience: High-level strategy, Nielsen Norman Group|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2014, out of 10.3 billion monthly [[Google]] searches by Internet users in the [[United States]], an estimated 78% are made to research products and services online.

Findability encompasses aspects of [[information architecture]], [[user interface design]], [[accessibility]] and [[search engine optimization]] (SEO), among others.

==Introduction==
Findability is similar to [[discoverability]], which is defined as the ability of something, especially a piece of content or information, to be found. It is different from web search in that the word ''find'' refers to locating something in a known space while 'search' is in an unknown space or not in an expected location.&lt;ref name="every-page" /&gt;

Mark Baker, the author of ''Every Page is Page One'',&lt;ref name="every-page"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Every Page is Page One|last = Baker|first = Mark|publisher = XML Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1937434281|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that findability "is a content problem, not a search problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Mark|title=Findability is a Content Problem, not a Search Problem|url=http://everypageispageone.com/2013/05/28/findability-is-a-content-problem-not-a-search-problem/|website=Every Page is Page One|access-date=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the right content is present, users often find themselves deep within the content of a website but not in the right place. He further adds that findability is intractable, perfect findability is unattainable, but we need to focus on reducing the effort for finding that a user would have to do for themselves.

Findability can be divided into external findability and on-site findability, based on where the customers need to find the information.

==History==
[[Heather Lutze]] is thought to have created the term in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/liz-wainger/the-shtickiness-factor_b_3471675.html | title=The Shtickiness Factor |last1=Wainger | first1=Liz | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=20 June 2013 | accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularization of the term ''findability'' for the Web is usually credited to [[Peter Morville]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 2005 he defined it as: "the ability of users to identify an appropriate Web site and navigate the pages of the site to discover and retrieve relevant information resources", though it appears to have been first coined in a public context referring to the web and information retrieval by Alkis Papadopoullos in a 2005 article entitled "Findability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkis Papadopoulos|title=The Key to Enterprise Search|journal=KM World|date=April 1, 2005|url=http://news-business.vlex.com/vid/findability-key-to-enterprise-search-62406335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Though the word has been used to mean "ease of finding information" since at least 1943: see Urban A. Avery, "The 'Findability' of the Law", ''Chicago Bar Record'' '''24''':272, April 1943, reprinted in the ''Journal of the American Judicature Society'' '''27''':25 [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/judica27&amp;div=12&amp;id=&amp;page=]&lt;/ref&gt;

==External findability==
External findability is the domain of [[Internet marketing]] and [[Search engine optimization|search engine optimization (SEO)]] tactics.  External findability can be very influential for businesses. Smaller companies may have trouble influencing external findability, due to being less aware to consumers. Other means are taken to make sure that they are found in search results.&lt;ref name="findability-solution" /&gt;

Several factors affect external findability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Findability Factors Found|url=http://www.econtentstrategies.com/Article_FindabilityFactorsFoundFinal_EContent_200701.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Search engine indexing'': As the very first step, webpages need to be found by indexing crawler in order to be shown in the search results. It would be helpful to avoid factors that may lead to webpages being ignored by indexing crawlers. Those factors may include elements that require user interaction, such as entering log-in credentials. Algorithms for indexing vary by the search engine which means the number of webpages of a website successfully being indexed may be very different between Google and Yahoo!'s search engines. Also, in countries like [[China]], [[Great Firewall|government policies]] could significantly influence the indexing algorithms. In this case, local knowledge about laws and policies could be valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Marketing in China|url=http://chineseseoshifu.com/china-online-marketing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Page descriptions in search results'': Once the webpages are successfully indexed by web crawlers and show in the search results with decent ranking, the next step is to attract customers to click the link to the web pages. However, the customers can't see the whole web pages at this point; they can only see an excerpt of the webpage's content and metadata. Therefore, displaying meaningful information in a limited space, usually a couple of sentences, in search results is important for increasing click traffic of the webpages, and thus the findability of the web content on your webpages.
# ''Keyword matching'': At a semantic level, terminology used by the searcher and the content producer be different. Bridging the gap between the terms used by customers and developers is helpful for making web content more findable to more potential content consumers.

==On-site findability==
On-site findability is concerned with the ability of a potential customer to find what they are looking for within a specific site. More than 90 percent of customers use internal searches in a website compared to browsing. Of those, only 50 percent find what they are looking for.&lt;!-- This reference is broken. We need a new reference here to back up these numbers --&gt;&lt;ref name="findability-solution"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Findability Solution|url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/strategy/docs/TheFindabilitySolution-StrategyWhitePaper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the quality of on-site searches highly improves the business of the website. Several factors affect findability on a website:
# ''Site search'': If searchers within a site do not find what they are looking for, they tend to leave rather than browse through the website. Users who had successful site searches are twice as likely to ultimately convert.&lt;ref name="findability-solution" /&gt;
# ''Related links and products'': User experience can be enhanced by trying to understand the needs of the customer and provide suggestions for other, related information.
# ''Site match to customer needs and preferences'': Site design, content creation, and recommendations are major factors for affecting the customer experience.

==Evaluation and measures==
'''Baseline findability''' is the existing findability before changes are made in order to improve it. This is measured by participants who represent the customer base of the website, who try to locate a sample set of items using the existing navigation of the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Customer Analytics For Dummies|last = Sauro|first = Jeff|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = |isbn = 978-1-118-93759-4|location = |pages = |url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118937597.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.measuringu.com/blog/measure-findability.php|title = How to Measure Findability|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to evaluate how easily information can be found by searching a site using a search engine or information retrieval system, [[retrievability]] measures were developed, and similarly, navigability measures now measure ease of information access through browsing a site (e.g. [[PageRank]], MNav, InfoScent (see [[Information foraging]]), etc.).

Findability also can be evaluated via the following techniques:
* [[Usability testing]]: Conducted to find out how and why users navigate through a website to accomplish tasks.
* [[Tree testing]]: An [[information architecture]] based technique, to determine if critical information can be found on the website.
* [[Card sorting|Closed card sorting]]: A usability technique based on information architecture, for evaluating the strength of categories.
* [[Click testing]]: Accounts for the implicit data collected through clicks on the user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nngroup.com/articles/navigation-ia-tests/|title = Low Findability and Discoverability: Four Testing Methods to Identify the Causes|date = July 6, 2014|access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond findability==
Findability Sciences defines a findability index in terms of each user's influence, context, and sentiments. For seamless search, current websites focus on a combination of structured hypertext-based information architectures and rich Internet application-enabled visualization techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journalofia.org/volume2/issue1/03-spagnolo/|title = Beyond Findability - Search-Enhanced Information Architecture for Content-Intensive Rich Internet Applications|date = 2010|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13843">The '''Global Consciousness Project''' ('''GCP''', also called the '''EGG Project''') is a [[parapsychology]] experiment begun in 1998 as an attempt to detect possible interactions of "global [[consciousness]]" with physical systems.  The project monitors a geographically distributed network of [[hardware random number generator]]s in a bid to identify anomalous outputs that correlate with widespread emotional responses to sets of world events, or periods of focused attention by large numbers of people. The GCP is privately funded through the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noetic.org/research/projects|title={{!}} Institute of Noetic Sciences|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes itself as an international collaboration of about 100 research scientists and engineers.

[[Skepticism|Skeptics]] such as [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert T. Carroll]], Claus Larsen, and others have questioned the methodology of the Global Consciousness Project, particularly how the data are selected and interpreted,&lt;ref name=schiavo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skepticnews.com/2005/04/terry_schiavo_a.html |title= Terry Schiavo and the Global Consciousness Project |work= Skeptic News |date= 27 April 2005 |accessdate= 2008-05-05}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Larsen |first= Claus |date= 1 January 2003 |url= http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=560 |title= An Evening with Dean Radin |work= Skeptic Report |accessdate= 2008-05-05}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying the data anomalies reported by the project are the result of "pattern matching" and [[selection bias]] which ultimately fail to support a belief in [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] or global consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.skepdic.com/globalconsciousness.html |chapter= Global consciousness |title= [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |date= |accessdate=2010-01-05 |last= Carroll |first= Robert Todd |authorlink= Robert Todd Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have stated that the open access to the test data "is a testimony to the integrity and curiosity of those involved". But in analyzing the data for 11 September 2001, May et al. concluded that the statistically significant result given by the published GCP hypothesis was fortuitous, and found that an alternative method of analysis gave only chance deviations throughout.&lt;ref name="MaySpottiswoode"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Background==
[[Roger D. Nelson]] developed the project as an extrapolation of two decades of experiments from the controversial [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab]] (PEAR).&lt;ref name="NY Times 2007-02-06"&gt;{{cite news |last= Carey |first= Benedict |title= A Princeton lab on ESP plans to close its doors |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 6 February 2007 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/10/science/10princeton.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=2f8f7bdba3ac59f1&amp;ex=1328763600 |accessdate= 2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an extension of the laboratory research utilizing [[hardware random number generator]]s called FieldREG, investigators examined the outputs of REGs in the field before, during and after highly focused or coherent group events. The group events studied included psychotherapy sessions, theater presentations, religious rituals, sports competitions such as the [[Football World Cup]], and television broadcasts such as the [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, 1996; Blasband, 2000; Nelson, 1995, 1997; Nelson et al.,  1996, 1998a, 1998b; Radin, 1997; Radin et al., 1996.{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FieldREG was extended to global dimensions in studies looking at data from 12 independent REGs in the US and Europe during a web-promoted "Gaiamind Meditation" in January 1997, and then again in September 1997 after the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The project claimed the results suggested it would be worthwhile to build a permanent network of continuously-running REGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Roger|last2=Boesch|first2=Holger|last3=Boller|first3=Emil|last4=Dobyns|first4=York|last5=Houtkooper|first5=Joop|last6=Lettieri|first6=Arnold|last7=Radin|first7=Dean|last8=Russek|first8=Linda|last9=Schwartz|first9=Gary|last10=Wesch|first10=Jerry|title=Global Resonance of Consciousness: Princess Diana and Mother Teresa|journal=the electronic Journal for Anomalous Phenomena|date=1998|url=http://global-mind.org/rdnelson/diana.html|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2014}} This became the EGG project or Global Consciousness Project.

Comparing the GCP to PEAR, Nelson,  referring to the "field" studies with REGs done by PEAR, said the GCP used "exactly the same procedure... applied on a broader scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://noosphere.princeton.edu/story.html |title= The EGG Story |publisher= Noosphere.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate= 2010-01-05}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2014}}

==Methodology==
The GCP's methodology is based on the hypothesis that events which elicit widespread emotion or draw the simultaneous attention of large numbers of people may affect the output of hardware random number generators in a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] way. The GCP maintains a network of hardware random number generators which are interfaced to computers at 70 locations around the world. Custom software reads the output of the random number generators and records a trial (sum of 200 bits) once every second. The data are sent to a server in Princeton, creating a database of synchronized parallel sequences of random numbers. The GCP is run as a replication experiment, essentially combining the results of many distinct tests of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is tested by calculating the extent of data fluctuations at the time of events. The procedure is specified by a three-step experimental protocol. In the first step, the event duration and the calculation algorithm are pre-specified and entered into a formal registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://noosphere.princeton.edu/pred_formal.html |title= GCP Event registry |accessdate= 2009-10-17}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2014}} In the second step, the event data are extracted from the database and a [[Z score]], which indicates the degree of deviation from the null hypothesis, is calculated from the pre-specified algorithm. In the third step, the event Z-score is combined with the Z-scores from previous events to yield an overall result for the experiment.

The remote devices have been dubbed ''Princeton Eggs'', a reference to the coinage ''electrogaiagram'', a [[portmanteau]] of [[electroencephalogram]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://noosphere.princeton.edu/story.html |title= Gathering of a global mind |accessdate= 2008-03-23}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2014}} Supporters and skeptics have referred to the aim of the GCP as being analogous to detecting "a great disturbance in [[the Force]]."&lt;ref name=schiavo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://noosphere.princeton.edu/williams/GCP911.html |title= Exploratory Block Analysis of Field Consciousness Effects on Global RNGs on September 11, 2001 |last= Williams |first=Bryan J. |date =12 August 2002 |work= Noosphere |accessdate= 2009-10-07}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boundaryinstitute.org/bi/randomness.htm |title= A disturbance in the Force...? |date= December 2001 |work= Boundary Institute |accessdate= 2009-10-07 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717191754/http://www.boundaryinstitute.org/bi/randomness.htm |archivedate= 2011-07-17 |df=  }}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims and criticism of effects from the September 11 terrorist attacks==
The GCP has suggested changes in the level of randomness may have occurred during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] at the times of the plane impacts and the building collapses, and over the two days following the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://noosphere.princeton.edu/terror.html |title= September 11, 2001: Exploratory and Contextual Analyses |accessdate= 2008-07-12}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2014}}

Independent scientists Edwin May and James Spottiswoode conducted an analysis of the data around the 11 September 2001 events and concluded there was no statistically significant change in the randomness of the GCP data during the attacks and the apparent significant deviation reported by Nelson and Radin existed only in their chosen time window.&lt;ref name="MaySpottiswoode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsasoc.com/docs/Sep1101.pdf|title=Global Consciousness Project: An Independent Analysis of The 11 September 2001 Events|last1=May|first1=E.C.|date=|website=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spikes and fluctuations are to be expected in any random distribution of data, and there is no set time frame for how close a spike has to be to a given event for the GCP to say they have found a correlation.&lt;ref name="MaySpottiswoode" /&gt;   
Wolcotte Smith said "A couple of additional statistical adjustments would have to be made to determine if there really was a spike in the numbers," referencing the data related to September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/tech/2001/12/06/net-interest.htm |title= Did Sept. 11 events refocus global consciousness? |last= Berman |first= A.S. |newspaper= USA Today |date= 6 December 2001 |accessdate= 2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jeffrey D. Scargle believes unless both [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] and classical [[p-value]] analysis agree and both show the same anomalous effects, the kind of result GCP proposes will not be generally accepted.&lt;ref name="Scargle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scargle|first1=Jeffrey D|title=Was there evidence of global consciousness on September 11, 2001?|journal=Journal of Scientific Exploration|date=2002|volume=16|issue=4|pages=571–577|url=http://global-mind.org/papers/jseScargle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  2003, a New York Times article concluded "All things considered at this point, the stock market seems a more reliable gauge of the national—if not the global—emotional resonance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= J.D. |last= Reed |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/nyregion/so-just-what-makes-the-earth-move.html |title= So just what makes the Earth move? |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 9 March 2003 |accessdate= 2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Age]]'', Nelson concedes "the data, so far, is not solid enough for global consciousness to be said to exist at all. It is not possible, for example, to look at the data and predict with any accuracy what (if anything) the eggs may be responding to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/mind-over-matter/2007/04/26/1177459869857.html |title= Mind over matter |first= Katherine |last= Kizilos |newspaper= [[The Age]] |date= 28 April 2007 |accessdate= 2010-01-05 |location= Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]] said that while it was "the most sophisticated attempt yet" to prove psychokinesis existed, the unreliability of significant events to cause statistically significant spikes meant that "the only conclusion to emerge from the Global Consciousness Project so far is that data without a theory is as meaningless as words without a narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090209/FRONTIERS/272091981/1036/OPINION |title= Does mind affect matter? |first= Robert |last= Matthews |newspaper= [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |location= Abu Dhabi |date= 9 February 2009 |accessdate= 2010-01-05 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090315003212/http://thenational.ae/article/20090209/FRONTIERS/272091981/1036/OPINION |archivedate= 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published by [[World Scientific]], the '''''Handbook of Porphyrin Science: With Applications to Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science, Engineering, Biology and Medicine''''' is a multi-volume reference set edited by scientists Karl Kadish, Kevin Smith and Roger Guilard. The first ten volumes were published in 2010 and the next ten are expected to be published in 2011.

Topics covered include:
*Developments in Supramolecular Chemistry Based on Porphyrins and Related Systems
*Involvement of Porphyrins and Related Systems in Catalysis
*Phototherapy, Radioimmunotherapy and Imaging
*Advances in Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry of Porphyrins, Phthalocyanines and Related Systems
*Heme Proteins

The current work stems from World Scientific's [[Journal of Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines]] (JPP)  and from  the research interests of the three editors and hundreds of authors who have presented the results of their research in this society-run journal since its founding in 1997.

An '''Indochinite''' is a type of [[tektite]]. Tektites were ejected into the Earth's upper atmosphere by a meteorite impact and subsequently cooled to form the distinctive glass-like structure. Indochinites are distinctly dark black in contrast to the green of European [[moldavite]] tektites. It is estimated that these bodies of solidified [[magma]] are 700,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140549/http://www.stomulet.com/products/tektite/indochinite-tektite/&lt;/ref&gt; Indochinite tektites, as the name suggests, are found in the [[Indochinese peninsula]], from Australia and the Pacific islands of [[Micronesia]] in the east and south, to China and Indonesia in the north and west. The largest indochinite is a Muong-Nong type tektite (which are layered tektites), which had a mass of 29.0 kg.

The '''International Association for Official Statistics''' (IAOS) is an association founded in 1985.  It is an international non-governmental organization ([[Non Governmental Organization|NGO]]), which was created and developed as a specialized section of the [[International Statistical Institute]] (ISI). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.go.jp/english/info/news/1958.html Mr. Shigeru Kawasaki became new President of the IAOS]. [[Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_and_Communications|The statistics Bureau of Japan]].  September 30, 2013.

It is thus an Association of physical and legal persons who have scientific or professional interest in the field of official statistics.  IAOS brings together producers and users of official statistics. 
IAOS aims to promote the understanding and advancement of official statistics and related subjects and to foster the development of effective and efficient official statistical services through international contacts among individuals and organizations, including users of official statistics as well as research institutes.
Its next biennial conferences will be from 8 to 10 October 2014 in [[Da Nang]], [[Vietnam]], to discuss how best to meet the statistical needs of a changing world.  
The Association publishes a quarterly statistical journal, the Statistical Journal of the IAOS, which includes peer reviewed articles relevant to the field of official statistics.
An annual Young Statisticians Prize is awarded to the best paper in the field of official statistics written by a young statistician.

'''Invalid science''' consists of scientific claims based on experiments that cannot be reproduced or that are contradicted by experiments that can be reproduced. Recent analyses indicate that the proportion of invalid claims in the scientific literature is steadily increasing.&lt;ref name=econ1013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588069-scientific-research-has-changed-world-now-it-needs-change-itself-how-science-goes-wrong |title=Problems with scientific research: How science goes wrong |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-10-19|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of retractions has grown tenfold over the past decade, but they still make up approximately 0.2% of the 1.4m papers published annually in scholarly journals.&lt;ref name=alarming&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble |title=Unreliable research: Trouble at the lab |publisher=The Economist |date= 2013-10-19|accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Office of Research Integrity]] (ORI), investigates scientific misconduct.&lt;ref name=sci1012/&gt;

{{toclimit|3}}

== Incidence ==

[[Science (journal)|Science magazine]] ranked first for the number of articles retracted at 70, just edging out [[PNAS]], which retracted 69. Thirty-two of Science's retractions were due to fraud or suspected fraud, and 37 to error. A subsequent "retraction index" indicated that journals with relatively high impact factors, such as Science, [[Nature magazine|Nature]] and [[Cell (journal)|Cell]], had a higher rate of retractions. Under 0.1% of papers in [[PubMed]] had were retracted of more than 25 million papers going back to the 1940s.&lt;ref name=sci1012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/10/misconduct-not-mistakes-causes-most-retractions-scientific-papers |title=Misconduct, Not Mistakes, Causes Most Retractions of Scientific Papers &amp;#124; Science/AAAS &amp;#124; News |publisher=News.sciencemag.org |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fang | first1 = F.

The fraction of retracted papers due to scientific misconduct was estimated at two-thirds, according to studies of 2047 papers published since 1977. Misconducted included fraud and plagiarism. Another one-fifth were retracted because of mistakes, and the rest were pulled for unknown or other reasons.&lt;ref name=sci1012/&gt;

A separate study analyzed 432 claims of genetic links for various health risks that vary between men and women. Only one of these claims proved to be consistently reproducible. Another meta review, found that of the 49 most-cited clinical research studies published between 1990 and 2003, more than 40 percent of them were later shown to be either totally wrong or significantly incorrect.&lt;ref name=wired1112&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_causation/all/ |title=Trials and Errors: Why Science Is Failing Us|first= Jonah |last=Lehrer |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/538729 |title=Highly cited studies often refuted |publisher=Medscape.com|date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological sciences ===

In 2012 biotech firm [[Amgen]] was able to reproduce just six of 53 important studies in [[cancer research]]. Earlier, a group at [[Bayer]], a drug company, successfully repeated only one fourth of 67 important papers. In 2000-10 roughly 80,000 patients took part in clinical trials based on research that was later retracted because of mistakes or improprieties.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Paleontology ===
[[Nathan Mhyrvold]] failed repeatedly to replicate the findings of several papers on dinosaur growth. Dinosaurs added a layer to their bones each year. [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] was thought to have increased in size by more than 700&amp;nbsp;kg a year, until Mhyrvold showed that this was a factor of 2 too large. In 4 of 12 papers he examined, the original data had been lost. In three, the statistics were correct, while three had serious errors that invalidated their conclusions. Two papers mistakenly relied on data from these three. He discovered that some of the paper's graphs did not reflect the data. In one case, he found that only four of nine points on the graph came from data cited in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anonymous |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21591837-enthusiastic-amateur-suggests-work-how-dinosaurs-grew-wrong-bone |title=Palaeontology: A bone to pick |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-12-21 |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major retractions ===

[[Torcetrapib]] was originally hyped as a drug that could block a protein that converts [[HDL cholesterol]] into LDL with the potential to "redefine cardiovascular treatment". One [[clinical trial]] showed that the drug could increase HDL and decrease LDL. Two days after [[Pfizer]] announced its plans for the drug, it ended the Phase III clinical trial due to higher rates of chest pain and heart failure and a 60 percent increase in overall mortality. Pfizer had invested more than $1 billion in developing the drug.&lt;ref name=wired1112/&gt;

An in-depth review of the most highly cited biomarkers (whose presence are used to infer illness and measure treatment effects) claimed that 83 percent of supposed correlations became significantly weaker in subsequent studies. [[Homocysteine]] is an amino acid whose levels correlated with heart disease. However, a 2010 study showed that lowering homocysteine by nearly 30 percent had no effect on heart attack or stroke.&lt;ref name=wired1112/&gt;

=== Priming ===

"Priming" studies claim that decisions can be influenced by apparently irrelevant events that a subject witnesses just before making a choice. Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman allege that much of it is poorly founded. Researchers have been unable to replicate some of the more widely cited examples. A paper in [[PLoS ONE]] reported that nine separate could not reproduce a study purporting to show that thinking about a professor before taking an intelligence test leads to a higher score than imagining a football hooligan.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

== Potential causes ==

=== Competition ===

In the 1950s, when academic research accelerated during the [[cold war]], the total number of scientists was a few hundred thousand. In the new century 6m-7m researchers are active. The number of research jobs has not matched this increase. Every year six new PhDs compete for every academic post. Replicating other researcher’s results is not perceived to be valuable. The struggle to compete encourages exaggeration of findings and biased data selection. A recent survey found that one in three researchers knows of a colleague who has at least somewhat distorted their results.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Publication bias ===

Major journals reject in excess of 90% of submitted manuscripts and tend to favor the most dramatic claims. The statistical measures that researchers use to test their claims allow a fraction of false claims to appear valid. Invalid claims are more likely to be dramatic (because they are false.) Without replication, such errors are less likely to be caught.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

Conversely, failures to prove a hypothesis are rarely even offered for publication. “Negative results” now account for only 14% of published papers, down from 30% in 1990. Knowledge of what is not true is as important as of what is true.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Peer review ===

[[Peer review]] is the primary validation technique employed by scientific publications. However, a prominent medical journal tested the system and found major failings. It supplied research with induced errors and found that most reviewers failed to spot the mistakes, even after being told of the tests.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

A pseudonymous fabricated paper on the effects of a chemical derived from lichen on cancer cells was submitted to 304 journals for peer review. The paper was filled with errors of study design, analysis and interpretation. 157 lower-rated journals accepted it. Another study sent an article containing eight deliberate mistakes in study design, analysis and interpretation to more than 200 of the [[British Medical Journal]]’s regular reviewers. On average, they reported fewer than two of the problems.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Peer reviewers typically do not re-analyse data from scratch, checking only that the authors’ analysis is properly conceived.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

=== Statistics ===

==== Type I and type II errors ====

Scientists divide errors into type I, incorrectly asserting the truth of a hypothesis (false positive) and type II, rejecting a correct hypothesis (false negative). Statistical checks assess the probability that data which seem to support a hypothesis come about simply by chance. If the probability is less than 5%, the evidence is rated “statistically significant”. One definitiomal consequence is a type one error rate of one in 20.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

==== Statistical power ====

In 2005 Stanford [[epidemiologist]] John Ioannidis showed that the idea that only one paper in 20 gives a false-positive result was incorrect. He claimed, “most published research findings are probably false.” He found three categories of problems: insufficient “[[statistical power]]” (avoiding type II errors); the unlikeliness of the hypothesis; and publication bias favoring novel claims.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

A statistically powerful study identifies factors with only small effects on data. In general studies with more repetitions that run the experiment more times on more subjects have greater power. A power of 0.8 means that of ten true hypotheses tested, the effects of two are missed. Ioannidis found that in neuroscience the typical statistical power is 0.21; another study found that psychology studies average 0.35.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Unlikeliness is a measure of the degree of surprise in a result. Scientists prefer surprising results, leading them to test hypotheses that are unlikely to very unlikely. Ioannidis claimed that in epidemiology, some one in ten hypotheses should be true. In exploratory disciplines like genomics, which rely on examining voluminous data about genes and proteins, only one in a thousand should prove correct.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

In a discipline in which 100 out of 1,000 hypotheses are true, studies with a power of 0.8 will find 80 and miss 20. Of the 900 incorrect hypotheses, 5% or 45 will be accepted because of type I errors. Adding the 45 false positives to the 80 true positives gives 125 positive results, or 36% specious. Dropping statistical power to 0.4, optimistic for many fields, would still produce 45 false positives but only 40 true positives, less than half.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Negative results are more reliable. Statistical power of 0.8 produces 875 negative results of which only 20 are false, giving an accuracy of over 97%. Negative results however account for a minority of published results, varying by discipline. A study of 4,600 papers found that the proportion of published negative results dropped from 30% to 14% between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Subatomic physics sets an acceptable false-positive rate of one in 3.5m (known as the [[Standard deviation#Particle physics|five-sigma standard]]). However, even this does not provide perfect protection. The problem invalidates some 3/4s of [[machine learning]] studies according to one review.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

==== Statistical significance ====

[[Statistical significance]] is a measure for testing [[statistical correlation]]. It was invented by English mathematician [[Ronald Fisher]] in the 1920s. It defines a “significant” result as any data point that would be produced by chance less than 5 (or more stringently, 1) percent of the time. A significant result is widely seen as an important indicator that the correlation is not random.&lt;ref name=wired1112/&gt;

While correlations track the relationship between truly independent measurements, such as smoking and cancer, they are much less effective when variables cannot be isolated, a common circumstance in biological systems. For example, statistics found a high correlation between lower back pain and abnormalities in spinal discs, although it was later discovered that serious abnormalities were present in two-thirds of pain-free patients.&lt;ref name=wired1112/&gt;

=== Minimum threshold publishers ===

Journals such as PLoS One use a “minimal-threshold” standard, seeking to publish as much science as possible, rather than to pick out the best work. Their peer reviewers assess only whether a paper is methodologically sound. Almost half of their submissions are still rejected on that basis.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

=== Unpublished research ===

Only 22% of the [[clinical trial]]s financed by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) released summary results within one year of completion, even though the NIH requires it. Fewer than half published within 30 months; a third remained unpublished after 51 months.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt; When other scientists rely on invalid research, they may waste time on lines of research that are themselves invalid. The failure to report failures means that researchers waste money and effort exploring blind alleys already investigated by other scientists.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Fraud ===

In 21 surveys of academics (mostly in the biomedical sciences but also in civil engineering, chemistry and economics) carried out between 1987 and 2008, 2% admitted fabricating data, but 28% claimed to know of colleagues who engaged in questionable research practices.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

=== Lack of access to data and software ===

Clinical trials are generally too costly to rerun. Access to trial data is the only practical approach to reassessment. A campaign to persuade pharmaceutical firms to make all trial data available won its first convert in February 2013 when [[GlaxoSmithKline]] became the first to agree.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Software used in a trial is generally considered to be proprietary intellectual property and is not available to replicators, further complicating matters. Journals that insist on data-sharing tend not to do the same for software.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Even well-written papers may not include sufficient detail and/or tacit knowledge (subtle skills and extemporisations not considered notable) for the replication to succeed. One cause of replication failure is insufficient control of the protocol, which can cause disputes between the original and replicating researchers.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

== Reform ==

=== Statistics training ===

Geneticists have begun more careful reviews, particularly of the use of statistical techniques. The effect was to stop a flood of specious results from [[genome sequencing]].&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Protocol registration ===

Registering research protocols in advance and monitoring them over the course of a study can prevent researchers from modifying the protocol midstream to highlight preferred results. Providing raw data for other researchers to inspect and test can also better hold researchers to account.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Post-publication review ===

Replacing peer review with post-publication evaluations can encourage researchers to think more about the long-term consequences of excessive or unsubstantiated claims. That system was adopted in physics and mathematics with good results.&lt;ref name=econ1013/&gt;

=== Replication ===

Few researchers, especially junior workers, seek opportunities to replicate others' work, partly to protect relationships with senior researchers.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Reproduction benefits from access to the original study's methods and data. More than half of 238 biomedical papers published in 84 journals failed to identify all the resources (such as chemical reagents) necessary to reproduce the results. In 2008 some 60% of researchers said they would share raw data; in 2013 just 45% do. Journals have begun to demand that at least some raw data be made available, although only 143 of 351 randomly selected papers covered by some data-sharing policy actually complied.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

The Reproducibility Initiative is a service allowing life scientists to pay to have their work validated by an independent lab. In October 2013 the initiative received funding to review 50 of the highest-impact cancer findings published between 2010 and 2012. ''Blog Syn'' is a website run by graduate students that is dedicated to reproducing chemical reactions reported in papers.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

In 2013 replication efforts received greater attention. ''Nature'' and related publications introduced an 18-point checklist for life science authors in May,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf Reporting Checklist For Life Sciences Articles]&lt;/ref&gt; in its effort to ensure that its published research can be reproduced. Expanded "methods" sections and all data were to be available online. The Centre for Open Science opened as an independent laboratory focused on replication. The journal Perspectives on Psychological Science announced a section devoted to replications. Another project announced plans to replicate 100 studies published in the first three months of 2008 in three leading psychology journals.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

Major funders, including the [[European Research Council]], the US [[National Science Foundation]] and [[Research Councils UK]] have not changed their preference for new work over replications.&lt;ref name=alarming/&gt;

[[File:IsaacAsimovsGuideToEarthAndSpace.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])&lt;br&gt;Cover art by [[Henrik Drescher]]]]
'''''Guide to Earth and Space''''' ({{ISBN|0-449-22059-1}}) is a non-fiction work by the well-known science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]]. The book differs somewhat in structure from typical literature by presenting its information in the form of answers to a series of questions, presumably posed by the reader. Like many of Asimov's non-fiction pieces, this "Guide" starts with the basics, answering relatively simple (to the modern reader) questions about the Earth - is it [[Flat Earth|flat]], does it spin, is it the [[Geocentric model|center of the universe]], etc...  

From there the questions progress roughly through the evolution of [[astronomy]] and discovery to introduce more complex topics, from the orbits of the planets to the formation of stars and the characteristics of [[quasars]] and [[black holes]].

Many of the concepts discussed in the latter sections of the books can be compared with those presented in Asimov's 1966 work ''The Universe: From Flat Earth to Quasar''; furthermore, they serve in several cases to update the state of the art from the intervening 25 years between publications.

'''John Morris''' (19 February 1810 &amp;ndash; 7 January 1886) was an English [[geologist]].

==Life==
He was born in 1810 at [[Homerton]], London, and educated at private schools. 
He was engaged for some years as a pharmaceutical chemist at Kensington, but soon became interested in geology and other branches of science, and ultimately retired from business. 
His published papers speedily attracted notice, and his ''Catalogue of British Fossils,'' published in 1845, a work involving much critical research, added greatly to his reputation.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Morris, John (1810-1886)|first= Thomas George |last=Bonney|volume=39|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris was professor of geology at [[University College, London]] from 1854 to 1877. He was elected [[Geological Society|F.G.S.]] in 1845. Along with [[James Scott Bowerbank|Bowerbank]] and five others, he was a founding member of the London Clay Club. Morris was president of the [[Geologists' Association]] from 1868–1871 and from 1877–1879. He was awarded the [[Lyell Medal]] in 1876. Morris's best original work was done on Eocene and Jurassic rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Topley, William|authorlink=William Topley (geologist)|title=The Life and Work of John Morris, M.A., F.G.S.

'''John White'''  (c. 1540 – c. 1593) was a settler among those who sailed with [[Richard Grenville]] to present-day [[North Carolina]] in 1585, acting as artist and mapmaker to the expedition.

During his time at [[Roanoke Island]] he made a number of watercolor sketches of the surrounding landscape and the native [[Algonquian peoples|Algonkin]] peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]]; the surviving original watercolors are now preserved in the [[print room]] of the [[British Museum]].

In 1587, White became governor of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]'s failed attempt at a permanent settlement on Roanoke Island, known to history as the "[[Lost Colony]]". This was the earliest effort to establish a permanent [[British Empire|English colony]] in the [[New World]]. White's granddaughter [[Virginia Dare]] was the first English child born in the Americas.

After the failure of the colony, White retired to Raleigh's [[Estate (land)|estate]]s in Ireland, reflecting upon the "evils and unfortunate events" which had ruined his hopes in America, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.

==Early life==
John White's exact date of birth is unknown but it seems likely he was born some time between 1540 and 1550.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"&gt;[http://ncpedia.org/biography/governors/white John White at ncpedia.org ]. Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There is a record dated 22 February 1539, of a christening in the Church of [[St Augustine Papey|St Augustine]], London, of a "John White" on that same day; but there is no proof this is the same person. White is known to have attended church in the parish of [[St. Martin Ludgate]] in London.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; In 1566 he married Tomasyn Cooper; with whom he had a son, Tom, who died young, and a daughter Eleanor.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; Little is known of White's training as an artist but it is possible that he apprenticed as an illustrator under a London master.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt;

==Early efforts at colonisation==
[[File:North carolina algonkin-rituale02.jpg|left|thumb|Watercolour by John White of [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]] Indians]]
In the late sixteenth century efforts to establish an English colony in the New World began to gain momentum, and White soon became an enthusiastic supporter.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; In 1585 White accompanied the expedition led by Sir [[Ralph Lane]] to attempt to found the first English colony in North America.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; White was sent by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] as Sir [[Richard Grenville]]'s artist-illustrator on his first voyage to the [[New World]]; he served as mapmaker and artist to the expedition, which encountered considerable difficulties and returned to England in 1586 .&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt;

==Gentleman artist==
In 1585 White had been commissioned to "draw to life" the inhabitants of the New World and their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Brave-New-World.htmlin Article in Smithsonian Magazine by Abigal Tucker, December 2008]. Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During White's time at Roanoke Island, he completed numerous watercolor drawings of the surrounding landscape and native peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]], and predate the first body of "discovery voyage art" created in the late 18th century by the artists who sailed with Captain [[James Cook]].  They represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of America encountered by England's first settlers.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

White's enthusiasm for [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] was unusual – most contemporary painters preferred to use [[Oil painting|oil-based paints]].&lt;ref name="Milton, p199"&gt;Milton, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; White's watercolors would soon become a sensation in Europe; it was not long before the watercolors were [[engraving|engraved]] by the Flemish master engraver [[Theodore de Bry]].&lt;ref name="Milton, p200"&gt;Milton, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; Through the medium of print, the illustrations became widely known and distributed; they were published in 1590 under the title ''America''.&lt;ref name="Milton, p200"/&gt;

==Governor of the Roanoke colony==
{{Main article|Lost Colony}}
[[File:Sir Walter Raleigh.jpg|thumb|right|White's patron, [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]]]
[[File:Roanoke map 1584.JPG|thumb|right|White's sketch of the Roanoke area c. 1585]]

After Lane's colonists returned to England in 1586, [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], who held the [[land patent]] for the proposed English [[colony of Virginia]], tasked White with the job of organising a new settlement in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area, one which would be self-sustaining and which would include women and children.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; During 1586 White was able to persuade 113 prospective colonists to join Raleigh's expedition, including his daughter [[Eleanor Dare|Eleanor]] and his son-in-law [[Ananias Dare]], recently married at [[St Bride's Church]] in [[Fleet Street]].&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts did not go unrewarded; on 7 January 1587, Raleigh named "John White of London Gentleman, to be the chief Governor" of the new colony.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; White, with thirteen others, were incorporated under the name of ''"The Governor and Assistants of the Cities of Raleigh of Virginia"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Queen's College, Oxford]], MSS 137](a). On the occasion he was granted arms with eight-quarters. The 1st contained his new arms: Ermine, on a canton Gules, a fusil Argent. The 2nd contained the ancient arms of White of Truro. The remaining six quarters contained the arms of some of his “Assistants”. This marshalling, other than being unorthodox, produced minute detail unsuitable for the [[New World Tapestry]] canvas. Therefore White (ancient) of Truro is depicted (Poptarts of 1587).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival at Roanoke===
In May 1587 White's colonists sailed for Virginia in the ''Lion''. They were guided by the Portuguese navigator [[Simon Fernandez]], the same pilot who had led the 1585 expedition and who was given by his fellow sailors the unhappy nickname of "the swine."&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers' chosen destination was not Roanoke but the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. But, upon reaching Roanoke in late July,&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; and allowing the colonists to disembark, Fernandez refused to let White's men re-board ship.

According to White's journal, Fernandez's deputy "called to the sailors in the [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinesse]], charging them not to bring any of the planters [settlers] back againe, but leave them on the island."&lt;ref name="Milton, p.215"&gt;Milton, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with what amounted to a [[mutiny]] by his navigator, White appears to have backed down and acquiesced in this sudden change of plan.&lt;ref name="Milton, p.215"/&gt; Despite the governor's protests, Fernandez held that "summer was farre spent [summer was almost over], wherefore hee would land all the planters in no other place."&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

This second colony at Roanoke set about repairing the structures left behind in 1585.&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; They also searched for the fifteen men left behind by the previous expedition, but found only bones.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; From an early stage there were tensions with the local [[Algonquian peoples|Algonkin]] Indians,&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt; though initially things went well. White quickly made contact with friendly natives led by Chief [[Manteo (Croatan)|
 Manteo]], who explained to him that the lost fifteen had been killed by hostile [[Secotan]], [[Aquascogoc]], and [[Dasamongueponke]] warriors,&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; choosing a time and place of attack "of great advantage to the savages."&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.220&lt;/ref&gt;
On 8 August 1587, White led a dawn attack on the Dasamongueponkes that went disastrously wrong. White and his soldiers entered the Dasamongueponke village in the morning "so early that it was yet dark,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_T0GyxK9DYC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Dasamonquepeuc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=poukTfanEdSEhQfW9cXeCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dasamonquepeuc&amp;f=falsebut Miller, Lee, p.131]. Retrieved April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but mistakenly attacked a group of hitherto friendly Indians, killing one and wounding many. "We were deceaved," wrote White in his journal, "for the savages were our friendes." Henceforth, relations with the local tribes would steadily deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.235&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia Dare===
[[File:Baptism of Virginia Dare.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|''Baptism of [[Virginia Dare]]'', lithograph, 1880]]

On 18 August 1587, there was happier news – White became a grandfather. "Elenora, daughter to the governour and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants, was delivered of a daughter in Roanoke."&lt;ref name="Milton, p.239"&gt;Milton, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; The child was healthy and "was christened there the Sunday following, and because this child was the first Christian born in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;Modern-day North Carolina&lt;/ref&gt; she was named Virginia."&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milton, p.239"/&gt;

===White returns to England===
However, the colonists' food supplies soon began to grow short, and in late 1587 the settlers pressed White to return to England "for the better and sooner obtaining of supplies, and other necessaries."&lt;ref name="ncpedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p240&lt;/ref&gt; Because the colony had been deposited in Roanoke rather than the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] area, supply ships from England ignorant of Fernandez's change of plan would most likely not land in Roanoke at all, and the settlement might not survive the coming winter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_T0GyxK9DYC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Dasamonquepeuc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=poukTfanEdSEhQfW9cXeCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dasamonquepeuc&amp;f=false Miller, Lee, p.132]. Retrieved April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; White was reluctant to abandon his colony, anxious that his enemies in England "would not spare to slander [him] falsely" should he leave,&lt;ref name="Milton, p.241"&gt;Milton, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; and worried that his "stuff and goods might be spoiled and most of it pilfered away."&lt;ref name="Milton, p.241"/&gt; Eventually the colonists agreed to stand surety for White's belongings and he was prevailed upon to sail, "much against his will," to seek help.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

Misfortune struck White's return to England from the beginning. The anchor of the [[flyboat]] on which White was quartered could not be raised, and many crew members were severely injured during the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; Worse, their journey home was delayed by "scarce and variable winds" followed by "a storm at the north-east," and many sailors starved or died of scurvy.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 1587 the desperate crew at last landed in [[Ard na Caithne|Smewicke]], in the west of Ireland, and White was finally able to make his way back to [[Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spanish Armada===
[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The invincible [[Spanish Armada]]]]

Further bad news awaited White on his return to England. Just two weeks previously [[Queen Elizabeth I]] had issued a general "stay of shipping," preventing any ships from leaving English shores.&lt;ref name="Milton, p.247"&gt;Milton, p.247&lt;/ref&gt; The reason was the "invincible fleetes made by the King of Spain, joyned with the power of the Pope, for the invading of England" – the [[Spanish Armada]].&lt;ref name="Milton, p.247"/&gt; White's patron [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] attempted to provide ships to rescue the colony but he was over-ruled by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.248&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Brave'' and the ''Roe''===
[[File:Kalamar Nycel Lewes DE.jpg|right|thumb|175px|A modern replica of an early 17th-century [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]]]]

In early 1588 White was able to scrape together a pair of small [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]]s, the ''Brave'' and the ''Roe'', which were unsuitable for military service and could be spared for the expedition to Roanoke. Unluckily for White, they were barely suited for the Atlantic crossing and the governor endured further bad luck as the ships were intercepted by French [[pirates]], who "playd extreemely upon us with their shot," hitting White (to his great embarrassment) "in the side of the buttoke."&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; White and his crew escaped to England with their lives, but "they robbed us of all our victuals, powder, weapons and provision," and the journey to Virginia had to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Milton, p.250"&gt;Milton, p.250&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage White appears to have formed the view that he was born under "an unlucky star."&lt;ref name="Milton, p.250"/&gt;

===Return to the "Lost Colony"===
{{

further|Watts' West Indies and Virginia expedition}}
Finally, in March 1590, with the immediate threat of a Spanish invasion by now abated, Raleigh was able to equip White's rescue expedition. Two ships, the ''Hopewell'' and the ''Moonlight'' set sail for Roanoke.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.257&lt;/ref&gt; The return journey was prolonged by extensive [[privateering]] and a number of sea battles, and White's eventual landing at the [[Outer Banks]] was further imperiled by poor weather.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; The landing was hazardous and was beset by bad conditions and adverse currents.  During the landing on Roanoke, of the mariners who accompanied White, "seven of the chiefest were drowned."&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.262&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor White finally reached Roanoke Island on 18 August 1590, his granddaughter's third birthday, but he found his colony had been long deserted. The buildings had collapsed and "the houses [were] taken downe."&lt;ref name="Milton p.265"&gt;Milton, p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The few clues about the colonists' whereabouts included the letters "CRO" carved into a tree, and the word "[[Croatoan Island|CROATOAN]]" carved on a post of the fort.&lt;ref name="Milton p.265"/&gt; Croatoan was the name of a nearby [[Croatoan Island|island]] (likely modern-day [[Hatteras Island]]) and of a local tribe of Native Americans. Roanoke Island was not the original planned location for the colony and the idea of moving elsewhere had been discussed. Before the Governor's departure, he and the colonists had agreed that a message would be carved into a tree if they had moved and would include an image of a [[Maltese Cross]] if the decision was made by force.&lt;ref name="Milton p.265"/&gt; White found no such cross and was hopeful that his family were still alive.&lt;ref name="Milton p.266"&gt;Milton, p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

True to their word, the colonists had looked after White's belongings, which had been carefully buried and hidden. However, local Indians had evidently looted the hiding place, and White found "about the place many of my things spoyled and broken, and my books torne from the covers, the frames of some of my pictures and mappes rotten and spoyled with rayne, and my armour almost eaten through with rust."&lt;ref&gt;Milton p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to weather which "grew to be fouler and fouler,"&lt;ref name="Milton, p.268"&gt;Milton, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; White had to abandon the search of adjacent islands for the colonists. The ship's captain had already lost three anchors and could not afford the loss of another.&lt;ref name="Milton, p.268"/&gt; White returned to [[Plymouth]], England, on 24 October 1590.

The loss of the colony was a personal tragedy for White, from which he never fully recovered. He would never return to the New World, and in a letter to [[Richard Hakluyt]] he wrote that he must hand over the fate of the colonists and his family "to the merciful help of the Almighty, whom I most humbly beseech to helpe and comfort them."&lt;ref name="Milton, p.268"/&gt;

==Later life==
Little is known of White's life after the failure of the Roanoke Colony. He lived in [[Plymouth]],&lt;ref&gt;as the will of his twin brother Robert White bequeathing him property in the city of Plymouth, referred to him as "of Plymouth"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transcripts of Robert White's will are in the same MSS [Queen's College, Oxford, MSS 137]; and in the New World Tapestry Library (as is the New World Tapestry) at the British Empire &amp; Commonwealth Museum, Bristol, England.&lt;/ref&gt; and also owned a house at Newtown, Kylmore (Kilmore, [[County Cork]]), Ireland.  He appears to have been in Ireland living on the estates of Sir Walter Raleigh, making maps of land for Raleigh's tenants, and reflecting upon the "evils and unfortunate events" which had ruined his hopes in the New World, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

The last surviving document related to White is a letter he wrote from Ireland in 1593 to the publisher of the [[old master print|prints]] of his Roanoke drawings.  However, a record from May 1606 that a Bridget White was appointed estate administrator for her brother "John White" may refer to him. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Legacy==
White is chiefly remembered today for his watercolors, which represent a unique record of 16th-century [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian society]]. All of White's surviving works are now in the [[print room]] of the [[British Museum]].

In 2007, the British Museum placed the entire group of John White's watercolors on public display under the collection, "''A New World: England's First View of America''." There are more than seventy watercolors in the travelling exhibit. There were plans to show the collection at the [[North Carolina Museum of History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.historyisfun.org/pdf/John-White-Watercolors/ANewWorld.pdf|title= A New World: England’s First View of America|publisher=The British Museum|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In the [[American Horror Story: Roanoke|sixth season]] of ''[[American Horror Story]]'', White is mentioned in the [[Chapter 3 (American Horror Story)|third episode]]. [[Kathy Bates]] portrays [[List of American Horror Story: Roanoke characters#The Butcher|Tomasyn "The Butcher" White]], his fictional wife and regent-governor while he is away getting supplies from England. [[Wes Bentley]] portrays John and Tomasyn's son, [[List of American Horror Story: Roanoke characters#Ambrose White|Ambrose]].
* In the Canadian based trilogy series [[Ginger Snaps]], the third and final film was debuted as a prequel to the franchise. In it, two young women are abandoned in the New World, and find their way to a fortress - Roanoke Colony, who has sealed its doors and refused to allow outsiders in. Eventually, the girls are able to get inside only to discover that the colony is plagued by werewolf-like creatures called wendigos. This movie in particular, is heavily inspired by the lost colony, as well as local Native American legend, although dramatically distorted.
* In the long-running paranormal drama series, [[Supernatural]], the lost colony is referenced as suffering from a demonic virus called, the Croatoan Virus. It infects humans, causing them to see their neighbors as demonic entities, and thus fuels them with a burning rage and dire need for survival to kill their friends and family. If left unchecked, the virus will eventually cause every single person in a town or village to kill one another, and then the survivor typically kills themselves.

In [[control theory]], the '''linear–quadratic–Gaussian''' ('''LQG''') '''control problem''' is one of the most fundamental [[optimal control]] problems. It concerns [[linear system]]s driven by [[additive white Gaussian noise]]. The problem is to determine an output feedback law that is optimal in the sense of minimizing the expected value of a quadratic [[cost functional|cost]] criterion. Output measurements are assumed to be corrupted by Gaussian noise and the initial state, likewise, is assumed to be a Gaussian random vector.

Under these assumptions an optimal control scheme ''within the class of linear control laws'' can be derived by a completion-of-squares argument.&lt;ref name="astrom"&gt;{{cite book |author=Karl Johan Astrom |title=Introduction to Stochastic Control Theory |publisher=Academic Press |volume=58 |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-44531-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This control law which is known as the '''LQG''' controller, is ''unique'' and it is simply a combination of a [[Kalman filter]], i.e. a linear–quadratic state estimator (LQE), together with a [[Linear-quadratic regulator|linear–quadratic regulator]] (LQR). The [[separation principle]] states that the state estimator and the state feedback can be designed independently. LQG control applies to both [[LTI systems|linear time-invariant systems]] as well as [[Time-variant system|linear time-varying system]]s, and constitutes a linear dynamic feedback control law that is easily computed and implemented. I.e., the LQG controller itself is a dynamic system like the system it controls. Both systems have the same state dimension.

A deeper statement of the separation principle is that the LQG controller is still optimal in a wider class of possibly nonlinear controllers. That is, ''utilizing a nonlinear control scheme will not improve the expected value of the cost functional''. This version of the separation principle is a special case of the [[separation principle of stochastic control]] which states that even when the process and output noise sources are possibly non-Gaussian martingales, as long as the system dynamics are linear, the optimal control separates into an optimal state estimator (which may no longer be a Kalman filter) and an LQR regulator.&lt;ref name="lindquist"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Lindquist|title=On Feedback Control of Linear Stochastic Systems |journal=SIAM Journal on Control |volume=11  |pages=323–343 |year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GL2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tryphon T. Georgiou and Anders Lindquist |title=The Separation Principle in Stochastic Control, Redux |journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=2481–2494 |year=2013 |doi=10.1109/TAC.2013.2259207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the classical LQG setting, implementation of the LQG controller may be problematic when the dimension of the system state is large. The '''reduced-order LQG problem''' (fixed-order LQG problem) overcomes this by fixing ''a priori'' the number of states of the LQG controller. This problem is more difficult to solve because it is no longer separable. Also the solution is no longer unique. Despite these facts numerical algorithms are available&lt;ref name="Wil1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Willigenburg L.G. |author2=De Koning W.L. |title=Numerical algorithms and issues concerning the discrete-time optimal projection equations |journal=European Journal of Control |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=93–100 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/s0947-3580(00)70917-4}} [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=19948&amp;objectType=file  Associated software download from Matlab Central].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wil2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Willigenburg L.G. |author2=De Koning W.L. |title=Optimal reduced-order compensators for time-varying discrete-time systems with deterministic and white parameters |journal=Automatica |volume=35 |pages=129–138 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0005-1098(98)00138-1}} [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=20014&amp;objectType=FILE  Associated software download from Matlab Central].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bern3"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zigic D. |author2=Watson L.T. |author3=Collins E.G. |author4=Haddad W.M. |author5=Ying S. |title=Homotopy methods for solving the optimal projection equations for the H2 reduced order model problem |journal=International Journal of Control |volume=56 | issue=1 | pages=173–191 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/00207179208934308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Had1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Collins Jr. E.G |author2=Haddad W.M. |author3=Ying S. |title=A homotopy algorithm for reduced-order dynamic compensation using the Hyland-Bernstein optimal projection equations |journal=Journal of Guidance Control &amp; Dynamics |volume=19 |pages=407–417 |year=1996 |doi=10.2514/3.21633 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to solve the associated [[optimal projection equations]]&lt;ref name="Bern1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hyland D.C |author2=Bernstein D.S. |title=The optimal projection equations for fixed order dynamic compensation |journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control |volume=AC-29 | pages=1034–1037 |year=1984 |doi=10.1109/TAC.1984.1103418 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bern2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bernstein D.S. |author2=Davis L.D. |author3=Hyland D.C. |title=The optimal projection equations for reduced-order discrete-time modeling estimation and control |journal=Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics| volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=288–293 |year=1986 |doi=10.2514/3.20105}}&lt;/ref&gt; which constitute necessary and sufficient conditions for a locally optimal reduced-order LQG controller.&lt;ref name="Wil1"/&gt;

To promote robustness some of the system parameters may be assumed stochastic instead of deterministic. The associated more difficult control problem leads to a similar optimal controller of which only the controller parameters are different.&lt;ref name="Wil2"/&gt;

Finally the LQG controller is also used to control perturbed non-linear systems.&lt;ref name="Athans"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Athans M. |title=The role and use of the stochastic Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian problem in control system design |journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control |volume=AC-16 |issue=6 |pages=529–552 |year=1971 |doi=10.1109/TAC.1971.1099818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description of the problem and solution==

===Continuous time===
Consider the [[continuous-time]] linear dynamic system

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + B(t) \mathbf{u}(t) +  \mathbf{v}(t),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{w}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt; represents the vector of state variables of the system, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{u}}&lt;/math&gt; the vector of control inputs and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{y}}&lt;/math&gt; the vector of measured outputs available for feedback. Both additive white Gaussian system noise &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and additive white Gaussian measurement noise &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}(t)&lt;/math&gt; affect the system. Given this system the objective is to find the control input history &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{u}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; which at every time &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}t&lt;/math&gt; may depend linearly only on the past measurements &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{y}}(t'), 0 \leq t' &lt; t&lt;/math&gt; such that the following cost function is minimized:

: &lt;math&gt; J = \mathbb{E}\left[{\mathbf{x}^\mathrm T}(T)F{\mathbf{x}}(T)+ \int_{0}^{T} {\mathbf{x}^\mathrm T}(t)Q(t){\mathbf{x}}(t) + {\mathbf{u}^\mathrm T}(t)R(t){\mathbf{u}}(t)\,dt \right],&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; F \ge 0,\quad Q(t) \ge 0,\quad R(t) &gt; 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[expected value]]. The final time (horizon) &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}T&lt;/math&gt; may be either finite or infinite. If the horizon tends to infinity the first term &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}^\mathrm T(T)F{\mathbf{x}}(T)&lt;/math&gt; of the cost function becomes negligible and irrelevant to the problem. Also to keep the costs finite the cost function has to be taken to be &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}J/T&lt;/math&gt;.

The LQG controller that solves the LQG control problem is specified by the following equations:

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(t) = A(t)\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t) + B(t){\mathbf{u}}(t)+L(t) \left( {\mathbf{y}}(t)-C(t)\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t) \right),  \quad \hat{\mathbf{x}}(0) = \mathbb{E} \left[ {\mathbf{x}}(0) \right], &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{u}}(t)= -K(t) \hat{\mathbf{x}}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}L(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Kalman gain''' of the associated [[Kalman filter]] represented by the first equation. At each time &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}t&lt;/math&gt; this filter generates estimates &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the state &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; using the past measurements and inputs. The Kalman gain &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}L(t)&lt;/math&gt; is computed from the matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}A(t), C(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the two intensity matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{}V(t), W(t)&lt;/math&gt; associated to the white Gaussian noises &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and finally &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\left[{\mathbf{x}}(0){\mathbf{x}}^\mathrm T(0) \right]&lt;/math&gt;. These five matrices determine the Kalman gain through the following associated matrix Riccati differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{P}(t) = A(t)P(t)+P(t)A^\mathrm T(t)-P(t)C^\mathrm T(t){\mathbf{}}W^{-1}(t)
C(t)P(t)+V(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P(0)= \mathbb{E} \left[{\mathbf{x}}(0){\mathbf{x}}^\mathrm T(0) \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the solution &lt;math&gt;P(t), 0 \leq t \leq T&lt;/math&gt; the Kalman gain equals

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{}}L(t) = P(t)C^\mathrm T(t)W^{-1}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}K(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''feedback gain''' matrix. This matrix is determined by the matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}A(t), B(t), Q(t), R(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F&lt;/math&gt; through the following associated matrix Riccati differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt; -\dot{S}(t) = A^\mathrm T(t)S(t)+S(t)A(t)-S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B^\mathrm T(t)S(t)+Q(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbf{}}S(T) = F.&lt;/math&gt;

Given the solution &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}S(t), 0 \leq t \leq T&lt;/math&gt; the feedback gain equals

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{}}K(t) = R^{-1}(t)B^\mathrm T(t)S(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Observe the similarity of the two matrix Riccati differential equations, the first one running forward in time, the second one running backward in time. This similarity is called '''duality'''. The first matrix Riccati differential equation solves the linear–quadratic estimation problem (LQE). The second matrix Riccati differential equation solves the [[Linear-quadratic regulator|linear–quadratic regulator]] problem (LQR). These problems are dual and together they solve the linear–quadratic–Gaussian control problem (LQG). So the LQG problem separates into the LQE and LQR problem that can be solved independently. Therefore, the LQG problem is called '''separable'''.

When &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}A(t), B(t), C(t), Q(t), R(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the noise intensity matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{}V(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{}W(t)&lt;/math&gt; do not depend on &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}t&lt;/math&gt; and when &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}T&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity the LQG controller becomes a time-invariant dynamic system. In that case both matrix Riccati differential equations may be replaced by the two associated [[algebraic Riccati equation]]s.

===Discrete time===
Since the [[discrete-time]] LQG control problem is similar to the one in continuous-time, the description below focuses on the mathematical equations.

The discrete-time linear system equations are

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}_{i+1} = A_i\mathbf{x}_i + B_i \mathbf{u}_i +  \mathbf{v}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_{i} = C_{i} \mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{w}_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{}i&lt;/math&gt; represents the discrete time index and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{i}, \mathbf{w}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; represent discrete-time Gaussian white noise processes with covariance matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{}V_{i}, W_{i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The quadratic cost function to be minimized is

: &lt;math&gt; J = \mathbb{E}\left[{\mathbf{x}}^\mathrm T_{N}F{\mathbf{x}}_{N}+ \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}( \mathbf{x}_i^\mathrm T Q_i \mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{u}_i^\mathrm T R_i \mathbf{u}_i )\right],&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; F \ge 0, Q_i \ge 0, R_i &gt; 0. \,  &lt;/math&gt;

The discrete-time LQG controller is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{i+1}=A_i\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i+B_i{\mathbf{u}}_i+L_{i+1} \left({\mathbf{y}}_{i+1}-C_{i+1} \left\{ A_i \hat{\mathbf{x}}_i + B_i u_i \right\} \right), \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0=\mathbb{E}[{\mathbf{x}}_0]&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_i=-K_i\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The Kalman gain equals

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{}}L_i = P_iC ^\mathrm T _i(C_iP_iC ^\mathrm T _i + W_i)^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}P_i&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the following matrix Riccati difference equation that runs forward in time:

: &lt;math&gt; P_{i+1} = A_i \left( P_i - P_i C ^\mathrm T _i \left( C_i P_i C ^\mathrm T _i+W_i \right)^{-1} C_i P_i \right) A ^\mathrm T _i+V_i, P_0=\mathbb{E} \left( {\mathbf{x}}_0 - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0\right)\left({\mathbf{x}}_0- \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0\right)^\mathrm T. &lt;/math&gt;

The feedback gain matrix equals

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{}}K_i = (B^\mathrm T_iS_{i+1}B_i + R_i)^{-1}B^\mathrm T_iS_{i+1}A_i &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}S_i&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the following matrix Riccati difference equation that runs backward in time:

: &lt;math&gt; S_i = A^\mathrm T_i \left( S_{i+1} - S_{i+1}B_i \left( B^\mathrm T_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \right)^{-1} B^\mathrm T_i S_{i+1} \right) A_i+Q_i, \quad S_N=F.&lt;/math&gt;

If all the matrices in the problem formulation are time-invariant and if the horizon &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}N&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity the discrete-time LQG controller becomes time-invariant. In that case the matrix Riccati difference equations may be replaced by their associated discrete-time [[algebraic Riccati equation]]s. These determine the time-invariant linear–quadratic estimator and the time-invariant [[Linear-quadratic regulator|linear–quadratic regulator]] in discrete-time. To keep the costs finite instead of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}J&lt;/math&gt; one has to consider &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}J/N&lt;/math&gt; in this case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28255">'''Superfund sites in New York''' are designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA, a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] law passed in 1980, authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of October, 2013, there were 87 Superfund sites on the NPL in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new sites have been proposed for addition to the list, and 26 sites have been deleted from the list following cleanup.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

This is a '''list of astronomical observatories''' ordered by name, along with initial dates of operation (where an accurate date is available) and location. The list also includes a final year of operation for many observatories that are no longer in operation. While other sciences, such as [[volcanology]] and [[meteorology]], also use facilities called observatories for research and observations, this list is limited to observatories that are used to observe celestial objects.

[[Observatory#Astronomical observatories|Astronomical observatories]] are mainly divided into four categories: space-based, airborne, ground-based, and underground-based.

Many modern telescopes and observatories are located in space to observe astronomical objects in [[wavelength]]s of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere (such as [[ultraviolet]] radiation, [[X-rays]], and [[gamma rays]]) and are thus impossible to observe using ground-based telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Chaisson| first = Eric|author2=McMillan, Steve | title = Astronomy Today, Fourth Edition| publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Being above the atmosphere, these [[Space observatory|space observatories]] can also avoid the effects of [[atmospheric turbulence]] that plague ground based telescopes, although new generations of [[adaptive optic]]s telescopes have since then dramatically improved the situation on the ground. The space high vacuum environment also frees the detectors from the ancestral [[Diurnal motion|diurnal cycle]] due to the atmospheric blue light background of the sky, thereby increasing significantly the observation time.

An intermediate variant is the [[airborne observatory]], specialised in the [[infrared]] wavelengths of the EM spectrum, that conduct observations above the part of the atmosphere containing [[water vapor]] that absorbs them, in the [[stratosphere]].

Historically, [[Observatory#Astronomical observatories|astronomical observatories]] consisted generally in a building or group of buildings where observations of [[astronomy|astronomical]] objects such as [[sunspot]]s, [[planets]], [[asteroids]], [[comet]]s, [[star]]s, [[nebula]]e, and [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]] wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum were conducted. At first, for millennia, astronomical observations have been made with naked eyes. Then with the discovery of [[optics]], with the help of different types of [[refractor telescope]]s and later with [[reflector telescope]]s. Their use allowed to dramatically increase both the [[Optical telescope#Light-gathering power|collecting power]] and [[Angular resolution|limit of resolution]], thus the [[brightness]], level of detail and apparent [[angular size]] of distant celestial objects allowing them to be better studied and understood. Following the development of modern [[physics]], new ground based facilities have been constructed to conduct research in the radio and [[microwave]] wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, with [[radio telescope]]s and dedicated [[Submillimetre astronomy|microwave telescope]]s.

Modern [[astrophysics]] has extended the field of study of celestial bodies to non electromagnetic vectors, such as [[neutrino]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[cosmic-ray]]s or [[gravitational wave]]s. Thus new types of observatories have been developed. [[Interferometer]]s are at the core of gravitational wave detectors. In order to limit the natural or artificial [[background noise]], most [[particle detector]] based observatories are built [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|deep underground]].

| [[Moundsville, West Virginia]]
| 250 to 150 BCE
| [[Adena culture]]
| At {{convert|69|ft|m}} high and {{convert|295|ft|m}} in diameter, the Grave Creek Mound is the largest conical type burial mound in the United States. In 1838, much of the archaeological evidence in this mound was destroyed when several non-archaeologists tunneled into the mound. To gain entrance to the mound, two shafts, one vertical and one horizontal were created. This led to the most significant discovery of two burial vaults.

| Also called the "Great Mortuary", it is the second-largest mound on the site and the only burial mound. A hollow chamber that began as a burial structure for Spiro's rulers became a cavity within the mound, about {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide, and allowed for almost perfect preservation of fragile artifacts made of wood, [[Lightning whelk|conch shell]], and copper. The conditions in this hollow space were so favorable that objects made of perishable materials such as [[basket weaving|basketry]], woven fabric, lace, fur, and feathers were preserved inside it. Craig Mound has been called "an American [[Tutankhamun|King Tut's Tomb]]."

| South Appalachian Mississippian
| [[Cyrus Thomas]] and [[John P. Rogan]] tested the site for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1883, where they discovered the "[[Rogan plates]]". But, the first well-documented archaeological inquiry at the site did not begin until the winter of 1925, conducted by [[Warren K. Moorehead]]. His excavations into Mound C at the site revealed a rich array of burial goods. These artifacts, along with the collections from [[Cahokia]], [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]], [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson]], and Spiro Mounds, would comprise the majority of the materials which archeologists used to define the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].

| Adjacent to the [[Tennessee River]], the site has 6 or 7 substructure [[platform mound]]s and one burial mound, Mound C. This mound was excavated in 1899 by [[Cornelius Cadle]], chairman of the Shiloh Park Commission. Amongst the discoveries was a large [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone effigy pipe]] in the shape of a kneeling man. It has since become the site’s most famous artifact and is on display in the [[Tennessee River Museum]] in [[Savannah, Tennessee|Savannah]]. The pipe is from a distinctive red stone in the same style as several statuettes from the Cahokia site in Collinsville, Illinois.&lt;ref name=NPSGOV&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/shil/mounds.htm|title=Shiloh Indian Mounds|accessdate =2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1873">'''Magnetic Proton Recoil neutron spectrometer''' is a large high-resolution [[neutron]] [[spectrometer]] installed at [[Joint European Torus|JET]].

==History==
The Magnetic Proton Recoil (MPR) neutron spectrometer is a thin-foil spectrometer which was installed at JET in 1996 and upgraded (MPRu) 2001-2005. 

==Principle==
In the MPR the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] [[neutron]]s are [[collimate]]d into a neutron beam. The neutron beam is directed onto a thin plastic film ([[Polyethylene]]) where the neutrons scatter elastically on the [[proton]]s of the foil. The recoil protons emitted in the forward direction enter a magnetic part of the spectrometer where they are momentum analyzed and focused onto the focal plane. An array of plastic [[scintillator]]s coupled to [[photomultiplier tube]]s (PMTs) register the spatial distribution of the protons. This proton distribution is then related to the [[neutron energy]] spectrum.

==Field-of-view==
The MPR has a semi-tangential line of sight through the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The MPR has a 700 mm long cylindrical steel neutron collimator with a 10-cm2 bore. At a distance 170 mm behind the end of the collimator is placed a 10 cm2 polythene conversion foil, defining the active area of the spectrometer. The collimator-foil arrangement defines the spectrometers field-of-view into the plasma.

==Uses==
The MPR determines the neutron spectrum from which important plasma parameters can be determined, such as the ion temperature, the collective motion of the main plasma, the fuel ion densities and their velocity distributions.

'''Nanoengineering''' is the practice of [[engineering]] on the [[nanoscale]]. It derives its name from the [[nanometre]], a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter.

Nanoengineering is largely a synonym for [[nanotechnology]], but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field.

==Degree programs==

{{Seealso|Nanotechnology education}}

The first nanoengineering program  was started at the [[University of Toronto]] within the Engineering Science program as one of the options of study in the final years. In 2003, the [[Lund Institute of Technology]] started a program in Nanoengineering. In 2004, the [[College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering]] at [[SUNY Polytechnic Institute]] was established on the campus of the [[University at Albany]]. In 2005, the [[University of Waterloo]] established a unique program which offers a full degree in Nanotechnology Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.nanotech.uwaterloo.ca/About_Nano_at_UW/
| title = Welcome to Nanotechnology Engineering at UW
| publisher = Department of Nanotechnology Engineering
| accessdate = 2008-10-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisiana Tech University]] started the first program in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006 the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] started a Bachelor and a Master program NanoEngineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.uni-due.de/nanoengineering/| title = NanoEngineering at University of Duisburg-Essen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike early NanoEngineering programs, the first Nanoengineering Department in the world, offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees, was established by the  [[University of California, San Diego]] in 2007.
In 2009, the [[University of Toronto]] began offering all Options of study in Engineering Science as degrees, bringing the second nanoengineering degree to Canada. Rice University  established in 2016 a Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering (MSNE).
DTU Nanotech - the Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology - is a department at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] established in 1990.

In 2013, [[Wayne State University]] began offering a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Certificate Program, which is funded by a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Education (NUE) grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]. The primary goal is to offer specialized undergraduate training in nanotechnology. Other goals are: 1) to teach emerging technologies at the undergraduate level, 2) to train a new adaptive workforce, and 3) to retrain working engineers and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.wayne.edu/nano/about.php/|title=Wayne State University Nanoengineering Certificate Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

* [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) - Can be used to both image, and to manipulate structures as small as a single atom.
* [[Molecular self-assembly]] - Arbitrary sequences of [[DNA]] can now be synthesized cheaply in bulk, and used to create custom proteins or regular patterns of amino acids. Similarly, DNA strands can bind to other DNA strands, allowing simple structures to be created.

On 6 December 2007, '''Odyssey Moon''' was the first team to register for the [[Google Lunar X Prize]] competition,&lt;ref name="space1"/&gt; an event that hopes to rekindle the efforts of humans to return to the moon. The competition is referred to as "Moon 2.0" and is composed of other private organizations like Odyssey Moon Limited, the commercial lunar enterprise that makes up this team.&lt;ref name ="space"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Odyssey Moon first off the mark for the Google Lunar X PRIZE|url=http://www.space.co.uk/Articles/20071209OdysseyMoon/tabid/99/Default.aspx|publisher=''space.co.uk''|accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team will be competing for a $20 million first prize, a $5 million second prize, and additional $5 million in (potential) bonuses.&lt;ref name ="xprize"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Odyssey Moon Announced as First Official Competitor in the Google Lunar X PRIZE|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/|publisher=''googlelunarxprize.org''|accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odyssey Moon Limited is based on [[The Isle of Man]],&lt;ref name="space"/&gt; and is the design of [[Robert D. Richards]].&lt;ref name="xprize"/&gt; His goals include developing the first commercial enterprise that utilizes the energy and resources on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reaching for the moon: Interview with Robert Richards|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/05/05/richards.interview/index.html#cnnSTCText|publisher=''[[CNN]]''|accessdate=2008-06-25 | date=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this end, the team enlisted the part-time consultant services of [[Alan Stern]], NASA's former top-rank planetary scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Former NASA chief Alan Stern joins Odyssey Moon|url=http://www.odysseymoon.com/PDF/Odyssey_Moon_Media_Release_-_Alan_Stern_18_June_2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010211509/http://odysseymoon.com/PDF/Odyssey_Moon_Media_Release_-_Alan_Stern_18_June_2008.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-10|publisher=''Odyssey Moon''|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September 2008,  another veteran of NASA joined Odyssey Moon. [[Jay F. Honeycutt]] was named president and will be responsible for all programs and commercial launch operations. He brings a great deal of expertise in managing large scale engineering operations. His experience at NASA was diverse. He was director of the [[Kennedy Space Center]] for several years and was director of Shuttle Management and Operations for more than five years. Outside NASA, another part of his forty years of professional experience was as president of [[Lockheed Martin]] Space Operations from 1997-2004.&lt;ref name="jay_pr"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Former NASA Kennedy Space Center Director Jay Honeycutt Announced As President of Odyssey Moon U.S. Operations|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=26491|publisher=''spaceref.com''|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}}

The team's goals are to build and deploy a robotic lander that will deliver exploration as well as scientific payloads to the moon. The new lander/spacecraft has been dubbed "MoonOne (M-1)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Private race to the moon (and money) takes off|author=Dave Mosher|author2=Anthony Duignan-Cabrera|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23278871/page/2/|publisher=''[[Space.com]]''|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have been contracted to [[MacDonald Dettwiler]], a Canadian corporation with a successful history of providing technical space solutions for several [[NASA]] projects including the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}}

[[The Planetary Society]], an international space interest group co-founded by [[Carl Sagan]], joined Odyssey Moon's efforts in 2007, specifically with public outreach and coordination between public and private organizations.&lt;ref name="space1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Company Accepts Google Lunar X Prize Challenge|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/071206-private-odyssey.html|author=Leonard David|year=2007|publisher=''[[Space.com]]''|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Pillinger]], a scientist with a background in studying meteorites, led the [[European Space Agency]]'s failed [[Beagle 2]] Mars lander project in 2003. In 2009 he was in discussion with Odyssey Moon regarding the use of an identical version of Beagle's most powerful instrument on their lander.&lt;ref name="sfn"/&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}}

In May 1943 Allied surveillance observed the construction of the first of 11 large sites in northern France for secret German weapons, including six for the [[V-2 rocket]]. In November it discovered the first of 96 "ski sites" for the [[V-1 flying bomb]].

Officials debated the extent of the German weapons' danger; some viewed the sites as decoys to divert Allied bombers, while others feared [[chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[biological warfare|biological]] warheads.&lt;ref name="levine1992"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Strategic Bombing of Germany, 1940-1945 | publisher=Praeger | author=Levine, Alan J. | year=1992 | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=136–139 | isbn=0-275-94319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reconnaissance and intelligence information regarding the V-2 became convincing, the [[Churchill War Ministry|War Cabinet]] [[Bombing of Peenemünde in World War II#Cabinet Defence Committee (Operations)|Defence Committee (Operations)]] directed the campaign's first planned{{efn| The June 1943 [[Operation Bellicose]] was not targeted against German long-range weapons, but happened to be the first bombing of a German long-range weapon facility (the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Zeppelin Werk]]).

===Bombing priority===
At the request of the [[Churchill War Ministry|British War Cabinet]], on April 19, 1944,&lt;ref name=Gruen/&gt;{{Rp|24}} [[Dwight Eisenhower]] directed ''Crossbow'' attacks to have absolute priority over all other air operations, including "[[Operation Pointblank|wearing down German industry]]" and [[Area bombing directive|morale]]&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt;{{Rp|46}} "for the time being", which he confirmed after the V-1 assault began on the night of June 12/13, 1944: "with respect to ''Crossbow'' targets, these targets are to take first priority over everything except the urgent requirements of the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] battle; this priority to obtain until we can be certain that we have definitely gotten the upper hand of this particular business" (Eisenhower to [[Arthur Tedder]], June 16).&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Kit C. |author2=Mueller, Robert |title=The Army Air Forces in World War II |url= https://books.google.com/?id=RjzLqxg6KlAC&amp;pg=PT579 |publisher=Center for Air Force History |page=527 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |isbn=978-1-4289-1543-5}} Mets' footnote 55 on p. 389 for p. 237 claims the Eisenhower memo which had the "qualifier that land battle emergencies would take priority" (Mets paraphrasing) was on June 29 (not June 16 per Carter &amp; Mueller):
*{{cite web |last=Eisenhower |first=Dwight D. |authorlink=Dwight Eisenhower |date=June 29, 1944 |title=Memorandum, Eisenhower to Tedder
|work= |location=[[Eisenhower Presidential Library]], Pre-Presidential File Box 115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launches surprised the Allies, who had believed that the earlier attacks on the sites had eliminated the danger. The British, who had not expected German bombing of Britain to resume so late in the war, were especially upset. Some suggested using gas on the launch sites, or even executing German civilians as punishment.{{r|levine1992}}

[[Carl Spaatz]], commander of [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe|U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe]] (USTTAF), responded on June 28&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spaatz |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Spaatz |date=June 28, 1944 |title=Memorandum, Spaatz to Eisenhower |work=Pre-Presidential File Box 115 |location=[[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "complain that ''Crossbow'' was a 'diversion' from the main task of wearing down the Luftwaffe and bombing German industry" for the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]], and to recommend instead that ''Crossbow'' be a secondary priority since "days of bad weather over Germany's industrial targets would still allow enough weight of attack for the rocket sites and the lesser tactical crises."&lt;ref name=Eisenhower/&gt;{{Rp|349}} By July 10, Tedder had published a list of Crossbow targets which assigned 30 to [[RAF Bomber Command]], six to [[AEAF|Tedder's tactical forces]], and 68 to Spaatz' USSTAF; after which Spaatz again complained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mets |first=David R. |year=1997 |quote=paperback |origyear=1988 |title=Master of Airpower: General Carl A. Spaatz |page=239 |isbn=0-89141-317-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|239}} so Eisenhower allowed "spare" bombing of non-Crossbow targets: "Instructions for continuing to make ''Crossbow'' targets our first priority must stand, but ... when ... the entire strategic forces cannot be used against ''Crossbow'', we should attack—(a) [[Operation Pointblank|Aircraft industry]], (b) [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil]], (c) [[Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission|ball bearing]] [[German language|(German)]]: [[ZF Sachs|Kugellagerwerke]], (d) Vehicular production" (Eisenhower, July 18).&lt;ref name=Eisenhower/&gt;{{Rp|349}}

Nonetheless, over 25 percent of the Combined Bomber Offensive's tonnage of bombs were used against V-weapon sites in July and August; many of the attacks were ineffective, as they were against unused sites rather than the launchers themselves. Spaatz unsuccessfully proposed that attacks concentrate on the Calais electrical grid, and on gyrocompass factories in Germany and V-weapon storage depots in France. The gyrocompass attacks, along with targeting liquid oxygen tanks (which the Allies knew the V-2 needed), might have been very effective against the missiles.{{r|levine1992}} On August 25, 1944, the Joint Crossbow Target Priorities Committee (established July 21)&lt;ref name=Craven&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Craven |editor-first=Wesley Frank |editor2=Cate, James Lea |title=(Volume 3) Europe: Argument to V-E Day |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jTXWGhwBacAC&amp;pg=PA530 |work=The Army Air Forces in World War II|page=535 |isbn=978-0-912799-03-2 |date=January 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared the "Plan for Attack on the German Rocket Organization When Rocket Attacks Commence"—in addition to bombing of storage, liquid-oxygen, and launch sites; the plan included aerial reconnaissance operations.&lt;ref name=Gruen/&gt;{{Rp|37}}
Following the last V-1 launch from France on September 1, 1944, and since the expected V-2 attacks had not begun, ''Crossbow'' bombing was suspended on September 3&lt;ref name=Gruen&gt;Gruen&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|34}} and the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|campaign against German oil facilities]] became the highest priority.

The V-1 threat from [[occupied France]] ended on September 5, 1944, when elements of the [[The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal)|7th Canadian Reconnaissance Regiment]] and the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] contained the German military units of the [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] area with their surrender following on September 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hyrman |first=Jan |title=Operation Undergo: The Capture of Calais &amp; Cap Griz Nez |work=Clearing the Channel Ports |url=http://www.nasenoviny.com/DunkirkENUndergo.html |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resumption of bombing===
''Crossbow'' bombing resumed after the first [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] attack and included a large September 17 raid on Dutch targets suspected as bases for [[Heinkel He 111]]s, which were air-launching V-1s.&lt;ref name=Gruen/&gt;{{Rp|37}} Modified V-1s (865 total) were "air-launched" from September 16, 1944 to January 14, 1945.&lt;ref name=Pocock&gt;

Allied reconnaissance detected two sites at [[Vlaardingen]] and [[Ypenburg]], and along with a third at [[Delft]], they launched 274 V-1s at London from March 3–29. Only 125 reached the British defences, and only thirteen of those reached the target area. Three additional sites directed their fire on Antwerp. After using medium bombers against V-2 launch site in the [[Haagse Bos]] on March 3, the RAF attacked the Holland V-1 sites with two squadrons. An [[RAF Fighter Command]] unit used Spitfires against Ypenburg on March 20 and 23, while a [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] unit used Typhoons against Vlaardingen on March 23. Counterattacks on Holland's V-1 and V-2 sites ended on April 3, and all ''Crossbow'' countermeasures ended on May 2 with the [[end of World War II in Europe]].&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt;{{Rp|133–6}}

On March 21, 1945, the plan for the "Engagement of Long Range Rockets with AA Gunfire" which called for anti-aircraft units to fire into a radar-predicted airspace to intercept the V-2 was ready, but the plan was not used due to the danger of shells falling on Greater London.&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|262}}  Happenstance instances of Allied aircraft engaging launched V-2 rockets include the following:
* on October 29, 1944, Lieutenants Donald A. Schultz and Charles M. Crane in a [[P-38 Lightning]] attempted to photograph a launched V-2 above the trees near the [[River Rhine]],&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;Kennedy&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|4}}
*  on January 1, 1945, a [[4th Fighter Group]] pilot aloft over the northern flightpath for attacking elements of five German fighter wings on ''[[Unternehmen Bodenplatte]]'' that day, observed a V-2 "act up for firing near [[Lochem]] ... the rocket was [[Meillerwagen|immediately tilted from 85 deg. to 30 deg"]],&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|256}}
* on February 14, 1945, a [[No. 602 Squadron RAF]] [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] XVI pilot, [[Raymond Baxter]]'s colleague 'Cupid' Love, fired at a V-2 just after launch.&lt;ref name="Cooksley"/&gt;{{Rp|162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Den Haag (The Hague) - Wassenaar - Hoek van Holland |url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html |work=A-4/V-2 Resource Site |publisher=V2Rocket.com |accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the last combat V-2 launch on March 27, 1945, the British discontinued their use of radar in the defence region to detect V-2 launches on April 13.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt;{{Rp|136}}

The original focus was on standardizing technical data definitions for capital intensive projects at the handover from the [[EPC (contract)|EPC]] contractor to the owner/operators of onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities. The program was sponsored by [[The Research Council of Norway]], two [[EPC (contract)|EPC]] contractors ([[Aker Maritime]] and [[Kværner]]), three owners/operators ([[Norsk Hydro]], [[Saga Petroleum]] and [[Statoil]]) and [[DNV]] as service provider and project owner.

=== POSC Caesar project ===
During the period 1994-96, Caesar Offshore Program was defined as a project of [[POSC|Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC)]] (now [[Energistics]]), and changed its name to the '''POSC Caesar Project'''.&lt;ref name="PCAHis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=POSCStatus98/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt;

In 1995 the project was joined by [[BP]], [[Brown and Root]] and [[Elf Aquitaine]] and in 1997 by [[Intergraph]], [[IBM]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Lloyd's]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[ABB Group|ABB]] and [http://www.umoe.no/ UMOE Technologies].&lt;ref name=POSCStatus98/&gt;

During that time, POSC Caesar also became a member of European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE) where it collaborates with PISTEP (UK), and USPI-NL (The Netherlands) on the development of [[ISO 10303]], also known as "Standard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP)."

=== POSC Caesar Association ===
In 1997, POSC Caesar Association was founded as an independent, global, non-profit, member organization. POSC Caesar Association serves an international membership and collaborates with other international organizations. It has its main office in Norway.

Albeit the name of POSC Caesar Association still hints to its past as a project within the [[POSC|Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC)]] (now [[Energistics]]&lt;ref name="POSCEnergistics"&gt;

== Activities and services ==

=== Initiator and custodian of ISO 15926 ===

In consultation with the other EPISTLE members and the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]], it was decided in 2003 (some say already in 1997{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}) that for modeling-technical reasons it was better to discontinue the development of [[ISO 10303]]&lt;ref name="SC4Legacy"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.tc184-sc4.org/SC4_Open/SC4%20Legacy%20Products%20(2001-08)/STEP_(10303)/
|title=ISO - SC4- Legacy products - STEP (ISO 10303)
|author=ISO
|accessdate=2009-08-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to initiate the development of [[ISO 15926]] "Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities."

Over the years, the scope of the standard has increased from the initial capital-intensive projects in the [[Upstream (oil industry)|upstream oil and gas industry]], to include also relevant terminology for [[Downstream (oil industry)|downstream oil and gas industry]] applications and to deal with real-time data related to the actual oil and gas production.

[[ISO 15926]] has also over the years evolved from a dictionary (a list of terms with definitions), over a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] (added hierarchy) to an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] (a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts). [[ISO 15926]] is therefore sometimes nicknamed the "Oil and Gas Ontology.",&lt;ref name="OLFIOOntology"&gt;

== Projects ==
There are a number of projects (co-)organized by POSC Caesar Association working on the extension of the [[ISO 15926]] standard in different application areas.

=== Capital intensive projects application domain ===
The following projects are running at the moment (August 2009):

* The ADI Project of FIATECH, to build the tools (which will then be made available in the public domain)
* The IDS Project of POSC Caesar Association, to define product models required for data sheets
* A joint collaboration project between FIATECH POSC Caesar Association is the ADI-IDS project is the [[ISO 15926 WIP]]

=== Upstream oil and gas industry application domain ===
The following projects are currently running (August 2009):

* The [[Integrated Operations in the High North|Integrated Operations in the High North (IOHN)]] project is working on extending ISO 15926 to handle real-time data transmission and (pre-)processing to enable the next generation of [[Integrated operations|Integrated Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;

* The Environment Web project to include environmental reporting terms and definitions as used in EPIM's EnvironmentWeb in ISO 15926.

Finalised projects include:

* The Integrated Information Platform (IIP) project working on establishing a real-time information pipeline based on open standards. It worked among others on:
** Daily Drilling Report (DDR) to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard became mandatory on February 1, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npd.no/English/Produkter+og+tjenester/Skjemaer/CDRS_reporting_oct_2007.htm |title=Drilling Reporting to the authorities |author=Norwegian Petroleum Directorate |accessdate=2009-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726004215/http://www.npd.no/English/Produkter+og+tjenester/Skjemaer/CDRS_reporting_oct_2007.htm |archive-date=2009-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for reporting on the [[Norwegian Continental Shelf]] by the [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD)]] and Safety Authority Norway (PSA). NPD says that the quality of the reports has improved considerably since.
** Daily Production Report (DPR) to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard was tested successfully on the [[Valhall oil field|Valhall]] ([[BP]]-operated) and Åsgard ([[StatoilHydro]]-operated) fields offshore Norway. The terminology and XML schemata developed have also been included in [http://www.Energistics.org Energistics]’ [[PRODML]] standard.

Ancient large-scale cities in China were always governmental center of the royal blood and planned to be symbols of this kind of government. The design ideas and city layout were affected by consciousness of concentrated [[royal power]]. By means of social research methods, the article confirms the close relationship between [[city planning]] ideas and political system in order to establish a sort of research base for the modern planning system.

==Traditional philosophy==
In Chinese traditional philosophy, it focuses on the practice. Specifically, architecture comes with transport, apparel and tool. Architecture is the crucial factor, not because of its value of art. It can be seen just as a symbol of class.

The “Thought of Etiquette” decides the expression of planning and architecture in ancient China.In China’s traditional [[urban planning]], the ruling class use physical boundaries to protect themselves. “[[Great Wall of China|The Great Wall]]” is one of the most famous [[physical boundary|physical boundaries]] in China. The theory of urban planning in ancient China reflects the Thought of Etiquette’s impact on the urban construction. 《周礼.考工记》 is one chapter of the ''Thought of Etiquette''. In this chapter, it talks about the regulation of urban planning in ancient China.

==Concept of urban==
The concept of “urban” in ancient China is separated into two parts: one is “city”, the place that the ruling class and residents live. The other is “market”, the place that residents can have commercial activities.

The history of urban development in China begins in [[Zhou dynasty]] (1066BC). Politic is the most important factor of the urban existence in ancient China. Therefore, the original and development reflect Deep-rooted authoritarian political regimes. The ruling class not only decides urban construction, but also has some special ideas of the urban scale, [[:wikt:layout|layout]], functional division and style of architecture during the process of urban construction.

The influence of the ruler’s thoughts is obvious. The [[checkerboard]] pattern appeared. The layout of most cities highlights the political center. Emphasized on the axis and layout palace in front, markets in back. Laid the basic pattern for the next 2000 years development.

'''Plutonism''' (or '''volcanism''') is the [[geologic]] [[theory]] that the [[igneous rock]]s forming the Earth originated from intrusive [[Magma|magmatic activity]], with a continuing gradual process of weathering and erosion wearing away rocks, which were then deposited on the sea bed, re-formed into layers of [[sedimentary rock]] by heat and pressure, and raised again. It proposes that [[basalt]] is solidified molten [[magma]].  The name ''plutonism'' references [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], the [[classical mythology|classical]] ruler of the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], while "volcanism" echoes the name of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman god]] of fire and volcanoes. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces use of the word "plutonists" to 1799,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Plutonist}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the appearance of the word ''plutonism'' to 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|plutonism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbé [[Anton Moro]], who had studied volcanic islands, first proposed the theory before 1750, and [[James Hutton]] subsequently developed it as part of his ''Theory of the Earth'',&lt;ref&gt;

published in 1788. The idea contested [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner's]] [[Neptunism|neptunist theory]] which proposed that the Earth had formed from a mass of water and suspended material which had formed rocks as layers of deposited sediment which became the continents when the water retreated, further layers being deposited by [[flood]]s and some volcanic activity.

Plutonists strongly disputed the [[neptunist]] view that rocks had formed by processes that no longer operated, instead supporting Hutton's [[uniformitarianism]]. A key issue of the debate revolved around the neptunist belief that [[basalt]] was sedimentary, and some fossils had been found in it. Against this, Hutton's friend [[John Playfair]] (1748-1819) argued that this rock contained no fossils as it had formed from molten magma, and it had been found cutting through other rocks in [[Dike (geology)|volcanic dyke]]s. The arguments continued into the early 19th century, and eventually the plutonist views on the origin of rocks prevailed in the wake of the work of [[Charles Lyell]] in the 1830s. However, geologists regard sedimentary rocks such as [[limestone]] as having resulted from processes like those described by the neptunists, and so modern [[petrology|petrological]] theory can be seen{{by whom|date=September 2016}} as a synthesis of the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''RNAi Global Initiative'''&lt;ref&gt;RNAi Global Initiative website: [http://www.rnaiglobal.org www.rnaiglobal.org]&lt;/ref&gt; is an alliance of international [[biomedical]] researchers that has been established to increase and accelerate the utility of genome-wide [[RNAi]] libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/probe/doc/ProjRNAiGlobal.shtml NCBI Probe Database Entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genome-wide [[RNAi]] screening has the potential to fundamentally change [[biological]] research by increasing scientists' ability to understand disease mechanisms and facilitating faster drug discovery and development. The RNAi Global Initiative provides a forum for member institutions to share research [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocols]], establish experimental standards, and develop mechanisms for exchanging and comparing screening data.

This ongoing interaction between the RNAi Global Initiative members is expected to help researchers optimize high-throughput human-genome-wide [[RNAi]] screening and accelerate [[drug discovery]]. Membership is open to [[non-profit]] [[biomedical]] research institutions across the globe.

The RNAi Global Initiative was established and is being coordinated under the auspices of the [[Dharmacon]] Product line of [[GE Healthcare]], whose Research and Development scientists actively contribute to the Initiative.

== MIARE ==
Through collaboration and the meaningful exchange of information and data, the RNAi Global Initiative intends to draw a comprehensive roadmap of human gene function and use this as a foundation to revolutionize the way medicine and healthcare are delivered.

To this end, members of the RNAi Global Initiative are actively engaged in promoting the concept and implementation of [[minimum information standards]] to facilitate data sharing within the extended [[RNAi]] community. Building on established standards such as [[MIAME]] (Minimum Information About a [[Microarray]] Experiment), the RNAi Global Initiative has contributed work towards a community-wide effort known as the Minimum Information About an [[RNAi]] Experiment ([[MIARE]]).&lt;ref&gt;MIARE website:[http://www.miare.org www.miare.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These reporting guidelines were developed in part by a large inter-laboratory benchmarking study and in part by workshops and discussions amongst the RNAi Global Initiative members.

== Member Institutions ==
As of January 2010, there were over 50 member groups in 15
different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genomeweb.com/rnai/south-african-group-joins-thermo-fishers-rnai-global-initiative November 2009 Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Coin Thorne''' (25 November 1898 – 27 May 1960) was an [[United States|American]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]].

==Life==
Thorne was born in Ashley, [[Utah]].

He participated at the ''[[Captain Marshall Field Expeditions#1st Captain Marshall Field Paleontological Expedition to Argentina and Bolivia|2nd Captain Marshall Field Paleontological Expedition]]'' in 1926. Other participants were [[Elmer S. Riggs]] (Leader and Photographer), [[Rudolf Stahlecker]] (Collector) and [[Felipe Mendez]]. The expedition started in April 1926 and finished in November 1926. The purpose was geology fossil collecting in Puerta Corral Quemado, Catamarca, Argentina, South America. The expedition was successful, and even new species like [[Stahleckeria]] have been found during this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/field_museum_library/3525670811/in/photostream/ Information by The Field Museum Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a veteran of World War I, an experienced outdoors man, mule driver and fossil collector. He was married to Constance and had with her a son, R. Neil Thorne. His letters about the expedition to his wife have 70 years later been published by their son at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/anh.2000.27.2.276a Archives of Natural History].

The '''Shuttle Landing Facility''' (SLF) {{Airport codes||KTTS|TTS}} is an [[airport]] located on [[Merritt Island, Florida|Merritt Island]] in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]], [[Florida]], [[United States|USA]]. It is a part of the [[Kennedy Space Center|John F. Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), and was used by [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] for landing until the program's end in 2011. It was also used  for takeoffs and landings for NASA training jets  such as the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] and for civilian aircraft.&lt;ref name="SLF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/slf.html|title= Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF)|accessdate=November 7, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landing101"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/launch/landing101.html|title=Shuttle Landing 101|accessdate=November 7, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2015, [[Space Florida]] manages and operates the facility under a 30-year lease from NASA. Private companies have been utilizing the SLF for its unique properties since 2011 and will continue to do so via Space Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs Agreement with Space Florida to Operate Historic Landing Facility|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-signs-agreement-with-space-florida-to-operate-historic-landing-facility-1|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 November 2015|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:ShuttleLandingFacilityMateDemate.jpg|thumb|left|The Mate-Demate Device at the Shuttle Landing Facility]]
The Shuttle Landing Facility covers {{convert|500|acre|ha}} and has a single runway, 15/33. It is [[List of longest runways|one of the longest runways in the world]], at {{convert|4572|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is {{convert|91.4|m|ft|sp=us}} wide.&lt;ref name="SLF" /&gt; (Despite its length, astronaut [[Jack R. Lousma]] stated that he would have preferred the runway to be "half as wide and twice as long".&lt;ref name="lousma20100315"&gt;{{cite interview | title = Jack R. Lousma Edited Oral History Transcript | url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/LousmaJR/LousmaJR_3-15-10.htm | date=2010-03-15 | accessdate=February 18, 2012 | last=Lousma | first=Jack R. | subjectlink=Jack R. Lousma | interviewer=Ross-Nazzal, Jennifer | work=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Additionally, the SLF has {{convert|305|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} of paved overruns at each end.  The [[Mate-Demate Device]] (MDD), for use when the shuttle was transported by the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], was located just off the runway.&lt;ref name="SLF" /&gt;

The runway is designated runway 15, or 33, depending on the direction of use. The runway surface consists of an extremely high-[[friction]] [[concrete]] strip designed to maximize the braking ability of the [[Space Shuttle]] at its high landing speed, with a paving thickness of {{convert|40.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the center.&lt;ref name="SLF" /&gt; It uses a grooved design to provide drainage and further increase the coefficient of friction.&lt;ref name="SLF" /&gt;  The original groove design was found to actually provide too much friction for the rubber used in the Shuttle's tires, causing failures during several landings. This issue was resolved by grinding down the pavement, reducing the depth of the grooves significantly.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

A local nickname for the runway is the "gator tanning facility", as some of the 4,000 [[American Alligator|alligators]] living at Kennedy Space Center regularly bask in the sun on the runway.&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/alligators/kscovr.html|title=Alligators and Rocketships|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512014453/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/alligators/kscovr.html|archivedate=2009-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing facility is managed by contractor [[EG&amp;G]], which provides air traffic control services, as well as managing potential hazards to landing aircraft, such as bird life.  The Bird Team kept the facility clear of both local and migratory birds during shuttle landings using [[pyrotechnic]]s, blank rounds fired from [[shotgun]]s and a series of 25 [[propane]] cannons arranged around the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/clearbirds.html|title=Bird Team Clears Path for Space Shuttles|last=Herridge|first=Linda |date=August 12, 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' was the first shuttle to arrive at the SLF via the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] on March 24, 1979.&lt;ref name="KSC History Quiz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy History Quiz|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/quiz_page_prt.htm#17|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The runway was first used by a space shuttle on 11 February 1984, when the [[STS-41-B]] mission returned to Earth.  This also marked the first-ever landing of a spacecraft at its launch site.  Prior to this, all shuttle landings were performed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] (with the exception of [[STS-3]], which landed at [[White Sands Space Harbor]]) while the landing facility continued testing and shuttle crews developed landing skills at White Sands and Edwards, where the margin for error is much greater than SLF and its water hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landing Sites|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XeKS0MeLsA|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 22, 1993, ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' was the first space shuttle to land at night at the SLF. A total of 78 shuttle missions landed at the SLF.&lt;ref name="KSC History Quiz"/&gt;

The final landing of a space shuttle occurred on July 21, 2011 by ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' for [[STS-135]]. ''Discovery'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' took off from the SLF on top of the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft#Ferry flights|Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] for museums in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles.

==Project Morpheus testing==
In 2012, [[NASA's Johnson Space Center]]'s [[Project Morpheus]]'s first vehicle arrived at KSC. Prior to arrival at KSC and throughout the project, Morpheus vehicle tests were performed at other NASA centers; KSC was the site for advanced testing. Multiple tests, including free flight, were performed at the SLF in 2013-2014. Multiple vehicles and iterations of the vehicles were tested, due to upgrades and damages during this experimental test program. During the August 9, 2012 test at the SLF, a vehicle exploded; no one was injured.

==Commercial use==
The SLF has also been used by commercial users. [[Zero Gravity Corporation]], which offers flights where passengers experience [[Vomit Comet|brief periods of microgravity]], has operated from the SLF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA HOSTS ZERO-G FLIGHTS AT SPACE SHUTTLE LANDING FACILITY|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/releases/2005/release-20051031.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; as have record-setting attempts by the [[Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Hosts GlobalFlyer|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/global_flyer_prt.htm|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[NASCAR]] teams have also used the facility for vehicle testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Runway to Racetrack: NASCAR Team Tests at Kennedy|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/nascartesting.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Space Shuttle''' was a partially [[reusable launch system|reusable]] [[low Earth orbit]]al [[spacecraft]] system operated by the U.S. [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) as part of the [[Space Shuttle program]].  Its official program name was ''Space Transportation System (STS)'', taken from a 1969 plan for [[Space Transportation System|a system of reusable spacecraft]] of which it was the only item funded for development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/taskgrp.html |title=Space Task Group Report, 1969 |first=Roger D. |last=Launius |publisher= NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982.  In addition to the prototype whose completion was cancelled, five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].  The Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.&lt;ref name="ShuttleByNumbers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon |publisher=Space.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |author=Malik, Tarik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuttle components included the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) with three clustered [[Rocketdyne RS-25]] main engines, a pair of recoverable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] (SRBs), and the expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] (ET) containing [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]].  The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to de-orbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|re-enter the atmosphere]].  The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].

The first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.  The U.S. has since relied primarily on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station.

==Overview==
The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable&lt;ref name=ft20110930&gt;{{cite news |last=Bewley |first=Elizabeth |title=SpaceX working on reusable rocket |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110930/NEWS02/309300020/SpaceX-working-reusable-rocket |accessdate=2011-09-30 |newspaper=Florida Today |date=September 30, 2011 |quote=''[many] rockets typically are used just once, although some partly reusable versions have been developed, such as the Space Shuttle.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human spaceflight]] vehicle capable of reaching [[low Earth orbit]], commissioned and operated by the U.S. [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) from 1981 to 2011. It resulted from shuttle design studies conducted by NASA and the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s and was first proposed for development as part of an ambitious second-generation [[Space Transportation System]] (STS) of space vehicles to follow the [[Apollo program]] in a September 1969 report of a Space Task Group headed by Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] to President [[Richard Nixon]]. Nixon's post-Apollo NASA budgeting withdrew support of all system components except the Shuttle, to which NASA applied the STS name.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The vehicle consisted of a [[spaceplane]] for orbit and re-entry, fueled from an expendable External Tank containing [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]], with two reusable strap-on solid rocket boosters. The [[STS-1|first]] of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982, all launched from the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy Space Center]], Florida.

Some payloads were launched into higher orbits with either of two different upper stages developed for the STS (single-stage [[Payload Assist Module]] or two-stage [[Inertial Upper Stage]]). The Space Shuttle was stacked in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]], and the stack mounted on a mobile launch platform held down by four [[frangible nut]]s&lt;ref name=nuts0&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/290339main_8-388221J.pdf|title=Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|accessdate=July 15, 2012|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on each SRB, which were detonated at launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solid Rocket Boosters|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/srb.html|publisher=NASA KSC|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shuttle stack launched vertically like a conventional rocket. It lifted off under the power of its two SRBs and three [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engines]], which were fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from the ET. The Space Shuttle had a two-stage ascent. The SRBs provided additional thrust during liftoff and first-stage flight. About two minutes after liftoff, frangible nuts were fired, releasing the SRBs, which then parachuted into the ocean, to be retrieved by [[NASA recovery ship]]s for refurbishment and reuse. The orbiter and ET continued to ascend on an increasingly horizontal flight path under power from its main engines. Upon reaching 17,500&amp;nbsp;mph (7.8&amp;nbsp;km/s), necessary for low Earth orbit, the main engines were shut down. The ET, attached by two frangible nuts&lt;ref name="nuts"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.fbodaily.com/cbd/archive/1997/11(November)/21-Nov-1997/25sol002.htm|title= PSA #1977| accessdate=July 15, 2012|publisher=Loren Data Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was then jettisoned to burn up in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=etuse/&gt; After jettisoning the external tank, the [[orbital maneuvering system]] (OMS) engines were used to adjust the orbit.

The orbiter carried [[astronaut]]s and payloads such as satellites or space station parts into low Earth orbit, the Earth's upper atmosphere or [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmos"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html |title=Earth's Atmosphere |accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=1995|author=NASA |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013232332/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html |archivedate= October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, five to seven crew members rode in the orbiter. Two crew members, the commander and pilot, were sufficient for a minimal flight, as in the first four "test" flights, STS-1 through STS-4. The typical payload capacity was about {{convert|50045|lb|kg|sigfig=3|sp=us}} but could be increased depending on the choice of launch configuration. The orbiter carried its payload in a large cargo bay with doors that opened along the length of its top, a feature which made the Space Shuttle unique among spacecraft. This feature made possible the deployment of large satellites such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and also the capture and return of large payloads back to Earth.

When the orbiter's space mission was complete, it fired its OMS thrusters to drop out of orbit and re-enter the lower atmosphere.&lt;ref name="atmos"/&gt; During descent, the orbiter passed through different layers of the atmosphere and decelerated from [[hypersonic]] speed primarily by [[aerobraking]]. In the lower atmosphere and landing phase, it was more like a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] but with [[reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters and [[fly-by-wire]]-controlled hydraulically actuated flight surfaces controlling its descent. It landed on a long runway as a conventional aircraft. The aerodynamic shape was a compromise between the demands of radically different speeds and air pressures during re-entry, hypersonic flight, and subsonic atmospheric flight. As a result, the orbiter had a relatively high [[sink rate]] at low altitudes, and it transitioned during re-entry from using RCS thrusters at very high altitudes to flight surfaces in the lower atmosphere.

The formal design of what became the Space Shuttle began with the "Phase A" contract design studies issued in the late 1960s. Conceptualization [[Space Shuttle design process|had begun two decades earlier]], before the [[Apollo program]] of the 1960s. One of the places the concept of a spacecraft returning from space to a horizontal landing originated was within [[NACA]], in 1954, in the form of an [[aeronautics]] research experiment later named the [[North American X-15|X-15]]. The NACA proposal was submitted by [[Walter Dornberger]].

In 1958, the X-15 concept further developed into a proposal to launch an X-15 into space, and another [[X-plane|X-series]] [[spaceplane]] proposal, named [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]], as well as variety of aerospace plane concepts and studies. [[Neil Armstrong]] was selected to pilot both the X-15 and the X-20. Though the X-20 was not built, another spaceplane similar to the X-20 was built several years later and delivered to NASA in January 1966 called the [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] ("HL" indicated "horizontal landing").

In the mid-1960s, the [[U.S. Air Force]] conducted classified [[North American DC-3#History|studies]] on next-generation space transportation systems and concluded that semi-reusable designs were the cheapest choice. It proposed a development program with an immediate start on a "Class&amp;nbsp;I" vehicle with expendable boosters, followed by slower development of a "Class&amp;nbsp;II" semi-reusable design and possible "Class&amp;nbsp;III" fully reusable design later. In 1967, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] held a one-day symposium at NASA headquarters to study the options. Eighty people attended and presented a wide variety of designs, including earlier U.S. Air Force designs such as the X-20 Dyna-Soar.

In 1968, NASA officially began work on what was then known as the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV). At the same time, NASA held a separate Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) competition. NASA offices in [[Houston]] and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] jointly issued a [[Request for Proposal]] (RFP) for ILRV studies to design a spacecraft that could deliver a payload to orbit but also re-enter the atmosphere and fly back to Earth. For example, one of the responses was for a two-stage design, featuring a large booster and a small orbiter, called the [[North American DC-3|DC-3]], one of several Phase A Shuttle designs. After the aforementioned "Phase A" studies, B, C, and D phases progressively evaluated in-depth designs up to 1972. In the final design, the bottom stage consisted of recoverable solid rocket boosters, and the top stage used an expendable external tank.&lt;ref name=lindroos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=INTRODUCTION TO FUTURE LAUNCH VEHICLE PLANS [1963–2001&amp;#93; Updated 6/15/2001, by Marcus Lindroos |publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] decided to [[Space Shuttle design process#Decision-making process|support proceeding]] with Space Shuttle development. A series of development programs and analysis refined the basic design, prior to full development and testing. In August 1973, the [[Martin-Marietta X-24B|X-24B]] proved that an unpowered spaceplane could re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a horizontal landing.

Across the Atlantic, European ministers met in Belgium in 1973 to authorize Western Europe's manned orbital project and its main contribution to Space Shuttle{{mdash}}the [[Spacelab]] program.&lt;ref name="sl98"/&gt; Spacelab would provide a multidisciplinary orbital space laboratory and additional space equipment for the Shuttle.&lt;ref name="sl98"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Columbia STS-1 arrival at launch pad.jpg|thumb|right|STS-1 on the launch pad, December 1980]]

The Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]]. It carried different payloads to low Earth orbit, provided crew rotation and supplies for the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and performed satellite servicing and repair. The orbiter could also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to Earth. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended. The person in charge of designing the STS was [[Maxime Faget]], who had also overseen the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]] spacecraft designs. The crucial factor in the size and shape of the Shuttle orbiter was the requirement that it be able to accommodate the largest planned commercial and military satellites, and have over 1,000 mile cross-range recovery range to meet the requirement for classified USAF missions for a once-around abort from a launch to a [[polar orbit]]. The militarily specified {{convert|1,085|nmi|abbr=on}} cross range requirement was one of the primary reasons for the Shuttle's large wings, compared to modern commercial designs with very minimal control surfaces and glide capability. Factors involved in opting for solid rockets and an expendable fuel tank included the desire of the Pentagon to obtain a high-capacity payload vehicle for satellite deployment, and the desire of the Nixon administration to reduce the costs of [[space exploration]] by developing a spacecraft with reusable components.

Each Space Shuttle was a [[reusable launch system]] composed of three main assemblies: the reusable OV, the expendable ET, and the two reusable SRBs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/system/system_STS.html Shuttle Basics]. NASA.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the OV entered orbit shortly after the tank and boosters are jettisoned. The vehicle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket, and the orbiter glided to a horizontal landing like an airplane, after which it was refurbished for reuse. The SRBs parachuted to splashdown in the ocean where they were towed back to shore and refurbished for later Shuttle missions.

[[File:STS-133 Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver 3.jpg|thumb|Tail-end of an orbiter showing various nozzles during an orbital maneuver with ISS]]
Five operational OVs were built: ''Columbia'' (OV-102), ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099), ''Discovery'' (OV-103), ''Atlantis'' (OV-104), and ''Endeavour'' (OV-105). A mock-up, ''[[Space Shuttle Inspiration|Inspiration]]'', currently stands at the entrance to the Astronaut Hall of Fame. An additional craft, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' (OV-101), was built for atmospheric testing gliding and landing; it was originally intended to be outfitted for orbital operations after the test program, but it was found more economical to upgrade the structural test article STA-099 into orbiter ''Challenger'' (OV-099). ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|disintegrated]] 73 seconds after launch in 1986, and ''Endeavour'' was built as a replacement from structural spare components. Building ''Endeavour'' cost about US$1.7&amp;nbsp;billion. [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' broke apart]] over Texas during re-entry in 2003.

A Space Shuttle launch cost around $450&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html |title=NASA – Space Shuttle and International Space Station |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger A. Pielke, Jr.]] has estimated that the [[Space Shuttle program]] cost about US$170&amp;nbsp;billion (2008 dollars) through early 2008; the average cost per flight was about US$1.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=duggins&gt;[http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2656-2008.18.pdf ''The Rise and Fall of the Space Shuttle''], Book Review: Final Countdown: NASA and the End of the Space Shuttle Program by Pat Duggins, ''American Scientist'', 2008, Vol. 96, No. 5, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Two missions were paid for by Germany, Spacelab [[STS-61-A|D1]] and [[STS-55|D2]] (D for ''Deutschland'') with a payload control center in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Spacelab D1 mission – 25 years ago|url= http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/Spacelab_D1_mission_25_years_ago|website= European Space Agency|accessdate= 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Europe at Helm of Tests on Next Spacelab Flight|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-28/news/mn-11677_1_spacelab|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 1985-10-28|access-date= 2015-11-28|issn= 0458-3035|language= en-US|first= LEE|last= DYE}}&lt;/ref&gt; D1 was the first time that control of a manned STS mission payload was not in U.S. hands.&lt;ref name=Interavia85/&gt;

At times, the orbiter itself was referred to as the Space Shuttle. This was not technically correct as the ''Space Shuttle'' was the combination of the orbiter, the external tank, and the two solid rocket boosters. These components, once assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] originally built to assemble the Apollo Saturn V rocket, were commonly referred to as the "stack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/events/exhibits/html/s91-39574.html|title=NASA - NASA - JSC Exhibits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for the Shuttle components was spread among multiple NASA field centers. The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=Nasa Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiter vehicle===
{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}
[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left to right: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]

The orbiter resembled a conventional aircraft, with double-[[delta wings]] swept 81° at the inner leading edge and 45° at the outer leading edge. Its vertical stabilizer's leading edge was swept back at a 50° angle. The four [[elevon]]s, mounted at the trailing edge of the wings, and the [[rudder]]/speed brake, attached at the trailing edge of the stabilizer, with the body flap, controlled the orbiter during descent and landing.

The orbiter's {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|adj=on}}-long payload bay, comprising most of the [[fuselage]], could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Information declassified in 2011 showed that these measurements were chosen specifically to accommodate the [[KH-9 HEXAGON]] spy satellite operated by the [[National Reconnaissance Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guillemette |first=Roger |url=https://news.yahoo.com/declassified-us-spy-satellites-reveal-rare-look-secret-140205867.html |title=Declassified US Spy Satellites Reveal Rare Look at Secret Cold War Space Program |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two mostly-symmetrical lengthwise payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay comprised its entire top. Payloads were generally loaded horizontally into the bay while the orbiter was standing upright on the launch pad and unloaded vertically in the near-weightless orbital environment by the orbiter's robotic [[Canada arm|remote manipulator arm]] (under astronaut control), EVA astronauts, or under the payloads' own power (as for satellites attached to a rocket "upper stage" for deployment.)

Three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The engine nozzles could [[gimbal]] 10.5 degrees up and down, and 8.5 degrees from side to side during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The orbiter structure was made primarily from [[Aluminium|aluminum]] [[alloy]], although the engine structure was made primarily from [[titanium]] alloy.

The operational orbiters built were OV-102 ''Columbia'', OV-099 ''Challenger'', OV-103 ''Discovery'', OV-104 ''Atlantis'', and OV-105 ''Endeavour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/orbiters.html |title= Orbiter Vehicles |publisher=NASA Kennedy Space Center |accessdate=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External tank===

[[File:STS-135 External Tank floats away.jpg|thumb|left|An external tank floats away from the orbiter.]]
[[File:Space Shuttle external tank assembly 01.jpg|thumb|Interior of an External Tank]]

The main function of the Space Shuttle external tank was to supply the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel to the main engines. It was also the backbone of the launch vehicle, providing attachment points for the two solid rocket boosters and the orbiter. The external tank was the only part of the Shuttle system that was not reused. Although the external tanks were always discarded, it would have been possible to take them into orbit and re-use them (such as a [[wet workshop]] for incorporation into a space station).&lt;ref name=etuse&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, "Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system"].

===Solid rocket boosters===
{{main|Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster}}

Two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) each provided {{convert|2800000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=3}} of thrust at liftoff,&lt;ref name="Columbia Accid Report D.7"&gt;[http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol2/part07.pdf Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report, Vol II, Appendix D.7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411132700/http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol2/part07.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}. NASA, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; which was 83% of the total thrust at liftoff. The SRBs were jettisoned two minutes after launch at a height of about {{convert|150000|ft|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and then deployed parachutes and landed in the ocean to be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Space Shuttle Columbia Launch |url=http://www.asterpix.com/console?as=1203639196321-20328515dc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607055607/http://www.asterpix.com/console/?as=1203639196321-20328515dc |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SRB cases were made of steel about ½&amp;nbsp;inch (13&amp;nbsp;mm) thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NASA|url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appl2b.htm|title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solid rocket boosters were re-used many times; the casing used in [[Ares I]] engine testing in 2009 consisted of motor cases that had been flown, collectively, on 48 Shuttle missions, including STS-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/09-053.html NASA Ares I First Stage Motor to be Tested August 25].

===Orbiter add-ons===
The orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-ons depending on the mission. This included orbital laboratories ([[Spacelab]], [[Spacehab]]), boosters for launching payloads farther into space ([[Inertial Upper Stage]], [[Payload Assist Module]]), and other functions, such as provided by [[Extended Duration Orbiter]], [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]]s, or [[Canadarm]] (RMS). An upper stage called [[Transfer Orbit Stage]] (Orbital Science Corp.

A major component of the Space Shuttle Program was Spacelab, primarily contributed by a consortium of European countries, and operated in conjunction with the United States and international partners.&lt;ref name=NASA28/&gt; Supported by a modular system of pressurized modules, pallets, and systems, Spacelab missions executed on multidisciplinary science, orbital logistics, and international cooperation.&lt;ref name=NASA28/&gt; Over 29 missions flew on subjects ranging from astronomy, microgravity, radar, and life sciences, to name a few.&lt;ref name=NASA28/&gt; Spacelab hardware also supported missions such as Hubble (HST) servicing and space station resupply.&lt;ref name=NASA28/&gt; STS-2 and STS-3 provided testing, and the first full mission was Spacelab-1 ([[STS-9]]) launched on November 28, 1983.&lt;ref name=NASA28/&gt;

Spacelab formally began in 1973, after a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, by European heads of state.&lt;ref name="sl98"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_10_1998_i_EN.html |title=ESA – '''N° 10-1998: 25 years of Spacelab – Go for Space Station''' |publisher=Esa.int |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the decade, Spacelab went into orbit and provided Europe and the United States with an orbital workshop and hardware system.&lt;ref name="sl98"/&gt; International cooperation, science, and exploration were realized on Spacelab.&lt;ref name=NASA28/&gt;

===Flight systems===
The Shuttle was one of the earliest craft to use a computerized [[fly-by-wire]] digital [[flight control system]]. This means no mechanical or hydraulic linkages connected the pilot's control stick to the control surfaces or reaction control system thrusters. The control algorithm, which used a classical [[PID controller|Proportional Integral Derivative]] (PID) approach, was developed and maintained by [[Honeywell]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The Shuttle's [[fly-by-wire]] digital [[flight control system]] was composed of 4 control systems each addressing a different mission phase: Ascent, Descent, On-Orbit and Aborts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Honeywell is also credited with the design and implementation of the Shuttle's Nose Wheel Steering Control Algorithm that allowed the Orbiter to safely land at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

A concern with using digital fly-by-wire systems on the Shuttle was reliability. Considerable research went into the Shuttle computer system. The Shuttle used five identical redundant IBM 32-bit general purpose computers (GPCs), model [[IBM AP-101|AP-101]], constituting a type of [[embedded system]]. Four computers ran specialized software called the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS). A fifth backup computer ran separate software called the Backup Flight System (BFS). Collectively they were called the Data Processing System (DPS).&lt;ref name="LogicD"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design|url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html|title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The surface of the vehicle is colored by the pressure coefficient, and the gray contours represent the density of the surrounding air, as calculated using the [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]] software package.]]
The design goal of the Shuttle's DPS was fail-operational/fail-safe reliability. After a single failure, the Shuttle could still continue the mission. After two failures, it could still land safely.

The four general-purpose computers operated essentially in lockstep, checking each other. If one computer provided a different result than the other three (i.e. the one computer failed), the three functioning computers "voted" it out of the system. This isolated it from vehicle control. If a second computer of the three remaining failed, the two functioning computers voted it out. A very unlikely failure mode would have been where two of the computers produced result A, and two produced result B (a two-two split). In this unlikely case, one group of two was to be picked at random.

The Backup Flight System (BFS) was separately developed software running on the fifth computer, used only if the entire four-computer primary system failed. The BFS was created because although the four primary computers were hardware redundant, they all ran the same software, so a generic software problem could crash all of them. Embedded system [[Avionics|avionic]] software was developed under totally different conditions from public commercial software: the number of code lines was tiny compared to a public commercial software product, changes were only made infrequently and with extensive testing, and many programming and test personnel worked on the small amount of computer code. However, in theory it could have still failed, and the BFS existed for that contingency. While the BFS could run in parallel with PASS, the BFS never engaged to take over control from PASS during any Shuttle mission.

The software for the Shuttle computers was written in a high-level language called [[HAL/S]], somewhat similar to [[PL/I]]. It is specifically designed for a [[Real-time computing|real time]] embedded system environment.

The IBM AP-101 computers originally had about 424 kilobytes of [[magnetic core memory]] each. The CPU could process about 400,000 instructions per second. They had no hard disk drive, and loaded software from magnetic tape cartridges.

In 1990, the original computers were replaced with an upgraded model AP-101S, which had about 2.5 times the memory capacity (about 1 megabyte) and three times the processor speed (about 1.2&amp;nbsp;million instructions per second). The memory was changed from magnetic core to semiconductor with battery backup.

Early Shuttle missions, starting in November 1983, took along the [[Grid Compass]], arguably one of the first laptop computers. The GRiD was given the name SPOC, for Shuttle Portable Onboard Computer. Use on the Shuttle required both hardware and software modifications which were incorporated into later versions of the commercial product. It was used to monitor and display the Shuttle's ground position, path of the next two orbits, show where the Shuttle had line of sight communications with ground stations, and determine points for location-specific observations of the Earth. The Compass sold poorly, as it cost at least US$8000, but it offered unmatched performance for its weight and size.&lt;ref name="GRiD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1139464298 |title=Pioneering the Laptop:Engineering the GRiD Compass |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=The Computer History Museum |year=2006 |author=The Computer History Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204034101/http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1139464298 |archivedate=December 4, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA was one of its main customers.&lt;ref name="GRiDNASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20020090827_2002146711.pdf|title=Portable Compute |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |publisher=NASA |year=1985 |author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its service life, the Shuttle's Control System never experienced a failure. Many of the lessons learned have been used to design today's high speed control algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/flyfeature_shuttlecomputers.html|title=NASA - Shuttle Computers Navigate Record of Reliability|last=KSC|first=Steven Siceloff,|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiter markings and insignia===
[[File:NASA-MHughes-Fulford.JPG|thumb|Payload specialist [[Millie Hughes-Fulford]], who flew aboard ''Columbia'' in 1991, displays the modernist Blackburn &amp; Danne NASA logotype, known as "the worm".]]

The prototype orbiter ''Enterprise'' originally had a [[flag of the United States]] on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters "USA" in black on the right wing. The name "Enterprise" was painted in black on the payload bay doors just above the hinge and behind the crew module; on the aft end of the payload bay doors was the [[NASA insignia|NASA "worm" logotype]] in gray. Underneath the rear of the payload bay doors on the side of the fuselage just above the wing is the text "United States" in black with a flag of the United States ahead of it.

The first operational orbiter, ''Columbia'', originally had the same markings as ''Enterprise'', although the letters "USA" on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart. ''Columbia'' also had black markings which ''Enterprise'' lacked on its forward RCS module, around the cockpit windows, and on its vertical stabilizer, and had distinctive black "chines" on the forward part of its upper wing surfaces, which none of the other orbiters had.

''Challenger'' established a modified marking scheme for the shuttle fleet that was matched by ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour''. The letters "USA" in black above an American flag were displayed on the left wing, with the NASA "worm" logotype in gray centered above the name of the orbiter in black on the right wing. The name of the orbiter was inscribed not on the payload bay doors, but on the forward fuselage just below and behind the cockpit windows. This would make the name visible when the shuttle was photographed in orbit with the doors open.

In 1983, ''Enterprise'' had its wing markings changed to match ''Challenger'', and the NASA "worm" logotype on the aft end of the payload bay doors was changed from gray to black. Some black markings were added to the nose, cockpit windows and vertical tail to more closely resemble the flight vehicles, but the name "Enterprise" remained on the payload bay doors as there was never any need to open them. ''Columbia'' had its name moved to the forward fuselage to match the other flight vehicles after [[STS-61-C]], during the 1986–88 hiatus when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], but retained its original wing markings until its last overhaul (after [[STS-93]]), and its unique black wing "chines" for the remainder of its operational life.

Beginning in 1998, the flight vehicles' markings were modified to incorporate the NASA [[NASA insignia|"meatball" insignia]]. The "worm" logotype, which the agency had phased out, was removed from the payload bay doors and the "meatball" insignia was added aft of the "United States" text on the lower aft fuselage. The "meatball" insignia was also displayed on the left wing, with the American flag above the orbiter's name, left-justified rather than centered, on the right wing. The three surviving flight vehicles, ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'', still bear these markings as museum displays. ''Enterprise'' became the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1985 and was no longer under NASA's control when these changes were made, hence the prototype orbiter still has its 1983 markings and still has its name on the payload bay doors.

===Upgrades===
[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]]. (composite image)]]

The Space Shuttle was initially developed in the 1970s,&lt;ref name="shuttle_sale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=9574776 |title=Recession Special: NASA Cuts Space Shuttle Price |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |date= January 15, 2010 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=January 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118122624/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=9574776|archivedate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but received many upgrades and modifications afterward to improve performance, reliability and safety. Internally, the Shuttle remained largely similar to the original design, with the exception of the improved avionics computers. In addition to the computer upgrades, the original analog primary flight instruments were replaced with modern full-color, flat-panel display screens, called a [[glass cockpit]], which is similar to those of contemporary airliners. To facilitate construction of ISS, the internal airlocks of each orbiter except ''Columbia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Justin|title=Flying into the future|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/features/000414overhaul/future.html|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=May 4, 2018|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were replaced with external docking systems to allow for a greater amount of cargo to be stored on the Shuttle's mid-deck during station resupply missions.

The Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. This explains phrases such as "Main engines throttling up to 104 percent." This did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit. The 100 percent figure was the original specified power level. During the lengthy development program, [[Rocketdyne]] determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust. NASA could have rescaled the output number, saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent. To clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software, so the 104 percent number was retained. SSME upgrades were denoted as "block numbers", such as block I, block II, and block IIA. The upgrades improved engine reliability, maintainability and performance. The 109% thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the Block II engines in 2001. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106 percent or 109 percent used for mission aborts.

For the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was painted white to protect the insulation that covers much of the tank, but improvements and testing showed that it was not required. The weight saved by not painting the tank resulted in an increase in payload capability to orbit.&lt;ref name="aerospaceweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/spacecraft/q0285.shtml|title=Space Shuttle External Tank Foam Insulation |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=Aerospaceweb.org |year=2006 |author=Aerospaceweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional weight was saved by removing some of the internal "stringers" in the hydrogen tank that proved unnecessary. The resulting "light-weight external tank" was first flown on STS-6 &lt;ref name=toba&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sivolella|first1=Davide|title=To Orbit and Back Again|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-0982-3|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used on the majority of Shuttle missions. [[STS-91]] saw the first flight of the "super light-weight external tank". This version of the tank was made of the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy. It weighed 3.4 metric tons (7,500&amp;nbsp;lb) less than the last run of lightweight tanks, allowing the Shuttle to deliver heavy elements to ISS's high inclination orbit.&lt;ref name=toba/&gt; As the Shuttle was always operated with a crew, each of these improvements was first flown on operational mission flights.

The solid rocket boosters underwent improvements as well. Design engineers added a third [[O-ring]] seal to the joints between the segments after the 1986 Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster.

[[File:SSME1.jpg|thumb|upright|The three nozzles of the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] with the two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) pods, and the [[vertical stabilizer]] above.]]
Several other SRB improvements were planned to improve performance and safety, but never came to be. These culminated in the considerably simpler, lower cost, probably safer and better-performing [[Advanced Solid Rocket Booster]]. These rockets entered production in the early to mid-1990s to support the Space Station, but were later canceled to save money after the expenditure of $2.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopedia Astronautica |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvfam/shuttle.htm |title=Shuttle |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118201447/http://www.astronautix.com/lvfam/shuttle.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the ASRB program resulted in the development of the Super LightWeight external Tank (SLWT), which provided some of the increased payload capability, while not providing any of the safety improvements. In addition, the U.S. Air Force developed their own much lighter single-piece SRB design using a filament-wound system, but this too was canceled.

[[STS-70]] was delayed in 1995, when [[woodpecker]]s bored holes in the foam insulation of ''Discovery'''s external tank. Since then, NASA has installed commercial plastic owl decoys and inflatable owl balloons which had to be removed prior to launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-70/woodpecker.html|title=Woodpeckers damage STS-70 External Tank|accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Jim Dumoulin |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delicate nature of the foam insulation had been the cause of damage to the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|Thermal Protection System]], the tile heat shield and heat wrap of the orbiter. NASA remained confident that this damage, while it was the primary cause of the Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster on February 1, 2003, would not jeopardize the completion of the International Space Station (ISS) in the projected time allotted.

A cargo-only, unmanned variant of the Shuttle was variously proposed and rejected since the 1980s. It was called the [[Shuttle-C]], and would have traded re-usability for cargo capability, with large potential savings from reusing technology developed for the Space Shuttle. Another proposal was to convert the payload bay into a passenger area, with versions ranging from 30 to 74 seats, three days in orbit, and cost US$1.5&amp;nbsp;million per seat.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web |author=Peter Wainwright (spacefuture.com) |url=http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_space_tourist.shtml |title=L David, R Citron, T Rogers &amp; C D Walker, April 25–28, 1985, "The Space Tourist", AAS 85-771 to −774. Proceedings of the Fourth Annual L5 Space Development Conference held April 25–28, 1985, in Washington, D.C |publisher=Spacefuture.com |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets were worn. A less-bulky, partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet was reinstated when Shuttle flights resumed in 1988. The Launch-Entry Suit ended its service life in late 1995, and was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which resembled the [[Gemini space suit]] in design, but retained the orange color of the Launch-Entry Suit.

To extend the duration that orbiters could stay docked at the ISS, the [[Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System]] (SSPTS) was installed. The SSPTS allowed these orbiters to use power provided by the ISS to preserve their consumables. The SSPTS was first used successfully on [[STS-118]].

===Launch preparation===
{{See also|Space shuttle launch countdown|Space shuttle launch commit criteria}}

All Space Shuttle missions were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The [[Space shuttle launch commit criteria|weather criteria used for launch]] included, but were not limited to: precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, lightning forecast, wind, and humidity.&lt;ref name="weather launch criteria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm|title=SPACE SHUTTLE WEATHER LAUNCH COMMIT CRITERIA AND KSC END OF MISSION WEATHER LANDING CRITERIA|work=KSC Release No. 39-99|publisher=NASA Kennedy Space Center|accessdate=July 6, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626180630/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm|archivedate=June 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by [[lightning]]. Aircraft are often struck by lightning with no adverse effects because the electricity of the strike is dissipated through its conductive structure and the aircraft is not electrically [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]]. Like most jet airliners, the Shuttle was mainly constructed of conductive aluminum, which would normally shield and protect the internal systems. However, upon liftoff the Shuttle sent out a long exhaust plume as it ascended, and this plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground. The NASA Anvil Rule for a Shuttle launch stated that an [[anvil cloud]] could not appear within a distance of 10 [[nautical miles]].&lt;ref name="anvil"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the weather conditions had to be acceptable at one of the Transatlantic Abort Landing sites (one of several [[Space Shuttle abort modes]]) to launch as well as the solid rocket booster recovery area.&lt;ref name="weather launch criteria" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA Launch Blog. [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sts-121/launch-vlcc_070106.html]. Retrieved June 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Shuttle might have safely endured a lightning strike, a [[Apollo 12#Mission highlights|similar strike caused problems on Apollo 12]], so for safety [[NASA]] chose not to launch the Shuttle if lightning was possible (NPR8715.5).

Historically, the Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January (a year-end rollover or YERO). Its flight software, designed in the 1970s, was not designed for this, and would require the orbiter's computers be reset through a change of year, which could cause a glitch while in orbit. In 2007, NASA engineers devised a solution so Shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary.&lt;ref name="YERO"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergin |first=Chris |title=NASA solves YERO problem for Shuttle |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418182718/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026 |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |date= February 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch===
After the final hold in the countdown at T-minus 9 minutes, the Shuttle went through its final preparations for launch, and the countdown was automatically controlled by the Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS), software at the Launch Control Center, which stopped the count if it sensed a critical problem with any of the Shuttle's onboard systems. The GLS handed off the count to the Shuttle's on-board computers at T minus 31 seconds, in a process called auto sequence start.

At T-minus 16 seconds, the massive sound suppression system (SPS) began to drench the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]] (MLP) and SRB trenches with {{convert|300000|USgal|m3|sigfig=2}} of water to protect the Orbiter from damage by [[acoustical]] energy and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and MLP during lift off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html|title=NASA - Sound Suppression System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sps"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

At T-minus 10 seconds, hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition. Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase. The main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time. The computers reciprocated this action by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phase.

[[File:020408 STS110 Atlantis launch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Space Shuttle Main Engine ignition]]
The three main engines (SSMEs) started at ''T''-6.6 seconds. The main engines ignited sequentially via the Shuttle's general purpose computers (GPCs) at 120 millisecond intervals. All three SSMEs were required to reach 90% rated thrust within three seconds, otherwise the onboard computers would initiate an [[RSLS Abort|RSLS abort]]. If all three engines indicated nominal performance by ''T''-3 seconds, they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for ignition at ''T''-0.&lt;ref name="countdown101"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration. [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/countdown101.html "NASA – Countdown 101"]. Retrieved July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Between ''T''-6.6 seconds and ''T''-3 seconds, while the SSMEs were firing but the SRBs were still bolted to the pad, the offset thrust caused the entire launch stack (boosters, tank and orbiter) to pitch down {{convert|25.5|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} measured at the tip of the external tank. The three second delay after confirmation of SSME operation was to allow the stack to return to nearly vertical. At ''T''-0 seconds, the 8 [[Pyrotechnic fastener|frangible nuts]] holding the SRBs to the pad were detonated, the SSMEs were commanded to 100% throttle, and the SRBs were ignited. By ''T''+0.23 seconds, the SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence, and reached maximum chamber pressure by ''T''+0.6 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shuttle Crew Operations Manual |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/390651main_shuttle_crew_operations_manual.pdf |website=nasa.gov |accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johnson Space Center]]'s [[Mission Control Center]] assumed control of the flight once the SRBs had cleared the launch tower.

Shortly after liftoff, the Shuttle's main engines were throttled up to 104.5% and the vehicle began a combined roll, pitch and yaw maneuver that placed it onto the correct heading (azimuth) for the planned orbital inclination and in a heads down attitude with wings level. The Shuttle flew upside down during the ascent phase. This orientation allowed a trim angle of attack that was favorable for aerodynamic loads during the region of high dynamic pressure, resulting in a net positive load factor, as well as providing the flight crew with a view of the horizon as a visual reference. The vehicle climbed in a progressively flattening arc, accelerating as the mass of the SRBs and main tank decreased. To achieve low orbit requires much more horizontal than vertical acceleration. This was not visually obvious, since the vehicle rose vertically and was out of sight for most of the horizontal acceleration. The near circular orbital velocity at the {{convert|380|km|mi|sigfig=3|sp=us}} altitude of the International Space Station is {{convert|27650|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}}, roughly equivalent to Mach 23 at sea level. As the International Space Station orbits at an inclination of 51.6 degrees, missions going there must set orbital inclination to the same value in order to rendezvous with the station.

Around 30 seconds into ascent, the SSMEs were throttled down—usually to 72%, though this varied—to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces acting on the Shuttle at a point called [[Max Q]]. Additionally, the propellant grain design of the SRBs caused their thrust to drop by about 30% by 50 seconds into ascent. Once the Orbiter's guidance verified that Max Q would be within Shuttle structural limits, the main engines were throttled back up to 104.5%; this throttling down and back up was called the "thrust bucket". To maximize performance, the throttle level and timing of the thrust bucket was shaped to bring the Shuttle as close to aerodynamic limits as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aerodynamics and Flight Dynamics |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/584730main_Wings-ch4d-pgs226-241.pdf |website= nasa.gov |date=February 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STS-1 The Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters break away from Columbia's External Tank.jpg|thumb|right|Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) separation during STS-1. The white external tank pictured was used on STS-1 and STS-2.]]
At around ''T''+126 seconds, [[pyrotechnic fastener]]s released the SRBs and small separation rockets pushed them laterally away from the vehicle. The SRBs parachuted back to the ocean to be reused. The Shuttle then began accelerating to orbit on the main engines. Acceleration at this point would typically fall to .9 ''[[g-force|g]]'', and the vehicle would take on a somewhat nose-up angle to the horizon{{spaced ndash}}it used the main engines to gain and then maintain altitude while it accelerated horizontally towards orbit. At about five and three-quarter minutes into ascent, the orbiter's direct communication links with the ground began to fade, at which point it rolled heads up to reroute its communication links to the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite]] system.

At about seven and a half minutes into ascent, the mass of the vehicle was low enough that the engines had to be throttled back to limit vehicle acceleration to 3 ''g'' (29.4&amp;nbsp;m/s² or 96.5&amp;nbsp;ft/s², equivalent to accelerating from zero to {{convert|105.9|km/h|mph|abbr=on|}} in a second). The Shuttle would maintain this acceleration for the next minute, and main engine cut-off (MECO) occurred at about eight and a half minutes after launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ascent Timeline and Abort Boundaries - STS-135 |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/fdf/135ascent.html |website=SpaceflightNow |accessdate=May 4, 2018|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main engines were shut down before complete depletion of propellant, as running dry would have destroyed the engines. The oxygen supply was terminated before the hydrogen supply, as the SSMEs reacted unfavorably to other shutdown modes. (Liquid oxygen has a tendency to react violently, and supports combustion when it encounters hot engine metal.) A few seconds after MECO, the external tank was released by firing pyrotechnic fasteners.

At this point the Shuttle and external tank were on a slightly suborbital trajectory, coasting up towards [[apogee]]. Once at apogee, about half an hour after MECO, the Shuttle's [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines were fired to raise its [[perigee]] and achieve orbit, while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean depending on launch profile.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;  The sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of pressure relief systems on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere. After the foam burned away during re-entry, the heat caused a pressure buildup in the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen until the tank exploded. This ensured that any pieces that fell back to Earth were small.

;Ascent tracking

[[File:STS-131 afterglow.jpg|thumb|Multicolored [[afterglow]] of the [[STS-131]] launch]]

The Shuttle was monitored throughout its ascent for short range tracking (10 seconds before liftoff through 57 seconds after), medium range (7 seconds before liftoff through 110 seconds after) and long range (7 seconds before liftoff through 165 seconds after). Short range cameras included 22 16mm cameras on the Mobile Launch Platform and 8 16mm on the Fixed Service Structure, 4 high speed fixed cameras located on the perimeter of the launch complex plus an additional 42 fixed cameras with 16mm motion picture film. Medium range cameras included remotely operated tracking cameras at the launch complex plus 6 sites along the immediate coast north and south of the launch pad, each with 800mm lens and high speed cameras running 100 frames per second. These cameras ran for only 4–10 seconds due to limitations in the amount of film available. Long range cameras included those mounted on the external tank, SRBs and orbiter itself which streamed live video back to the ground providing valuable information about any debris falling during ascent. Long range tracking cameras with 400-inch film and 200-inch video lenses were operated by a photographer at [[Playalinda Beach]] as well as 9 other sites from 38 miles north at the [[Ponce Inlet]] to 23 miles south to [[Patrick Air Force Base]] (PAFB) and additional mobile optical tracking camera was stationed on Merritt Island during launches. A total of 10 HD cameras were used both for ascent information for engineers and broadcast feeds to networks such as [[NASA TV]] and [[HDNet]]. The number of cameras significantly increased and numerous existing cameras were upgraded at the recommendation of the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] to provide better information about the debris during launch. Debris was also tracked using a pair of [[Weibel Scientific|Weibel]] Continuous Pulse Doppler X-band radars, one on board the SRB recovery ship [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] positioned north east of the launch pad and on a ship positioned south of the launch pad. Additionally, during the first 2 flights following the loss of ''Columbia'' and her crew, a pair of NASA [[WB-57]] reconnaissance aircraft equipped with HD Video and Infrared flew at {{convert|60000|ft}} to provide additional views of the launch ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shuttle launch imagery from land, air and water|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/167722main_LaunchImagery06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy Space Center also invested nearly $3&amp;nbsp;million in improvements to the digital video analysis systems in support of debris tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/rtf_optics100903.html |title=New Eyes for Shuttle Launches |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=November 22, 2007 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In orbit===
Once in orbit, the Shuttle usually flew at an altitude of {{convert|320|km|nmi|abbr=on}}, although the [[STS-82]] mission reached {{convert|620|km|nmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anthony R. Curtis, editor@spacetoday.org |url=http://www.spacetoday.org/Questions/PolarSats.html |title=Space Today Online – Answers To Your Questions |publisher=Spacetoday.org |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s, many flights involved space science missions on the NASA/ESA Spacelab, or launching various types of satellites and science probes. By the 1990s and 2000s the focus shifted more to servicing the space station, with fewer satellite launches. Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the [[Extended Duration Orbiter]] add-on or when attached to a space station. [[STS-80]] was the longest at almost 17 days and 16 hours.

===Re-entry and landing===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2007}}

Almost the entire Space Shuttle re-entry procedure, except for lowering the landing gear and deploying the air data probes, was normally performed under computer control. However, the re-entry could be flown entirely manually if an emergency arose. The approach and landing phase could be controlled by the autopilot, but was usually hand flown.

[[File:Space Shuttle Atlantis in the sky on July 21, 2011, to its final landing.jpg|thumb|right|Glowing plasma trail from Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' re-entry as seen from the Space Station]]
The vehicle began re-entry by firing the Orbital maneuvering system engines, while flying upside down, backside first, in the opposite direction to orbital motion for approximately three minutes, which reduced the Shuttle's velocity by about  {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The resultant slowing of the Shuttle lowered its orbital [[perigee]] down into the upper atmosphere. The Shuttle then flipped over, by pushing its nose down (which was actually "up" relative to the Earth, because it was flying upside down). This OMS firing was done roughly halfway around the globe from the landing site.

The vehicle started encountering more significant air density in the lower thermosphere at about {{convert|400000|ft|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, at around [[Mach number|Mach]] 25, {{convert|8200|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|sigfig=2|sp=us}}. The vehicle was controlled by a combination of [[Reaction Control System|RCS thrusters]] and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude, producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to flatten-out, or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the heat-shield glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By the end of the last turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete. The vehicle leveled its wings, lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The orbiter's maximum [[glide ratio]]/[[lift-to-drag ratio]] varies considerably with speed, ranging from 1:1 at [[hypersonic]] speeds, 2:1 at supersonic speeds and reaching 4.5:1 at subsonic speeds during approach and landing.&lt;ref&gt;http://klabs.org/DEI/Processor/shuttle/shuttle_tech_conf/1985008580.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower atmosphere, the orbiter flies much like a conventional glider, except for a much higher descent rate, over {{convert|50|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|sigfig=2|sp=us}} or 9,800 fpm. At approximately Mach 3, two air data probes, located on the left and right sides of the orbiter's forward lower fuselage, are deployed to sense air pressure related to the vehicle's movement in the atmosphere.

;Final approach and landing phase
[[File:Sts-127 landing.ogv|thumb|[[STS-127]], Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' landing video, 2009]]

When the approach and landing phase began, the orbiter was at a {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|sp=us}} altitude, {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the runway. The pilots applied aerodynamic braking to help slow down the vehicle. The orbiter's speed was reduced from {{convert|682|to|346|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, approximately, at touch-down (compared to {{convert|260|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=or|sp=us}} for a jet airliner). The landing gear was deployed while the Orbiter was flying at {{convert|430|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. To assist the speed brakes, a {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|sp=us}} drag chute was deployed either after main gear or nose gear touchdown (depending on selected chute deploy mode) at about {{convert|343|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}}. The chute was jettisoned once the orbiter slowed to {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}}.

[[File:Discovery mission completed q.jpg|thumb|''Discovery'' after landing on Earth for crew disembarkment]]

After landing, the vehicle stayed on the runway for several hours for the orbiter to cool. Teams at the front and rear of the orbiter tested for presence of [[hydrogen]], [[hydrazine]], [[monomethylhydrazine]], [[nitrogen tetroxide]] and [[ammonia]] (fuels and by-products of the reaction control system and the orbiter's three [[Auxiliary Power Unit|APUs]]). If hydrogen was detected, an emergency would be declared, the orbiter powered down and teams would evacuate the area. A convoy of 25 specially designed vehicles and 150 trained engineers and technicians approached the orbiter. Purge and vent lines were attached to remove toxic gases from fuel lines and the cargo bay about 45–60 minutes after landing. A [[flight surgeon]] boarded the orbiter for initial medical checks of the crew before disembarking. Once the crew left the orbiter, responsibility for the vehicle was handed from the Johnson Space Center back to the Kennedy Space Center.&lt;ref name=afterlandingpao&gt;{{cite web|title=From Landing to Launch Orbiter Processing|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/orbiterprocessing2002.pdf|publisher=NASA Public Affairs Office|accessdate=2011-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721053142/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/orbiterprocessing2002.pdf|archivedate=July 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the mission ended at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California, [[White Sands Space Harbor]] in New Mexico, or any of the [[List of space shuttle landing runways|runways the orbiter might use in an emergency]], the orbiter was loaded atop the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a modified 747, for transport back to the Kennedy Space Center, landing at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]]. Once at the Shuttle Landing Facility, the orbiter was then towed {{convert|2|mi}} along a tow-way and access roads normally used by tour buses and KSC employees to the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] where it began a months-long preparation process for the next mission.&lt;ref name=afterlandingpao/&gt;

===Landing sites===
{{See also|List of space shuttle landing runways}}
[[File:Atlantis is landing after STS-30 mission.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' deploys the [[landing gear]] before landing.]]

NASA preferred Space Shuttle landings to be at [[Kennedy Space Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/landing_sites.html |title=NASA – Roster of Runways Ready to Bring a Shuttle Home |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If weather conditions made landing there unfavorable, the Shuttle could delay its landing until conditions are favorable, touch down at Edwards Air Force Base, California, or use one of the multiple alternate landing sites around the world. A landing at any site other than Kennedy Space Center meant that after touchdown the Shuttle must be mated to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and returned to [[Cape Canaveral]]. Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' ([[STS-3]]) once landed at the [[White Sands Space Harbor]], [[New Mexico]]; this was viewed as a last resort as NASA scientists believed that the sand could potentially damage the Shuttle's exterior.

There were many [[Emergency landing sites|alternative landing sites]] that were never used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Global Security |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |title=Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites |accessdate=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=US Northern Command |url=http://www.northcom.mil/News/2009/031309_a.html |title=DOD Support to manned space operations for STS-119 |accessdate=2011-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113160305/http://www.northcom.mil/news/2009/031309_a.html |archivedate=January 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal NASA risk assessment study (conducted by the Shuttle Program Safety and Mission Assurance Office at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]]) released in late 2010 or early 2011 concluded that the agency had seriously underestimated the level of risk involved in operating the Shuttle.

===Disasters===

On January 28, 1986, ''Challenger'' disintegrated 73 seconds after launch due to the failure of the right SRB, killing all seven astronauts on board. The disaster was caused by low-temperature impairment of an O-ring, a mission critical seal used between segments of the SRB casing.  Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]], causing it to explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch3.htm |title= Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter III: The Accident |publisher=History.nasa.gov |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53&amp;nbsp;°F (12&amp;nbsp;°C) had been ignored by NASA managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |publisher=History.nasa.gov |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' disintegrated during re-entry, killing its crew of seven, because of damage to the [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon]] leading edge of the wing caused during launch. Ground control engineers had made three separate requests for high-resolution images taken by the Department of Defense that would have provided an understanding of the extent of the damage, while NASA's chief [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] (TPS) engineer requested that astronauts on board ''Columbia'' be allowed to leave the vehicle to inspect the damage. NASA managers intervened to stop the Department of Defense's assistance and refused the request for the spacewalk,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/space/Columbia%20accident.htm "the Columbia Accident"]. century-of-flight.net&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the feasibility of scenarios for astronaut repair or rescue by ''Atlantis'' were not considered by NASA management at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/caib/PDFS/VOL2/D13.PDF |title=D13 – In-Flight Options |format=PDF |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
{{main|Space Shuttle retirement}}
[[File:Atlantis welcome home ceremony outside the OPF July 22.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|''Atlantis'' orbiter's final welcome home, 2011]]

NASA retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, after 30 years of service. The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a "Space Truck", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA – NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year – Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shuttle's final mission consisted of just four astronauts—Christopher Ferguson (Commander), Douglas Hurley (Pilot), Sandra Magnus (Mission Specialist 1), and Rex Walheim (Mission Specialist 2);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rare Four-Member Crew to Fly Final Shuttle |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/07/03/rare-four-member-crew-to-fly-final-shuttle/?test=faces |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |agency=[[FoxNews]] |date=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; they conducted the 135th and last space Shuttle mission on board ''Atlantis'', which launched on July 8, 2011, and landed safely at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 AM EDT (09:57 UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===
[[File:Space Shuttle Program Commemorative Patch.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Space Shuttle Program]] commemorative patch]]

NASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program. Each museum or institution is responsible for covering the {{US$|28.8 million}} cost of preparing and transporting each vehicle for display.  Twenty museums from across the country submitted proposals for receiving one of the retired orbiters.&lt;ref name="retired shuttle display"&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Gallery: How to display a retired space shuttle |url=http://collectspace.com/news/news-080210b.html| newspaper= Collect Space|date=November 1, 2010| accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASA also made [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] tiles available to schools and universities for less than US$25 each.&lt;ref name=tiles&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2010/december/178743/NASA-offers-space-shuttle-tiles-to-school-and-universities |title=NASA offers space shuttle tiles to school and universities |work=Channel 13 News |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133214/http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2010/december/178743/NASA-offers-space-shuttle-tiles-to-school-and-universities |archivedate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 tiles were available on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis, limited to one per institution.&lt;ref name=tiles/&gt;

====Orbiters on display====
On April 12, 2011, NASA announced selection of locations for the remaining Shuttle orbiters:&lt;ref name=NASA_New_Homes_for_Orbiters&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/shuttle_station/features/shuttle_homes.html |title=NASA Announces New Homes for Space Shuttle Orbiters After Retirement |author=Jason Townsend |date=April 12, 2011 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intrepid"&gt;{{cite news |last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|title=Space Shuttle to Land in Manhattan|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/space-shuttle-to-land-in-manhattan/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 12, 2011| accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Atlantis'' is on display at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]], near [[Cape Canaveral]], Florida.  It was delivered to the Visitor Complex on November 2, 2012.
* ''Discovery'' was delivered to the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center|Udvar-Hazy Center]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia]], near Washington, D.C. on April 19, 2012.  On April 17, 2012, ''Discovery'' was flown atop a 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft escorted by a NASA [[T-38 Talon]] chase aircraft in a final farewell flight.  The 747 and ''Discovery'' flew over Washington, D.C. and the metropolitan area around 10&amp;nbsp;am and arrived at Dulles around 11&amp;nbsp;am. The flyover and landing were widely covered on national news media.
[[File:Space Shuttle Endeavor Touchdown at LAX.JPG|thumb|''Endeavour'' at Los Angeles International Airport]]
* ''Endeavour'' was delivered to the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles, California on October 14, 2012. It arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on September 21, 2012 escorted by two NASA [[F/A-18 Hornet]] chase aircraft, concluding a two-day, cross country journey atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft after stops at Ellington Field in Houston, Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso and the Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
* ''Enterprise'' (atmospheric test orbiter) was on display at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center but was moved to New York City's [[Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum]] in mid-2012.&lt;ref name="shuttle_sale" /&gt;

In August 2011, the [[NASA Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) published a "Review of NASA's Selection of Display Locations for the Space Shuttle Orbiters"; the review had four main findings:&lt;ref name="oigreview"&gt;{{Cite report |type= Special Report |format= PDF |date= August 25, 2011 |title= Review of NASA's Selection of Display Locations for the Space Shuttle Orbiters |url= http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY11/Review_NASAs_Selection_Display_Locations.pdf |publisher= [[NASA Office of Inspector General]] |page= 26 |accessdate= 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this references has significant details that should be added --&gt;
* "NASA's decisions regarding Orbiter placement were the result of an Agency-created process that emphasized above all other considerations locating the Orbiters in places where the most people would have the opportunity to view them";
* "the Team made several errors during its evaluation process, including one that would have resulted in a numerical 'tie' among the Intrepid, the Kennedy Visitor Complex, and the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force (Air Force Museum) in Dayton, Ohio";
* there is "no evidence that the Team's recommendation or the Administrator's decision were tainted by political influence or any other improper consideration";
* "some of the choices NASA made during the selection process – specifically, its decision to manage aspects of the selection as if it were a competitive procurement and to delay announcement of its placement decisions until April 2011 (more than 2 years after it first solicited information from interested entities)—may intensify challenges to the Agency and the selectees as they work to complete the process of placing the Orbiters in their new homes."
The NASA OIG had three recommendations, saying NASA should:&lt;ref name="oigreview"/&gt;
* "expeditiously review recipients' financial, logistical, and curatorial display plans to ensure they are feasible and consistent with the Agency's educational goals and processing and delivery schedules";
* "ensure that recipient payments are closely coordinated with processing schedules, do not impede NASA's ability to efficiently prepare the Orbiters for museum display, and provide sufficient funds in advance of the work to be performed; and"
* "work closely with the recipient organizations to minimize the possibility of delays in the delivery schedule that could increase the Agency's costs or impact other NASA missions and priorities."

In September 2011, the CEO and two board members of Seattle's Museum of Flight met with NASA Administrator [[Charles Bolden]], pointing out "significant errors in deciding where to put its four retiring Space Shuttles"; the errors alleged include inaccurate information on Museum of Flight's attendance and international visitor statistics, as well as the readiness of the [[Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum]]'s exhibit site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2016405754_shuttle05m.html |title= Seattle still dreams of landing a shuttle |date= October 4, 2011 |publisher= The Seattle Times |first= Jack |last= Broom |accessdate= 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orbiter replicas on display====
* [[Space Shuttle Independence|''Independence'']], formerly known as ''Explorer'', is a full-scale, high-fidelity replica of the Space Shuttle. It was built by [[Guard-Lee]] in [[Apopka, Florida]], installed at [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in 1993, and moved to [[Space Center Houston]] in 2012. It was built using schematics, blueprints and archival documents provided by NASA and by shuttle contractors such as [[Rockwell International]]. While many of the features on the replica are simulated, some parts, including the landing gear's [[Michelin]] tires, have been used in the [[Space Shuttle program]].&lt;ref name="collect20120524"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-052412a.html |title=Space shuttle replica sets sail for Houston |work=CollectSpace.com |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is on display, mounted on top of the original [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (NASA 905) outside of the Visitors' Center.&lt;ref name="insider20140815"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/johnson-space-center/independence-rises-history-atop-sca-space-center-houston/ |title=Independence rises into history atop SCA at Space Center Houston |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Nathan |last=Moeller |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Space Shuttle Pathfinder|''Pathfinder'']] (honorary [[Orbiter Vehicle Designation]]: OV-098) is a Space Shuttle test simulator made of [[steel]] and [[wood]]. Constructed by [[NASA]] in 1977 as an unnamed [[test article]], it was purchased in the early 1980s by the America-Japan Society, Inc. which had it refurbished, named it, and placed it on display in the Great Space Shuttle Exhibition in [[Tokyo]]. The mockup was later returned to the United States and placed on permanent display at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], in May 1988.

====Hardware on display====
Flight and mid-deck training hardware will be taken from the [[Johnson Space Center]] and will go to the National Air and Space Museum and the [[National Museum of the U.S. Air Force]]. The full fuselage mockup, which includes the payload bay and aft section but no wings, is to go to the [[Museum of Flight]] in Seattle. Mission Simulation and Training Facility's fixed simulator will go to the [[Adler Planetarium]] in Chicago, and the motion simulator will go to the [[Texas A&amp;M]] Aerospace Engineering Department in College Station, Texas. Other simulators used in Shuttle astronaut training will go to the [[Wings of Dreams Aviation Museum]] in Starke, Florida and the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]] in Hampton, Virginia.&lt;ref name="retired shuttle display" /&gt;

&lt;!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie the Shuttle is mentioned on or appears in. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! Unless you have an example that is much, much, much better than those already here, don't insert it. We could use a novel or two, and a videogame, but the Shuttle should be an important part of the story, not just a casual mention. (''[[The Core]]'''s opening scene is a casual mention, for example.--&gt;

Space Shuttles have been features of fiction and nonfiction, from children's movies to documentaries. Early examples include the 1979 ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the 1982 [[Activision]] videogame ''Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space'' (1982) and [[G. Harry Stine]]'s 1981 novel ''[[Shuttle Down]]''.  In the 1986 film ''[[SpaceCamp]]'', ''Atlantis'' accidentally launches into space with a group of [[U.S. Space Camp]] participants as its crew.  A space shuttle named ''Intrepid'' is featured in the 1989 film ''[[Moontrap]]''.

The 1998 film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' portrays a combined crew of offshore oil rig workers and U.S. military staff who pilot two modified Shuttles to avert the destruction of Earth by an asteroid. Retired American test pilots visit a Russian satellite in the 2000 [[Clint Eastwood]] adventure film ''[[Space Cowboys]]''. In the 2003 film ''[[The Core]]'', the ''Endeavour''{{'}}s landing is disrupted by the Earth's magnetic core, and its crew is selected to pilot a vehicle designed to restart the core. The 2004 Bollywood movie ''[[Swades]]'', where a Space Shuttle is used to launch a special rainfall monitoring satellite, was filmed at Kennedy Space Center in the year after the [[Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] that had taken the life of Indian-American astronaut [[Kalpana Chawla|KC Chawla]].

On television, the 1996 drama ''[[The Cape (1996 TV series)|The Cape]]'' portrays the lives of a group of NASA astronauts as they prepare for and fly Shuttle missions. ''[[Odyssey 5]]'' was a short-lived sci-fi series that features the crew of a Space Shuttle as the last survivors of a disaster that destroys Earth.  The 1997–2007 sci-fi series ''Stargate SG-1'' has a shuttle rescue written into an episode.

The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' features the fictional Space Shuttle ''Explorer'' during STS-157, whose crew are killed or left stranded after it is destroyed by a shower of high speed orbital debris.  The 2017 [[Lego]] film ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' features a hybrid between the [[Batmobile]] and a Space Shuttle,  named "the Bat Space Shuttle" by [[Dick Grayson]]. It's clearly based on the [[Lego City]] set 3367 ("Space Shuttle"), but is black and weapon-equipped.
&lt;!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie the shuttle is mentioned on or appears in. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! Unless you have an example that is much, much, much better than those already here, don't insert it. We could use a novel or two, and a videogame, but the Shuttle should be an important part of the story, not just a casual mention. ''[[The Core]]'''s opening scene is a casual mention, for example. Also in the X file episode ''[[Space]]'' --&gt;

The Space Shuttle has also been the subject of toys and models; for example, a large [[Lego]] Space Shuttle model was constructed by visitors at Kennedy Space Center,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3xBtR_TJZ8UC&amp;q=Lego+Space+Shuttle&amp;dq=Lego+Space+Shuttle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DtIHTc7qAcP68AbxpbDgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA Cherie D.

A 1980 pinball machine ''Space Shuttle'' was produced by [[Zaccaria (company)|Zaccaria]] and a 1984 pinball machine ''[[Space Shuttle (pinball)|Space Shuttle: Pinball Adventure]]'' was produced by [[WMS Industries|Williams]] and features a plastic Space Shuttle model among other artwork of astronauts on the play field. The Space Shuttle also appears in a number of [[Amateur flight simulation|flight simulator]] and [[space flight simulator game]]s such as ''[[Microsoft Space Simulator]]'', ''[[Orbiter (simulator)|Orbiter]]'', ''[[FlightGear]]'', ''[[X-Plane (simulator)|X-Plane]]'' and [[Space Shuttle Mission 2007]]. Several [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers toys]] were modeled after the Space Shuttle.

'''Stanford University Mathematics Camp''', or '''SUMaC''', is a competitive summer mathematics program for rising high school juniors and seniors around the world. The camp lasts for 4 weeks, usually from mid-July to mid-August. It is based on the campus of [[Stanford University]].

Like the [[Ross Program]] at [[Ohio State]] and the [[PROMYS]] program at [[Boston University]], SUMaC does not put emphasis on competition-math preparations but focuses instead on advanced undergraduate math topics.

==History==
SUMaC was founded in 1995 by Professors Rafe Mazzeo and Ralph Cohen of the Stanford Mathematics Department and has been directed from the beginning by Prof. Mazzeo, and Dr. Rick Sommer. Dr. Sommer was an Assistant Professor in the Stanford Mathematics Department and is currently a Deputy Director of the [[Education Program for Gifted Youth]] ([[EPGY]]), at Stanford. He designed the '''Program I''' course and has been teaching versions of it since the first SUMaC in 1995. The '''Program II''' course was designed and has been taught by Prof. Rafe Mazzeo. (In recent years, the course was cotaught by Dr. Pierre Albin, a former Stanford graduate student who currently teaches at [[MIT]], and is currently taught by Dr. Simon Rubinstein-Salzedo, a postdoctoral fellow in statistics at Stanford.)

==Programs==
* '''Program I''' investigates non-constructibility in geometry, classification of patterns in two dimensions, error-correcting codes, [[cryptography]], and the analysis of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. The mathematics that is central to solving these problems comes from the areas of [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]].
* '''Program II''' contains an introduction to selected topics in [[combinatorial]], [[differential topology|differential]], and [[algebraic topology]]. The program emphasizes developing ideas from, and problems in, [[geometric topology]] where methods from [[abstract algebra]] and [[calculus]] have proven to be effective tools.

==Other activities==
During the camp, there are frequent guest lectures given by internationally renowned mathematicians. These talks are in the areas of current mathematical research. [[Ravi Vakil]], a current Stanford mathematics professor and a 4-time [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]], talked to the students in 2007.
Also in 2007, [[Tyson Mao]], one of the best cube solvers in the world, taught SUMaC students how to solve the [[Rubik's Cube]]. Other speakers in 2007 included Drs. Kay Kirkpatrick ([[MIT]]), Ted Shifrin ([[University of Georgia]]), and Pete Storm (Stanford).
In 2014, John Edmark, Professor of Art and Art History at Stanford, spoke about his current work in [[mathematics-inspired sculptures]], and [[Brian Conrey]], executive director of the [[American Institute of Mathematics]], gave a lecture on the [[Twin Primes Conjecture]] and the [[Riemann Hypothesis]].
Students at SUMaC also engage in a variety of sports activities during their free time.
Such sports include [[basketball]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[table tennis]], and [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]].

SUMaC was the backdrop for [[Justina Chen Headley]]'s book ''Nothing But the Truth (and a Few White Lies)'', a teen novel about a half-Taiwanese girl who finally finds her identity at the math camp.

==Teaching assistants and counselors==
Most of the SUMaC residential counselors and teaching assistants are Stanford mathematics graduate students and undergraduate math majors. SUMaC usually has a 1-to-4 ratio of staff to students, with most of the teaching assistants serving in the role of live-in counselors. Many of the SUMaC teaching assistants and counselors return from previous years, and some attended SUMaC in high school.

==Residence==
SUMaC students have traditionally been housed in Synergy [http://www.stanford.edu/group/synergy/], a small Stanford-student residence that is a famously vegetarian co-op during the academic year, though there have been years when students lived in Κappa Αlpha (KA). Each student has one,two or three roommates, and the floors are divided by sex. Dining takes place at a separate dining hall shared by other summer youth programs at [[Stanford]].

'''Sylvatic''' is a [[scientific]] term referring to wild animals, often in context of diseases or [[pathogens]] that only affect them (sylvan means ''forest-dwelling'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology|page=483|first1=Brian W.J. |last1=Mahy|first2= Marc H.V. |last2=van Regenmortel|publisher=Academic Press|date=21 May 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsh48WKIbhQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of [[animal]] research, its opposite is [[domesticated|domestic]], which refers to pets, farm animals or other animals which do not dwell in the wild.

*Examples: sylvatic [[rabies]]; sylvatic and domestic bacterial strains; sylvatic [[yellow fever]]

The word "sylvatic" is also simply a synonym for "sylvan" (or "silvan") = "of the forest".

The Latin words ''silvatica'', ''silvaticus'' of this root are commonly used in biological taxonomy: ''[[Rana sylvatica]]'' (Wood Frog), ''[[agaricus silvaticus]]'' (Scaly Wood Mushroom), etc.

The '''Sznajd model''' or '''United we stand, divided we fall''' ('''USDF''') model is an [[econophysics]] model suggested in 2000&lt;ref name=RefOriginal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sznajd-Weron|first1=Katarzyna|last2=Sznjad|first2=Jozef|title=Opinion evolution in closed community|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics C|volume=11|issue=06|pages=1157–1165|doi=10.1142/S0129183100000936|arxiv=cond-mat/0101130|bibcode=2000IJMPC..11.1157S}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced to gain fundamental understanding about opinion dynamics using methods from [[statistical physics]]. The Sznajd model implements a phenomenon called [[social validation]] and thus extends the [[Ising spin model]]. In simple words, the model states:
* '''Social validation''': If two people share the same opinion, their neighbors will start to agree with them.
* '''Discord destroys''': If a block of adjacent persons disagree, their neighbors start to argue with them.
{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Models}}

== Mathematical formulation ==
For simplicity, one assumes that each individual&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has
an opinion S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; which might be [[Boolean network|Boolean]] (&lt;math&gt;S_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; for ''no'', &lt;math&gt;S_i=1&lt;/math&gt; for ''yes'')  in its simplest formulation, which means that each individual either agrees or disagrees to a given question.

In the original 1D-formulation, each individual has exactly two neighbors just like beads on a [[bracelet]]. At each time step a pair of individual &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random to change their nearest neighbors' opinion (or: [[Ising spin]]s) &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}&lt;/math&gt; according to two dynamical rules:
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_i&lt;/math&gt;. This models '''social validation''', if two people share the same opinion, their neighbors will change their opinion.
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=-S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_i&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively: If the given pair of people disagrees, both adopt the opinion of their other neighbor.

=== Findings for the original formulations ===
In a closed (1 dimensional) community, two [[steady state]]s are always reached, namely complete consensus (which is called ''[[ferromagnetic]] state'' in physics) or [[stalemate]] (the ''[[antiferromagnetic]] state'').
Furthermore, [[Monte Carlo simulations]] showed that these simple rules lead to complicated dynamics, in particular to a [[power law]] in the decision time distribution with an exponent of -1.5.&lt;ref name=RefApplications&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sznajd-Weron|first1=Katarzyna|title=Sznajd model and its applications|journal=Acta Physica Polonica B|date=2005|volume=36|issue=8|arxiv=physics/0503239|bibcode=2005AcPPB..36.2537S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modifications ===
The final (antiferromagnetic) state of alternating all-on and all-off is unrealistic to represent the behavior of a community. It would mean that the complete population uniformly changes their opinion from one time step to the next. For this reason an alternative  dynamical rule was proposed. One possibility is that two spins &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; change their nearest neighbors according to the two following rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Sanchez|first1=Juan R.|title=A modified one-dimensional Sznajd model|arxiv=cond-mat/0408518}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Social validation''' remains unchanged: If &lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=-S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;

== Relevance ==
In recent years, [[statistical physics]] has been accepted as modeling framework for phenomena outside the traditional physics. Fields as [[econophysics]] or [[sociophysics]] formed, and many [[quantitative analyst]]s in [[finance]] are physicists. The [[Ising model]] in statistical physics has been a very important step in the history of studying [[Critical phenomena|collective (critical) phenomena]]. The Sznajd model is a simple but yet important variation of prototypical Ising system.&lt;ref name=RefSocialPhysics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castellano|first1=Claudio|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|last3=Loreto|first3=Vittorio|title=Statistical physics of social dynamics|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=0710.3256|volume=81|issue=2|pages=591–646|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.591|bibcode=2009RvMP...81..591C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron has been recognized by the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft#Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics|Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics]] of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] (German Physical Society) for an outstanding original contribution using physical methods to develop a better understanding of socio-economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics|url=http://www.dpg-physik.de/dpg/gliederung/fv/soe/YSA/preistraeger_YSA.html|publisher=Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft|accessdate=15 October 2014|location=Bad Honnef, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===
The Sznajd model belongs to the class of '''binary-state dynamics on a networks''' also referred to as [[Boolean network]]s. This class of systems includes the [[Ising model]], the [[voter model]] and the [[q-voter model]], the [[Bass diffusion model]], [[threshold model]]s and others.&lt;ref name=RefBinaryStateDynamics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gleeson|first1=James P.|title=Binary-State Dynamics on Complex Networks: Pair Approximation and Beyond|journal=Physical Review X|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.3.021004|arxiv=1209.2983|bibcode=2013PhRvX...3b1004G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sznajd model can be applied to various fields:
* The [[finance]] interpretation considers the spin-state &lt;math&gt;S_i=1&lt;/math&gt; as a bullish trader placing orders, whereas a &lt;math&gt;S_i=0&lt;/math&gt; would correspond to a trader who is bearish and places sell orders.

The '''theory of indispensable attributes''' ('''TIA''') is a theory in the context of [[perceptual organization|perceptual organisation]] which asks for the functional units and elementary features that are relevant for a [[perceptual system]] in the constitution of perceptual objects. Earlier versions of the theory emerged in the context of an application of research on [[Visual system|vision]] to [[Auditory system|audition]], and analogies between vision and audition were emphasised,&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael: Concurrent-Pitch Segregation and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes. In: Kubovy, Michael/Pomeranz, James R. (Eds.): Perceptual Organization, Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1981, 55–98.&lt;/ref&gt;
whereas in more recent writings the necessity of a [[Sensory modality|modality-general]] theory of perceptual organisation and objecthood is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael/Valkenburg, D. Van: ''In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes.'' Cognition 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of perceptual organisation, and with it TIA, constitute a prime example of how theories of [[Gestalt psychology]]  have been taken up and kept alive in [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael (1999): ''Gestalt Psychology''. In: Robert A. Wilson/Frank C. Keil (Eds.), The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences, pp. 346–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

TIA has been drawn on in the context of music research, in the areas of music philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Charles O. (2007): ''The Musical Representation. Meaning, Ontology, and Emotion'', Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;
and systematic music theory.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Schmidt, Lüder/Schmidt, Silke/Seifert, Uwe/Gernemann, Andreas: ''Perceptual Organization and Systematic Music Theory: Musical Surface, Auditory Objects, and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes.'' In: Proceedings of the APSCOM Conference Seoul 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptual grouping ==
Since the [[perception]] of objects implies a segregation of some parts of the environment (''figure'') from other parts of the environment (''ground''), a [[perceptual system]] will have to rely on certain features in the environment for the aggregation of what goes together. This aggregation is termed [[Principles of grouping|''perceptual grouping'' (PG)]], and the aim of TIA is the identification of conditions for the occurrence of PG.&lt;ref name="kubovy227"&gt;Kubovy, M./Valkenburg, D. Van: "In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes." ''Cognition'' 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

PG is considered as a transformation happening between some input and some output. The input &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is considered a set of discrete elements which are distributed over some medium &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Media are also termed ''indispensable attributes'' (IA). The output PP is termed a ''phenomenal partition'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; into subsets, or ''blocks'', E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

The grouping into some block E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in reference to at least one feature F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; from a set of features &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Kubovy and Van Valkenburg (2003) recommend the following expression for the description of a PP: "... the elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; spread over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, are grouped by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

'''''Vanguardia de la Ciencia''''' was a Spanish science podcast and radio program which was broadcast on the shortwave band by Radio Exterior de España, one of the stations of [[Radio Nacional de España]] (RNE). The program aired weekly, without interruption, from April 1995 until June 2007. It was available for download as [[mp3]]-files from the web pages of RNE from September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rne.es/ree/pnvanguardia/ant-vang.htm|title=RNE|accessdate=September 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031210211043/http://www.rne.es/ree/pnvanguardia/ant-vang.htm|archive-date=December 10, 2003|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was created by [[Ángel Rodríguez Lozano]]. A total of 98 programs are still available online. In addition to ''Vanguardia de la Ciencia'', Lozano also hosted another popular science radio program and podcast, ''[[El Sueño de Arquímedes]]''.

==Listenership==

''Vanguardia de la Ciencia'' had a large audience worldwide. Although exact numbers of downloads and listeners are unavailable, Radio exterior de España has 80 million listeners, only surpassed by the BBC and Radio Vaticana. In addition, ''Vanguardia de la Ciencia'' was retransmitted by several radio stations in Latin America and Spain. The program was popular throughout the Spanish-speaking world
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605d79bfad0a57f2b494b75f0d9df022583bbf4a37cbcdc51b1760b732aef2bc51ca258512135ee0ce4ca8a53c8364a53e4ae155d4087714dea3 Radio Nacional de España, in their biography of Ángel Rodríguez Lozano] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The program aimed at being accessible to everyone with an interest for science. Some basic knowledge of science was required to get the most it, as it often went into some technical detail, especially in the interviews. The audio production was of top quality.

* '''Science news.''' The program started with a review of science news.
* '''Interviews.''' The news section was usually followed by an in-depth interview with a Spanish-speaking scientist, focusing on a recent publication in a major scientific journal.
* '''Biographies.''' The biography of a great scientist was often included. These were written by [http://www.rtve.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605dceedec15a322702dd41da976ac96c4395def1e9f8e232e7869bb1c304bb715731b852947013e5ad675ccaeddfc4875cdea9bcd15f8880681 Carmen Buergo].{{es}} They were written in the first person, and usually set at a point in time when the scientist was old, and told the story of his or her life and achievements.
* '''Letters from Ulises.''' Many of the programs included a section called "Cartas de Ulises" (Letters from Ulises). Ulises was presented as a friend of the program, who acted as a correspondent. His letters often started with stories from his childhood in rural Spain, which illustrated a scientific concept. In some of the programs, this section was more frivolous, such as when Ulises travelled in time, and performed an interview with [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], with simultaneous translation to Spanish. The contributions of Ulises were not credited, but in an interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ ¡DIME TÚ! — Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano] {{es}} First published June 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; at [http://dimetu.com dimetu.com], Ángel Rodríguez Lozano revealed that Ulises, in fact, was himself, and that the stories were inspired by people and events from his own childhood.&lt;ref&gt;''"¿Y, quíen es Ulises? ¡Huy! ... Pues Ulises realmente soy yo."''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Correspondence'''. Near the end of the program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano read a letter from a listener. The letters have included questions about permission to redistribute the audio. These have consistently been answered that the audio is freely redistributable, both by individuals and radio stations, with no need for signing a special agreement, as long as the source, Radio Exterior de España, is clearly stated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esnips.com/doc/4e6cd06a-93e4-4a08-b5a2-2d51ea260e66/2006-04-29-Permission-to-redistribute.mp3 2006-04-29-Permission-to-redistribute - eSnips, share anything&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esnips.com/doc/2c1aa6f0-6733-41e3-ae45-9e57a737e89c/2006-10-22-Permission-to-redistribute.mp3 2006-10-22-Permission-to-redistribute - eSnips, share anything&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters also included questions for the section ''La ciencia nuestra de cada dia'' (everyday science). In addition, some letters were from listeners who were learning Spanish, who found the program helpful for that purpose.
* '''Everyday science.''' In the section ''La ciencia nuestra de cada dia'', Ángel Rodríguez Lozano answered questions from listeners, requesting explanations of observations of natural phenomena and curious observations. Often, a question was read one week, and answered the next, and it was evident that much research had been put into giving a thorough answer.

==Termination of Vanguardia de la Ciencia==

In June 2007, ''Vanguardia de la Ciencia'' and ''El sueño de Arquímedes'' were abruptly terminated. In the correspondence section of one of the last programs, Lozano explained, in response to a letter from an outraged listener, that the decision to terminate the program was made due to a re-structuration of RNE, and that he was but one of 4,150 employees who had to leave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b Correspondence section at the end of the program of June 9th, 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121209052256/http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |date=December 9, 2012 }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the previously referenced interview, he explained that everyone older than 52 years had to retire early, and that he was 54 years old at the time.
The decision to terminate the programs was widely criticized in Spanish-speaking blogs.
