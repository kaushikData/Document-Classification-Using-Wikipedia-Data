== History ==

Ayman Sadiq founded 10 Minute School in mid 2014 as an YouTube Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.intellect.com.bd/details/343/-%E2%80%9Clearn.-practice.-progress.%E2%80%9D |title="Learn.

While one of the major challenges for the organization back then was to find a suitable sponsor to fund its operational activities, it later came to be supported by telecom operator [[Robi|Robi Axiata]] Ltd and the [[Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology|ICT Ministry of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.daily-sun.com/post/198758/ICT-Div-Robi-10-Minute-School-join-hands-to-promote-digital-edu|title=ICT Div, Robi, 10 Minute School join hands to promote digital edu {{!}} daily sun|last=Sun|first=The Daily|date=|work=Daily Sun|access-date=2018-03-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2010 student protest in Dublin''' was a [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] that took place in the centre of the city on 3 November 2010 in opposition to a proposed increase in university registration fees, further cuts to the student maintenance grant and increasing graduate unemployment and emigration levels caused by the [[Government of the 30th Dáil#28th Government of Ireland|28th Government of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="USI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usi.ie/press-archives/65-2010/1546-thousands-of-students-expected-at-usi-protest-march.html |title=Over 25,000 Students Expected at USI Protest March |date=3 November 2010 |work=[[Union of Students in Ireland]] |accessdate=3 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135212/http://www.usi.ie/press-archives/65-2010/1546-thousands-of-students-expected-at-usi-protest-march.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized by the [[Union of Students in Ireland]] (USI) and students unions nationwide, it saw between 25,000 and 40,000 protesters on the streets of central Dublin during what ''[[The Irish Times]]'' described as "the largest student protest for a generation".&lt;ref name="25,000 protest against fees increase"&gt;{{cite news|author=Flynn, Seán|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1104/1224282635055.html|title=25,000 protest against fees increase|date=4 November 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protestors came from all over Ireland – students from most third-level colleges featured, as did some protestors from [[Queen's University Belfast]]&lt;ref name="QUB students join Dublin fees protest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pearl, Aine|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-517840?ref=feeds%2Foncnn|title=Irish Student Protest|date=11 November 2010|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; – with many travelling to the city by coach.&lt;ref name="25,000 protest against fees increase"/&gt; It took more than an hour and a half for all the protestors to walk from [[Parnell Square]] to [[Government Buildings]] in [[Merrion Street]], a short distance.&lt;ref name="25,000 protest against fees increase"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=47453&amp;locID=1.2.&amp;pagename=news |title=Thousands of students expected to protest |date=3 November 2010 |work=[[TV3 News]] |publisher=[[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] |accessdate=3 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329042436/http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=47453&amp;locID=1.2.&amp;pagename=news |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some protestors and [[Garda Síochána|gardaí]] engaged in clashes following the protest, with an unidentified number of people being wounded and three gardaí sustaining minor injuries; two arrests were made.&lt;ref name="Gardaí, students clash in Dublin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1103/education.html|title=Gardaí, students clash in Dublin|date=3 November 2010|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men who were arrested were in their twenties and charged with [[criminal damage]] and a [[breach of the peace]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Gardaí, students clash in Dublin"/&gt; The [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]] was occupied by protestors for a time, and 36 complaints of [[police brutality]] were made of which just over half were admitted;&lt;ref name="Garda Ombudsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardaombudsman.ie/GSOC/121110-Complaints-arising-from-incidents-associated-with-the-student-protest-in-Dublin-on-3rd-November-2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721124428/http://www.gardaombudsman.ie/GSOC/121110-Complaints-arising-from-incidents-associated-with-the-student-protest-in-Dublin-on-3rd-November-2010.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; these led to a further march by students seven days later with the intention to "end garda brutality".&lt;ref name="Up to 500 students protest over Garda behaviour"/&gt;

[[Presseurop]] wondered the day after thousands of students marched on the streets of Dublin: "Has Ireland awoken?" and said the protest had "Giv[en] the lie to general opinion that the economically stricken nation has taken swingeing austerity measures with passive resignation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/376801-has-ireland-awoken|title=Has Ireland awoken?|date=4 November 2010|work=[[Presseurop]]|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2010 student protest in London|"Scenes bizarrely similar"]] occurred in [[London]] one week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/sound-familiar-student-protest-in-london-turns-nasty-2010-11/|title=Sound familiar? Student protest in London turns nasty|date=10 November 2010|publisher=thejournal.ie|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[BBC]]'s Ireland Correspondent [[Mark Simpson (Ireland Correspondent)|Mark Simpson]] noted that most demonstrations in Ireland had been "angry rather than violent".&lt;ref name="Irish government comes under fire from students"/&gt; One example he alluded to occurred two days before students demonstrated when [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]] [[Mary Harney]] was successfully pelted with red paint by an opposition politician in a protest intended to highlight the "blood budget" which "will result in the unnecessary and avoidable deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people over the coming years"; this incident occurred while she was attempting to open a mental healthcare facility in Dublin.&lt;ref name="Irish government comes under fire from students"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/World/Story/STIStory_598214.html|title=Irish minister pelted with paint|date=1 November 2010|work=[[The Straits Times]]|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=12022960|title=Irish Health Minister Pelted With Paint Over Cuts: Ireland's health minister pelted with red paint as protesters decry plans to slash health jobs|date=1 November 2010|work=[[ABC News]]|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1101/harneym.html|title=Councillor quizzed over Harney paint incident|date=1 November 2010|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Simpson also wrote that "It is unlikely that their [students] demonstration will make any difference. [...] They [the Irish government] will be hoping that young people will eventually accept [that Ireland has no money]. After all, most students know what it feels like to be broke".&lt;ref name="Irish government comes under fire from students"/&gt;

==March and further events==
According to ''The Irish Times'', the protest was "powerful, uplifting – and very peaceful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nihill, Cían  |author2=Flynn, Seán|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1106/1224282790865.html|title=What our reporters saw|date=6 November 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commenced from [[Parnell Square]] at 13:00.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nihill, Cían  |author2=Flynn, Seán|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1104/1224282635068.html|title=Student march: timeline of events|date=4 November 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; T-shirts bearing slogans such as "Education not Emigration" were worn by many protestors.&lt;ref name="Irish government comes under fire from students"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Mark Simpson (Ireland Correspondent)|Simpson, Mark]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11689264|title=Irish government comes under fire from students|date=3 November 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from [[Queen's University Belfast]] joined their counterparts on the streets of Dublin for the protest in return for support given to their own protest at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] two days earlier.&lt;ref name="QUB students join Dublin fees protest"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rutherford, Fiona |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/community-telegraph/south-belfast/news/qub-students-join-dublin-fees-protest-14995288.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419194131/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/community-telegraph/south-belfast/news/qub-students-join-dublin-fees-protest-14995288.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=QUB students join Dublin fees protest |date=4 November 2010 |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |accessdate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty minutes later, some protestors left the march route at [[Nassau Street (Dublin)|Nassau Street]] and approached [[Dáil Éireann]]'s front gates on [[Kildare Street]].&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; Some scaled poles and items were thrown through the gates.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; March organisers sent them back to the main protest.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt;

Several dozen protestors entered the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]]'s lobby at 15:00 and commenced occupation.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; Authorities removed some and barricaded the remainder inside.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; More students gathered outside the entrance where authorities lined up to separate them from those inside the building, while horses and vans were deployed to split those outside into two.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; A sit-down protest ensued among those who were outside.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; [[Riot police]] arrived on the scene and authorities removed the rest of the protestors still inside the building, some of whom had "evidence of a beating on their faces" (''The Irish Times'').&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; Riot police then forced those outside to move backwards, eventually charging at them followed by horses and dogs until they reached the [[Shelbourne Hotel]].&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; A second charge by the authorities forced those in the vicinity back to [[Anglo Irish Bank]].&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt;

Many of those left outside the Department of Finance then joined a peaceful sit-down protest which was occurring outside Dáil Éireann.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; [[Free Education for Everyone]] then organised a march to [[Pearse Street]] garda station, thought to be the destination of those who had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt; They collected there and demanded the release of anyone who had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Student march: timeline of events"/&gt;

==Complaints of police brutality==
Two female protesters were reported to have been pulled out of the Department of Finance "by their ankles" and one by her hair.&lt;ref name="Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets"/&gt; One bespectacled male student was trampled upon by a horse.&lt;ref name="Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets"/&gt; A female was kicked and knocked to the ground by a horse.&lt;ref name="Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets"/&gt; Another who said she was engaging in a peaceful protest was told by police to "get the fuck off the street" before being batoned.&lt;ref name="Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/student-protest-brings-chaos-to-dublin-streets-14995269.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419203032/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/student-protest-brings-chaos-to-dublin-streets-14995269.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets |date=4 November 2010 |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |accessdate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A male sitting peacefully on the ground with his hands out was reported to have been "rammed" by four garda horses.&lt;ref name="Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets"/&gt; Blood and facial injuries were a common sight.&lt;ref name="Student protest brings chaos to Dublin streets"/&gt;

After viewing video footage of the disorder [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Joe Higgins]] said: "The use of Garda horses and dogs against student protesters in Dublin on Wednesday is an outrageous abuse of the right to protest. The intention was clearly to intimidate peaceful protesters and it is an utter scandal. They should never again be used against protesters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lally, Conor|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/1105/breaking43.html|title=Complaints over protest policing|date=5 November 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

He was born at [[Hohenheim]] in [[Württemberg]], on December 19, 1831. He first went to the [[University of Tübingen]], where he graduated with a Ph.D. in 1853. The results of his work was published in ''Die Juraformation Englands, Frankreichs und des südwestlichen Deutschlands'' (1856–1858). He went to the [[Paläontologische Museum München|Palaeontological Museum]] at [[Munich]] in 1858 and became an assistant there. It was in 1860 that he became the Professor of Palaeontology at the [[University of Munich]]. Then, a year later, he became the director of the [[Palaeontological Collection]]. Of his later works, it can be said that the most important was ''Paläontologische Mittheilungen aus dem Museum des Königlichen Bayerischen Staates'' (1862–1865). He died on 23 December 1865 at the age of 34.

==Studies==

Oppel devoted his life to the study of fossils and the examination of the strata of the [[Jurassic]] period deposits. He is considered to have founded the study of zone [[stratigraphy]] and the use of [[index fossil]]s, a term which he created, to compare the different strata.  He also established the [[Tithonian]] stage, for strata (mainly equivalent to the English [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] and [[Purbeck Group|Purbeck]] Beds) that occur on the borders of [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]]. He was awarded the Chair of Paleontology at the [[University of Munich]].

A number of [[anti-evolution]] [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] have been introduced in the [[United States Congress]] and [[State legislature (United States)|State legislatures]] since 2001. Purporting to support [[academic freedom]], supporters have contended that teachers, students, and college professors face intimidation and retaliation when discussing scientific criticisms of evolution, and therefore require protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Discovery Institute|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the legislation have pointed out that there are no credible scientific critiques of evolution.{{sfn|Simon|2008}} An investigation in [[Florida]] of the allegations of intimidation and retaliation found no evidence that it had occurred.{{sfn|The Professional Staff of the Education Pre-K-12 Committee|2008}} The vast majority of the bills have been unsuccessful, with the one exception being Louisiana's [[Louisiana Science Education Act]], which was enacted in 2008.

Based largely upon language drafted by the [[Discovery Institute]], from language originally drafted for the [[Santorum Amendment]], the common goal of these bills has been to expose more students to articles and videos that criticize evolution, most of which have been produced by advocates of [[intelligent design]] or Biblical [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santorum Amendment==
[[File:Rick Santorum official photo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]], sponsor of the [[Santorum Amendment]]]]
{{main|Santorum Amendment}}
In 2001 former [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]] from [[Pennsylvania]] proposed an amendment, to the education funding bill which became known as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which promoted the teaching of intelligent design while questioning the academic standing of [[evolution]] in U.S. public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|U.S. Congress|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of this amendment was crafted in part by the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, with [[Phillip E. Johnson]], founding adviser of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, and "father" of the intelligent design movement, assisting Santorum in phrasing the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cromartie|2005}}, That language, which was penned by Phil Johnson for Rick Santorum, passed the Senate as an amendment to the No Child Left Behind education bill, and eventually became part of the conference report for that legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Santorum|2002}} It portrayed evolution as generating "much continuing controversy" and being not widely accepted, using the Discovery Institute's [[Teach The Controversy]] method.{{sfn|Orr|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pasulka|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Conferees recognize that a quality science education should prepare students to distinguish the data and testable theories of science from religious or philosophical claims that are made in the name of science. Where topics are taught that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), the curriculum should help students to understand the full range of scientific views that exist, why such topics may generate controversy, and how scientific discoveries can profoundly affect society.|Final text of the Santorum Amendment as included in the Conference Report.{{sfn|House of Representatives|2001}} }}

On June 14, 2001, the amendment was passed as part of the education funding bill by the Senate on a vote of 91-8. This was hailed as a major victory by proponents of intelligent design; for instance an email newsletter by the Discovery Institute contained the sentence "Undoubtedly this will change the face of the debate over the theories of evolution and intelligent design in America ... It also seems that the Darwinian monopoly on public science education, and perhaps the biological sciences in general, is ending."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foerstel|2009|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and educators feared that by singling out biological evolution as very controversial, the amendment could create the impression that a substantial scientific controversy about evolution exists, leading to a lessening of academic rigor in science curricula. A coalition of 96 scientific and educational organizations signed a letter urging that the amendment be stricken from the final bill, which it was, but intelligent design supporters on the conference committee preserved it in the bill's legislative history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.issues.org/18.3/hill.html |title=Language on evolution attached to education law |date=Spring 2002 |publisher=The National Academys |location=Washington, D.C. |page="From the Hill" |accessdate=2010-06-08 |ref=harv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710130329/http://www.issues.org/18.3/hill.html |archive-date=July 10, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Intelligent design in politics}}
Rather than calling for teaching intelligent design or Bible-based [[creationism]] (as previous legislative attempts have), the bills make no mention of these subjects. They instead describe evolution as controversial and attempt to bar school administrators from interfering with teachers who describe purported flaws in the theory. This runs contrary to the overwhelming scientific consensus, which holds that there is no debate about the core principles of evolution: the only credible, and a thoroughly tested, scientific explanation for the development and diversification of all life on Earth.&lt;ref name=EdWeek&gt;{{cite web

Tom Hutton, a senior staff lawyer for the [[National School Boards Association]], stated that while state legislators have a legal right to craft laws that affect districts' policies as a general rule, he believes that some decisions are better left to local officials. He further suggested that these proposed bills, if enacted, could face difficult legal challenges. He further stated that despite their language stating that they are not promoting religious views, and wording to promote "scientific" rather than religious critiques, courts are likely to question the motives behind these bills, and their specific focus on evolution, and draw a conclusion as to "what's going on here."&lt;ref name=EdWeek /&gt;

Michael Simpson, a lawyer for the [[National Education Association]] stated that courts have generally refused to afford significant free-speech protections to teachers for in-class remarks. He further offered the opinion that the legality of these measures would depend on a number of unknowns, such as how the critical views of evolution-critical views were presented, and possibly the degree of congruence between them and other state policies, such as state science curriculum.&lt;ref name=EdWeek/&gt;

A variety of groups, such as the [[National Center for Science Education]] and [[Anti-Defamation League]], criticized and are publicly opposed to the "Academic Freedom bills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Alabama bills==
Between 2004 and 2006, a series of unsuccessful anti-evolution 'Academic freedom' bills were introduced in the [[Alabama Legislature]].&lt;ref name=NCSE_Flr1&gt;{{cite web

On April 8, 2004, the [[Alabama Senate]] unanimously passed SB336, the "Academic Freedom Act." The bill would have given teachers at public institutions "the affirmative right and freedom to present scientific, historical, theoretical, or evidentiary information pertaining to alternative theories or points of view on the subject of origins" and gives students the right to hold a "particular position on origins, so long as he or she demonstrates acceptable understanding of course materials." Before passage, it was amended so that "[t]he rights and privileges contained in this act do not apply to the presentation of theoretical information unless it is accompanied by scientific, historical, or evidentiary information."&lt;ref name=NCSE_Ala1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2004/04/academic-freedom-act-progresses-alabama-00481|title='Academic Freedom Act' progresses in Alabama |first=Nick|last=Matzke |date=April 16, 2004|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=2010-06-09 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428131551/http://ncse.com/news/2004/04/academic-freedom-act-progresses-alabama-00481|archivedate=28 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, 2004, the [[Alabama House]] adjourned the 2004 legislative session without voting on the bill, allowing it to lapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2004/05/alabama-legislature-lets-sb336-die-without-vote-00484|title=Alabama legislature lets SB336 die without a vote|first=Nick|last=Matzke|date=May 18, 2004|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]|accessdate=2010-06-09|ref=harv|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100428131118/http://ncse.com/news/2004/05/alabama-legislature-lets-sb336-die-without-vote-00484|archivedate= 28 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2005, a pair of virtually identical bills were simultaneously introduced in the Alabama Senate and House (HB352 and SB240), again under the description of "The Academic Freedom Act." These bills purported to protect the right of teachers "to present scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories" and the right of students to "hold positions regarding scientific views".

Pre-release screenings for legislators of the controversial film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', which portrays proponents of intelligent design as being "persecuted", have been presented by actor [[Ben Stein]].{{sfn|Simon|2008}} There were special showings for legislators from Florida and Missouri to promote Academic Freedom bills in those states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligent design bill author wants debate|first=Chad|last=Livengood|date=April 5, 2008|publisher=Springfield News Leader| page=A.8|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/news_leader/access/1712285121.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+5%2C+2008&amp;author=Chad+Livengood&amp;pub=Springfield+News+Leader&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.8&amp;desc=Intelligent+design+bill+author+wants+debate |ref=harv |accessdate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida showing was at the invitation of that Florida bill's House sponsor, Representative [[Alan Hays]], on March 12, 2008. It was a private screening restricted to legislators, their spouses, and their legislative aides. The press and public were excluded, and when the House general counsel was asked if that was legal under the Florida [[Freedom of information in the United States|sunshine law]] Hays said that it was technically legal as long as they just watched the film without discussing the issue or arranging any future votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080311/NEWS0120/80311045/1075 |title=Legislature invited to movie about creationism debate : news-press.com : The News-Press |accessdate=2008-03-13 |ref=harv }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this, and the controversy over Roger Moore of the ''Orlando Sentinel'' previously managing to view the film against the wishes of the film company, House Democratic leader [[Dan Gelber]] of [[Miami Beach]] said, "It's kind of an irony: The public is expelled from a movie called Expelled."&lt;ref name="03/10/2008MiamiHerald"/&gt; The screening was attended by about 100 people, but few were legislators,&lt;ref name=lawm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tallahassee.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080313/CAPITOLNEWS/803130323/1067/RSS15 |title=Lawmakers attend Tallahassee screening of movie by Ben Stein |publisher= Tallahassee Democrat |accessdate=2008-03-14 |ref=harv|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of legislators stayed away.&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tallahassee.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080314/OPINION01/803140322/1006/OPINION |title=Eyes wide open |publisher=Tallahassee Democrat |accessdate=2008-03-14 |ref=harv|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the film was released on April 18, 2008, the producer of the film, Walt Ruloff, held a press conference on April 15 at the [[Heritage Foundation]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Louisiana act==
A bill (SB561) named the "Louisiana Academic Freedom Act," was pre-filed on March 21, 2008, in the [[Louisiana Senate]] by the Education Committee chair, [[Ben Nevers]], a [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. While its name is the same as the Florida, Alabama and Discovery Institute bills, the Louisiana version is modeled on a policy adopted in 2006 by the [[Ouachita Parish]] School Board with the backing of the pro-creationism [[Louisiana Family Forum]] (LFF). The bill contends that "the teaching of some scientific subjects, such as biological evolution, the chemical origins of life, global warming, and human cloning, can cause controversy, and that some teachers may be unsure of the expectations concerning how they should present information on such subjects," and extends permission to Louisiana's teachers to "help students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories pertinent to the course being taught."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/03/antievolution-legislation-louisian-001431|title= Antievolution legislation in Louisiana|author=[[National Center for Science Education]]|date=March 24, 2008|publisher=self published newsletter|accessdate=2010-06-17|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevers states that he was asked to sponsor the bill by the LFF.  Gene Mills, executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum, stated that a bill is needed that makes it easier for teachers to delve into criticism of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.&lt;ref name=Advocate&gt;{{cite news |title=Author denies bill lets creationism slip into schools |first=Will |last=Sentell |url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/17179166.html|newspaper=[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|The Advocate]]|date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-06-17|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in introducing the LFF-suggested bill he also stated that the LFF "believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin's theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill allows teaching creationism as science|first=Sylvia|last=Schon|url=http://www.hammondstar.com/articles/2008/04/06/top_stories/9327.txt|newspaper=Hammond Star|date=April 6, 2008|accessdate=2010-06-17|ref=harv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419040815/http://www.hammondstar.com/articles/2008/04/06/top_stories/9327.txt|archive-date=April 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry W.

In response, Americans United noted that Louisiana legislators have repeatedly tried to water down the teaching of evolution, with previous attempts having been deemed unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and suggest that this legislation "opens the door to teaching creationism in public schools, an action that is likely to spark litigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2008/06/louisiana-will-f.html|title=Louisiana Will Face Lawsuit If New Law Brings Religion Into Public School Science Classes, Says Americans United|author=[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]]|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-06-28|ref=harv|format=press release|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629131327/http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2008/06/louisiana-will-f.html|archivedate= June 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2008, the day after the House bill passed, "concerned parents, teachers and scientists" formed Louisiana Coalition for Science, "[i]n response to numerous attacks on science education in the Bayou State". Founding members include prominent philosopher and critic of the [[intelligent design movement]] [[Barbara Forrest]] and veteran biology teacher Patsye Peebles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasciencecoalition.org/2008/06/12/reject_sb_733/ |title=Press Release: Reject SB 733 |author=Louisiana Coalition for Science |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-28 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810022627/http://lasciencecoalition.org/2008/06/12/reject_sb_733/ |archivedate=August 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative commentator [[John Derbyshire]] questioned the constitutionality of the law, and its likely effects:
{{quote|Some local school board will take the Act as a permit to bring religious instruction into their science classes. That will irk some parents. Those parents will sue. There will be a noisy and expensive federal lawsuit, possibly followed by further noisy and expensive appeals. The school board will inevitably lose.

In a December 2008 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article [[Glenn Branch]] and [[Eugenie Scott]] stated:

{{quote|In the meantime, it is clear why the Louisiana Science Education Act is pernicious: it tacitly encourages teachers and local school districts to mis-educate students about evolution, whether by teaching creationism as a scientifically credible alternative or merely by misrepresenting evolution as scientifically controversial.

== Missouri bills ==
On April 1, 2008, representative Robert Wayne Cooper introduced a bill to add a "new section [into state law] relating to teacher academic freedom to teach scientific evidence regarding evolution" into the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] (HB2554). It would require educational authorities to "endeavor to create an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that encourages students to explore scientific questions, learn about scientific evidence, develop critical thinking skills, and respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues, including such subjects as the teaching of biological and chemical evolution" and forbid them from "prohibit[ing] any teacher in a public school system of this state from helping students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of theories of biological or chemical evolution." Previously in 2004, Cooper had introduced two unsuccessful bills (HB 911 and HB 1722) that called for equal time for [[intelligent design]] in Missouri schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills081/biltxt/intro/HB2554I.htm|title= House bill no. 2554|first=Robert Wayne|last=Cooper|date=April 1, 2008|publisher=[[Missouri House of Representatives]]|format=primary source|accessdate=2010-07-03|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/new-antievolution-bill-missouri-001671|title=A new antievolution bill in Missouri|author=[[National Center for Science Education]]|date=April 4, 2008|format=self published newsletter|accessdate=2010-07-03|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">'''Apple Certified System Administrator''' (ACSA) was an [[Apple Inc.]] designed [[Apple certification programs|certification program]] to verify an in-depth knowledge of Apple technical architecture. The last ACSA certification was offered for [[Mac OS X v10.6]] and will not be available for [[Mac OS X v10.7]] and later.

An ACSA will have demonstrated the ability to install and configure Mac OS X systems, as well as the ability to design and configure networks; enable, customize, tune, and troubleshoot a wide range of services; and integrate [[Mac OS X]], [[Mac OS X Server]], and other Apple technologies within a multi-platform networked environment.

The ACSA for [[Mac OS X v10.6]] was phased out in June 2012 and it will not be returning for [[Mac OS X v10.7]] and later. The [[Apple Certified Technical Coordinator]] v10.7 now replaced the ACSA as Apple's highest certification for systems administrators. Prior to its phase out, it was available for [[Mac OS X v.10.6]] and [[Mac OS X v10.5]]. The [[Mac OS X v10.4]] exam was phased out in October 2009, and the [[Mac OS X v10.3]] exam was phased out in December 2005.

For Mac OS X v.10.6 Snow Leopard, the Mac OS X Advanced System Administration exam was eliminated, and replaced with Security &amp; Mobility. The following exams were required:
*Mac OS X Server Essentials v10.6 Exam
*Mac OS X Directory Services v10.6 Exam
*Mac OS X Deployment v10.6 Exam
*Mac OS X Security and Mobility v10.6 Exam

For Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard, the ACSA program was revised to require much more knowledge of the Mac OS X Server than 10.4. To achieve the ACSA 10.5, the following exams were required:
*Mac OS X Server Essentials v10.5 Exam
*Mac OS X Directory Services v10.5 Exam
*Mac OS X Deployment v10.5 Exam
*Mac OS X Advanced System Admin v10.5 Exam

To achieve the ACSA for Mac OS X v.10.4 Tiger, new candidates took any of the following exams to earn the seven required certification credits:
*Mac OS X Deployment v10.4 Exam (9L0-609) -- 2 credits
*Xsan Administration v1.1 Exam (9L0-610) -- 3 credits
*Directory Services Integration and Administration v10.4 Exam (9L0-611) -- 4 credits
*Security Best Practices v10.4 Exam (9L0-612) -- 3 credits
*Podcasting and Streaming Internet Media Exam (9L0-613) -- 3 credits
*Command Line Setup and Administration v10.4 Exam (9L0-614) -- 3 credits
*Network Account Management v10.4 Exam (9L0-615) -- 3 credits
*Xsan for Pro Video Technician v10.4 Exam (9L0-932) -- 3 credits

To move on to the [[Apple Certified Trainer]] passing the test is only one step. Trainer candidates must not only take the Apple Training course, they must also pass the exam with a 90% or better, and attend a train-the-trainer class.

'''Arthur William Oldham''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (6 September 1926&amp;nbsp;– 4 May 2003) was an English composer and choirmaster.  He founded the [[Edinburgh Festival]] Chorus in 1965, the Chorus of the [[Orchestre de Paris]] in 1975, and the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouw Orchestra]] Chorus in Amsterdam in 1979.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; He also worked with the [[Scottish Opera]] Chorus 1966–74 and directed the [[London Symphony Chorus]] 1969–76.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/14/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|title=Obituary: Arthur Oldham|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his work with the LSO Chorus, he won three [[Grammy Award]]s.  He was also a composer, mainly of religious works, but also a ballet and an opera.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

==Biography==
Arthur Oldham was born in London in 1926.  When he was age 14, his mother committed suicide by gassing herself in an oven,&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; and he was brought up in [[Wallington, London|Wallington]], at that time in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/954346 Conrad Wilson, Arthur Oldham, jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt; He won a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Music]], where he studied composition under [[Herbert Howells]].  He then became [[Benjamin Britten]]'s only private pupil&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/arthur-oldham-composer-teacher-and-founder-of-the-edinburgh-festival-chorus-who-was-renowned-here-and-abroad-1.119247|title=Arthur Oldham Composer, teacher, and founder of the Edinburgh Festival Chorus who was renowned here and abroad|work=Herald Scotland|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Aldeburgh]] between 1945 and 1951.&lt;ref name=nmc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmcrec.co.uk/composer/oldham-arthur|title=Oldham, Arthur - NMC Recordings|work=nmcrec.co.uk|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He claims that the bar lines on the manuscript of ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' were his work.&lt;ref name=durrant&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/edinburgh-festival-the-master-of-chorus-masters-the-man-at-the-back--arthur-oldham-for-30-years-master-of-the-edinburgh-festival-chorus--is-bowing-out-sabine-durrant-talked-to-him-before-his-final-performances-1385875.html|title=Edinburgh Festival: The master of chorus masters: The man at the back - Arthur Oldham, for 30 years master of the Edinburgh Festival Chorus - is bowing out. Sabine Durrant talked to him before his final performances|work=The Independent|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) He and Britten came into conflict over their ideas about choral music, but they later worked together in Edinburgh on Britten's ''Voices for Today'', Op. 75, and the ''[[War Requiem]]''.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Until 1968 the only published vocal score of Britten's ''[[The Little Sweep]]'' was the piano duet and percussion version prepared by Arthur Oldham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=research/catalogue/detail.html&amp;id=221|title=Britten-Pears Foundation - Home|work=brittenpears.org|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed musical director of the [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] in 1945, aged only 19.  His music first came to public notice in 1946, when his ballet ''Mr Punch'' was performed by the Ballet Rambert at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]], and was included in the Rambert's 1947–48 tour of Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Several of his own pieces were heard at early Aldeburgh Festivals.&lt;ref name=nmc/&gt; He also composed for the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballet-dance.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=16578&amp;sid=05b193958fc398c78e5f9594fb98d602|title=CriticalDance Forum • View topic - Arthur Oldham Obituary|work=ballet-dance.com|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arranged Britten's ''[[Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge]]'' (a work for string orchestra) for full orchestra, for the ballet ''Le Rêve de Léonor'', choreographed by [[Frederick Ashton]].  This had its first performance on 26 April 1949 at the Prince's Theatre, London, by the Ballet de Paris de [[Roland Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6xcZf0Vt5cC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=britten+leonor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SzY5RPqL2X&amp;sig=_tdaK-3YI_0289YvrKE-iLx_7as&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VkDBS_29MYrg7AOA9NDrCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=britten%20leonor&amp;f=false|title=Benjamin Britten|work=google.com.au|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, after [[Edmund Rubbra]] pulled out of the project, Oldham provided a variation for ''[[Variations on an Elizabethan Theme]]'', a [[Classical music written in collaboration|collaborative work]] with other contributions by [[Lennox Berkeley]], Britten, [[Imogen Holst]], [[Humphrey Searle]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[William Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Themes-Variations-Various/dp/B00005A7LD|title=Themes and Variations by BBC Symphony Orchestra, None: Amazon.co.uk: Music|work=amazon.co.uk|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMyKjyzEW_kC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=guirlande+Campra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiQh66hgNV&amp;sig=4UnEnJm5NbPSJLfo4NbaOKRTB7k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PfG_S43fGI3-7AOzzPDACQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=guirlande%20Campra&amp;f=false|title=Letters from a Life: 1952-1957|work=google.com.au|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, his modern treatment of [[Thomas Arne]]'s pastiche opera ''[[Love in a Village]]'' was staged by the [[English Opera Group]].  Criticism of the work led to a nervous breakdown and his working outside music for some time.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

He then became a [[Roman Catholic]] and was employed as a teacher at [[Scotus Academy]] and choirmaster at [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral]], Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt; He introduced Scottish pre-Reformation music such as [[Robert Carver (composer)|Robert Carver]]'s 19-part motet ''O Bone Jesu''.  Britten's ''[[Missa Brevis (Britten)|Missa Brevis]]'' had its first performance in Scotland under Oldham's direction.&lt;ref name=stm/&gt; His work at the Cathedral was noticed by people such as [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] and [[Georg Solti]].&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

The first performance in Scotland (and one of the earliest in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;) of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8 "Symphony of a Thousand"]] was scheduled for the opening night of the 1965 [[Edinburgh Festival]], with the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra|Scottish National Orchestra]], but a suitable choir was lacking.  [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|Lord Harewood]] and [[Alexander Gibson (conductor)|Alexander Gibson]] approached Oldham to create one and train the singers, and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus was born.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; Under his direction for the next 12 years, the chorus went on to participate in major works such as [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' (under Giulini), [[Michael Tippett|Tippett]]'s ''[[A Child of Our Time]]'' (under Gibson), [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]]'' (under [[Herbert von Karajan]]), [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Seven, They are Seven]]'' (under [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]]], Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|"Resurrection" Symphony]] (under [[Leonard Bernstein]]), [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s ''[[A German Requiem (Brahms)|A German Requiem]]'' (under [[Daniel Barenboim]]), and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' (under [[Claudio Abbado]]).&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; He was instrumental in the first Scottish performances of Britten's ''[[War Requiem]]'', under Alexander Gibson.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; He also continued with the St Mary's Cathedral Choir until 1971.&lt;ref name=stm/&gt;

Davidson was the recipient of the 1973 [[St Mungo Prize]], awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow.&lt;ref name='GlasStory'&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Somervillen|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSS00044|work=A P Somerville|publisher=The Glasgow Story|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked with the [[London Symphony Chorus]] between 1969 and 1976, winning three [[Grammy Award]]s.

He left for Paris in 1977 to create the [[Orchestre de Paris]]'s Chorus at Daniel Barenboim's request.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/12/news/12iht-obits_ed3__2.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times, 12 May 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; For his farewell appearance in Edinburgh he wrote ''Psalms in Time of War'', which was performed at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; His first project with the Paris chorus was [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Te Deum (Berlioz)|Te Deum]]'', under Barenboim, for which he had auditioned 1,700 people to create a chorus of 200 singers.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; From 1987 to 1994 he commuted weekly between Paris and Edinburgh, working with both choirs.  In 1992, the Edinburgh Chorus presented [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Moses und Aron]]''.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; From 1994, he worked with the Orchestre de Paris Chorus exclusively.  He celebrated 20 years with the chorus in 1996 with a new work, ''The Will of Villon''.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; He retired from that chorus in 2002.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

Arthur Oldham died in [[Villejuif]] in 2003, aged 76.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/arthur-oldham-730288.html|title=Arthur Oldham|work=The Independent|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]]'s ''[[Requiem (Fauré)|Requiem]]'' was performed in his memory.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; He was married twice, and left 2 sons and 2 daughters.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

The Arthur Oldham/Michael Lester-Cribb Memorial Fund has been created to honour the joint work of Oldham and Michael Lester-Cribb, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus's pianist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycos.co.uk/content/mediaassets/doc/Newsletter_2008.pdf National Youth Choir of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Digital inclusion''' ('''CDI''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] that uses technology to fight poverty and stimulate [[entrepreneurship]]. CDI and partners create community centers in low-income, rural, indigenous communities, hospitals, prisons, and psychiatric clinics. These centers work to strengthen low-income communities by providing access to [[information and communication technologies]].

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a US-based [[nonprofit organization]] has defined digital inclusion as follows:
Digital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).  This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= NDIA |year= 2017 |url= https://www.digitalinclusion.org/definitions/ |accessdate= June 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changed in 2015 to Recode and ''recode.org.br''.

==Overview==
Rodrigo Baggio founded the ''Comitê para Democratização da Informática'' (roughly translated as "Committee for Democracy in Information Technology" in the [[Portuguese language]]) in 1995.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Participants |date= July 21, 2008 |work= Brainstorm Tech program |publisher= Forbes |page=12 |url= http://www.brainstormtechdigital.com/brainstormtech/2008/?pg=12 |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its plan was [[social entrepreneurship]] to overcome the [[digital divide]].
CDI is a network of self-managed and self-sustaining CDI Community Centers throughout Brazil and 13 other countries – monitored and coordinated by their 23 regional offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdi.org.br&lt;/ref&gt; Schools are located in low-income communities, indigenous communities, psychiatric clinics, hospitals for mentally and physically disabled, and detention facilities. CDI is an international [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro]], with operations in the US, Europe and Latin America.

CDI helps disadvantaged groups use [[Information and Communication Technologies]] (ICTs). CDI community
centers are technology and learning centers in impoverished communities. Each community center is a
partnership with an existing [[grassroots]] organization. The community-based organizations provide the
infrastructure, and CDI provides free computers and software, implements educational methods, trains instructors
and monitors the schools.

==Methodology==
CDI community centers are self-managed and self-sustainable. Students collectively identify a common
challenge facing their community and prepare an action plan to overcome it. Issues can range from sexual abuse,
pollution, violence, crime, and drugs, to lack of health care or schools. Students can take the technical skills they’ve
learned in class to mobilize their communities, engage in advocacy and awareness campaigns,
and work together to solve that specific problem. CDI focuses on making people active and
informed citizens, capable of organizing their communities, making their voices heard, and subsequently, affecting change.

== Recognition ==
After a pilot program in two [[favela]]s, [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]] provided initial funding for three years starting in 1996.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Emily Mitchell |author2=Rachele Kanigel |author3=Elizabeth Lea |title= Rodrigo Baggio |date= February 21, 2000 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996110,00.html |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Rodrigo Baggio Barreto |work= Fellow biography |publisher= [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]] |url= http://ashoka.org/fellow/rodrigo-baggio-barreto |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AVINA Foundation]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]], [[Skoll Foundation]], [[Tech Museum]], [[Unicef]] and [[Unesco]] also provided support.
CDI founder  Rodrigo Baggio was named by the [[World Economic Forum]] as one of “100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow”, by ''Time'' magazine as one of the 50 leaders in [[Latin America]] that will make a difference in the third millennium,&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt; by [[CNN]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' as one of the world’s ten “Principal Voices in Economic Development”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Rodrigo Baggio on CNN Principal Voices |work= Video |publisher= CNN |url= http://www.ashoka.org/video/4131 |accessdate= October 16, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110929085914/http://www.ashoka.org/video/4131 |archivedate= September 29, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he was invited to join the Strategy Council of the UN’s new [[Global Alliance for Information and Communication Technologies and Development]] and the [[Clinton Global Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Recognition |year= 2009 |work= CDI blog |url= http://centerfordigitalinclusion.wordpress.com/about/recognition/ |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International expansion==
CDI opened development offices in [[New York City]] (with [[501c3|501(c)(3)]] US tax status) in 2007 and [[London]] in 2008 (UK Registered Charity), using the same acronym with an English language expansion (Centre for Digital Inclusion or CDI Europe in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=CDI Europe  |work= Orfficial website |url= http://cdieurope.eu/ |accessdate= October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the support of [[James Wolfensohn]], former president of the [[World Bank]] and the [[Wolfensohn Institute]], {{As of |2011 |lc=on}} CDI planned to expand to the Middle East and North Africa, to be followed by India and other parts of Africa.

Since 2010, CDI UK is called CDI Apps For Good. Apps for Good is an acclaimed education movement where young people in schools learn to create apps that can change their world, according to CDI's methodology.

During April- June 2010, CDI Apps for Good successfully ran the first pilot course with 9 unemployed young people aged 16–25 at High Trees Development Trust in South London. Apps for Good has grown significantly and now has nearly 655 schools in the UK delivering the courses to more than 100,000 students aged 11 to 18.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6690">The '''Centers for Public Health Preparedness''' ('''CPHP''') program was established in 2000 by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to strengthen [[bioterrorism]] and [[emergency preparedness]] by linking academic expertise to state and local health agency needs. 

The original CPHP program closed in August 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/cdcpreparedness/cphp/centers.asp Centers for Public Health Preparedness (CPHP) Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411234241/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/cdcpreparedness/cphp/centers.asp |date=April 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by the [[Preparedness and Emergency Response Learning Centers]] (PERLC) cooperative agreement program.

==Overview==
In order to "enhance the [[public health]] practice activities within [[Schools_of_public_health#Schools_of_public_health|schools of public health]],"  the CDC established a program called Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness (A-CPHP) in 2000. These centers were awarded through a competitive submission process to four schools of public health (Saint Louis University, University of Alabama-Birmingham, University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Oklahoma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/firsthours/pdf/article_slu_trust.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507050323/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/firsthours/pdf/article_slu_trust.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These initially funded centers formed a nucleus upon which to build a response to the events on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. Yet, with nearly 450,000 public health professionals dispersed throughout more than 3,000 state and local health agencies expected to protect the health of the U.S. population against threats that were previously considered unthinkable, the magnitude of the problem demanded more vigorous collaboration between the academy and the practice community.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Service Administration, Bureau of Health Professions, National Center for Health Workforce Information and Analysis (US).

In 2009, there were 27 [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH)-accredited schools of public health with established and funded centers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/cotper/cphp/centers.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629035730/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/cotper/cphp/centers.asp |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2010, the CDC gave $134 million in funding to the Centers for Public Health Preparedness (CPHP) Cooperative Agreement program; 27 CPHPs within accredited schools of public health received the funds. The point of the program is to link academia and government public health professionals in order to improve public health response. According to the journal Public Health Reports, "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, public health practitioners identified the need to enhance partnerships between academia and the practice community and to assure a competent public health and health-care workforce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richmond |first1=Alyson |last2=Hostler |first2=Liane |last3=Leeman |first3=Gregg |last4=King |first4=Wanda |title=A Brief History and Overview of CDC's Centers for Public Health Preparedness Cooperative Agreement Program |journal=Public Health Reports |date=November 2010 |volume=125 |issue=5_suppl |pages=8–14 |doi=10.1177/00333549101250S503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is run by the Publishers International Linking Association Inc. (PILA)&lt;ref name=PILA&gt;{{cite web |title=Publisher rules |url=http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/59pub_rules.html |work=Crossref.org |publisher=PILA Inc. |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was launched in early 2000 as a cooperative effort among publishers to enable persistent cross-publisher citation linking in [[Electronic journal|online academic journals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History/mission |work=Crossref.org |publisher=PILA Inc. |url=http://www.crossref.org/01company/02history.html |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Crossref is a [[not-for-profit]] association of about 2000 voting member publishers who represent 4300 societies and [[publisher]]s, including both commercial and not-for-profit organizations. Crossref includes publishers with varied business models, including those with both [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and subscription policies. Crossref does not provide a database of [[fulltext]] scientific [[Digital content|content]]. Rather, it facilitates the links between distributed content hosted at other sites.

Crossref [[Hyperlink|interlinks]] millions of items from a variety of content types, including journals, books, [[conference proceedings]], working papers, [[technical report]]s, and data sets. Linked content includes materials from Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) and Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. The expense is paid for by Crossref Member publishers. Crossref provides the technical and business infrastructure to provide for this reference linking using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). Crossref provides deposit and query service for its DOIs.

In addition to the DOI technology linking scholarly references, Crossref enables a common linking contract among its participants. Members agree to assign DOIs to their current journal content and they also agree to link from the references of their content to other publishers' content. This reciprocity is an important component of what makes the system work.

Non-publisher organizations can participate in Crossref by becoming affiliates. Such organizations include libraries, online journal hosts, linking service providers, secondary database providers, [[search engine]]s and providers of [[article discovery]] tools.

==Services==
In addition to assigning DOIs to scholarly content, Crossref provides additional services such as [[plagiarism]] screening and searching by funders.

=== CrossMark ===

The CrossMark update system facilitates reference linking and other sustainable cross-publisher services for the scholarly community.  The reader simply clicks on the CrossMark logo to view status information about the document. If an update exists, the status information will include a [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] link to the updated document.

{{quote|CrossMark allows scholars to easily identify instances of documents that are being actively maintained by their publishers. The appearance of a CrossMark logo on a HTML, PDF or ePub document indicates that the publisher is taking care of or stewarding it through any updates, corrections, retractions, or other changes.|Crossref&lt;ref&gt;

=== Initiative for Open Citations ===

Crossref citation data is made available on behalf of the [[Initiative for Open Citations]], &lt;ref name="I4OCFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/#faqs|title=FAQ|publisher=Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project, launched in April 2017, that describes itself as:&lt;ref name="I4OC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/|title=I4OC: Initiative for Open Citations|date=6 April 2017|publisher=Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crutch''' is a [[mobility aid]] that transfers weight from the [[human leg|legs]] to the upper body. It is often used by people who cannot use their legs to support their weight, for reasons ranging from short-term injuries to lifelong disabilities.

==History==
Crutches were used in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Fairley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fairley|first1=Miki|title=Innovative Crutch Designs: More Gain, Much Less Pain|url=https://opedge.com/Articles/ViewArticle/2008-04_06|website=The O&amp;P Edge |date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, Emile Schlick patented the first commercially produced crutch; the design consisted of a walking stick with an upper arm support. Later, A.R. Lofstrand, Jr. developed the first crutches with a height-adjustable feature making the crutches customizable. Through time, the design of crutches haven't changed much such that the classic design still is most commonly used.&lt;ref name=Fairley /&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Axillary (underarm) crutches.JPG|thumb|100px|Axillary (underarm) crutches]]
There are several types of crutches:

===Underarm or axilla===
Axillary crutches are used by placing the pad against the ribcage beneath the armpit and holding the grip, which is below and parallel to the pad. They are usually used to provide support for patients who have temporary restriction on ambulation.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 1042-1043.&lt;/ref&gt;
With underarm crutches, sometimes a towel or some kind of soft cover is needed to prevent or reduce armpit injury. A condition known as ''crutch paralysis,'' or ''[[crutch palsy]]'' can arise from pressure on nerves in the armpit, or [[axilla]].&lt;ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing &amp; Allied Health Dictionary]] | editors=Glanze, W.D., Anderson, K.N., &amp; Anderson, L.E | edition=3rd | publisher= The C.V. Mosby Co.|location=St. Louis, Missouri |year=1990 |isbn=0-8016-3227-7}} p.324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046"&gt;{{cite book| title=Gray’s Anatomy |editor1=Warwick, R. |editor2=Williams, P.L | edition=35th | publisher= Longman |location=London|year=1973}} p.1046&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, "the [[brachial plexus]] in the axilla is often damaged from the pressure of a crutch...In these cases the [[radial nerve|radial]] is the nerve most frequently implicated; the [[ulnar nerve]] suffers next in frequency."&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" /&gt;

An uncommon type of axillary crutches is the spring-loaded crutch. The underarm pad is a curved design that is open in the front with the grips for the hands shaped for maximum comfort and to reduce the prevalence of overuse injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mechanics of Ambulation With Standard and Spring-Loaded Crutches|last=Segura|first=A|last2=Piazza|first2=SJ|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1159–1163|pmid=17826462|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.05.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crutches also contain a spring mechanism at the bottom. The idea behind this design is to allow the user to propel themselves further, resulting in quicker movement from place to place, though research has shown that the difference in speed is very small when comparing standard axillary crutches to spring-loaded crutches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seeley|first=M K|last2=Hunter|first2=I|last3=Bateman|first3=T|last4=Roggia|first4=A|last5=Larson|first5=B J|last6=Draper|first6=DO|year=2011|title=A Kinematic Comparison of Spring-Loaded and Traditional Crutches|journal=Journal of Sport Rehabilitation|volume=20|issue=2|pages=198–206|doi=10.1123/jsr.20.2.198|pmid=21576711}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crutches are most commonly used by young or athletic populations.

===Forearm===
[[File:El uso correcto del bastón inglés.ogg|thumb|right|A typical forearm crutch]]
A forearm crutch (also commonly known as an elbow crutch, Canadian crutch or "Lofstrand" crutch due to a brand by this name) has a cuff at the top that goes around the forearm.&lt;ref name=Fairley /&gt; It is used by inserting the arm into a cuff and holding the grip.  The hinged cuff, most frequently made of plastic or metal, can be a half-circle or a full circle with a V-type opening in the front allowing the forearm to slip out in case of a fall.

Forearm crutches are the dominant type used in Europe, whether for short or long term use. Outside of Europe forearm crutches are more likely to be used by users with long term disabilities, with axillary crutches more common for short term use.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

===Platform===
[[File:Platform-crutch.jpg|thumb|right|Top portion of a platform crutch showing platform and grip]]

These are less common and used by those with poor hand or grip strength due to [[arthritis]], [[cerebral palsy]], or other conditions. The forearm rests on a horizontal platform and is usually strapped in place with velcro-type straps that allow the platform or trough to release in case of a fall. The hand holds an angled grip which, in addition, should allow adjustment of length from trough to grip and side-to-side sway depending on the user's disability.

===Leg support===
These non-traditional crutches are useful for users with an injury or disability affecting one lower leg only. They function by strapping the affected leg into a support frame that simultaneously holds the lower leg clear of the ground while transferring the load from the ground to the user's knee or thigh. This style of crutch has the advantage of not using the hands or arms while walking. A claimed benefit is that upper thigh [[atrophy]] is also reduced because the affected leg remains in use. Unlike other crutch designs these designs are unusable for pelvic, hip or thigh injuries and in some cases for knee injuries also.

Walking sticks or [[Cane (walking stick)|canes]] serve an identical purpose to crutches, but are held only in the hand and have a limited load bearing capability because of this.

== Types of gaits ==
[[File:A student nurse, acting as physical therapist 8b07715v.jpg|thumb|Small boy learns to use his crutches (1942)]]

===One crutch===
When using one crutch, the crutch is placed on the side of the unaffected leg.

===Four-point gait===
Those who can tolerate partial weight bearing on both legs usually use the four point gait. The sequence is right crutch, left leg, left crutch, right leg. This is the slowest of all gaits but also the safest in that three of the four points are in contact with the ground at any given time. &lt;ref name="walkeasy-gaits"&gt;[https://walkeasy.com/explore/crutch-gaits.php Walk Easy &gt; Explore &gt; Crutch Gaits]. Retrieved on May 19, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-point gait===
Those who can tolerate partial weight bearing on both legs but require less support than a four-point gait usually use the two-point gait. The sequence is right crutch with left leg and then left crutch with right leg.

===Three-point gait===
The three point gait is usually used by those who cannot bear weight on one leg. Both crutches are advanced while bearing weight on the unaffected leg. Then the unaffected leg is advanced while bearing weight on the crutches.

===Swing-to gait===
A person with a non-weight bearing injury generally performs a "swing-to" gait: lifting the affected leg, the user places both crutches in front of himself, and then swings his uninjured leg to meet the crutches. A similar "swing-through" gait is when both legs are advanced in front of the crutches rather than beside them.

===Stairs===
When climbing up stairs, the unaffected leg is advanced first, then the affected leg and the crutches are advanced. When descending stairs, the crutches are advanced first and then the affected leg and the unaffected leg.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

== Alternative devices ==
&lt;!--please see the talk page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Crutch before adding any more alternative devices--&gt;

The [[knee scooter]] and the [[wheelchair]] are possible alternatives for patients who cannot use or do not like crutches. These wheeled devices introduce an additional limitation, however, since they cannot negotiate stairs.

== Materials ==

'''Cultural psychology '''is the study of how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of their members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Heine, S. J. (2011). ''Cultural Psychology. ''New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fiske, A.; Kitayama, S.; Markus, H.R.; &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (1998). [http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/Classes/Readings/Heine2010Cult-Psy.pdf The cultural matrix of social psychology]. In D. Gilbert &amp; S. Fiske &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The Handbook of Social Psychology (4th ed., pp. 915–81). San Francisco: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Shweder]], one of the major proponents of the field, writes, "Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shweder, Richard (1991). Thinking Through Cultures. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-88415-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with other branches of psychology ==
Cultural psychology is often confused with [[cross-cultural psychology]]. However, cultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology in that the cross-cultural psychologists generally use culture as a means of testing the universality of psychological processes rather than determining how local cultural practices shape psychological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. | last2 = Ruby | first2 = M. B. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 2 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So whereas a cross-cultural psychologist might ask whether [[Jean Piaget]]'s stages of development are universal across a variety of cultures, a cultural psychologist would be interested in how the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the development of cognitive processes in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H.R. | last2 = Kitayama | first2 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Culture, Self, and the Reality of the Social | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 277–83 | doi = 10.1207/S15327965PLI1403&amp;4_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural psychology research informs several fields within psychology, including [[social psychology]], [[cultural-historical psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. However, the relativist perspective of cultural psychology, through which cultural psychologists compare thought patterns and behaviors within and across cultures, tends to clash with the universal perspectives common in most fields in psychology, which seek to qualify fundamental psychological truths that are consistent across all of humanity.

== Importance ==

=== Need for expanded cultural research ===
According to [[Richard Shweder]], there has been repeated failure to replicate Western psychology laboratory findings in non-Western settings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Therefore, a major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and varied cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in order to correct these theories so that they become more relevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of all human behaviors, not just Western ones.&lt;ref name="schweder84"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Shweder, R.A.|editor2=Levine, R.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Culture theory: Essays on mind, self, and emotion|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal is shared by many of the scholars who promote the [[indigenous psychology]] approach. In an attempt to show the interrelated interests of cultural and indigenous psychology, cultural psychologist Pradeep Chakkarath emphasizes that international mainstream psychology, as it has been exported to most regions of the world by the so-called West, is only one among many indigenous psychologies and therefore may not have enough intercultural expertise to claim, as it frequently does, that its theories have universal validity.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chakkarath, P.|year=2012|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396430-e-5|chapter=The role of indigenous psychologies in the building of basic cultural psychology|editor=J. Valsiner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|pages=71–95|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym W.E.I.R.D. describes populations that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Thus far, W.E.I.R.D. populations have been vastly overrepresented in psychological research.&lt;ref name="Arnett"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnett, J. J.|year=2008|url=http://facweb.northseattle.edu/kkuwada/Psyc%20200:Fall%202012/article16-1.pdf|title=The neglected 95%: Why American psychology needs to become less American|journal=American Psychologist|volume=63|issue=7|pages=602–614|pmid=18855491|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.63.7.602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weirdest" /&gt; Findings from psychology research utilizing primarily W.E.I.R.D. populations are often labeled as universal theories and are inaccurately applied to other cultures.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = Joseph | year = 2010 | title = Most people are not WEIRD | url = http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/jvt002/BrainMind/Readings/Henrich_2010.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 5| page = 29 | doi = 10.1038/466029a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research is showing that cultures differ in many areas, such as logical reasoning and social values.&lt;ref name="weirdest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Heine | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Norenzayan | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The weirdest people in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 61–135 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt; The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from their contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social psychologists refer to the "[[fundamental attribution error]]" or  the tendency to explain people's behavior in terms of internal, inherent personality traits rather than external, situational considerations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior to an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however, this phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D. populations tend to pay more attention to the context in which behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people's behavior in terms of their situation; someone's anger might be viewed as simply a result of an irritating day.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, D.|year=2010|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/media/WEIRDinScience.pdf|title=A WEIRD View of Human Nature|journal=Science |volume=328|issue=25|page=1627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisbettmiyamoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = R. | last2 = Miyamoto | first2 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = The influence of culture: holistic versus analytic perception | citeseerx=10.1.1.87.43 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 467–473 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.004 | pmid=16129648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many long-standing theories of how humans think rely on the prominence of analytical thought.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt;

By studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to account for a substantial amount of diversity of the global population. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations to other populations can lead to a miscalculation of psychological theories and may hinder psychologists' abilities to isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.

== Mutual constitution ==
Mutual constitution is the notion that the society and the individual have an influencing effect on one another. Because a society is composed of individuals, the behavior and actions of the individuals directly impact the society. In the same manner, society directly impacts the individual living within it. The values, morals, and ways of life a society exemplifies will have an immediate impact on the way an individual is shaped as a person. The atmosphere that a society provides for the individual is a determining factor for how an individual will develop. Furthermore, mutual constitution is a cyclical model in which the society and the individual both influence one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513133-8|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cultural psychology is reliant on this model, societies often fail to recognize this. Despite the overwhelming acceptance that people affect culture and culture affects people, societal systems tend to minimize the effect that people form on their communities. For example, mission statements of businesses, schools, and foundations attempt make promises regarding the environment and values that their establishment holds. However, these promises cannot be made in accordance with the mutually consisting theory without being upheld by all participants. The mission statement for the employees of Southwest Airlines, for example, makes the claim that, "...We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Southwest|url=https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/index.html?clk=GFOOTER-ABOUT-ABOUT|website=Southwest Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company can ensure the "equal opportunity for learning and personal growth", the aforementioned message cannot be promised. The work environment that Southwest provides includes paying consumers. While rules can be enforced to ensure ''safety'' on their aircraft, customers will not be removed due to attitude or a lack of courtesy. This therefore contradicts the promise of a "stable work environment". On the contrary, some establishments do ensure that their mission statements agree with the mutually consisting model. For example, Yale University promises within its mission statement that:
::Yale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice. Yale educates aspiring leaders worldwide who serve all sectors of society. We carry out this mission through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/mission-statement|website=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Positive Example of Mutual Constitution in Society.png|thumb|This image is a representation derived from ideas found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinoba Kitayama.]]
Instead of making promises that depend on all of their students and faculty, they make statements that can refer to only a part of their student/ faculty body. The statement focuses more on what they offer, and how they uphold these promises. By providing evidence they provide readers with an example as to how their school community members participate in the environment they promise, accepting the community's role in their school culture.

Past research has been conducted by middle-class North Americans analyzing culturally different societies by means of comparison mostly involving middle-class North Americans and/or aforementioned W.E.I.R.D. societies. What has been characterized as Euro-American centrism, resulted in a great volume of research for this specific selection of humans. It has also allowed us to divert from the idea that certain psychological processes can be considered basic or universal, and recognize humans' remarkable capacity to create cultures and then be shaped by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markus |first=Hazel Rose |last2=Kitayama |first2=Shinobu |date=2010 |title=Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=5 |pages=420–430 |doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although cultural psychology has internalized the mutually constituting model, further implementation in our society is necessary. Being aware of this model promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and the effect that their actions have on their community. Through acceptance of ones responsibilities and conscious application, communities have opportunity for improvement which in turn supports the individuals within the community. These ideas can be found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama which are also represented in the graphic provided.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Per Gjerde states that cultural psychology tends to "generalize about human development across nations and continents" and assigning characteristics to a culture promotes a disregard for heterogeneity and minimizes the role of the individual.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;McNulty, Jennifer (2004, July 26). "[http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/07/531.html Emphasis on 'culture' in psychology fuels stereotypes, scholar says.]" University of California: Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjerde argues that individuals develop multiple perspectives about their culture, sometimes act in accord with their culture without sharing the cultural beliefs, and sometimes outright oppose their culture. Stereotyping thus views individuals as homogeneous products of culture.&lt;ref name="wainryb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainryb | first1 = C | year = 2004 | title = The Study of Diversity in Human Development: Culture, Urgencies, and Perils | url = https://psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110173541/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-11-10 | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 47 | issue =  | pages = 131–137 | doi = 10.1159/000077986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty methodology ===
Self-reporting data is one of the easiest and most accessible methods of mass data collection, especially in cultural psychology.&lt;ref name="masuda01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2002 | title = Culture and basic psychological processes—Toward a system view of culture: Comment on Oyserman et al | url = http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/indivdualismandcollectivism/culture%20lit/to%20print/Kitayama2002commentsonOyserman.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 89–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.89 | pmid = 11843550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over-emphasizing cross-cultural comparisons of self-reported attitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and ultimately misleading data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Lehman | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Peng | first3 = K. | last4 = Greenholtz | first4 = J. | year = 2002 | title = What's wrong with cross-cultural comparisons of subjective Likert scales: The reference-group problem | url = http://culcog.berkeley.edu/Publications/2002JPSP_referencegroup.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 903–18 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = K. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Wong | first3 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Validity problems of cross-cultural value comparison and possible solutions | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92164/ValidityProblemsComparingValues.pdf?sequence=1 | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 329–41 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.2.4.329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Cultural psychologist, Richard Shweder argues that the psyche and culture are mutually constructed and inseparable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The failure of replicating many psychology findings in other regions of the world supported the idea that mind and environment are interdependent, and different throughout the world. Some criticisms state that using self-report may be a relatively unreliable method, and could be misleading especially in different cultural context. Regardless that self-report is an important way to obtain mass data, it is not the only way.

In fact, cultural psychologists utilized multiple measurements and resources no different from other scientific researches – observation, experiment, data analysis etc. For example, Nisbett &amp; Cohen (1996) investigated the relation between historical cultural background and regional aggression difference in the U.S.A. In this study, researchers designed laboratory experiment to observe participants' aggression, and crime rate, demographic statistics were analyzed. The experiment results supported the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]] theory that the aggression is a defense mechanism which is rooted in the herding cultural origin for most the southerners.&lt;ref name="nisbett96" /&gt; In laboratory observations, Heine and his colleagues found that Japanese students spend more time than American students on tasks that they did poorly on, and the finding presents a self-improvement motivation often seen in East Asian that failure and success is interconvertible with effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultural psychology|last = Heine|first = Steven|publisher = W.

Quantitative statistics of cultural products revealed that public media in western countries promote more individualistic components than East-Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Culture Outside the Head: A Meta-Analysis of Individualism—Collectivism in Cultural Products|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/199|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18544712|pages = 199–221|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308318260|first = Beth|last = Morling|first2 = Marika|last2 = Lamoreaux}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics are objective because it does not involve having people fill out questionnaire, instead, psychologists use physical measurements to quantitatively collect data about culture products, such as painting and photos. These statistics data can also be national records, for example, Chiao &amp; Blizinsky (2010) revealed that cultures of high collectivism is associated with lower prevalence of mood/anxiety disorders in study involving 29 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture–gene coevolution of individualism–collectivism and the serotonin transporter gene|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1681/529|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2010-02-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 2842692|pmid = 19864286|pages = 529–537|volume = 277|issue = 1681|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1650|first = Joan Y.|last = Chiao|first2 = Katherine D.|last2 = Blizinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the experimental and statistics data, evidence from neuro-imaging studies, also help strengthen the reliability of cultural psychology research. For example, when thinking of mother, the brain region related to self-concept showed significant activation in Chinese, whereas no activation observed in Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811906009189|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2007-02-01|pages = 1310–1316|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047|first = Ying|last = Zhu|first2 = Li|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jin|last3 = Fan|first4 = Shihui|last4 = Han|pmid=17134915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural models ==

"One way we organize and understand our social world is through the use of cultural models or culturally shaped mental maps. These consist of culturally derived ideas and practices that are embodied, enacted, or instituted in everyday life." Cultural psychologists develop models to categorize cultural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Fryberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fryberg | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Markus | first2 = H.R. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural models of education in American Indian, Asian America, and European American contexts | url = | journal = Social Psychology of Education | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1381–2890 | doi = 10.1007/s11218-007-9017-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 4 I's culture cycle ===

The 4 I's cultural model was developed by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and Alana Conner in their book ''Clash! 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are.'' In it, they refer to the mutually constitutive nature of culture and individual as a "culture cycle." The culture cycle consists of four layers (Individuals, Interactions, Institutions, Ideas) of cultural influence that help to explain the interaction between self and culture.&lt;ref name="Markus"&gt;Markus, H. R., &amp; Conner, A. C. (2013). Clash! Eight Cultural Conflicts that Make Us Who We Are. New York: Penguin (Hudson Street Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals ====
The first "I" concerns how an individual thinks about and expresses itself. Studies show that in the United States, individuals are more likely think of him or herself as "independent", "equal", and "individualistic". Individuals have characteristics that are consistent across time and situation.  When asked to describe themselves, Americans are likely to use adjectives to describe their personalities, such as "energetic", "friendly", or "hard-working". In Japan, studies show that individuals are more likely to think of themselves as "obligated to society", "interdependent", and "considerate". The self is adaptable to the situation. Japanese individuals are therefore more likely to describe themselves in relation to others, such as "I try not to upset anyone," or "I am a father, a son, and a brother."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Heine, S. (2011). Cultural Psychology. San Francisco: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interactions ====
Interactions with other people and products reinforce cultural behaviors on a daily basis. Stories, songs, architecture, and advertisements are all methods of interaction that guide individuals in a culture to promote certain values and teach them how to behave.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; For example, in Japan, no-smoking signs emphasize the impact that smoke has on others by illustrating the path of smoke as it affects surrounding people. In the US, no-smoking signs focus on individual action by simply saying "No Smoking".  These signs reflect underlying cultural norms and values, and when people see them they are encouraged to behave in accordance with the greater cultural values.

==== Institutions ====
The next layer of culture is made up of the institutions in which everyday interactions take place. These determine and enforce the rules for a society and include legal, government, economic, scientific, philosophical, and religious bodies. Institutions encourage certain practices and products while discouraging others. In Japanese kindergartens, children learn about important cultural values such as teamwork, group harmony, and cooperation. During "birthday month celebration," for example, the class celebrates all the children who have birthdays that month. This institutional practice underscores the importance of a group over an individual. In US kindergartens, children learn their personal value when they celebrate their birthdays one by one, enforcing the cultural value of uniqueness and individualism. Everyday institutional practices such as classroom birthday celebrations propagate prominent cultural themes.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Whiting model ===
John and Beatrice Whiting, along with their research students at [[Harvard University]], developed the "Whiting model" for child development during the 1970s and 1980s, which specifically focused on how culture influences development.&lt;ref name="Worthman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthman | first1 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = The Ecology of Human Development: Evolving Models for Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 546–562 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitings coined the term "cultural learning environment", to describe the surroundings that influence a child during development.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards, Carolyn P. and Bloch, M. (2010). "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&amp;context=psychfacpub The Whitings' Concepts of Culture and How They Have Fared in Contemporary Psychology and Anthropology]." Faculty Publications, Department of Psychology.Paper 501.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beatrice Whiting defined a child's environmental contexts as being "characterized by an activity in progress, a physically defined space, a characteristic group of people, and norms of behavior".&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt; This environment is composed of several layers. A child's geographical context influences the history/anthropology of their greater community. This results in maintenance systems (i.e., sociological characteristics) that form a cultural learning environment. These factors inform learned behavior, or progressive expressive systems that take the form of religion, magic beliefs, ritual and ceremony, art, recreation, games and play, or crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Berry, Ype H. Poortinga, Marshall H. Segall, Pierre R. Dasen, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Cross-Cultural Psychology: Research and Applications: Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have expanded upon the Whiting model,&lt;ref name="Worthman" /&gt; and the Whiting model's influence is clear in both modern psychology and anthropology. According to an article by Thomas Weisner in the ''[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]'', "All these [more recent] approaches share a common intellectual project: to take culture and context deeply and seriously into account in studies of human development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisner | first1 = T.S. | year = 2010 | title = John and Beatrice Whiting's Contributions to the Cross-Cultural Study of Human Development: Their Values, Goals, Norms, and Practices | url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/41/4/499.full.pdf+html | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 499–509 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and motivation ==

=== Self-enhancement vs. self-improvement ===
While self-enhancement is a person's motivation to view themselves positively, self-improvement is a person's motivation to have others view themselves positively. The distinction between the two modes of life is most evident between independent and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heine|first=Steven|date=1999|title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|url=|journal=2017 American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures with independent self-views (the premise that people see themselves as self-contained entities) often emphasize self-esteem, confidence in one's own worth and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2007/06/07/high-self-esteem-may-be-culturally-universal-international-study-shows/|title=High self-esteem may be culturally universal, international study shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With self-esteem seen as a main source of happiness in Western cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunji|date=February 2016|title=The Role of Positive Self-Evaluation on Cross-Cultural Differences in Well-Being|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motivation to self-enhance generally follows as a way to maintain one's positive view about oneself. Some strategies employed when self-enhancing often include [[Social comparison theory|downward social comparison]], compensatory self-enhancement, discounting, [[Attribution (psychology)|external attributions]] and [[basking in reflected glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Psychology|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, collectivistic cultures often emphasize self-improvement as a leading motivating factor in their lives. This motivation is often derived from a desire to not lose face and to appear positively among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heine |first1=Steven J. |last2=Raineri |first2=Andres |title=Self-Improving Motivations and Collectivism |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=January 2009 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=158–163 |doi=10.1177/0022022108326193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and empathy ==

=== Cultural orientation: collectivistic and individualistic ===
A main distinction to understand when looking at psychology and culture is the difference between [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures. People from an individualistic culture typically demonstrate an independent view of the self; the focus is usually on personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prooijen|first1=J.|title=Individualistic and social motives for justice judgments|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=1299|issue=1|pages=60–67|doi=10.1111/nyas.12143|pmid=25708080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a collectivistic society have more of a focus on the group (interdependent view of self), usually focusing on things that will benefit the group.&lt;ref name="Hui (1988)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=C.H.|title=Measurement of individualism-collectivism|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1988|volume=22|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown such differences of the self when comparing collectivistic and individualistic cultures: The [[Fundamental attribution error|Fundamental Attribution Error]] has been shown to be more common in America (individualistic) as compared to in India (collectivistic).&lt;ref name="Ross (1977)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ross|authorlink1=L.|editor1-last=Berkowitz|editor1-first=L.|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|edition=4th|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these same lines, the [[self-serving bias]] was again shown as more common among Americans than Japanese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kashima|first1=Y.|authorlink2=Harry C. Triandis|last2=Triandis|first2=H.C.|title=The self-serving bias in attributions as a coping strategy: A cross-cultural study|journal=Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology|date=1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1177/0022002186017001006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a study involving an animation of fish, wherein Western viewers interpreted the scene of a fish swimming away from a school as an expression of individualism and independence, while Eastern individuals wondered what was wrong with the singular fish and concluded that the school had kicked it out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/resources/transcripts/DiscoveringPsychology/26CulPsych.pdf|title=Discovering Psychology: Cultural Psychology|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=|website=Learner.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that in coverage of the same instance of violent crime, Western news focused on innate character flaws and the failings of the individual while Chinese news pointed out the lack of relationships of the perpetrator in a foreign environment and the failings of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is not to imply that collectivism and individualism are completely dichotomous, but these two cultural orientations are to be understood more so as a spectrum. Each representation is at either end; thus, some members of individualistic cultures may hold collectivistic values, and some collectivistic individual may hold some individualist values. The concepts of collectivism and individualism show a general idea of the values of a specific ethnic culture but should not be juxtaposed in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=G.|title=Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values|date=1980|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empathy across cultures ===
These differences in values across cultures suggests that understanding and expressing empathy may be manifested differently throughout varying cultures. Duan and Hill&lt;ref name="Duan &amp; Hill (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Hill|first2=C.E.|title=The current state of empathy research|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1996|volume=43|issue=3|pages=261–74|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; first discussed empathy in subcategories of intellectual empathy: taking on someone's thoughts/perspective, also known as cognitive empathy&lt;ref name="Soto &amp; Levenson (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soto|first1=J.A.|last2=Levenson|first2=R.W.|title=Emotion recognition across culture: The influence of ethnicity on empathic accuracy and physiological linkage|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1037/a0017399|pages=874–884|pmc=2877627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional empathy:  taking on someone's feeling/experience. Duan, Wei, and Wang&lt;ref name="Duan, Wei, &amp; Wang (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Wei|first2=M.|last3=Wang|first3=L.|title=The role of individualism-collectivism|journal=Asian Journal of Counseling|date=2008|volume=29|issue=3|pages=57–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthered this idea to include empathy in terms of being either dispositional (capacity for noticing/understanding empathy) or experiential (specific to a certain context or situation, observing the person and empathizing). This created four types of empathy to further examine: 1) dispositional intellectual empathy; 2) dispositional empathic emotion; 3) experienced intellectual empathy; and 4) experienced empathic emotion. These four branches allowed researchers to examine empathic proclivities among individuals of different cultures. While individualism was not shown to correlate with either types of dispositional empathy, collectivism was shown to have a direct correlation with both types of dispositional empathy, possibly suggesting that by having less focus on the self, there is more capacity towards noticing the needs of others. More so, individualism predicted experienced intellectual empathy, and collectivism predicted experienced empathic emotion. These results are congruent with the values of collectivistic and individualistic societies. The self-centered identity and egoistic motives prevalent in individualistic cultures, perhaps acts as a hindrance in being open to (fully) experiencing empathy.&lt;ref name="Kitayama &amp; Markus (1994)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Markus|first2=H.R.|title=Emotion and culture: Empirical studies of mutual influence|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural and ethnocultural empathy ===
Cultural empathy became broadly understood as concurrent understanding and acceptance of a culture different from one's own.&lt;ref name="Ridley &amp; Lingle (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ridely, C.R.|author2=Lingle, D.W.|editor1-last=Pedersen|editor1-first=P.B.|editor2-last=Draguns|editor2-first=J.G.|title=Counseling Across Culture|date=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousands Oaks: CA|chapter=Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been further developed with the concept of [[ethnocultural empathy]].&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y.W.|last2=Blier|first2=J.|last3=Davidson|first3=M.|last4=Savoy|first4=H.|last5=Tan|first5=J.|last6=Tan|first6=J.|last7=Yakushka|first7=O.|title=The scale of ethnocultural empathy: Development, validation, and reliability|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2003|volume=2|pages=221–234|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.50.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moves beyond merely accepting and understanding another culture, and also includes acknowledging how the values of a culture may affect empathy. This idea is meant to foster cultural empathy as well as engender cultural competence.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyche|first1=L.|last2=Zayas|first2=L.H.|title=Cross-cultural empathy and training the contemporary psychotherapist|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=3|pages=245–258|doi=10.1023/A:1010407728614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the greatest barriers of empathy between cultures is people's tendency to operate from an ethnocentric point of view. Eysneck&lt;ref name="Eysenck (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=M.|title=Psychology: A student's handbook|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press LTD}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized ethnocentrism as using one's own culture to understand the rest of the world, while holding one's own values as correct. Concomitant with this barrier to intercultural empathy, Rasoal, Eklund, and Hansen&lt;ref name="Raosal, Eklund, &amp; Hansen (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raosal|first1=C.|last2=Eklund|first2=J.|last3=Hansen|first3=E.M.|title=Toward a conceptualization of ethnocultural empathy|journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1037/h0099278}}&lt;/ref&gt; posit five hindrances of intercultural empathy; these include:

Paucity of:
* (general) knowledge outside one's own culture
* (general) experience with other cultures outside one's own
* (specific) knowledge regarding other people's cultures
* (specific) experiences regarding other people's cultures

and:
* inability to bridge different cultures by understanding the commonalities and dissimilarities

These five points elucidate lack of both depth and breadth as hindrances in developing and practicing intercultural empathy.

Another barrier to intercultural empathy is that there is often a power dynamic between different cultures. Bridging an oppressed culture with their (upper-echelon) oppressor is a goal of intercultural empathy.  One approach to this barrier is to attempt to acknowledge one's personal oppression.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeTurk|first1=S.|title=Intercultural empathy: Myth, competency, or possibility for alliance building?|journal=Communication Building|date=2001|volume=50|issue=4|pages=374–384|doi=10.1080/03634520109379262}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this may be minimal in comparison to other people's oppression, it will still help with realizing that other people have been oppressed.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)" /&gt; The goal of bridging the gap should focus on building an alliance by finding the core commonalities of the human experience; this shows empathy to be a relational experience, not an independent one. Through this, the goal is that intercultural empathy can lend toward broader intercultural understanding across cultures and societies.

Four important facets of cultural empathy are:&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;
* Taking the perspective of someone from a different culture
* Understanding the verbal/behavioral expression that occurs during ethnocultural empathy
* Being cognizant of how different cultures are treated by larger entities such as the job market and the media
* Accepting differences in cultural choices regarding language, clothing preference, food choice, etc.

These four aspects may be especially helpful for practicing cultural competence in a clinical setting. Given that most psychological practices were founded on the parochial ideals of Euro-American psychologists, cultural competence was not considered much of a necessity until said psychologists increasingly began seeing clients with different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)" /&gt; Many of the problems that contribute to therapy not being beneficial for people of color include: therapy having an individual focus, an emphasis on expressiveness, and an emphasis on openness.&lt;ref name="Sue &amp; Sue (1977)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue|first1=D.W.|last2=Sue|first2=D.|title=Barriers to effective cross-cultural counseling|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=5|pages=420–429|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.24.5.420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on intercultural competence, see [[intercultural competence]].

'''Dual language''' is a form of education in which students are taught literacy and content in two languages. The majority of dual language programs in the United States teach in [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although increasing numbers of programs use a partner language other than Spanish, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[Korean language|Korean]]. Dual language programs use the partner language for at least half of the instructional day in the elementary years.

Dual language programs generally start in [[kindergarten]] or [[first grade]] and extend for at least five years, although many continue into [[middle school]] and [[high school]]. These programs aim for [[bilingual]]ism (the ability to speak fluently in two languages), [[biliteracy]] (the ability to read and write in two languages), academic achievement equal to that of students in non-dual language programs, and [[cultural competence|cross-cultural competence]]. Most dual language programs are located in neighborhood [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, although many are [[charter school|charter]], [[magnet school|magnet]], or [[private school]]s.

==Historical Context of Two-Way Immersion==
The initiation of dual immersion programs in the United States is characterized by the coalescence of local politicians and community members.  [[Coral Way Elementary]], a K-8 school in Dade County, Florida, is cited as the first two-way bilingual school, beginning in 1963 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111013130124/http://coralwayelementary.dadeschools.net/About%20Us%202.htm].  The program was started by Cuban citizens who were seeking refuge in Florida from the Castro regime and believed that their children would eventually return to Cuban schools [https://web.archive.org/web/20111013130124/http://coralwayelementary.dadeschools.net/About%20Us%202.htm].  The Ecole Bilingue, a French/English school in Massachusetts, was formed around the same time [http://www.english-schools.org/USA/french-american-international-school-boston.htm].  In 1968, the passing of the [[Bilingual Education Act]] served to address the reality that [[Limited English Proficient]](LEP) students were in need of proper instructional support to achieve academic gains, and in turn provided federal funding for primary language instruction in local school districts [http://www.rethinkingschools.org/restrict.asp?path=archive/12_03/langhst.shtml].   The [[Lau v. Nichols]] ruling of 1974 further affirmed a student’s right to educational opportunity via appropriate instructional services (Calderón, 2000).  Schools were thus charged with the mission to implement programs suitable to the needs of their language minority students.

While the number of dual immersion programs remained relatively low throughout the mid-1980s, a greater attention to the need to provide challenging yet comprehensible (Calderón, 2000) instruction to [[English language learners]] (ELLs), in more recent years, triggered a substantial growth in the number of programs.  In 2002, for example, the implementation of the [[English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act]] of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] subsequently made it requisite that schools with large numbers of language minority students provide instruction that facilitates their acquisition of English, to consequently perform well on standardized tests [https://web.archive.org/web/20111116201644/http://www.nabe.org/nclb.html].  There are presently three hundred and ninety-eight two-way immersion programs in thirty distinct states and the District of Columbia [http://www.cal.org/twi/directory/index.html].  The quantity of programs has increased significantly in the last decade, despite efforts made in states such as Arizona and California to eradicate bilingual education programs in favor of English-immersion, with the passing of [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Proposition 203]] and [[Proposition 227]], respectively.  It is estimated ninety-four percent of the dual immersion programs are Spanish/English, with the remaining six percent either Chinese/English, Navajo/English, Japanese/English, and Korean/English programs (Bae, 2007).

==Changes in the TWI Model Since its First Implementation==
One of the most salient changes that has occurred in the two-way immersion program since its inception is its conversion from a program centered predominately on aiding ELLs to develop fluency in English to an enrichment program striving for biliteracy, bilingualism and biculturalism for all students participating.  Although two-way immersion was initially focused on supporting ELLs in their development and acquisition of English literacy skills, the need to develop bilingualism in an increasingly globalized society has made the program appealing for many parents of children who are native speakers of English (Calderón, 2000).  Whereas foreign-language education programs can provide native speakers of English with exposure to a second language, TWI has the potential to help students achieve near fluency in a second language.  This suggests that such programs are not solely focused on helping ELLs to acquire English, but instead aim to develop second language proficiency for native speakers of English.  In fact, because two-way immersion requires almost an equal amount of native English and native Spanish speakers, if the former is lacking, it is likely that such programs will not be implemented, which implies that the latter may not receive the opportunity to take part in the dual immersion program (Gomez, 2005).

==Types of Dual Language Programs==
There are four main types of dual language programs, which mainly differ in the population:

# Developmental, or maintenance, bilingual programs. These enroll primarily students who are native speakers of the partner language.
# Two-way (bilingual) immersion programs. These enroll a balance of native English speakers and native speakers of the partner language.
# Foreign language immersion, [[language immersion]] or one-way immersion. These enroll primarily native English speakers.
# Heritage language programs. These mainly enroll students who are dominant in English but whose parents, grandparents, or other ancestors spoke the partner language.

The term "dual language" is often used interchangeably with two-way immersion. Other variations on dual language include "dual language immersion," "dual immersion," and "dual enrollment". The term [[bilingual education]] has somewhat fallen out of favor among dual language practitioners, but it is still used to refer to any program that uses two languages for instruction.

Dual language programs are different from transitional bilingual programs, where the aim is to transition students out of their native language and, in the [[United States]], into English as quickly as possibly, usually in three years. This is sometimes referred to as ''subtractive bilingualism'' since the first language is typically lost as English is acquired. Dual language programs are considered to promote "additive bilingualism", meaning that students' primary language is developed and maintained as a second language is added.

Another type of program that is not considered dual language is [[language education|foreign language education]] where students receive less than half a day studying in the partner language, and often only study language arts and literature in that language as opposed to content area subjects such as [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[social studies]].

==Variation within Dual Language Programs==

There are two main variations:
1.  Amount of time spent in the partner language
2.  Division of languages

1.  Time Spent in Partner Language

*Full immersion, or 90/10, programs teach in the partner language 90% of the time in the primary grades (usually kindergarten and first grade) and 10% in English, and gradually adjust the ratio each year until the partner language is used 50% and English is used 50% by [[third grade|third]] or [[fourth grade]] (sometimes later if the program extends through [[eighth grade]] or beyond). 50/50, programs teach 50% of the day in English and 50% of the day in the partner language at all grade levels.
* Partial Immersion teaches less than 50% of the time and usually focuses on one content area, either language arts, math or science.

There is currently no research indicating that one of these methods is preferable to another, although some research indicates that students who spend more time in the partner language do better in that language (Howard, Christian, &amp; Genesee, 2003; Lindholm-Leary, 2001; Lindholm-Leary &amp; Howard, in press), and that language minority students (in the U.S., those whose native language is not English) do better academically when their [[native language]] is supported and developed (Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; 2002).

Some schools, like [[Arizona Language Preparatory]] in Phoenix, Arizona and [[Ysleta Independent School District|Alicia R. Chacon Elementary School]] in [[El Paso, Texas]] include a third language for a full day or a small portion of the day at all grade levels. Arizona Language Preparatory offers two full days of Mandarin Chinese, two full days of Spanish and one day of English. Arizona Language Preparatory is also the first school in the nation to send a delegation of "Mini Ambassadors" through Phoenix Sister Cities to Chengdu, China. Youth ambassador programs are typically done on the high school level.

Full immersion (90/10) programs typically begin [[literacy]] instruction for students in kindergarten and first grade in the partner language and add formal literacy in English in second or third grade. Students do not need to relearn how to read in English; teachers help them transfer their literacy skills from one language to the other. Other 90/10 programs separate students by native language and provide initial literacy instruction in the native language, adding second language literacy by second or third grade. In partial immersion or 50/50 programs, initial literacy instruction is either provided simultaneously in both languages to all students, or students are separated by native language in order to receive initial literacy in his or her native language.

Dual language programs in [[middle school]] and [[high school]] often merge students from several dual language elementary schools and exist as programs within larger mainstream schools. They often offer dual language students the opportunity to take language arts and at least one content area in the partner language, and many prepare students to take the [[Advanced Placement]] exams.

2.  Division of Languages

*  Language division by schedule: Within any dual language program, students speak and study in one language at a time, and the times for each language are explicitly defined.  There is great variation, however, in the specifics.  In some programs, language alternates by day, by week, or by several week periods.  In other schools, students speak one language in the morning and the other language after lunch.  After a designated amount of time, one, two, or more weeks, the morning and afternoon languages switch.  Further variation includes programs where particular subjects are always taught in one language, due to resource availability.  Within a given school or program, there may be different schedules for different grades, such as at the Amistad Dual Language School in New York City, where students alternate languages less frequently as they progress through the grades and establish stronger skills in both languages.
*  Language division by instructor: A dual language program may use a Self-Contained or Side-by-Side model. Self-Contained programs have one teacher for one group of students in one classroom.  The teacher transitions from one language to the other along with her or his students.  Alternatively, Side-by-Side programs have two or more classrooms for each grade, where one teacher teaches in the partner, or target, language and the other teacher teaches in the dominant language (English in the United States).  The grade is divided into two groups of students and the groups trade classrooms and teachers according to an explicit schedule, whether daily or weekly. Finally, at some schools, two or more teachers may team teach in the same classroom, with each teacher using one language and a combination of whole group, small group, and independent activities facilitated by the teachers.

==Instruction in Dual Language Programs==
Dual language programs vary in the kinds of instruction they provide, but generally implement many of the following features:

*[[language arts]] instruction in both program languages
*instruction on literacy skills like [[phonics]] and [[fluency]] along with opportunities to read [[literature]] in both languages
*[[sheltered instruction]] strategies in both languages
*[[ability grouping]] for targeted purposes, with frequent reassessment based on strengths and weaknesses on different skills
*separation of languages, where the teacher will only speak one language at a time without translating, while allowing students to use native language resources such as peers and bilingual dictionaries
*ample time for student interaction (such as through the use of cooperative learning), allowing students to practice their new language skills with their peers

Dual language teachers also incorporate practices that should be in place in any classroom that includes linguistically diverse students:

*Teaching content so that it interests and challenges bilingual students 
*Communicating high expectations, respect, and interest in each of their students 
*Understanding the roles of language, race, culture, and gender in schooling 
*Engaging parents and community in the education of their children 
*Becoming knowledgeable about and developing strategies to educate bilingual students and to communicate with their families
*Seeking and obtaining the professional development needed to engender these attitudes, knowledge bases and specific instructional skills (Garcia, 2005).

In regard to lesson planning, dual language teachers should focus on creating lessons that:

*proceed from whole to part 
*are learner centered 
*have meaning and purpose for students and connection to their present lives 
*engage groups of students in social interaction 
*develop both oral and written language 
*show faith in the learner in order to expand students’ potential (Freeman &amp; Freeman, 1994)
 
Other important tips for educators teaching bilingual or multilingual students include organizing content around themes, providing students with choice, starting the learning process with students’ questions, and exposing students to not only professional published books and magazines but student-authored literature (Freeman &amp; Freeman, 1994).

==Effectiveness of Two-Way Immersion==
Two-way immersion has been referred to as the most effective bilingual program contributing to long-term academic success (Howard et al. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;24).  Thorough planning and effective implementation are crucial to the success of TWI programs, in addition to ample support from administrators and access to quality resources.  In well-implemented programs, ELLs have achieved higher academic success than their peers in other bilingual programs (Dorner, 2011).  Effective implementation, for one, lies in the duration of the program.  In order to produce academic achievement, students ideally must be enrolled in TWI programs for four to seven years (Howard et al. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;24).  Students participating in TWI programs for this length of time have been shown to demonstrate higher academic performance than their peers in English-immersion programs (Howard et al. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;24).  On the contrary, students who receive little to no instruction in their native language, during their elementary years, struggle to attain grade level performance in the target language (Cobb, 2006).

Both Native English Speakers (NES) and ELLs are beneficiaries of the gains made through TWI.  The juxtaposed use of the majority and minority language in TWI programs can enable children to transfer skills from the secondary language to their primary language and vice versa (Scanlan, 2009).  Research comparing the academic achievement made by native speakers of English and native speakers of Spanish illustrates that while both groups show growth in their native and secondary language, English native speakers are more dominant in their primary language, whereas Spanish native speakers are able to achieve a more balanced form of bilingualism, that is, relatively equal in their ability to communicate orally and in writing in their primary and secondary language (Howard et al. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;36).

The evidence of the effectiveness of TWI is consistent in programs where less common languages are maintained as well.  For example, an eight-year study of the Navajo/English two-way bilingual program at the Rough Rock Community School in northeastern Arizona confirms that those students who received thorough instruction in their native language as well as the target language encountered more success in school than their peers in English-only programs (McCarty, 2000).  Such students too showed progress in both languages in their writing abilities on local and national measures (McCarty, 2000).

In addition to quantitative measures of effectiveness, research has further credited the two-way immersion model as creating more unified communities in public schools amongst parents and caregivers, since speakers of both majority and minority languages are grouped together in an effort to develop literacy skills in both languages and consequently foster cross-cultural relationships in both cultures (Scanlan, 2009).  Furthermore, studies have shown that high school students who attended schools with two-way bilingual programs were more motivated and passionate about attaining higher level education (Cobb, 2006).

Dual Language Immersion programs may be inefficient in the education of language-minority students. Issues are raised in the quality of instruction in the minority language, the effects of dual immersion and intergroup relations, and, how Dual Language immersion programs fit into the relationship between language and power of children and society (Valdes, 1997).

While such examples attest to the effectiveness of the TWI model, these programs are often voluntary which signifies the inherent difficulty in making comparisons across programs.  Academic success and biculturalism may be attributed to the quality of the TWI program, however, may also be ascribed to external factors such as a student’s inherent qualities or socioeconomic status (Howard et al. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;12).  Thus, while standardized test scores, from a policy perspective, are often used to determine the effectiveness of a program, other elements may impact the academic success achieved by many students in the TWI program (Howard et al. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;23).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">'''Education Business Partnerships (EBPs)''' were, until 2011, UK-government-sponsored bodies. In 2011 the [[Department for Education]] ('''DfE''') abolished funding for Education Business Links. EBPs now directly contract with schools to provide Work Experience, Work Related Learning, Enterprise Education and Careers Education, Information and Guidance (CEIAG) by linking the worlds of business and education to offer young people a rewarding and realistic introduction to work. Around two thirds of secondary schools nationally have decided to maintain a work experience offer.

EBPs are regionally based and supported by a national network organisation, the Education Business Partnership Network.

==Statutory status==
EBPs do not have a statutory status, although many support schools and local authorities with delivery of statutory programmes.

==Funding==
In March 2011 the [[Young People's Learning Agency]] stated that the [[Department for Education]], successor to the DCSF, had confirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sctp.org.uk/documents/EBPSFundingWithdrawn.pdf | title=Education Business Partnership Services Funding Withdrawn | date=28 March 2011 | accessdate=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that funding for Education Business Partnership Services had been withdrawn with effect from 31 March 2011 and that schools would decide whether to buy in their services locally.

==Awards and reputation==

In 2017, Edward Elgar Publishing was awarded the prestigious Fox Williams Independent Publisher of the Year Award at the [[Independent Publishers Guild]] (IPG) Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipg.uk.com/independent-publishing-awards "IPG Independent Publishing Awards honour 2018 winners"], IPG.&lt;/ref&gt; As a "resolutely forward-looking business", expanding into law publishing and building digital platform Elgaronline, the judges praised EEP for "punching way above its weight despite competition from far larger operators". "Edward Elgar produced an outstanding performance in a difficult market in 2016," the judges said. "It is a very well run and profitable company with excellent partnerships, great author care and consistently superb customer service." At the same awards ceremony, EEP was also awarded the ProQuest Academic &amp; Professional Publisher of the Year Award 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Onwuemezi, Natasha, [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/edward-elgar-crowned-ipg-publisher-year-485106 "Edward Elgar crowned Publisher of the Year at IPG Awards"], ''The Bookseller'', 9 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This brings the tally of major awards received in the last four years to six.

In 2015, the firm was nominated for three awards at the Independent Publishing Awards and won the Digital Publishing Award for their www.ElgarOnline.com online ebook and journal content platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomsbury, Edward Elgar and Nosy Crow lead IPG Awards shortlists|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/bloomsbury-edward-elgar-and-nosy-crow-lead-ipg-award-shortlist|work=The Bookseller|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges cited the "excellent site design and back-end technology" and also applauded the way it provided free content to libraries in poorer countries: "That is sensible, creditable and important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPG Independent Publishing Awards winners revealed|url=http://www.ipg.uk.com/awards|publisher=Independent Publishers Guild|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015 Edward Elgar Publishing was also shortlisted by ''[[The Bookseller]]'' for the Independent Academic, Educational and Professional Publisher of the Year Award to be presented at Awards dinner in May 2015. ''The Bookseller'' said Elgar was "trying for an unprecedented third win on the trot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hachette, Pan Mac, Foyles lead Bookseller Industry Awards chase|url=http://thebookseller.com/news/hachette-pan-mac-foyles-lead-bookseller-industry-awards-chase|publisher=The Bookseller|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bookseller'' has been the leading British business magazine for the book industry since 1858.

In 2014, Edward Elgar Publishing won the award for Independent Academic, Educational and Professional Publisher of the Year at the annual industry awards hosted by ''The Bookseller'' in London. In the same year the company won the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] Academic and Professional Publisher of the Year award at the Independent Publishers Guild (IPG) awards.  ''The Bookseller'' noted the publisher's "renowned author care and entrepreneurial approach", while the IPG reported that "Edward Elgar is incredibly professional, responsive and imaginative. It is a great example of how a relatively small publisher can be at least as innovative as those many times its size".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What our judges said|url=http://www.ipg.uk.com/?id=-1572|website=IPG|publisher=Independent Publishers' Guild|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Elgar Publishing had previous won the ''Bookseller'' award in 2013.  At that time the award was given for "achieving record sales in a tough market, launching digital platform Elgaronline and for its "high-class editorial, design and production".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/random-house-and-foyles-triumph-bookseller-industry-awards.html "Random House and Foyles triumph at Bookseller Industry Awards"], ''The Bookseller'', 13 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The company was also shortlisted by the IPG in 2013 and 2012.

'''Elisabeth Schumann''' (13 June 1888 &amp;ndash; 23 April 1952) was a German [[soprano]] who sang in [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[oratorio]], and [[lied]]er. She left a substantial legacy of recordings.

==Career==
[[File:Elisabeth Schumann &amp; Richard Strauss.jpg|thumb|left|Elisabeth Schumann and Richard Strauss]]
Born in [[Merseburg]], Schumann trained for a singing career in Berlin and Dresden. She made her stage debut in Hamburg in 1909. Her initial career started in the lighter [[soubrette]] roles that expanded into mostly [[Lyric soprano|lyrical]] roles, some [[Coloratura soprano|coloratura]] roles, and even a few [[Dramatic soprano|dramatic]] roles. She remained at the [[Hamburg Opera]] until 1919, also singing during the 1914/15 season at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], New York. From 1919 to 1938, she was a star of the [[Vienna State Opera]]. Her most famous role was that of Sophie in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''; but she also excelled in Mozart, taking the roles of Pamina in ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', Zerlina in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', Blonde in ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' and Susanna in ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]''.

The conductor {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Alwin|de}} was her second husband from 1920 until 1938. In 1938 she emigrated to New York City where she lived until her death on 23 April 1952. During World War II she gave recitals but mainly taught singing, privately and at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in Philadelphia. After the war she gave many recitals in Europe, making a particularly successful comeback in England.

She was a much-loved artist, admired for her vivacity, elegance, and beauty. She was closely connected with Richard Strauss, [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Lotte Lehmann]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], and other leading musicians of the first half of the 20th century.

==Opera roles==
In a career spanning 28 years, Schumann sang 91 roles.

'''Gail Robinson''' (7 August 1946 – 19 October 2008) was an American [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who sang with many of the world's leading opera companies during the 1970s and 1980s. She spent most of her career singing [[lyric coloratura]] roles at the [[Metropolitan Opera]].&lt;ref name="Tommasini-nyt"&gt;Tommasini, Anthony (October 21, 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/arts/music/21robinson.html?ref=obituaries "Gail Robinson, Soprano Who Sang at the Metropolitan Opera, Dies at 62".] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After her performance career ended she taught [[singing]] to young artists and also directed the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artist Program for over ten years. Upon leaving the Met, she joined the voice faculty at the [[University of Kentucky]].

==Biography==
Robinson was born in [[Meridian, Mississippi]] but moved to [[Jackson, Tennessee]] shortly thereafter. She showed musical talent early, performing locally on radio and television. She graduated from [[Jackson High School (Jackson, Tennessee)|Jackson High School]] in 1964 and went on to study voice under Norvell Taylor at [[Memphis State University]]. While at MSU, she won the Metropolitan Opera's ''Audition of the Air'' (the precursor to the National Council Auditions) at the young age of 19.&lt;ref name="dunlap-js"&gt;Dunlap, Stanley (October 22, 2008). [http://jacksonsun.com/article/20081022/NEWS01/810220316/1002/rss "Opera singer, Jackson native dies Gail Robinson-Lohmeyer died Sunday".] ''[[The Jackson Sun]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this important win, Robinson left MSU to the Met's development program for young artists, with which Robinson sang leading roles in school performances throughout New York, beginning in 1966.

Robinson made her professional opera debut in 1966 with [[Memphis Opera]] as the title heroine in [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' conducted by [[Fiora Contino]]. That same year she toured to Rhode Island with the Met to perform the role of the Swallow in the American premiere of [[Malcolm Williamson]]'s ''The Happy Prince''. She made her debut at the company's opera house three years later as the First Genii in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. She became a regular performer at the Met during the next two decades singing in more than 200 performances with the company.&lt;ref name="Tommasini-nyt"/&gt; Her roles with the Metropolitan Opera included Adina in ''[[L'Elisir d'Amore]]'', Almirena in ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'', Amore in ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', Annina in ''[[La Traviata]]'', Barbarina in ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', Flower Maiden in ''[[Parsifal]]'', Garsenda in ''[[Francesca da Rimini]]'', Gilda in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', Gretel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel]]'', Guadalena in ''[[La Périchole]]'', Juliette in ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'', Konstanze in ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'', Lucia in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', Norina in ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', Oscar in ''[[Un Ballo in Maschera]]'', Pamina in ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', Princess in ''[[L'Enfant et les Sortilèges]]'', Rosina in ''[[Il Barbiere di Siviglia]]'', Servilia in ''[[La Clemenza di Tito]]'', Sophie in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', and Sophie in ''[[Werther]]'' among others. Her last performance both with the Met and on the operatic stage was as Echo in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' on October 10, 1987. Robinson decided to retire at the time due to health reasons.

Robinson's career also took her to other leading opera houses around the world including the [[Hamburg State Opera]], [[Berlin State Opera]], the [[Munich State Opera]], and [[Grand Théâtre de Genève]] among others. She also sang at numerous companies in the United States including the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], [[San Antonio Grand Opera Festival]], [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]], [[New Orleans Opera]], [[Opera Omaha]] and the [[Kentucky Opera]] among others.

Robinson also had a fruitful career as a concert artist and recitalist, giving performances in more than 80 cities in the United States alone and singing at such distinguished places as the [[White House]] and [[Carnegie Hall]]. She performed with several prestigious orchestras including the [[Hollywood Bowl Orchestra]] and the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] among others.&lt;ref name="Login"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article5009730.ece|title=Login|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her career on stage she began mentoring young singers in the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artist Program, becoming director of both that program and the Met's National Council Auditions for almost fifteen years.&lt;ref name="dunlap-js"/&gt; In 1999 she became a professor of voice at the [[University of Kentucky]] and held the position until she died. Several of her students have gone on to have successful opera careers including [[Stephanie Blythe]], [[Dwayne Croft]], [[Christine Goerke]], [[Paul Groves (tenor)|Paul Groves]] and [[Heidi Grant Murphy]].

Robinson was the recipient of numerous honours including an honorary PhD in fine arts from [[Rhodes College]], Memphis, and the inaugural Obelisk Award of the [[Center for Contemporary Opera]].

Robinson died of complications from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] on October 19, 2008, aged 62. She was the wife of [[Henno Lohmeyer]],&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Christopher (October 22, 2008).[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/oct/22/robinson-lent-voice-to-lead-roles-at-02/ "Met soprano Gail Robinson dies".] ''[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; a journalist and writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexingtonopera.com/newsletters/vol5no1fall2005.pdf "Bravo!

==Recordings==
Very little of Robinson's work has been recorded. She was never offered a recording contract with a record label and the only surviving records of her work are a videotaped performance of the Met's production of ''Francesca da Rimini'', several [[operetta]] films, such as [[Millöcker]]'s ''[[Die Dubarry]]'', that she made in Germany during the 1970s, and several television appearances.&lt;ref name="Login"/&gt;

== Organization ==
Georgian Technical University has more than 12,000 students and around 1,500 faculty and staff members. Major faculties of the university are as follows:
*[[Civil Engineering]]
*Power Engineering and Telecommunication
*Mining and [[Geology]]
*[[Chemical Technology]] and [[Metallurgy]]
*[[Architecture]], [[Urban planning]] and [[Design]]
*Informatics and Control Systems;
*[[Transportation]] and Machine-Building
*Humanitarian-Social&lt;ref&gt;A recent addition, which comprised all arts and economics departments that have existed in the GTU for past ten years.&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian Technical University has provided over 60% of Georgia's engineering, chemistry and scientific industry specialists for the last eighty years. While its major counterpart [[Tbilisi State University]] focuses on popular specialties like Civil Law or Economics, GTU continues its fine tradition of providing technical specialists to the industry and exact sciences. Additionally, over the recent years GTU added more establishments, "Caucasus Business School" (a joint project of GTU, Tbilisi State University and Georgia State University (Atlanta, Georgia, USA), German Studies faculty, a Franco-Georgian Studies faculty and a "Cisco Networking Academy". GTU also has thirteen offspring institutes all over the country.

GTU uses the [[ECTS grading scale]] and awards degrees and diplomas in Diploma of Specialist, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Science. 
The first three degrees require four to four-and-one-half years of full-time studies; the Master of Sciences degree requires a year-and-one-half to two years of full-time studies. Most students (apart from those in humanitarian or arts specialties) undergo rigorous training in mathematics and fundamental sciences while studying at the GTU. GTU is known for its strong ties with [[Andria Razmadze Institute of Mathematics of Georgia]], the leading mathematical research institute in TransCaucasia.

GTU also awards scientific Ph.D.s that require three or more years of advanced studies depending on specialty.

All degrees are also provided as part-time and distance studies; these may take much longer to complete.

GTU's scientific library is one of the largest libraries in Georgia, comprising 1,254,000 books of which many are unique and rare finds, and 500,000 periodic materials. Plans are underway for digitizing this large collection of knowledge.

In [[mathematics education]] at the level of [[primary school]] or [[elementary school]], the '''grid method''' (also known as the '''box method''') of multiplication is an introductory approach to multi-digit multiplication calculations, i.e. multiplications involving numbers larger than ten. 

Compared to traditional [[long multiplication]], the grid method differs in clearly breaking the multiplication and addition into two steps, and in being less dependent on place value.  

Whilst less ''efficient'' than the traditional method, grid multiplication is considered to be more ''reliable'', in that children are less likely to make mistakes.  Most pupils will go on to learn the traditional method, once they are comfortable with the grid method; but knowledge of the grid method remains a useful "fall back", in the event of confusion. It is also argued that since anyone doing a lot of multiplication would nowadays use a pocket calculator, efficiency for its own sake is less important; equally, since this means that most children will use the multiplication algorithm less often, it is useful for them to become familiar with a more explicit (and hence more memorable) method.

Use of the grid method has been standard in mathematics education in primary schools in England and Wales since the introduction of a [[National Numeracy Strategy]] with its "numeracy hour" in the 1990s. It can also be found included in various curricula elsewhere.  Essentially the same calculation approach, but not necessarily with the explicit grid arrangement, is also known as the '''partial products algorithm''' or '''partial products method'''.

== Calculations ==

=== Introductory motivation ===

The grid method can be introduced by thinking about how to add up the number of points in a regular array, for example the number of squares of chocolate in a chocolate bar.  As the size of the calculation becomes larger, it becomes easier to start counting in tens; and to represent the calculation as a box which can be sub-divided, rather than drawing lots and lots of dots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathsonline.org/pages/boxmult.html?56&amp;551 Long multiplication − The Box method]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/maths/number/multiplicationdivisionrev1.shtml Long multiplication and division]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the simplest level, pupils might be asked to apply the method to a calculation like 3 &amp;times; 17.  Breaking up ("partitioning") the 17 as (10 + 7), this unfamiliar multiplication can be worked out as the sum of two simple multiplications:

:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | &amp;nbsp;
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 10
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 7
|-
! scope="row" | 3
|30
|21
|}

so 3 &amp;times; 17 = 30 + 21 = 51.

This is the "grid" or "boxes" structure which gives the multiplication method its name.

Faced with a slightly larger multiplication, such as 34 &amp;times; 13, pupils may initially be encouraged to also break this into tens.
So, expanding 34 as 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 and 13 as 10 + 3, the product 34 &amp;times; 13 might be represented:

:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | &amp;nbsp;
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 10
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 10
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 10
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 4
|-
! scope="row" | 10
|100
|100
|100
|40
|-
! scope="row" | 3
|30
|30
|30
|12
|}

Totalling the contents of each row, it is apparent that the final result of the calculation is (100 + 100 + 100 + 40) + (30 + 30 + 30 + 12) = 340 + 102 = 442.

=== Standard blocks ===

Once pupils have become comfortable with the idea of splitting the whole product into contributions from separate boxes, it is a natural step to group the tens together, so that the calculation 34 &amp;times; 13 becomes

:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | &amp;nbsp;
! scope="col" width="120pt" | 30
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 4
|-
! scope="row" | 10
|300
|40
|-
! scope="row" | 3
|90
|12
|}
giving the addition
::{|
|&lt;pre&gt;
  300
   40
   90
 + 12
 ----
  442
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

so 34 &amp;times; 13 = 442.

This is the most usual form for a grid calculation.  In countries such as the U.K. where teaching of the grid method is usual, pupils may spend a considerable period of time regularly setting out calculations like the above, until the method is entirely comfortable and familiar.

=== Larger numbers ===
The grid method extends straightforwardly to calculations involving larger numbers.

For example, to calculate 345 &amp;times; 28, the student could construct the grid with six easy multiplications

:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | &amp;nbsp;
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 300
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 40
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 5
|-
! scope="row" | 20
|6000
|800
|100
|-
! scope="row" | 8
|2400
|320
|40
|}

to find the answer 6900 + 2760 = 9660.

However, by this stage (at least in standard current U.K. teaching practice) pupils may be starting to be encouraged to set out such a calculation using the traditional long multiplication form without having to draw up a grid.

Traditional long multiplication can be related to a grid multiplication in which only one of the numbers is broken into tens and units parts to be multiplied separately:
:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 
! scope="col" width="120pt" | &amp;nbsp;345
|-
! scope="row" | 20
|6900
|-
! scope="row" | 8
|2760
|}

The traditional method is ultimately faster and much more compact; but it requires two significantly more difficult multiplications which pupils may at first struggle with {{cn|date=April 2013}}.  Compared to the grid method, traditional long multiplication may also be more abstract {{cn|date=April 2013}}and less manifestly clear {{cn|date=April 2013}}, so some pupils find it harder to remember what is to be done at each stage and why {{cn|date=April 2013}}. Pupils may therefore be encouraged for quite a period to use the simpler grid method alongside the more efficient traditional long multiplication method, as a check and a fall-back.

== Other applications ==

=== Fractions ===

While not normally taught as a standard method for [[Fractions#Multiplication|multiplying fractions]], the grid method can readily be applied to simple cases where it is easier to find a product by breaking it down.

For example, the calculation 2½ &amp;times; 1½ can be set out using the grid method

:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | &amp;nbsp;
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 2
! scope="col" width="40pt" | ½
|-
! scope="row" | 1
| 2
| ½
|-
! scope="row" | ½
| 1
| ¼
|}

to find that the resulting product is 2 + ½ + 1 + ¼ = 3¾

=== Algebra ===

The grid method can also be used to illustrate the multiplying out of a product of [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s, such as (''a'' + 3)(''b'' + 2), a standard topic in elementary algebra (although one not usually met until [[secondary school]]):

:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! scope="col" width="40pt" | &amp;nbsp;
! scope="col" width="40pt" | ''a''
! scope="col" width="40pt" | 3
|-
! scope="row" | ''b''
| ''ab''
| 3''b''
|-
! scope="row" | 2
| 2''a''
| 6
|}

Thus (''a'' + 3)(''b'' + 2) = ''ab'' + 3''b'' + 2''a'' + 6.

== Mathematics ==
Mathematically, the ability to break up a multiplication in this way is known as the [[distributive law]], which can be expressed in algebra as the property that ''a''(''b''+''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac''.  The grid method uses the distributive property twice to expand the product, once for the horizontal factor, and once for the vertical factor.

Historically the grid calculation (tweaked slightly) was the basis of a method called [[lattice multiplication]], which was the standard method of multiple-digit multiplication developed in medieval Arabic and Hindu mathematics.  Lattice multiplication was introduced into Europe by [[Fibonacci]] at the start of the thirteenth century along with the so-called Arabic numerals themselves; although, like the numerals also, the ways he suggested to calculate with them were initially slow to catch on.  [[Napier's bones]] were a calculating help introduced by the Scot [[John Napier]] in 1617 to assist lattice method calculations.

'''Cornelis "Kees" Bol''' (September 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; September 16, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhbest.nl/index.php/2009/09/19/kees-bol-1916-2009-brabantse-topschilder/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[art education|art educator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/10084|title=Home Kees Bol|work=rkd.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was exhibited in art galleries and museums throughout the Netherlands, as well as in [[Paris]]. In 1950 Bol was awarded the [[Thérèse Schwartze|Thérèse van Duyl-Schwartze Prize]] and in 1982 he was made [[Knight]] in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]].

==Biography==
Bol was born in [[Oegstgeest]], [[South Holland]]. Initially he was a florist in his home town. After moving to [[Eindhoven]] in 1935, he held corporate jobs at [[Bata Shoes]] and [[Philips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=P.M.J|title=Beeldend Nederland: biografisch handboek|edition=2|location=[[Tilburg]]|publisher=P.M.J. Jacobs|year=1993|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 he married Toos van 't Hof. In 1946 he turned to art, studying at the [[Royal Academy of Art (The Hague)|Royal Academy of Art]] in [[The Hague]] with [[Paul Citroen]], Han van Dam, Jan Heesters, and Henk Meijer.&lt;ref name="8k"&gt;[http://www.keesbol.8k.com/index.html Kees Bol - Unofficial website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420115228/http://keesbol.8k.com/index.html |date=2008-04-20 }} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 he moved to [[Tongelre]], Eindhoven where he worked as a painter and taught at the [[Design Academy Eindhoven]].

In 1970 he moved to [[Heusden]]. He also spent considerable time painting in [[France]].

At the Design Academy Eindhoven, back at the [[Royal Academy of Art (The Hague)|Royal Academy of Art]] and in his [[studio]] Bol educated scores of art students, among whom [[Helen Berman]], Frans Clement, [[Els Coppens-van de Rijt]], [[Frank Dekkers]], Frank Letterie, Har Sanders, and Hans van Vroonhoven. His three sons, [[Henri Bol|Henri]] (1945-2000), Peter (born 1947), and Guillaume (born 1950), have also become visual artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterbol.com/CONTENT/biografie-e.html|title=peterbol|work=peterbol|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929012944/http://www.peterbol.com/content/biografie-e.html|archivedate=2015-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposite what had been his home and studio from 1947 in Eindhoven, a park was named in his honor. This park contains Bol's bust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoldhometown.com/eindhoven/picture/number12342.asp Picture d description of the park and statue at Eindhoven-in-beeld.nl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912140921/http://www.theoldhometown.com/eindhoven/picture/number12342.asp |date=2007-09-12 }} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 1991 the Dutch broadcaster [[NCRV]] aired a special about the painter.

'''''Lives on the Boundary''''', written by [[American people|American]] scholar [[Mike Rose (educator)|Mike Rose]], is a 1989 work of non-fiction that explores the challenges and successes associated with literacy at the margins of America’s education system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">The '''Lowry Bill''', also known as the '''Lowry Act''' and the '''Lowry Normal School Bill''', was a bill introduced in 1910 in the [[Ohio]] state legislature which called for the establishment of two state [[normal schools]] in northern Ohio, one in the northeast and one in the northwest.  It was named after its main sponsor, John Hamilton Lowry, a representative from northwest Ohio's [[Henry County, Ohio|Henry County]].  It was approved and signed into law by Ohio Governor [[Judson Harmon]] on May 19, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/scfaq.html#ksu|title= Kent State University: General History|accessdate= 2008-05-14|author= Kent State University Special Collections and Archives|date= 2007-05-09|work= Kent State University Special Collections and Archives FAQ|publisher= Kent State University|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513114532/http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/scfaq.html#ksu|archivedate= 2008-05-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following its approval, the Commission on Normal School Sites was established and search committees were formed to determine the sites of the two schools with nearly forty communities applying.  On November 25, 1910, the Commission announced that the villages of [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]] in the northeast and [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] in the northwest had been selected as the sites of the new schools.&lt;ref name="Memories"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hildebrand, William H. |author2=Keller, Dean H. |author3=Herington, Anita D. |title= A Book of Memories: Kent State University 1910-1992|year= 1993|publisher= Kent State University Press|location= Kent, Ohio, USA|isbn= 0-87338-488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These schools would eventually evolve into what are today [[Kent State University]] and [[Bowling Green State University]].&lt;ref name="Memories"/&gt;

Lowry Hall, one of the oldest buildings at Kent State University (built 1913), was named for John Hamilton Lowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.kent.edu/page/10372|title= Campus Building Information|accessdate=2008-05-14 |date= 2008-01-23|work= Joseph F. Morbito Architecture Library |publisher= Kent State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of the bill==
[[Ohio]] did not have schools of education at its public universities until 1902 when they were established at [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]] and [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio|Oxford]], followed by [[The Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] in 1907.&lt;ref name="Memories"/&gt;  All three schools were located in the southern half of the state while the majority of the growth, population, and need for teachers were in northern Ohio.  The Lowry bill was the first successful action to establish teacher training schools in northern Ohio after several failed attempts.&lt;ref name="Memories"/&gt;

'''Nam Le''' (born 1978)&lt;ref name = "MW"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/when-the-boat-comes-in/2008/05/29/1211654216643.html?page=fullpage |author=Williams, Michael |title=When the boat comes in |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=29 May 2008 |publisher=Fairfax |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Vietnamese Australian|Vietnamese]]-born Australian  writer, who won the [[Dylan Thomas Prize]] for his book ''The Boat'', a collection of short stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/11/11/2416097.htm |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 November 2008 |title=Aussie author claims $140k Dylan prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stories have been published in many places including ''Best Australian Stories 2007'', ''Best New American Voices'', ''Zoetrope: All-Story'', ''A Public Space'' and ''One Story''. In 2008 he was named a 3 under 35 honoree by the [[National Book Foundation]].

==Life and early career==

Nam Le came to Australia from Vietnam with his parents, when he was less than a year old, as a [[Boat people|boat refugee]].&lt;ref name = "GM"&gt;Metherell, Gia (2008) "Vietnamese refugee wins top English literary award", ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPON"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianpacificpost.com/portal2/c1ee8c441be17957011be68f898300b5_Spotlight_On__Nam_Le.do.html |title=Spotlight On: Nam Le |work=Asian Pacific Post |date=21 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121134613/http://www.asianpacificpost.com/portal2/c1ee8c441be17957011be68f898300b5_Spotlight_On__Nam_Le.do.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and the [[University of Melbourne]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (Hons) and [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] (Hons). His Arts thesis supervisor was the Australian poet [[Chris Wallace-Crabbe]].&lt;ref name = "MW"/&gt; He worked as a corporate lawyer and was admitted to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2003/2004.&lt;ref name = "MW"/&gt;

Le decided to turn to writing, and in 2004 attended the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] in the United States where he completed a Masters in Creative Writing. He became fiction editor at the ''[[Harvard Review]]''.&lt;ref name = "GM"/&gt; His first short story was published in ''Zoetrope'' in 2006. Nam Le also held fellowships at the [[Fine Arts Work Center]] in [[Provincetown]] in 2006, and at the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], in 2007.&lt;ref name = "MW"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "GM"/&gt;

In an interview on Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio, he said he turned from law to writing due to his love of reading: "I loved reading, and if you asked me why I decided to become a writer, that's the answer right there, because I was a reader and I was just so enthralled and thrilled by the stuff that I'd read that I just thought; what could be better? How could you possibly better spend your time than trying to recreate that feeling for other people".&lt;ref name = "RN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2273652.htm |title=Nam Le: The Boat (Interview) |work=The Book Show |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] |date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview he said that his first writing was poetry.

He returned to Australia in 2008, but is moving to Great Britain to take up a writing fellowship at the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref name = "GM"/&gt;

When asked about his source of inspiration, Nam Le said in 2008 that "I’d say I’m most inspired by my parents for the choices and sacrifices they’ve made. It still boggles me".&lt;ref name = "SPON"/&gt;

==Style==
Regarding his style, Nam Le said in an interview that "one of the demarcations is writers that deal primarily with language, the more lyrical minded writers, and writers that are more structurally oriented. I always used to...I started out writing poetry and reading poetry, and so I always knew that that was the side that I was most predisposed to, and so I actually had to be quite careful in these stories to not overdo that impulse, to not throw too many images or indulge too many lyrical flights of fancy."&lt;ref name = "RN"/&gt;

==''The Boat''==
{{main|The Boat (short stories collection)}}

The book, first published in 2008, comprises seven short stories which take the reader to such places as Colombia, New York City, Iowa, Tehran, Hiroshima, and small-town Australia. In the opening story,  ''Love and Honor and Pity and Pride and Compassion and Sacrifice'', he writes about a Vietnamese-born character called Nam Le who is attending a writing workshop in Iowa. In a conversation with Michael Williams he said about the practice of using a narrator close to "self" in a story:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of people presume if I'm writing a narrator who has clear parallels to me, that's just sheer inertia; that there's a natural adaptation from so-called life to so-called text. But any careful reader or writer would understand how much artifice and contrivance go into making this self-standing and self-contained. Actually it's tougher: if I stick in something that has more resonance for me than is communicated on the page, then that's a failure of my charge as a writer . . . I'm not creating a good enough space for the reader to come in and fully partake in that scene or that language or that line."&lt;ref name = "MW"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each story provides "a snapshot of a pivotal point in the characters' lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Irving, Alexandra |year=2008 |title=Word of Mouth: The Boat (Review) |journal=goodreading |issue=August 2008 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nam Le has said of his Vietnamese heritage and writing that:&lt;blockquote&gt;My relationship with Vietnam is complex. For a long time I vowed I wouldn’t fall into writing ethnic stories, immigrant stories, etc. Then I realized that not only was I working against these expectations (market, self, literary, cultural), I was working against my kneejerk resistance to such expectations. How I see it now is no matter what or where I write about, I feel a responsibility to the subject matter. Not so much to get it right as to do it justice. Having personal history with a subject only complicates this — but not always, nor necessarily, in bad ways. I don’t completely understand my relationship to Vietnam as a writer. This book is a testament to the fact that I’m becoming more and more okay with that.&lt;ref name = "SPON"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Australian short story writer [[Cate Kennedy]], interviewing Nam Le, said that ''The Boat'' has put the short story back in "the literary centre stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/1109 |title=Nam Le in conversation with Cate Kennedy about ''The Boat'' |publisher=The Monthly |work=SlowTV |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Observatory for Protection of Cultural Heritage in Areas of Crisis''' ('''OPCHAC''') is an [[Italy|Italian]]-based organization concerned with protecting [[cultural heritage]].

==History==
The “Observatory for Protection of Cultural Heritage in Areas of Crisis” was created in 1995 by Prof. [[Fabio Maniscalco]]. 
All activities of the OPCHAC are devoted to the safeguarding of cultural property of countries in crisis, independent of religion, race, or political ideology. 
OPCHAC does not receive public funds, so it is free to work and to denounce injustices, discriminations and/or violations to international rights. 
The address of OPCHAC is at the [[University L'Orientale]] (Scuola di Studi Islamici).
Other offices are at Institute of Archaeology of [[Al-Quds University of Jerusalem]] and at the Institute of Archaeology of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].

==Aims==

The main aims of the OPCHAC are:

* To strengthen the local Authorities, as well as the various Ministries, competent social services or the Italian Armed Forces, outside of the Country, monitoring the objects of cultural heritage of the Nations in crisis.
* To monitor, on the field, the situation of the movable and immovable cultural property in war areas.
* To create a Database dealing with the situation of the cultural heritage in the examined Countries.
* To publish journals, periodicals and/or monographic collections concerning the safeguard, the conservation and the exploitation of international cultural and environmental property.
* To make the press and the public opinion more sensitive in regard to the problems of the safeguard of the cultural heritage in war countries, promoting appeals, conferences, meetings and other forums.
* To cooperate with Organizations, governmental and non-governmental,  Universities and various private or public Associations at their request.
* To organize Courses on International Human Rights and on the protection of cultural heritage in critical areas. 
* To conceive and to manage projects and/or activities finalized to the safeguard, the conservation and de exploitation of cultural and environmental property in war areas and/or in areas of crisis.

==Database==

'''QUANTA''' is an international competition for [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[computer science]]. The competition was organized in 1994 as a national event in [[India]]. The initial success and popularity of the competition induced QUANTA to be organized as an international competition beginning in 1995. QUANTA is the only international competition for science for school children in India. It is organised by CMS [[Lucknow]]. Certificates of participation are awarded to each participant. Winners receive separate certificates and trophies. All of these certificates have international accreditation. The first, second and third positions in each event contribute five, three and two points respectively, to the total tally. The championship trophy is awarded to the team with the maximum points. The second and third-place teams are awarded the two runners-up trophies. Special prizes are also awarded for "best team turnout", "most creative participant" and "the loony fringe".

The events and rules are as follows:

'''RUR - Python Learning Environment''' ('''RUR-PLE''') is an educational tool to help students learn the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language. Made by André Roberge. RUR-PLE uses the idea behind [[Karel the robot|Karel the Robot]], making the learning of Python programming more interesting. A student writes a program that controls a 'robot' that moves through a city consisting of a rectangular grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down). 

It is very similar to [[Guido van Robot]] (GvR), but RUR-PLE can use all  Python features (while GvR only limited subset of syntax).
RUR-PLE has 48 lessons (in main European languages and Chinese) with the code and robot environment examples to experiment with.

A second implementation of RUR-PLE, Rurple NG is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Rede São Paulo Saudável''' (''Healthy São Paulo Network'', in [[Portuguese language]]) is a [[satellite]]-based [[digital TV]] [[corporate video|corporate channel]], developed by the Municipal Health Secretary of [[São Paulo]], with the goal of bringing programs focused on [[health promotion]] and [[health education]], which may be watched by the entire population seeking [[health care]] in its units in the city. The network consists of two complete [[TV studio]]s, and a system for transmission of closed [[digital video]] in [[high-definition television|high definition]] via [[satellite]], with about 1,400 points of reception in all health care units of the municipality of São Paulo, including its more than 700 public health care centers and posts, medical [[clinic]]s, and 17 [[hospital]]s.

==Channel line-up==

The TV network has currently three active channels.

The first channel (the ''Citizenship Channel'') is devoted to the [[broadcast]]ing of [[health education]] directly to the population in the waiting rooms of the units. Currently more than 400 short- and medium-length TV programs with this content are part of its grid.

The second channel (the ''Professional Education Channel'') has the aim of providing [[continuing education]] and [[training]] programs to Health Secretary professionals, such as [[physician]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[social worker]]s, etc., through [[distance education]]. The reception points for this channel are located in meeting rooms or [[classrooms]] inside the basic health units and hospitals.

The third channel (the "Administrative Channel") is interactive, and serves for [[meeting]]s and for corporate communication with [[Management|managers]] in general, as well as for the transmission of courses in real time. The interaction is accomplished by a [[online chat|chat]] interface, through the Internet connection of each unit, since the TV channel is unidirectional (broadcasting).

Each reception room for channels 1 and 2 has a 39" [[LCD TV]] and a digital satellite [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] conencted to an externally placed [[satellite dish]]. Channel 3 is received directly in a PC [[microcomputer]] in the administrative offices.

==Distance Education==

Several distance education courses for doctors, nurses and other health professionals are already in the air, and are freely available for the 54,000 employees of the Secretary. The courses consist or prerecorded or real time video transmissions according to a program grid, and of a public [[WWW]] site for off-class support using a [[Learning Management System]] (LMS).

The [[Centro de Formação e Desenvolvimento dos Trabalhadores da Saúde de São Paulo]] (CEFOR-SP) (''Center for Buildup and Development of Healthcare Workers'' (CEFOR-SP) and the centers for research and education of several hospitals of the public health network of São Paulo, such as the [[Hospital do Servidor Publico Municipal de São Paulo]] (''Hospital of the Public Servant of São Paulo'') are among the institutions which create and provide certification of educational content. The Healthy São Paulo Network is managed by the Technical Department of Information Technology and the Educational Technology Group of CEFOR-SP.

==Technology==

The Healthy São Paulo Network uses [[IP TV]] through [[multicasting]] via [[satellite]], using the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] standard. The default compression used is [[H.264]] [[MPEG 4]], with a total [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of 20 Mbit/s for the 3 channels. The São Paulo company [[SpeedCast]] is responsible for the operation of the system and for providing the [[satellite space segment]], with its [[satellite hub]] located in the city of [[Barueri]]. A virtual platform to support [[teaching]] and [[learning]] uses the  [[Moodle]] [[learning management system]] (LMS), hosted in a [[virtual dedicated server]] operated by the state company [[PRODAM]] and developed by the [[Edumed Institute for Education in Medicine and Health]].

===Television studios===

The network has two complete [[TV studio]]s, a smaller one located at the central administrative center of the Secretary of Health, in downtown São Paulo, and another, with a full [[auditorium]] with 90 seats, located at CEFOR-SP, in the neighbourhood of Moema. The studios are equipped with [[robotic camera]]s, [[document camera]]s, [[smartboard]]s, computers for presentation of slides, [[teleprompter]]s, and control desks with [[video switcher]]s, [[audio mixer]] and [[DVD]] recording capabilities

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Strozzi-Heckler spent his early life in a [[military]] family periodically moving to different [[naval base]]s.  In early adolescence, he began studying [[martial arts]],&lt;ref name="speak"/&gt; beginning with [[judo]], then [[karate]] and [[jiujitsu]].&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;  He excelled in athletics while in high school and was awarded a scholarship to [[San Diego State College]] in [[San Diego, California]] where he was named [[All-America#Collegiate sports|All-American]] in [[track and field]].&lt;ref name="aikiamer"/&gt;

After a [[Marine Corps]] tour of duty in the mid 1960s, Strozzi-Heckler traveled throughout Asia studying [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt; He returned to the United States, eventually earning a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from [[Saybrook University]] with an emphasis on [[mind-body connection]].&lt;ref name="aikiamer"&gt;Stone, J., Meyer R. ''Aikido in America'', Frog Books (1995) {{ISBN|978-1-883319-27-4}} p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, H. ''The Art and Practice of Leadership Coaching'',  Wiley and Sons (2004) {{ISBN|978-0-471-70546-8}} p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Strozzi-Heckler holds the rank of seventh degree [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] (shichidan) in [[aikido]].&lt;ref name="bbelt"&gt;Warneka, T. ''Leading People the Black Belt Way: Conquering the Five Core Problems Facing Leaders Today'', Asogomi Publishing International (2006)  {{ISBN|978-0-9768627-2-7}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Strozzi-Heckler co-founded the Lomi School in 1970 with Robert K. Hall, Alyssa Hall, and Catherine Flaxman, integrating aikido&lt;ref name="aikiamer"/&gt; and [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] principles into a [[body oriented psychotherapy]] called Lomi Work.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, B. “Lomi Therapy” ''[[Yoga Journal]]'', November–December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Strozzi-Heckler, together with [[George Leonard]] and Wendy Palmer, established the Aikido of Tamalpais [[dojo]] in [[Mill Valley, California]].&lt;ref name="aikiamer" /&gt; In 1985, he was invited to contribute to a  [[US Army Special Forces]] project designed to test the effectiveness of integrating various practices into its training program.  During the six-month program, he taught aikido and meditation techniques.&lt;ref name="dance" /&gt;

In 1986, he moved to rural [[Sonoma County, California]] outside of [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]],&lt;ref name="aikiamer" /&gt; and developed a methodology, Strozzi Somatics, aimed at reproducing the outcomes of the [[US Army]] project with individuals and civilian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strozziinstitute.com/resources/articles/Somatics,+Neuroscience,+and+Leadership&lt;/ref&gt; Strozzi Somatics has been employed in various forms to groups around the world.&lt;ref name="dance" /&gt;

Strozzi-Heckler helped design and implement the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]].&lt;ref name="dance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, G. [http://www.aikicommunications.net/heckler.html A Few Good Men Try the Marine Martial Art, and Take on 2 Gurus] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', October 9, 2000    Retrieved 11/26/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embodied leadership==
Pointing out the relationship of thoughts and mood to an individual's body (e.g., posture, facial expression, tone of voice),&lt;ref name= "triangle" &gt;McLeod, L.E. ''The Triangle of Truth: The Surprisingly Simple Secret to Resolving Conflicts Large and Small'', Penguin (2010) {{ISBN|978-0-399-53567-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strozzi-Heckler has said that congruency between these elements and a person’s words is a primary characteristic of effective leaders.&lt;ref name="bbelt" /&gt; He asserts that this characteristic can be practiced and improved as reliably as practicing and improving one's skill in a martial art or with a musical instrument.&lt;ref name="aikiamer" /&gt;

The Strozzi Somatics methodology involves eliciting an individual or organization’s defining values and introducing practices that combine conceptual understanding with physical activity in a way that is intended to produce an increase in behavioral traits that are in accordance with those values.&lt;ref name=dance /&gt; Many of these practices are based on aikido movements or principles.&lt;ref name="dance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aikiamer" /&gt;

In addition to corporate and military leadership, Strozzi Somatics have been applied to [[law enforcement]], [[corrections]], professional and Olympic athletics,&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;Helgesen, S. “The Dance of Power” ''Strategy+Business'', Winter 2007/Issue 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]], politics, [[social justice]], and health.&lt;ref name="speak" /&gt;

The '''Secondary Board High School''' is an Indian public high school in [[Cuttack]], [[Odisha]]. It is situated at the Bajrakabati Road of Cuttack on the same campus as the [[Board of Secondary Education, Odisha]] (BSE).

Established in 1959 by the BSE, the school was created as a model high school for imparting education in the Odisha state board system. The school has classes only from Std VI to X.

On 3 August 2009, this school celebrated its [[golden jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Singha, Minati | date = 19 July 2009 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-19/bhubaneswar/28183950_1_golden-jubilee-alma-mater-model-school|title=Old Boys Pay Back Debt' to Alma Mater |work = [[The Times of India]] |access-date= 12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1952–53, the [[Mudaliar Commission]]'s report on ''Reform in the System of Secondary Education in India''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47855890/Mudaliar-Commission|title=The Mudaliar Commission Report|publisher=Scribd|access-date= 1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested a vast set of reforms for the education system.  At that time, the educationists-cum-policy makers for Odisha, e.g., Professor B. C. Das, DPI; Shree H. Mishra, DDPI; Dr. S. Sahu, and senior officials of the BSE conceived an idea to establish three model schools at Cuttack, [[Sambalpur]] and [[Berhampur]], respectively.

Under this initiative, construction of a school, named Secondary Board High School, began at Cuttack in 1958. The school opened on 3 August 1959 with 148 students (including 31 girls), under the guidance of Shree Chakradhar Mohanty, deputed by the BSE as special officer, and nine teachers.

It was initially planned to have only three classes, i.e., VI, VII and VIII, and accordingly, admission process began on 9 June 1959 starting with Class-VI. On demand by local guardians, classes IX and X were introduced later. The first batch passed the [[HSC Examination]] in 1962 with three years of study in the school, the fully trained first batch passed out in 1965 with all six years of study in the school.

Gradually the strength of students grew up to 1,100 by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sebhosa.org/index.php|title=The Old Boys Association Home page|publisher=The Old Boys Association SBHS|access-date= 1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus and buildings==
[[File:Secondary Board High School main entrance.JPG|thumb|Main entrance of the school]]
The school shares the same campus as the BCE and the two buildings stand facing each other. Although the campus has a gate at the entrance on Bajrakabati Road, there is no clear demarcation or boundary walls for the entire campus.

==House system==
The school has classes from VI to X with three sections in classes VI and VII and four sections in classes VIII, IX, X. Each of the sections or houses is named after one of the [[states of India]]. On 3 August each year, when the school celebrates its annual day, each of the houses makes a display of the rich culture of the it associated state. This display is evaluated each year and the best house is selected.

'''StudentMentor.org''' is a national college student mentoring program. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase college completion and student career readiness by utilizing its technology platform to connect college students with professionals. According to a U.S. Department of Education&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/datalab/quickstats/default.aspx U.S. Department of Education Study&lt;/ref&gt; study, students who met with advisors regularly during their freshmen year had 170% greater chance of completing their bachelor's degree than those that did not. CNN mentions, "StudentMentor is the first national online [[mentoring]] matchmaking service designed to pair up college students who have questions with experienced businesspeople who have answers."  &lt;ref name="Annie"&gt;{{cite news|title=A new way to shape the people you'll be hiring in 2014 (or sooner)|author=Anne Fisher|url=http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2010/11/22/a-new-way-to-help-shape-the-people-youll-be-hiring-in-2014-or-sooner/|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=22 November 2010|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to USA Today, "Prospective mentors and mentees can join for free on StudentMentor’s web site and are matched according to their areas of common interest."&lt;ref name="Annie" /&gt; Then, mentorships take place either in-person or virtually ([[e-mentoring]]). Mentees go on their way towards achieving their goals while mentors receive personal satisfaction and professional growth. StudentMentor.org checks with the pair throughout to see how the mentorship is progressing in addition to performing rigorous statistical analysis.

StudentMentor.org was founded in 2010 by Ashkon Jafari and Stephanie Bravo. According to a USA Today interview with Jafari, "The mentoring organization was launched because while students in grades K-12 have plenty of programs to find mentors, college students often don't have anyone to guide them. We know there is a huge need out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/jobcenter/workplace/bruzzese/2010-12-08-college-students-need-mentors-too_N.htm?csp=34|title=Mentoring benefits aspiring professionals|author=Anita Bruzzese|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=8 December 2010|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States Committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites''' (US/ICOMOS) is one of numerous national subsidiary committees of [[ICOMOS]], forming a worldwide alliance for the study and conservation of historic buildings, districts, and sites. It is the focus of international cultural resources exchange in the United States, working to share preservation information and expertise worldwide. It also highlights and interprets the unique American preservation system: the partnership between private organizations and federal, state, and local governments, and the cooperation between the academic community, professionals and civic volunteers.

US/ICOMOS is one of the largest national committees of ICOMOS, comprising over 1,000 members in the United States and abroad. As the only professional preservation organization with a global focus in the United States, US/ICOMOS serves as the principle gateway for the participation of preservation professionals in worldwide heritage conservation. The organization guides and promotes activities through an extensive membership network of preservation professionals, institutions, and organizations, including specialized scientific committees.  US/ICOMOS also organizes an annual international scientific symposium, an [[US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program|International Intern Exchange Program]], and occasional special training courses and workshops.

The '''University of Kinshasa''' ({{lang-fr|Université de Kinshasa}}), commonly known as '''UNIKIN''', is one of the three major universities in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], together with the [[University of Kisangani]] and [[University of Lubumbashi]]. Originally founded in 1954 as [[Lovanium University]] during [[Belgian Congo|Belgian colonial rule]], the current university was established following the division of the [[National University of Zaire]] (UNAZA) in 1981. It is located in [[Kinshasa]].

The university had an enrollment of 26,186 and a faculty and research staff of 1,530 in the 2006-07 academic year,&lt;ref name ="Sarua" /&gt; and currently has ten academic divisions.&lt;ref name="faculties"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unikin.cd/index.php?page=facultes | title =Facultés | accessdate =December 15, 2010 | publisher =University of Kinshasa |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The university is located about {{convert|15|km}} south of central Kinshasa, in the suburb of [[Lemba, Kinshasa|Lemba]].

Many of the campus facilities have deteriorated and are in poor condition, or lack proper instructional tools - in 2003, the science library had as few as 300 titles in its collection. Since 2001, the university has hosted Cisco Academy, a joint project sponsored by the American software company [[Cisco]] and the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. The academy focuses on providing recent technology, training students to install and operate computer networks and all coursework is online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Light in the Harvard of darkness | newspaper =Economist | pages =41 | date =July 5, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Lovanium University===
The university was established in 1954 as [[Lovanium University]] by Belgian colonial authorities following criticism that they had done too little to educate the Congolese people. The university was originally affiliated with the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium. When it opened, the university received heavy subsidies from the colonial government&lt;ref name="WorldBank"&gt;
{{Cite book | last =World Bank | title =Education In the Democratic Republic of Congo | publisher =World Bank Publications | year =2005 | location =Washington, D.C. | pages =102–122 | isbn =9780821361214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and was lauded as the best university in Africa.&lt;ref name="HungerCompetes"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Greenhouse | first = Steven | title = Kinshasa Journal; Hunger Competes With a Thirst for Knowledge | pages = Section A; Page 4, Column 3; Foreign Desk | newspaper = The New York Times | location = New York | date = June 2, 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National University of Zaire===
[[File:Université de Kinshasa.JPG|Rectorat|thumb|The ''Rectorat'', main administrative building at the University of Kinshasa]]
In August 1971, the university was merged with the ''Protestant Autonomous University of Congo'' (''Université Libre du Congo'') and ''The University of Congo at Lubumbashi'' (founded in 1956) into the [[University of Zaire|''National University of Zaire'']] (Université Nationale du Zaïre, UNAZA). Ties were cut with the Catholic University of Leuven, and funding for the university began to drop precipitously. At this point, the university had an enrollment capacity of just 5,000.&lt;ref name="WorldBank" /&gt;

The decision to merge the private universities into one centralized system was made, at least partially, to counter concerns about political demonstrations on campuses. The entire higher education system was run by a single rector and faculty and staff were put on the federal payroll.&lt;ref name="WorldBank" /&gt;

By 1981, the centralized system became too burdensome and the decision was made to re-establish the three separate institutions: the University of Kinshasa, [[Kisangani University]], and the [[University of Lubumbashi]].

===Decline in funding===

Newly independent, the University of Kinshasa continued to struggle financially throughout the 1980s. By 1985, the campus was in decline, strewn with trash and the dormitories in poor condition. The university's cafeteria stopped serving meals and pay for professors slipped as low as $15.&lt;ref name="HungerCompetes" /&gt;

In response to declining government funds tuition was raised 500 percent in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Greenhouse | first = Steven | title = 18 Months of Harsh Austerity Bring Indications of a Turnaround to Zaire; High Price Exacted By Lauded Reforms | pages =First Section; A23 | newspaper = The Washington Post | location = Washington, D.C. | date = May 22, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1989, deeper cuts were made, with the suspension of nearly all scholarships and financial aid and institution of new fees. Through the 1980s, as much as 90 percent of the university's budget was paid for by the government, with only a small amount of revenues coming from student tuition. By 2002, the government only contributed $8,000 (USD) of the university's estimated $4.3 million annual budget (not including some personnel costs which are paid directly by the state).&lt;ref name="WorldBank" /&gt;

== Nuclear Reactor ==
{{Main|Regional Center for Nuclear Studies}}
The first nuclear reactor in Africa was built at the University of Kinshasa in 1958. The reactor, known as TRICO I, is a [[TRIGA]] reactor built by [[General Atomics]]. TRICO stands for a combination of TRIGA or “Training Isotopes General Atomic” and Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-2002 SCK•CEN|isbn=9076971056|url=http://www.sckcen.be/en/content/download/1259/27403/file/BrochureSCK50_UK.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor was built while the country was still under Belgian control, and with the assistance of the United States government, under the [[Atoms For Peace]] program. TRIGA I was estimated to have a 50-kilowatt capacity and was shut down in 1970. In 1967, the African Union established a nuclear research center, the [[Regional Center for Nuclear Studies]] and the United States agreed to provide another TRIGA reactor. The second reactor, TRICO II, is believed to have a one-megawatt capacity and was brought online in 1972.&lt;ref name ="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/congo/index.html | title =Congo Special Weapons | accessdate =December 15, 2010 | publisher =globalsecurity.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the TRICO II reactor was reported to be operational,&lt;ref name="globalsecurity" /&gt; but was apparently put on standby in 1998.&lt;ref name ="missingkeys"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/23/congo.chrismcgreal | title =Missing keys, holes in fence and a single padlock: welcome to Congo's nuclear plant | accessdate =December 15, 2010 | publisher =The Guardian | location=London | first=Chris | last=McGreal | date=November 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo stopped funding the program in the late 1980s, and the United States has since refused to ship replacement parts.

International observers have long been concerned about the safety and security of the two nuclear reactors and the enriched uranium they contain.

== Faculties and divisions ==

'''Volunteer Eco Students Abroad''' (VESAbroad) is a non governamental organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Volunteer Eco Students Abroad|title=Donations Page|url=http://www.vesabroad.com/make_a_donation.htm|publisher=VESAbroad.com|accessdate=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  founded in 2009 which has been established to give participants from around the globe the opportunity to visit a number of countries and to participate in a program consisting of some [[volunteer work]] and [[adventure tourism]]. The primary programs are generally of two weeks duration with opportunities to extend the trip with supplementary adventure tours.

==Programs==
Split into two week-long sections, the program sees participants volunteering in areas of need such the areas of [[education]], [[construction]] and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] in a range of multi-faceted projects.
