The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the New York-based private non-profit organization [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that is dedicated to [[Historic preservation|preserving]] the [[cultural heritage|historic, artistic, and architectural heritage]] around the world.&lt;ref name=2006_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = World Monuments Fund Announces 2006 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites | publisher = World Monuments Fund | author = Holly Evarts | date = 21 June 2005 | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate = 16 May 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. It is a call to action on behalf of threatened cultural heritage monuments worldwide. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = World Monuments Fund Announces 2008 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites | author = Holly Evarts | date = 6 June 2007 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090521092007/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf |archivedate = 21 May 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=2006_press_release /&gt; A site’s inclusion on the Watch List attracts international attention, helping to raise funds needed for its rescue and spurring local governments and communities to take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark.

==2004 Watch List==
The 2004 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on 24 September 2003 by WMF President [[Bonnie Burnham]] and WMF partner [[American Express]].&lt;ref name=2004_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = 2004 List of 100 Most Endangered Sites Announced | publisher = World Monuments Fund | date = 24 September 2003 | url = http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/wmf04/index.html |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, a site from [[Antarctica]] was included, ensuring that the Watch List geographically covers every continent.&lt;ref name=2004_press_release /&gt;
{{cquote|By working to preserve these treasures, WMF and its partners are helping to save for future generations the structures and places that tell us who we are. Be it a palace, a cave painting, an archaeological site, or a town, the sites on the Watch list speak of human aspirations and achievements. To lose any one of them would diminish us all.|200px||Bonnie Burnham, WMF president|launch of 2004 Watch List&lt;ref name="WMF 2004 Watch List press release"/&gt;}}

'''Abdallah Guennoun''' (Born 16 September 1908 in [[Fes]] - died 9 July 1989 in [[Tangier]]) was a famous, and influential Moroccan essayist.&lt;ref&gt;Literatura Marroqui [http://www.literaturamarroqui.edu.es/autores/GHENNUN,%20Abdallah%20(1908-1989).pdf] (retrieved Feb. 13, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 and 1928, he wrote a three-volume book titled ''An Nubûgh Al Maghribi'' ("The genius of Maghreb"), where he assesses the excellence of Moroccan literature and philosophy.

Guennoun taught at the universities of [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Amman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5006">'''Alfred Rupert Hall''' (or '''Rupert Hall''') (26 July 1920 – 5 February 2009) was a prominent British [[historian of science]], known as editor of a collection of [[Isaac Newton]]'s unpublished scientific papers (1962), and Newton's correspondence, in 1977.&lt;ref name="guardian-obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=David Knight | title = Obituary: Rupert Hall | work = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/27/rupert-hall-obituary | date = 27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He went to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1938 to study history, but his studies were interrupted by war service. He completed his degree in 1946 and began postgraduate research. As a boy he had delighted in the history of inventions and devices, and the army had given him hands-on experience; his doctoral thesis which was on 17th-century ballistics was published as a book in 1952. In 1949 he was elected a fellow of Christ's College.

Hall was unusual in coming to the discipline from history, not science, and his background would yield fresh and different perspectives in this new emerging field. [[Charles Singer]], the first president of the [[British Society for the History of Science]], was not alone in having suspicions about someone without a scientific education teaching the history of science. Hall won him round, and they were to co-operate in editing the five-volume ''History of Technology'' published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1954-58.

In 1948 Hall was appointed as the first curator of the [[Whipple Museum of the History of Science]], in Cambridge, and in 1950 began lecturing in the subject. Soon, the discipline was formally accepted into the tripos structure of degrees, and the department of history and philosophy of science was established, now the largest university department of its kind in the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian-obit" /&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Marie Boas]] had come from the US to work on [[Robert Boyle]]'s papers, and met Hall, who was working on Isaac Newton's. In 1959 Hall, whose first marriage had ended in divorce, joined her in the US and they were married. In 1963 they were invited back to [[Imperial College]] in [[London]], where Hall became the first professor of the history of science.

Between 1962 and 1986 the Halls edited, translated and published in 13 volumes the correspondence of [[Henry Oldenburg]], the secretary of the [[Royal Society]] in its early days, and founding editor of its journal, [[Philosophical Transactions]], which grew out of his extensive international letter-writing. They also edited a valuable collection of Newton's unpublished scientific papers (1962). In 1980 he published ''Philosophers at War'', an account of Newton's disreputable quarrel with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].

Rupert directed the [[Wellcome Trust]] programme on the history of medicine for 4 years, a programme which funds courses in various universities and gives bursaries to individuals.

As David Knight ends the obituary to Rupert Hall published in ''The Guardian'' in 2009:

"Rupert and Marie were inseparable and devoted; she died 18 days after him. They not only filled gaps in our knowledge of 17th-century science, but were exemplary in being genial, encouraging and helpful to younger scholars."&lt;ref name="guardian-obit"/&gt;

The '''Andean civilizations''' were a patchwork of different [[Indigenous peoples of South America|cultures and peoples]] that developed from the [[Andes]] of [[Colombia]] southward down the Andes to northern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]], plus the coastal deserts of [[Peru]] and northern Chile.  Archaeologists believe that Andean [[civilization]]s first developed on the narrow coastal plain of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Norte Chico civilization]] of Peru is the oldest known dating back to 3200 BCE.&lt;ref name=Caral&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shady Solis | first = Ruth |author2=Jonathan Haas |author3=Winifred Creamer  | date = 27 April 2001 | title = Dating Caral, a Preceramic Site in the Supe Valley on the Central Coast of Peru | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5517 | pages = 723–726 | doi = 10.1126/science.1059519 | pmid = 11326098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite severe environmental challenges, the Andean civilizations domesticated a wide variety of crops, some of which became of worldwide importance.  The Andean civilizations were also noteworthy for monumental architecture, textile weaving, and many unique characteristics of the societies they created.

Less than a century prior to the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquerors, the [[Incas]] united most of the Andean cultures into the [[Inca Empire]] which encompasses all of what is usually called Andean civilization. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] of Colombia and the [[Timoto-Cuica people|Timoto Cuica]] of Venezuela remained outside the Inca orbit. The Inca Empire was a patchwork of languages, cultures and peoples.

Spanish rule ended or transformed many elements of the Andean civilizations, notably influencing religion and architecture.

==Uniqueness==
[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A quipu]]
Andean civilization was one of five civilizations in the world deemed by scholars to be "pristine", that is indigenous and not derived from other civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand &amp; Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite  6 or 7 pristine civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its isolation from other civilizations, the [[Indigenous people of South America|Indigenous people of the Andes]] had to come up with their own, often unique solutions to environmental and societal challenges.{{sfn|McEwan|2006|p=5}}

Andean civilization lacked several characteristics distinguishing it from the pristine civilizations in the [[Old World]] and from the Mesoamerican cultures. First, and perhaps most important, Andean civilizations did not have a written language.  Instead, their societies used the [[quipu]], a system of knotted and colored strings, to convey information.  Few quipus survive and they have never been fully deciphered.  Scholars differ on whether the knotted cords of the quipu were able only to record numerical data or could also be used for narrative communication, a true system of writing.&lt;ref name="McEwan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McEwan|first1=Gordon F.|title=The Incas: New Perspectives|date=2006|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-33301-5|pages=183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the quipu dates back at least to the [[Wari Empire]] (600-1000 CE) and possibly to the much earlier [[Norte Chico civilization]] of the third millennium BCE.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Quipu--South America's Ancient Undeciphered Writing System|URL=https://www.thoughtco.com/introduction-to-quipu-inca-writing-system-172285|website=ThoughtCo|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andean civilizations also lacked wheeled vehicles and draft animals.  People on land traveled only by foot and the transport of goods was only by humans or [[llama]], pack animals which could carry loads of up to one-fourth of their weight, a maximum of {{convert|45|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Llamas as Pack  Animals|url=http://www.llamapack.com/text/packanimals.html|website=Buckhorn Llama Co.|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llamas were not big or strong enough to be used for [[Plough|plowing]] or as [[riding animal|riding]] animals for adults.{{sfn|McEwan|2006|p=5}}

Moreover, Andean civilizations faced severe environmental challenges.  The earliest civilizations were on the hyper-arid desert coast of Peru.  Agriculture was possible only with irrigation in valleys crossed by rivers coming from the high Andes, plus in a few fog oases called [[lomas]]. In the Andes, agriculture was limited by thin soils, cold climate, low or seasonal precipitation, and a scarcity of flat land. Freezing temperatures may occur in every month of the year at altitudes of more than {{convert|3000|m|ft}}, the homeland of many of the highland Andean civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Guillet, David and others (1987), "Terracing and Irrigation in the Peruvian Highlands," ''Current Anthropology'', Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 409-410. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Andean civilizations lacked money. Copper [[axe-monies]] (also called "naipes")&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.E. (1993). "Axe-Monies and Their Relatives" by Dorothy Hosler; Heather Lechtman; Olaf Holm. (Review). ''Ethnohistory'', 40(1), p. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spondylus]] shells&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Benjamin. "Spondylus in South American Prehistory" in ''Spondylus in Prehistory: New Data and Approaches.'' Ed. Fotis Ifantidis and Marianna Nikolaidou. BAR International Series 2216. Oxford: Archaeopress, 2011: 63-89.&lt;/ref&gt; functioned as mediums of exchange in some areas, especially coastal [[Ecuador]], but most of the Andes area had economies organized on reciprocity and redistribution rather than money and markets. These characteristics were especially notable during the Inca Empire but originated in much earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian M. (1996), ''The Oxford Guide to Archaeology'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
[[File:Pisac006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Agricultural terraces ([[Andén|andenes]], were widely built and used for agriculture in the Andes.]] 
Agriculture in South America may have begun in coastal Ecuador with the domestication of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] about 8000 BCE by the [[Las Vegas culture]].&lt;ref&gt;"Domestication History of the Squash Plant", https://www.thoughtco.com/domestication-history-of-the-squash-plant-172698, accessed 19 Jun 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that the earliest civilizations on the Peruvian coast initially relied more upon maritime resources than agriculture during the formative period of their societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=85 | title= The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis | last=Moseley | first=Michael | publisher= The Hall of Ma'at |format= |work= | accessdate= 2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Michael | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization |year=1975 |publisher=Cummings |location=Menlo Park |isbn=0-8465-4800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as in all civilizations until the late 19th century, agriculture was the principal occupation of the great majority of the people.  The greatest contribution of Andean civilization to the modern world has been the plants its people domesticated.  Crops grown by the Andeans were often unique to the region. [[Maize]], which found its way to the Andes from [[Mexico]], was often the most important crop at lower and intermediate elevations.  The Andeans cultivated an estimated 70 different plants, almost as many as were cultivated in all of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, William K., "Rediscovering the Lost Crops of the Inca,"   ''The New York Times'', October 31, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these plants are no longer cultivated, or are minor crops, but important plants which were domesticated in or near the Andes include  [[potato]]es, [[quinoa]], [[tomato]]es, [[chile peppers]], [[cotton]], [[coca]], [[tobacco]], [[pineapple]]s, [[peanut]]s, and several varieties of [[bean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Piperno, Dolores r. (2011), "The Origins of Plant Cultivation and Domestication in the New World Tropics: Patterns, Process, and new Developments," ''Current Anthropology'', Vol. 52, No. 54, pp. S457-S459 Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt; Animals domesticated in the Andes were llamas and [[guinea pigs]].

The challenges of the environment required sophisticated agricultural technology.&lt;ref name="D'Altroy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Altroy|first1=Terence N.|title=The Incas|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-17677-0|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Middle East]], the Andes lacked easily domesticated and large-seeded plants such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]] and large and easily domesticated animals such as [[horses]] and [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared (1999), ''Guns. Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.,  pp. 83-113&lt;/ref&gt;  Agriculture on the desert coast required the development of irrigation. In the mountains, the climate and steep terrain required a range of technological solutions such as terraces ([[Andenes]]), exploitation of microclimates, and [[selective breeding]]. Due to the climatic uncertainties, farmers traditionally farmed several crops at several elevations and exposures.  At a macro level, societies and states did the same with the [[vertical archipelago]], establishing colonies at different elevations and locations to increase the possibilities of agricultural success.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2002|pp=27-35}} {{sfn|McEwan|2006|pp=23-27, 83-85}}

=== Caral ===
{{main|Norte Chico civilization}}
[[File:PeruCaral01.jpg|thumb|left|The Caral pyramids in the arid Supe Valley, some 20 km from the Pacific coast.]]

The [[Norte Chico civilization]] (also called Caral)&lt;ref&gt;The name is disputed. English-language sources use Norte Chico (Spanish: "Little North") per Haas ''et al.'' (2004). Caral or Caral-Supe are more likely to be found in Spanish language sources per Shady. This article follows usage in recent English-language sources and employs Norte Chico, but the title is not definitive. Peruvian Norte Chico should not be confused with the [[Chile]]an region of [[Norte Chico, Chile|the same name]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a complex [[pre-Columbian]] society that included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico region]] of north-central coastal [[Peru]]. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the [[Cradles of civilization]] where civilization separately originated in the ancient world. It flourished between the 30th century BC and the 18th century BC. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, is derived from the [[Sacred City of Caral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1269|title=Sacred City of Caral-Supe|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=2011-06-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615010519/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1269| archivedate= 15 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Supe Valley, a large and well-studied Norte Chico site. Complex society in Norte Chico arose a millennium after [[Sumer]] in [[Mesopotamia]], was contemporaneous with the [[Egyptian pyramids]], and predated the [[Mesoamerican]] [[Olmec]] by nearly two millennia.

[[File:Chavinmuseolarco.jpg|thumb|right|Chavín Gold Crown [[Cultural periods of Peru|Formative Epoch]] 1200-300 BCE ([[Larco Museum|Larco Museum Collection]], Lima).]]
The [[Chavín culture]] in Peru is thought to have been primarily a religious movement. The culture apparently began in the Andes highlands and then spread outward throughout the country. The Chavín culture has very distinctive art styles, particularly in effigy pots, a number of which were in feline shapes. [[Chavin de Huantar]] was an important ritual centre for Chavin Culture, dating to around 1,500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Valdivia Culture]] is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier [[Las Vegas culture]] and thrived on the [[Santa Elena, Ecuador|Santa Elena]] peninsula near the modern-day town of [[Valdivia, Ecuador|Valdivia]], [[Ecuador]] between 3500 BC and 1800 BC.

=== Nazca ===

[[File:Líneas de Nazca, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 55.JPG|thumb|200px|The Condor, [[Nazca Lines]], created by the [[Nazca culture]].]]
The [[Nazca culture]] (also Nasca) was the [[archaeological culture]] that flourished from 100 to 800 AD beside the dry southern coast of [[Peru]] in the river valleys of the [[Nazca|Rio Grande de Nazca]] drainage and the [[Ica Region|Ica Valley]] (Silverman and Proulx, 2002). Having been heavily influenced by the preceding [[Paracas culture]], which was known for extremely complex textiles, the Nazca produced an array of beautiful crafts and technologies such as ceramics, textiles, and [[geoglyph]]s (most commonly known as the [[Nazca Lines|Nazca lines]]). They also built an impressive system of underground [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, known as ''[[puquios]]'', that still function today. The [[Nazca Province]] in the [[Ica Region]] was named for this people.

=== Moche ===
{{main|Moche (culture)}}
[[File:Condormuseolarco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Moche culture is world-renowned for its pottery, in picture a [[Andean condor|Condor]] from about 300 CE.]]
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] civilization (alternately, the Mochica culture, Early [[Chimu]], Pre-Chimu, Proto-Chimu, etc.) flourished in northern [[Peru]] from about 100 AD to 800 AD, during the [[Cultural periods of Peru|Regional Development Epoch]]. While this issue is the subject of some debate, many scholars contend that the Moche were not politically organized as a monolithic empire or state.   Rather, they were likely a group of autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture, as seen in the rich [[iconography]] and [[monument]]al architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately painted [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[gold]] work, monumental constructions (''[[huaca]]s'') and [[irrigation]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = | first2 = Linda |last2=Black |first3=Larry S. |last3=Krieger |first4=Phillip C. |last4=Naylor |first5=Dahia |last5=Ibo Shabaka | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moche history may be broadly divided into three periods – the emergence of the Moche culture in Early Moche (AD 100–300), its expansion and florescence during Middle Moche (AD 300–600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (AD 500–750).&lt;ref&gt;Bawden, G. 2004.

=== Tiwanaku ===
{{main|Tiwanaku}}
[[File:Zonnepoort tiwanaku.jpg|thumbnail|The "[[Gate of the Sun]]" built by the Tiwanaku culture.]]
[[Tiwanaku]] (Spanish: Tiahuanaco and Tiahuanacu) is an important [[Pre-Columbian]] archaeological site in western [[Bolivia]], South America. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important precursors to the [[Inca Empire]], flourishing as the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] in the [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz Department]], [[Ingavi Province]], [[Tiwanaku Municipality]], about {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]]. The site was first recorded in written history by Spanish conquistador and self-acclaimed "first chronicler of the Indies" [[Pedro Cieza de León]]. Leon stumbled upon the remains of Tiwanaku in 1549 while searching for the Inca capital [[Qullasuyu]].&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization |last=Kolata| first=Alan L.|authorlink=Alan Kolata |date=December 15, 1993| isbn=978-1-55786-183-2| publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have hypothesized that Tiwanaku's modern name is related to the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] term ''taypiqala'', meaning "stone in the center", alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world.&lt;ref name="Ancient Skies"&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy | first1=David H.| last1=Kelley| first2=Eugene F.| last2=Milone  |date=November 19, 2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-0-387-95310-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost, as the people of Tiwanaku had no written language.&lt;ref name="Frommers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes|first=Holly| url=http://www.frommers.com/store/047018986X.html |title=Frommers 500 Places to See Before They Disappear (500 Places) |publisher=[[Frommers]] |date=October 20, 2008 |pages= 266|isbn=978-0-470-18986-3 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/pi/santos_notes.html |title=Profile: Fabricio R.

{{main|Chachapoyas culture}}
[[File:Ruinas-soloco chachapoyas amazonas peru.jpg|thumb|left|Walls of Soloco fortress, Chachapoyas, Peru.]]
The Chachapoyas, or the 'Cloud people', were an Andean civilization living in a cloud forests of the Amazonas region of present-day northern Peru. The Incas conquered the Chachapoyas shortly before the arrival of the Spanish in Peru. The first firm evidence of the existence of their existence dates back to around 700 AD, although it is possible that they built a settlement called Gran Pajáten where some ceramics have been dated to 200 BC. The largest Chacapoyan site discovered so far is [[Kuelap]]. A number of mummified burial sites have also been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bruceleeeowe.wordpress.com/weird-sciences-home-page/ancient-and-lost-civilizations/inca-civilization/the-chachapoyas-culture-of-peru/| publisher=Wordpress| accessdate=24 October 2011| title=The Chachapoyas Culture of Peru

=== Wari ===
{{main|Wari culture}}
[[File:Piquillacta Archaeological site - street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pikillaqta administrative center, built by the Wari civilization in [[Cusco]].]]
The [[Wari culture|Wari]] ({{lang-es|Huari}}) were a [[Pre-Inca cultures|Middle Horizon]] civilization that flourished in the south-central [[Andes]] and coastal area of modern-day [[Peru]], from about AD 500 to 1000. (The Wari culture is not to be confused with the modern [[ethnic]] group and language known as ''[[Wari']]'', with which it has no known link.) [[Wari ruins|Wari]], as the former capital city was called, is located {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of the modern city of [[Ayacucho]], Peru. This city was the center of a civilization that covered much of the highlands and coast of modern [[Peru]]. The best-preserved remnants, beside the [[Wari ruins|Wari Ruins]], are the recently discovered [[Northern Wari ruins]] near the city of [[Chiclayo, Peru|Chiclayo]], and Cerro Baul in [[Moquegua]]. Also well-known are the Wari ruins of ''Pikillaqta'' ("Flea Town"), a short distance south-east of [[Cuzco]] ''en route'' to [[Lake Titicaca]].

== Historical cultures ==

=== Chimú ===
{{main|Chimú culture}}
[[File:Vasija chimú caballito de totora (M. América 10788) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chimú vessel representing a fisherman on a [[caballitos de totora]] (1100–1400 CE).]]
The [[Chimú culture|Chimú]] were the residents of [[Chimor]], with its capital at the city of [[Chan Chan]], a large adobe city in the [[Moche Valley]] of present-day [[Trujillo, Peru]]. The culture arose about 900 AD. The [[Inca]] ruler [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] led a campaign which conquered the Chimú around 1470 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, George. (1962). ''The Art and Architecture of Ancient America'', Ringwoods: Penguin Books London Ltd., pp. 247-274&lt;/ref&gt;

This was just fifty years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers were able to record accounts of Chimú culture from individuals who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly,  [[archaeological]] evidence suggest Chimor grew out of the remnants of [[Moche culture]]; early Chimú pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate.

=== Inca Empire ===
{{Main|Inca Empire}}
[[File:Over Machu Picchu.jpg|left|thumb|View of [[Machu Picchu]] built by the Incas.]]
The [[Inca Empire]], or Incan Empire&lt;ref&gt;Also Inka Empire; see [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]] for more information regarding this spelling difference&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: ''Tawantinsuyu''), was the largest empire in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian America]].&lt;ref&gt;Terence D'Altroy, ''The Incas'', pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in [[Cusco]] in modern-day [[Peru]]. The [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]] arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century, and the [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572. From 1438 to 1533 AD, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges, including large parts of modern [[Ecuador]], Peru, western and south central [[Bolivia]], northwest [[Argentina]], north and north-central [[Chile]], and southern [[Colombia]] into a state comparable to the historical [[empire]]s of the [[Old World]].

=== Muisca ===
{{main|Muisca Confederation}}
{{see also|List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites}}
[[File: Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''La balsa Muisca'' (The [[Muisca raft]]), a pre-Columbian gold sculpture representing the Muisca's offerings of gold in the [[Guatavita Lake]].]]
The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] was the [[Chibcha]]-speaking people that formed the [[Muisca Confederation]] in the central highlands of present-day Colombia. They were encountered by the troops of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], in name of the [[Spanish Empire]] at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|conquest]] in the spring of 1537. The Muisca comprised two confederations: [[Tunja|Hunza]] (present-day Tunja) was located in the northern area, whose sovereign was the ''[[zaque]]''; and [[Bogotá|Bacatá]] the southern area, whose sovereign was the ''[[zipa]]''. Both confederations were located in the highlands of modern-day [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]'') in the central area of [[Colombia]]'s [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]].

=== Timoto-Cuica ===
{{main|Timoto-Cuica people}}
[[File: Campo de Mérida.JPG|thumb|right|Timoto-Cuica territory, in present-day [[Mérida State|Mérida, Venezuela]].]]
Timoto–Cuica people compromised primarily of two tribes, the '''Timotes''' and the '''Cuicas''', that inhabited in the [[Andes|Andean]] region of western [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=mahoney&gt;Mahoney 89&lt;/ref&gt; They were closely related to the [[Muisca people]] of the [[Andes]], who spoke a [[Chibcha language]]. The Timoto-Cuicas were not only composed of the Timoto and the Cuica tribes, but also the Mucuchíes, the Migures, the Tabares, and the Mucuñuques. Timoto-Cuica society was complex with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. They also stored water in tanks.&lt;ref name=mahoney/&gt; Their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful, for the most part, and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and [[ulluco]]s.&lt;ref name=art&gt;[http://en.amigosprecolombino.es/cultures/central-america-and-intermedia/venezuela "Venezuela."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904200841/http://en.amigosprecolombino.es/cultures/central-america-and-intermedia/venezuela |date=2011-09-04 }} ''Friends of the Pre-Columbian Art Museum.'' (retrieved 9 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; They left behind works of art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the [[arepa]], a staple in [[Venezuelan cuisine|Venezuelan]] and [[Colombian cuisine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">{{short description|Theory of continuous nonconformist Christian Church}}
'''Baptist successionism''' (or '''Baptist perpetuity''') is one of several theories on the [[Baptists#Origins|origin and continuation of Baptist churches]]. The theory postulates an unbroken lineage of churches (since the days of [[John the Baptist]], who baptized [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]) which have held beliefs similar to those of current [[Baptists]]. Groups often included in this lineage include the [[Montanists]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], [[Cathari]], [[Waldenses]], [[Albigenses]], and [[Anabaptist]]s.{{sfn|Patterson|1969|p= 9}}

== Articulation of the theory ==

[[File:The Trail of Blood.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Diagram representing ''[[The Trail of Blood]]'' as presented by [[James Milton Carroll]]]]
The perpetuity view is often identified with ''[[The Trail of Blood]]'', a pamphlet by [[James Milton Carroll]] published in 1931.{{sfn|McBeth|1987|pp=59–60}} Other Baptist writers who held the perpetuity view are [[John T. Christian]], [[Thomas Crosby (Baptist)|Thomas Crosby]], G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and D. B. Ray.{{sfnm |1a1=McBeth |1y=1987 |1pp=59–60 |2a1=Torbet |2y=1975 |2p=18}}

This view was once commonly held among Baptists.{{sfn|Torbet|1975|p=18}} Since the end of the 19th century, however, the theory has increasingly come under attack and today has been largely discredited.{{sfnm |1a1=Brackney |1y=2004 |2a1=McGoldrick |2y=2000}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}} Nonetheless, the view continued to be the prevailing view among Baptists of the [[Southern United States]] into the latter 20th century.{{sfn|Patterson|1969|p=6}} It is now identified primarily with [[Landmarkism]], though not exclusively so.{{sfnm |1a1=McBeth |1y=1987 |1p=58 |2a1=Patterson |2y=1969 |2p=6}} The concept finds its parallels in the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] doctrine of [[apostolic succession]] and stands in contrast to the restorationist views of [[Mormons|Latter Day Saints]] and the [[Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]].{{sfn|Torbet|1975|p=19}}

== Modern rejection of the theory ==

Since the end of the 19th century the trend in academic Baptist [[historiography]] has been away from the successionist viewpoint to the view that modern day Baptists are an outgrowth of 17th-century [[English Separatist|English Separatism]].{{sfn|Cross|1990|p=174}} This shift precipitated a controversy among [[Southern Baptists]] which occasioned the [[Southern Baptist Convention#Whitsitt controversy|forced resignation of William H. Whitsitt]], a professor at [[Southern Baptist Seminary]], in 1898 from the seminary for advocating the new view, though his views continued to be taught in the seminary after his departure.{{sfn|McBeth|1987|pp=457–458}}

The '''Bergmannstraße'''{{need-IPA|German|date=August 2018}} is a street in [[Munich]] and lies west of the city center. It leads from [[Landsberger Straße]] in the north to Ridlerstraße in the south and is located in the [[Boroughs of Munich|district]] of [[Schwanthalerhöhe]]. The formerly referred to as Sendlinger way road, was named in 1883 after the lawyer, historian and archivist Michael Adam von Bergmann (1733-1783), who was city chief judge starting in 1762 and then became mayor in Munich.

== Location ==
The Bergmannstraße is located in the district Schwanthalerhöhe and in the district of Westend, a classic working-class district with [[Housing cooperative|cooperative buildings]] from the period around 1900. The district is, with about 30,000 inhabitants in an area of just over two square kilometers, one of the most densely populated districts in Munich. The proportion of foreigners is 34.5% (as of 2015), one of the highest in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtinfos/Statistik/Ver-ffentlichungen.htmls | title=Statistisches Taschenbuch 2016 | author= | date=2016 | website= | publisher=Landeshauptstadt München | language=German | accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rental prices here in comparison with the other municipalities of Munich are at a medium level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wohnungsboerse.net/mietspiegel-Muenchen/2091 | title=Mietspiegel München 2018 | author= | date= | website=wohnungsboerse.net | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bergmannstraße is centrally located in the district and runs in a north-south direction for a length of almost 900 meters. The western parallel road is the [[Trappentreustraße]], part of the [[Bundesstraße 2 R]], but mostly runs underground through the Trappentreutunnel. North of the Bergmannstraße runs the multiple track railway lines from about 1.5 kilometers east of the ''[[München Hauptbahnhof]]'' (main train station), south of the Bergmannstraße the branching tracks of the [[Munich South Ring]] run towards the [[Munich East station]] and from there, on towards [[Munich–Rosenheim railway|Rosenheim and Salzburg]]. The [[Theresienwiese]], where the annual Munich [[Oktoberfest]] takes place, is located about 800 meters east of the Bergmannstraße.

== Road direction ==
Bergmannstraße branches off to the south of Landsberger Straße, a major arterial road that runs parallel to the [[Munich-Augsburg railway]] line, connecting the city center with the western districts and continuing in the direction of [[Landsberg am Lech]].

The northern part of the Bergmannstraße is dominated mostly by simple four-storey to five-storey rental units and individual small businesses. In the middle part of the street, on the western side, lies the Gollierplatz, a green area of about 10,000 square meters. On the east side of the street is a historically listed multi-storey residential complex from the early 1920s. South of it stands the ''Ledigenheim'' (asylum for unmarried people), which was built as a ''Rohziegelbau'' (brick building) in the [[New Objectivity (architecture)|new objectivity style]] under the direction of the architect [[Theodor Fischer]], originating from [[Lower Franconia]], in the years 1925-1927. On the west side of the road, just south of Gollierplatz, is the building of the elementary school (now a primary school) from 1889 to 1891, built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style. A little further south is a three-winged complex arranged around a forecourt, built in factual forms with slightly expressionistic impact in the years 1928 to 1931 and also called Green Block due to the light green color.

Further south, on the east side of the street, there is a post office from the years 1926 to 1928 in the new objectivity style. At the southern end of the Bergmannstraße, on the west side, are several rental units from the years 1898 to 1909, built in the [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] style or in [[Art Nouveau]] style.

The Bergmannstraße connects at its southern end, to the Ridlerstraße which runs parallel to the railway line of the Südring, which leads from the main station to Ostbahnhof.

== History ==
As long as [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg|Neuhausen]] was not a parish of its own, the Sendlinger Weg was also the Kirchweg, since baptisms, weddings and festive church services took place in the [[Sendling]]er parish church of St. Margaret. It was not until 1871 that the Winthirkirche became a vicarage church and finally in 1882 a parish church. The paved dirt road ran like today's [[Donnersbergerstraße]], leading slightly to the east at the height of the present Richelstraße, crossing the railway tracks at the height of the [[Maillingerstraße]] and then leading on to the later Bergmannstraße to the old Sendlinger church. With the extension of today's Maillingerstraße, the Bergmannstraße was also extended to the ''Burgfriendensgrenze'' (border of the castle precincts) from 1846 to 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bayerische-landesbibliothek-online.de/images/blo/ortsblaetter/karten/karten/St_Muen_1853_11.jpg | title=Stadtkarte von München Nr. 558/03 | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Bayerisches Landesvermessungsamt München | language=German | accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since today's Bergmannstraße was on the municipal boundary of Neuhausen and Sendling, there was still paving duties charged in 1865, for example, when a wedding party wanted to cross the border. In 1877, the Sendling community was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]], as a result, the dirt road came into the Munich city planning sovereignty. After the renaming of Haderer Weg in Westendstraße in coordination with the incorporation of the town, the designation of Bergmannstraße followed in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kusz-westend.de/das-kusz/historie/ | title=Ein neuer Stadtteil entstand | author= | date= | website= | publisher=KUSZ-Westend | language=German | accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Cartography ==
The street is completely marked in the 14th edition from 1891, of the [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]] and also shown as built up to the Bergmannschule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://machinatemporis.de/media/image/product/38269/lg/muenchen-stadtplan-lithographie-1891.jpg | title=Stadtkarte München Schwabing von 1891 | author= | date= | website=machinatemporis.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Road access ==
The only direct connection of the Bergmannstraße to the public transport is the station Bergmannstraße of the bus line 53 ([[Münchner Freiheit]] – [[Aidenbachstraße (Munich U-Bahn)|Aidenbachstraße]]), which runs through the Kazmairstraße, a crossroad of Bergmannstraße.

The nearest [[Munich U-Bahn|underground stations]] are located about 400 meters away, these are the stations [[Schwanthalerhöhe (Munich U-Bahn)|Schwanthalerhöhe]], as well as Heimeranplatz, the latter station is also connected to the [[Munich S-Bahn]] network.

== Historical Monuments ==
Directly on Bergmannstraße lie ten historical monuments built between 1889 and 1927, in the youth or Neo-Baroque style as well as in the style of New Objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://stadt-muenchen.net/baudenkmal/l_baudenkmal_strasse.php?strasse=Bergmannstra%C3%9Fe | title=Baudenkmäler - Bergmannstraße | author= | date=2017 | website= | publisher=Stadtportal München | language=German | accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bergmannstraße crosses the Gollierplatz Ensemble (E-1-62-000-19). Nr. 56, 58, 62, 64 and 66 at the southwestern end of Bergmannstraße form a coherent, handsome but not exactly uniform group of buildings.

== Deliberately engineered or continuation of civil war ==
=== Overview ===
During the 1930s, the Soviet Union was dominated by [[Joseph Stalin]], who sought to reshape Soviet society with aggressive economic planning. As the leader of the Soviet Union, he constructed an authoritarian state whose policies have been blamed for millions of deaths. During his time as leader of the Soviet Union, Stalin made frequent use of his [[secret police]], prisons, and nearly unlimited power to reshape Soviet society.

A campaign of [[political repression]], including arrests, deportations, and executions of better-off peasants and their families occurred from 1929 to 1932. The richer peasants were labeled ''[[kulak]]s'' and considered [[class enemies]]. More than 1.8 million peasants were deported in 1930–1931.&lt;ref name="Harvest"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] (1986) ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-505180-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=viola&gt;[[Lynne Viola]], ''The Unknown Gulag.

This policy was accomplished simultaneously with [[collectivization in the Soviet Union]] and effectively brought all [[agriculture in the Soviet Union]] under state control.

[[File:Three broad categories of the peasants.jpg|thumb|left|May 1926 illustration to the Soviet categories of peasants: bednyaks, or poor peasants; serednyaks, or mid-income peasants; and kulaks, the higher-income farmers who had larger farms than most Russian peasants]]
The "liquidation of the kulaks as a [[Social class|class]]" was announced by Stalin on December 27, 1929.&lt;ref name="Harvest"/&gt; The decision was formalized in a resolution, "On measures for the elimination of kulak households in districts of comprehensive [[collectivization]]", on January 30, 1930. The kulaks were divided into three categories: those to be shot or imprisoned as decided by the local [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|secret political police]]; those to be sent to [[Siberia]], North, the [[Urals]], or [[Kazakhstan]], after confiscation of their property; and those to be [[eviction|evicted]] from their houses and used in [[labor colony|labour colonies]] within their own districts.&lt;ref name="Harvest"/&gt;

The combination of the elimination of kulaks, collectivization, and other repressive policies contributed to mass starvation in many parts of the [[Soviet Ukraine]] and the death of at least 7 to 10 million peasants in 1930–1937.&lt;ref name="Harvest"/&gt;

=== Requisition quotas ===
Sources such as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' say there was no physical basis for famine in Ukraine, and that Soviet authorities set quotas for Ukraine at exceedingly high levels. However Soviet archive data suggests the grain harvest was not as large as has been assumed, and the Ukrainian historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], who lived through the period in question and was himself a victim of a Stalinist purge, described the famine as preceded by "a year of drought coincid[ing] with chaotic agricultural conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tauger|first=Mark B.|date=1991|title=The 1932 Harvest and the Famine of 1933|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/1932-harvest-and-the-famine-of-1933/C5FC508259E11A70BFBFA5AE5A2C4E9F|journal=Slavic Review|volume=50|issue=1|pages=70–89|doi=10.2307/2500600|issn=0037-6779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ukraine|last=Hrushevsky|first=Mikhail|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the phrase "chaotic agricultural conditions" may suggest, the famine was perhaps caused by the food requisition actions carried out by the Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-famine-of-1932-33#ref404577|title=Ukraine: The famine of 1932–33|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=3 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016|quote="The Great Famine (Holodomor) of 1932–33—a man-made demographic catastrophe unprecedented in peacetime. Of the estimated six to eight million people who died in the Soviet Union, about four to five million were Ukrainians...  Its deliberate nature is underscored by the fact that no physical basis for famine existed in Ukraine... Soviet authorities set requisition quotas for Ukraine at an impossibly high level. Brigades of special agents were dispatched to Ukraine to assist in procurement, and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated... The rural population was left with insufficient food to feed itself."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government plans for central grain collection in Ukraine were lowered by 18.1% relative to the 1931 plan. Collective farms were expected to return 132,750 tons of grain, the amount that had been provided in spring 1932 as aid. The grain collection plan for July 1932 was adopted to collect 19.5 million [[pood]]s. The actual state of collection was disastrous, and by July 31 only 3 million poods (compared to 21 million in 1931) were collected. The total amount of grain collected by February 5, 1933 was only 255 million poods (compared to 440 million poods in 1931).

In 1930 the Ukraine provided 27% of the Soviet harvest but 38% of the deliveries. In 1931 it made 42% of deliveries. The Ukrainian harvest fell from 23.9 million tons to 18.3 but the same quota, 7.7 million tons, was demanded, 7 million was collected. 7.7 was again demanded in 1932, reduced to 6.6, only 4.7 was collected.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock (1991). ''Hitler and Stalin''. pp. 293—294.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminalised gleaning ===
[[Gleaning]] is the act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested or from fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest. Some ancient cultures promoted gleaning as an early form of a welfare system. In the [[Soviet Union]], people who gleaned and distributed food brought themselves under legal risk. The [[Law of Spikelets]] criminalised gleaning under penalty of death, or ten years of forced labour in exceptional circumstances.

Some sources claim there were several legislative acts adopted in order to force starvation in the Ukrainian SSR. On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law, "On the Safekeeping of Socialist Property",&lt;ref name="TICirc"&gt;Konchalovsky and Lipkov, The Inner Circle, [[Newmarket Press]], New York: 1991, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; that imposed penalties starting at a ten-year prison sentence and up to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property.&lt;ref name="Potocki, p. 320"&gt;Potocki, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Serczyk, p. 311"&gt;Serczyk, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Gregorovich 1998"&gt;Andrew Gregorovich, [http://www.faminegenocide.com/resources/genocide/index.html#4 "Genocide in Ukraine 1933", part 4: "How Did Stalin Organize the Genocide?"], Ukrainian Canadian Research &amp; Documentation Centre, Toronto 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin personally appended the stipulation: "People who encroach on socialist property should be considered [[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]."{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Within the first five months of passage of the law, 54,645 individuals had been imprisoned under it, and 2,110 sentenced to death. The initial wording of the decree, "On fought with speculation”, adopted August 22, 1932, led to common situations where minor acts such as bartering tobacco for bread were documented as punished by 5 years imprisonment. After 1934, by NKVD demand, the penalty for minor offenses was limited to a fine of 500 [[ruble]]s or three months of correctional labor.&lt;ref name="law.edu.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.edu.ru/article/article.asp?articleID=1131644 |title=RELP. Г. И. Вольфман. Борьба со спекуляцией по советскому законодательству. Изд. Саратовского ун-та, 1963, 133 стр. : |publisher=Law.edu.ru |date= |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of this law, colloquially dubbed the "[[Law of Spikelets|law of the wheat ears]]",&lt;ref name="TICirc" /&gt; included even the smallest appropriation of grain by peasants for personal use. A little over a month later, the law was revised, as [[Politburo]] protocols revealed that secret decisions had later modified the original decree of September 16, 1932. The Politburo approved a measure that specifically exempted small-scale theft of socialist property from the death penalty, declaring that "organizations and groupings destroying state, social, and co-operate property in an organized manner by fires, explosions and mass destruction of property shall be sentenced to execution without trial", and listed a number of cases in which "kulaks, former traders, and other socially-alien persons" would be subject to the death penalty. "Working individual peasants and collective farmers" who stole ''[[kolkhoz]]'' property and grain would be sentenced to ten years; the death penalty would be imposed only for "systematic theft of grain, sugar beets, animals, etc."&lt;ref name="DW167_168_198_203"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, pp.167-168, 198-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet expectations for the 1932 grain crop were high because of Ukraine's bumper crop the previous year, which Soviet authorities believed were sustainable. When it became clear that the 1932 grain deliveries were not going to meet the expectations of the government, the decreased agricultural output was first blamed on the kulaks, and later on agents and spies of foreign intelligence services, "nationalists", "[[Symon Petlura|Petlurovites]]", and from 1937 on, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. According to a report from the head of the Supreme Court, by January 15, 1933 as many as 103,000 people (more than 14 thousand in the Ukrainian SSR) had been sentenced under the provisions of the August 7 decree. Of the 79,000 whose sentences were known to the Supreme Court, 4,880 had been sentenced to death, 26,086 to ten years of imprisonment, and 48,094 to other punishments.&lt;ref name="DW167_168_198_203" /&gt;

On November 8, Molotov and Stalin issued an order stating, "from today the dispatch of goods for the villages of all regions of Ukraine shall cease until kolkhozy and individual peasants begin to honestly and conscientiously fulfill their duty to the working class and the Red Army by delivering grain."&lt;ref name="DW174"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, the Politburo ordered that all those sentenced to confinement of three years or more in Ukraine be deported to labor camps. It also simplified procedures for confirming death sentences in Ukraine. The Politburo also dispatched Balytsky to Ukraine for six months with the full powers of the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]].&lt;ref name="DW175"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blacklist system ===
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2010}} claim that in December 1932, Soviets imposed special sanctions and blockade by NKVD units which led to complete extermination by starvation of certain villages and areas. The blacklist was applied with harsher methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be "underperforming" in the grain collection procurement: "Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations."&lt;ref name="Rajca, p. 321"&gt;Rajca, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grainmemo"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/k2grain.html Memorandum on Grain Problem], Addendum to the minutes of Politburo [meeting] No. 93. Resolution on blacklisting villages. December 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants, who were not kolkhoz members and who were "underperforming" in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To reach the grain procurement quota amongst peasants, 1,100 brigades were organized, which consisted of activists, often from neighboring villages, who had either already accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it.

Since most of the goods supplied to the rural areas were commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and sometimes obtained by villagers from neighboring cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained thus for a long period&amp;mdash;as an example mentioned in the December 6 decree, the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist on October 17, 1933, when they completed their plan for grain collection early. After January 1933, the blacklist regime was modified, with 100% plan execution no longer required. As mentioned in the December 6 Decree, the villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after 88% and 70% plan completion, respectively.&lt;ref name="archives1933"/&gt;

Measures were taken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was done frequently by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain, and regardless of whether or not the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves or enough seed left to plant the next harvest.

=== Restrictions on freedom of movement ===
Some sources state{{who|date=November 2010}} that Ukrainian SSR borders were sealed by the [[NKVD]] and the army in order to prevent starving peasants from travelling into territories where food was more available. Some researchers believe these measures extended to urban areas inside Ukrainian SSR. During the [[first five-year plan]], urban population growth brought more than 10 million people from villages to cities; the number receiving food rations increased from 25 million in 1930 to 40 million in 1932. Food production declined and urban food supplies fell drastically.  Reserves did not keep pace with ration requirements. Desertion of factories, combined with peasants' flight from collective farms, resulted in millions of people moving around the country. In response, the government revived the tsarist institution of internal passports at the end of 1932.&lt;ref name="Tauger_SR1991"/&gt;

Special barricades were set up by [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] units throughout the Soviet Union to prevent an exodus of peasants from hunger-stricken regions. During a single month in 1933, 219,460 people were either intercepted and escorted back or arrested and sentenced.&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ukraine, these measures had the following results, according to the declassified documents:&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52386&lt;/ref&gt; During the 11 days (January 23–February 2) after the January 22, 1933 decree, 3,861 people were intercepted, of which 340 were arrested "for further recognition". During the same period, there were 16,773 people intercepted (907 of those not living in Ukraine) in trains and at railway stations on the whole Ukrainian territory; out of those, 1,610 people were arrested. These figures also included criminals. In the same document, the GPU states that 94,433 peasants had already left the Ukrainian territory during the period from December 15, 1932 to January 2, 1933 (data for 215 districts out of 484, and Moldavian ASRR). It has been estimated that there were some 150,000 excess deaths as a result of this policy, and one historian asserts that these deaths constitute a [[crime against humanity]].&lt;ref name="Ellman"&gt;[http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/mjellman/ Michael Ellman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014232729/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/mjellman/ |date=2007-10-14 }},

The government introduced new identity papers and obligatory registration for citizens in December 1932.&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt; Initially, the area of new identity papers and obligatory registration implementation was limited to Moscow, Leningrad (encircling 100&amp;nbsp;km), and [[Kharkiv]] (encircling 50&amp;nbsp;km), and the new measures were planned for implementation by June 1933. In Ukraine, introduction of the passport system was to be carried out by the end of 1933, with top priority given to its enforcement in Kharkiv, Kiev, and Odessa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genocidecurriculum.org/curriculum-resources/general-archive/united-states-congressional-commission-on-the-ukrainian-famine/1report-to-congress/page-83-3/ On establishment of uniform system of internal passports in URSR], ''Visti VUTsVK'', January 1, 1933, p. 4., cited through [http://genocidecurriculum.org/about-the-project/ genocidecurriculum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel from Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus [[Kuban]] ''kray'' region was specifically forbidden by the directives of January 22, 1933 (signed by Molotov and Stalin) and of January 23, 1933 (joint directive [[Central Committee of Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and [[Sovnarkom]]). February 16, 1933, the same measures were applied to the Lower-Volga region.&lt;ref&gt;Politburo Decision http://media.mid.ru/golod/072_17-3-916-17.jpg {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028221246/http://media.mid.ru/golod/072_17-3-916-17.jpg# |date=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After February, the directives stated that travel "for bread" from these areas was organized by enemies of the Soviet Union, with the purpose of agitation in northern areas of the Soviet Union against kolkhozes, but was not prevented. Therefore, railway tickets were to be sold only by ''[[ispolkom]]'' permits, and those who had already reached the north should be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Martin, The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939., Ithaca. N.I., 2001, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information blockade ===
Some sources say{{who|date=November 2010}} that the Soviet regime, by preventing news of the famine from reaching the outside world, prevented foreign sources from providing aid to alleviate the famine and associated hardships. Some claim the same thing happened during the earlier [[Russian famine of 1921|1921&amp;ndash;23 famine]] in the Soviet Union. With regard to the earlier famine, some researchers say initial Soviet pleas for aid in early autumn 1921 were refused by European countries, and what aid was eventually provided didn't come for four or five months, so the Soviet government may not have expected the outside world to be very helpful in this instance either.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

On February 23, 1933, the Politburo of Central Committee adopted a decree requiring foreign journalists to seek travel permits from the General Directorate of Militia before entering the affected areas. Also, the Soviet government denied initial reports of the famine (but agreed with information about malnutrition), while preventing foreign journalists from traveling in the region. At the same time, there was no credible evidence of information blockade arrangements on a considerable number of foreign specialists (engineers, workers, etc.) who worked at construction sites at Ukrainian territory.

For example, [[Gareth Jones (journalist)|Gareth Jones]], one of [[David Lloyd George]]'s private secretaries, spent several days in mid-March travelling to "all twenty villages, not only in the Ukraine, but also in the black earth district, and in the Moscow region, and... I slept in peasants' cottages, and did not immediately leave for the next village."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} He reached the neighboring rural area of Kharkiv (the capital of Soviet Ukraine), spent some days there, and despite seeing no dead people or animals himself, reported "that there was famine in the Soviet Union."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

On August 23, 1933, foreign correspondents were warned individually by the press section of the Foreign Office of the Soviet Union not to attempt to travel to the provinces or elsewhere in the Soviet Union without first obtaining formal permission. The Foreign Office of the Soviet Union, without explanation, refused permission to [[William Henry Chamberlin|William H. Chamberlain]], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' correspondent, to visit and observe the harvest in the principal agricultural regions of the [[North Caucasus]] and Ukraine. From May&amp;ndash;July 1933, two other American correspondents were forbidden to make a trip to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artukraine.com/famineart/bread_price.htm |title=The Great Famine-Genocide in Soviet Ukraine (Holodomor) |publisher=Artukraine.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093254/http://www.artukraine.com/famineart/bread_price.htm# |archive-date=2008-05-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such restrictions were softened in September 1933.

Scholars who have conducted research in declassified archives have reported "the Politburo and regional Party committees insisted that immediate and decisive action be taken in response to the famine such that 'conscientious farmers' not suffer, while district Party committees were instructed to supply every child with milk and decreed that those who failed to mobilize resources to feed the hungry or denied hospitalization to famine victims be prosecuted."&lt;ref name="DW424"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1933, based on data collected by undercover investigation and photos, the [[Bohemia]]n-[[Austria]]n [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Theodor Innitzer]] began an awareness-raising campaign in the [[Western World|West]] about the massive deaths by hunger and occasional cases of [[cannibalism]] that were occurring in Ukraine and the North Caucasus at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746864,00.html Starvation &amp; Surplus], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', January 22, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refusal to provide aid for starving ===
[[File:HolodomorUcrania9.jpg|thumb|250px|Street in [[Kharkiv]], 1932]]
Some sources claim{{who|date=November 2010}} that, despite the pleas for assistance and the acknowledged famine situation, the Moscow authorities refused to provide aid; some researchers state that aid was provided only during the summer.  The first reports regarding malnutrition and hunger in rural areas and towns (which were undersupplied through the recently introduced rationing system) to the Ukrainian GPU and ''oblast'' authorities are dated to mid-January 1933. However, the first food aid sent by Central Soviet authorities for the Odessa and Dnepropetrovsk regions 400 thousand [[pood]]s (6600 [[tonne]]s, 200 thousand poods or 3300 tonnes for each) appeared as early as February 7, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mid.ru/ns-arch.nsf/932b471b7dc29104c32572ba00560533/22fa7cb39af8e09ec32574bb003a7f8c?

While the numbers of such reports increased, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine issued a decree on February 8, 1933, that urged every "hunger case" to be treated without delay and with a maximum mobilization of resources by ''kolkhozes'', ''raions'', towns, and oblasts. The decree set a seven-day term for food aid which was to be provided from "central sources". On February 20, 1933, the Dnipropetrovsk oblast received 1.2 million poods of food aid, Odessa received 800 thousand, and Kharkiv received 300 thousand.  The Kiev oblast was allocated 6 million poods by March 18. The Ukrainian authorities also provided aid, but it was limited by available resources. In order to assist orphaned children, the Ukrainian GPU and [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|People's Commissariat for Health]] created a special commission, which established a network of kindergartens where children could get food.  Urban areas affected by food shortage adhered to a rationing system. On March 20, 1933, Stalin signed a decree which lowered the monthly milling levy in Ukraine by 14 thousand tons, which was to be redistributed as an additional bread supply "for students, small towns and small enterprises in large cities and specially in Kiev." However, food aid distribution was not managed effectively and was poorly redistributed by regional and local authorities.

After the first wave of hunger in February and March, Ukrainian authorities met with a second wave of hunger and starvation in April and May, specifically in the [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]] oblasts. The situation was aggravated by the extended winter.

Between February and June 1933, thirty-five Politburo decisions and Sovnarkom decrees authorized the issue of a total of 35.19 million poods (576,400 tonnes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php|title=Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109210644/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php#|archive-date=2017-11-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more than half of total aid to Soviet agriculture as a whole.  1.1 million tonnes were provided by Central Soviet authorities in winter and spring 1933 &amp;mdash; grain and seeds for Ukrainian SSR peasants, [[kolhoz]]es and ''[[sovhoz]]es''. Such figures did not include grain and flour aid provided for the urban population and children, or aid from local sources. In Russia, Stalin personally authorized distribution of aid in answer to a request by [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Sholokhov]], whose own district was stricken.&lt;ref name="DW217"&gt;On April 6, 1933, Sholokhov, who lived in the Vesenskii district (Kuban, Russian Federation), wrote at length to Stalin, describing the famine conditions and urging him to provide grain. Stalin received the letter on April 15, and on April 16 the Politburo granted 700 tons of grain to that district. Stalin sent a telegram to Sholokhov stating "We will do everything required.  Inform size of necessary help.  State a figure."  Sholokhov replied on the same day, and on April 22, the day on which Stalin received the second letter, Stalin scolded him, "You should have sent your answer not by letter but by telegram.  Time was wasted".  Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Stalin also later reprimanded Sholokhov for failing to recognize "sabotage" within his district.  This was the only instance that a specific amount of aid was given to a specific district.&lt;ref name="DW217" /&gt; Other appeals were not successful, and many desperate pleas were cut back or rejected.&lt;ref name="DW218"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents from Soviet archives indicate that the aid distribution was made selectively to the most affected areas, and during the spring months, such assistance was the goal of the relief effort. A special resolution of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine]] for the [[Kiev Oblast]], from March 31, 1933, ordered peasants to be hospitalized with either ailing or recovering patients. The resolution ordered improved nutrition within the limits of available resources so that they could be sent out into the fields to sow the new crop as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="CCresolution"&gt;CC C(b)PU resolution cited through [[Stanislav Kulchytsky]], "[http://www.day.kiev.ua/153455/ Why did Stalin exterminate the Ukrainians?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209185612/http://www.day.kiev.ua/153455/ |date=December 9, 2007 }}", ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'', November 29, 2005 [https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109210644/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php# |date=2017-11-09 }} doc # 204&lt;/ref&gt; The food was dispensed according to special resolutions from government bodies, and additional food was given in the field where the laborers worked.

The last CPSU Politburo decision about food aid to the whole of the Ukrainian SSR was issued on June 13, 1933. Separate orders about food aid for regions of Ukraine appeared by the end of June through early July 1933 for the [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] and [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]] regions. For the kolkhozes of the [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]] region, assistance was provided by end of July 1933 (Politburo decision dated July 20, 1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid.ru/ns-arch.nsf/932b471b7dc29104c32572ba00560533/22fa7cb39af8e09ec32574bb003a7f8c?|title=Главная|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Export of grain and other food ===
Some publications claim that after recognition of the famine situation in Ukraine during the drought and poor harvests, the Soviet government in [[Moscow]] continued to export grain rather than retain its crop to feed the people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c-8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity - Page 1056] {{ISBN|0-02-865848-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though at a significantly lower rate than in previous years. In 1930&amp;ndash;31, there had been 5,832,000 metric tons of grains exported. In 1931–1932, grain exports declined to 4,786,000 metric tons. In 1932–1933, grain exports were just 1,607,000 metric tons, and in 1933&amp;ndash;34, this further declined to 1,441,000 metric tons.&lt;ref name="DW471"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p.471&lt;/ref&gt; Officially published data &lt;ref&gt;СССР в цифрах ЦУНХУ Госплана СССР. Москва 1935, [[:ru:Изображение:Export27-33.jpg|page 574, 575]]&lt;/ref&gt; differed slightly:
'''Cereals (in tonnes):'''
* 1930 – 4,846,024
* 1931 – 5,182,835
* 1932 – 1,819,114 (~750,000 during the first half of 1932; from late April ~157,000 tonnes of grain was also imported)
* 1933 – 1,771,364 (~220,000 during the first half of 1933;&lt;ref name="Tauger2001"/&gt; from late March grain was also imported)&lt;ref&gt;СССР в цифрах ЦУНХУ Госплана СССР. Москва 1935, [[:ru:Изображение:USSRimport1929-1933.jpg|page 585]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1931 – 2,498,958
* 1932 – 550,917
* 1933 – 748,248

In 1932, via Ukrainian commercial ports the following amounts were exported: 988,300 tons of grains and 16,500 tons of other types of cereals. In 1933, the totals were: 809,600 tons of grains, 2,600 tons of other cereals, 3,500 tons of meat, 400 tons of butter, and 2,500 tons of fish.  Those same ports imported the following amounts: less than 67,200 tons of grains and cereals in 1932, and 8,600 tons of grains in 1933.

The following amounts were received from other Soviet ports: in 1932, 164,000 tons of grains, 7,300 tons of other cereals, 31,500 tons of {{clarify|date=February 2017}}, and no more than 177,000 tons of meat and butter; in 1933, 230,000 tons of grains, 15,300 tons if other cereals, 100 tons of meat, 900 tons of butter, and 34,300 tons of fish.

[[Michael Ellman]] states that the 1932–1933 grain exports amounted to 1.8 million tonnes, which would have been enough to feed 5 million people for one year.&lt;ref name="Ellman"/&gt;

=== Elimination of Ukrainian cultural elite ===
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2010}} found that the famine of 1932&amp;ndash;1933 followed the assault on Ukrainian national culture that started in 1928.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The events of 1932&amp;ndash;1933 in Ukraine were seen by the Soviet Communist leaders as an instrument against Ukrainian self-determination.  At the 12th Congress of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]] (CP(b)U), Moscow-appointed leader Pavel Postyshev declared that "1933 was the year of the defeat of Ukrainian nationalist counter-revolution."&lt;ref&gt;''"12th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, Stenograph Record"'', Kharkiv 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; This "defeat" encompassed not just the physical extermination of a significant portion of the Ukrainian peasantry, but also the mass imprisonment or execution of Ukrainian intellectuals, writers, and artists.

By the end of the 1930s, approximately four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite had been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, "History of Ukraine" article.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like Ukrainian writer [[Mykola Khvylovy]], committed suicide. One of the leading Ukrainian Bolsheviks, [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], who was in charge of the decade-long [[Ukrainization]] program that had been decisively brought to an end, shot himself in the summer of 1933 at the height of the purge of the CP(b)U.  Whole academic organizations, such as the Bahaliy Institute of History and Culture, were shut down following the arrests.

Repression of the intelligentsia occurred in virtually all parts of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Medvedev]] writes "Instead, Stalin once again looked for a scapegoat and found it in the form of the specialists from among the pre-revolutionary Russian (and Ukrainian) intelligentsia" &lt;br&gt;Roy Medvedev, "Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism", ''[[Columbia University Press]]'', 1989, {{ISBN|0-231-06350-4}}, p. 256-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the assault, education and publishing in the republic remained Ukrainianized for years afterward. In 1935&amp;ndash;36, 83% of all school children in the Ukrainian SSR were taught in Ukrainian, with Ukrainians making up about 80% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, ''The Soviet Experiment''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, of 1830 newspapers, 1402 were in Ukrainian, as were 177 magazines, and in 1936, 69 thousand Ukrainian books were printed.&lt;ref&gt;"Soviet Ukraine for 20 years" p.102 Ukrainian SRR Academy of Science 1938 Kiev, also same data in Statistical Compendium 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deliberate targeting of Ukrainians ===
Although famine, caused by collectivization, raged in many parts of the Soviet Union in 1932, special and particularly lethal policies, described by [[Yale]] historian [[Timothy Snyder]] in his book ''[[Bloodlands|Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin]]'' (2010), were adopted in and largely limited to Ukraine at the end of 1932 and 1933.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=42–46}} Snyder lists seven crucial policies that applied only, or mainly, to Soviet Ukraine. He states: "Each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill":{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=42–46}}
# From 18 November 1932 peasants from Ukraine were required to return extra grain they had previously earned for meeting their targets. State police and party brigades were sent into these regions to root out any food they could find.
# Two days later, a law was passed forcing peasants who could not meet their grain quotas to surrender any livestock they had.
# Eight days later, collective farms that failed to meet their quotas were placed on "blacklists" in which they were forced to surrender 15 times their quota. These farms were picked apart for any possible food by party activists. Blacklisted communes had no right to trade or to receive deliveries of any kind, and became death zones.
# On 5 December 1932, Stalin's security chief presented the justification for terrorizing Ukrainian party officials to collect the grain. It was considered treason if anyone refused to do their part in grain requisitions for the state.
# In November 1932 Ukraine was required to provide 1/3 of the grain collection of the entire Soviet Union. As [[Lazar Kaganovich]] put it, the Soviet state would fight "ferociously" to fulfill the plan.
# In January 1933 Ukraine's borders were sealed in order to prevent Ukrainian peasants from fleeing to other republics. By the end of February 1933 approximately 190,000 Ukrainian peasants had been caught trying to flee Ukraine and were forced to return to their villages to starve.
# The collection of grain continued even after the annual requisition target for 1932 was met in late January 1933.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=42–46}}

The recent award-winning documentary ''Genocide Revealed'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozeukes.com/culture/film-genocide-revealed-wins-multiple-awards/ Film “Genocide Revealed” wins multiple awards]. Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organizations. Retrieved 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by Canadian-Ukrainian director Yurij Luhovy, presents evidence for the view that Stalin and his cohorts in the Communist regime (not necessarily the Russian people as a whole) deliberately targeted Ukrainians in the mass starvation of 1932–1933. Stalin's regime proceeded to eliminate the [[intelligentsia]] of Ukraine{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}, to forcibly deport Ukrainian [[Kulak]]s who opposed its collectivization policies, and to orchestrate a deliberate mass starvation by hunger of Ukrainians, wherever they were found throughout the Soviet Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yluhovy.com/MML/Welcome_files/Genocide%20Revealed%20Electronic%20Press%20Kit.pdf ''Genocide Revealed''].

== Consequence of collectivization ==
While a complex task, it is possible to group some of the causes that contributed to the Holodomor. They have to be understood in the larger context of the social revolution from above that took place in the [[Soviet Union]] at the time.&lt;ref name=Problemy12&gt;С.

=== Collectivization ===
{{further|Collectivization in the USSR|Collectivization in the Ukrainian SSR|Dekulakization}}
Approaches to changing from individual farming to a collective type of agricultural production had existed since 1917, but for various reasons (lack of [[agricultural equipment]], agronomy resources, etc.) were not implemented widely until 1925, when there was a more intensive effort by the agricultural sector to increase the number of agricultural cooperatives and bolster the effectiveness of already existing [[sovkhoz]]es. In late 1927, after the XV Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], then known as the All-Union Communist Party ([[bolsheviks]]), a significant impetus was given to the collectivization effort.

In 1927, a [[drought]] shortened the harvest in southern areas of the Ukrainian SSR and [[North Caucasus]]. In 1927–1928, the winter tillage area was badly affected due to low snow levels.  Despite seed aid from the State, many affected areas were not re-sown.  The 1928 harvest was affected by drought in most of the grain producing areas of the Ukrainian SSR.  Shortages in the harvest and difficulties with the supply system created difficulties with the food supply in urban areas and destabilized the food supply situation in the USSR in general.  In order to alleviate the situation, a system of food [[rationing]] was initially implemented in [[Odessa]] in the second quarter of 1928, and later spread to [[Mariupol]], [[Kherson]], [[Kiev]], Dniprelstan ([[Dnipropetrovsk]]), and [[Kharkiv]].  At the beginning of 1929, a similar system was implemented throughout the Soviet Union.  Despite the aid from the Soviet Ukrainian and the Central governments, many southern rural areas registered occurrences of malnutrition and in some cases hunger and starvation (the affected areas and thus the amount of required food aid was under-counted by authorities).  There was also a shortage of forage [[livestock]]. Most of [[Kolkhoz]]es and recently refurnished [[sovkhoz]]es went through these years with few losses, and some were even able to provide assistance to peasants in the more affected areas (seed and grain for food).

Despite the intense state campaign, the collectivization, which was initially voluntary, was not popular amongst peasants: as of early 1929, only 5.6% of Ukrainian peasant households and 3.8% of [[arable land]] were ''collectivized''. In early 1929, the methods employed by the specially empowered authority ''UkrKolhozcenter'' changed from a voluntary enrollment to an administrative one.  By October 1, 1929, a plan for the creation of kolkhozes was "outperformed" by 239%. As a result, 8.8% of arable land was collectivized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1929.php|title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933. Збірник матеріалів і документів|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major step toward "all-over collectivization" took place after an article was published by Stalin in ''[[Pravda]]'' in early November 1929.

While initiated by a November 10&amp;ndash;17 meeting of Communist Party Central Committee ''[[Twenty-Five Thousander]]s'' only trained at special short courses, the main driving force of collectivization and ''[[dekulakization]]'' in Ukraine became a "poor peasants committee" (''komnezamy'') and local village councils (''silrady'') where komnezams members had a voting majority.

The USSR Kolhozcenter issued the December 10, 1929, decree on collectivization of livestock within a three-month period (draft animals 100%, cattle 100%, pigs 80%, sheep and goats 60%). This drove many peasants to slaughter their livestock. By January 1, 1930, the percentage of collectivized households almost doubled to 16.4%.

Despite the infamous January 5, 1930 decree, in which the deadline for the complete collectivization of the Ukrainian SSR was set for the period from the end of 1931 to spring 1932, the authorities decided to accelerate the completion of the campaign in autumn 1930.  The high expectations of the plan were outperformed by local authorities even without the assistance of the 7,500 Twenty-Five Thousanders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1930.php|title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933. Збірник матеріалів і документів|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by March, 70.9% of arable land and 62.8% of peasant households were collectivized. The dekulakization plan also "over-performed". The first stage of delukakization lasted from second half of January until the beginning of March 1930. Such measures were applied to 309 out of 581 total districts of Ukrainian SSR, which accounted for 2,524,000 of 5,054,000 peasant households. As of March 10, 61,897 peasants households (2.5%) were ''dekulakized'', while in 1929, the percentage of dekulakized households was 1.4%.&lt;ref name=Problemy9&gt;Н. Бем, Ставлення україньского селянства до ликвидації куркульства як класу та суцільної колективізації сільського господарства (1930-1931 рр.) ([http://www.history.org.ua/zbirnyk/9/9.pdf pdf]), ''Проблеми Історіїї України факти, судження, пошуки'', [http://www.history.org.ua/zbirnyk/9/ №9], 2003, сс. 227-243, see p. 230-231&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the peasants and "weak elements" were arrested and deported "to the north". Many arrested ''kulaks'' and "well-to-do" farmers resettled their families to the [[Urals]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheatcroft and Davies&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''kulak'' was ultimately applied to anybody resisting collectivization as many of the so-called kulaks were no more well-off than other peasants.

The fast-track to collectivization incited numerous peasant revolts in Ukraine and in other parts of the Soviet Union. In response to the situation, ''Pravda'' published Stalin's article "Dizzy with success", which blamed overeager Party members and declared that "collective farms must not be established by force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1930/03/02.htm | title = Dizzy with success: Concerning questions of the collective-farm movement | author = Josef V.

Some of those dekulakized were declared to have been labeled mistakenly and received their property back, and some returned home. As a result, the collectivization process was rolled back. On May 1, 1933, 38.2% of Ukrainian SSR peasant households and 41.1% of arable land had been collectivized—by the end of August these numbers declined to 29.2% and 35.6% respectively.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A second forced-voluntary collectivization campaign was initiated in the winter of 1931, with significant assistance of the so-called tug-brigades composed of kolkhoz ''[[udarnik]]s''. Many kulaks, along with their families, were deported from the Ukrainian SSR.

According to declassified data, around 300,000 peasants in Ukraine were affected by these policies in 1930–1931. Ukrainians composed 15% of the total 1.8 million kulaks relocated Soviet-wide.&lt;ref name="DW490"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p.490&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in summer 1931, all further deportations were recommended to be administered only to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Ivnitskyy "Tragedy of Soviet Village"&lt;/ref&gt;

This second forced-voluntary collectivization campaign also caused a delay in sowing. During winter and spring 1930–1931, the Ukrainian agricultural authority ''Narkomzem'' issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock caused by poor treatment, the absence of [[forage]], stables, and farms, and "kulak sabotage".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

According to the [[first five-year plan]], Ukrainian agriculture was to switch from an exclusive orientation of grain to a more diverse output. This included not only an increase in [[sugar beet]] crops; other types of agricultural production were expected to be utilized by industry, including cotton, which was established in 1931. This plan anticipated a decrease in grain area and an increase of yield and area for other crops.

By July 1, 1931, 65.7% of Ukrainian SSR peasant households and 67.2% of arable land were reported as collectivized, while the main grain and sugar beet production areas were collectivized at levels of 80&amp;ndash;90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1931.php|title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933.

The decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party on August 2, 1931 clarified the all-over collectivization term—in order to be considered complete, the all-over collectivization did not have to reach 100%, but could not be less than 68-70% of peasants households and 75-80% of arable lands.  According to the same decree, all-over collectivization was accomplished in the following areas: Northern Caucasus (Kuban), with 88% of households and 92% of arable lands collectivized; Ukraine (South), with 85% and 94% respectively; Ukraine (Right Bank), with 69% and 80%; and Moldavian ASRR (part of Ukrainian SRR), with 68% and 75%.&lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Soviet Law for 1931. Moscow, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the beginning of October 1931, the collectivization of 68% of peasant households, and 72% of arable land was complete.&lt;ref name="UHJ2004-2"&gt;С.В.

[[File:plan1932UKRSSR.jpg|thumb|Article from a Soviet newspaper with the first version of a plan for grain collections in 1932 for [[kolkhoz]]es and peasants—5,831.3 thousand tons + [[sovkhoz]]es 475,034 tons]]
The plan for the state grain collection in the Ukrainian SSR adopted for 1931 was over-optimistic&amp;mdash;510 million [[pood]]s (8.4 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)|Tg]]). Drought, administrative distribution of the plan for kolkhozes, and  the lack of relevant general management destabilized the situation. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested.  A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (wet grain). The total [[winter sowing]] area shrunk by ~2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and wages awarded to kolhoz members.  Grain collection continued until May 1932, but reached only 90% of the planned amounts. By the end of December 1931, the collection plan was 79% accomplished. Many kolkhozes from December 1931 onwards suffered from lack of food, resulting in an increased number of deaths caused by malnutrition, which were registered by OGPU in some areas (Moldavian SSR as a whole and several central rayons of Vinnytsia, Kiev, and North-East rayons of Odessa oblasts)&lt;ref name="archives1932"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1932.php |title=Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів |publisher=Archives.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815104813/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1932.php# |archive-date=2012-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in winter, spring and early summer 1932. By 1932, the sowing campaign of the Ukrainian SSR was implemented with minimal drafht power, as most of the remaining horses were incapable of working, while the number of available agricultural tractors was too small to fill the gap.

The Government of the Ukrainian SSR tried to remedy the situation, but it had little success. Administrative and territorial reform (oblast creation) in February 1932 also added to the mismanagement.  As a result, Moscow had more details about the seed situation than the Ukrainian authorities. In May 1932, in an effort to change the situation, the central Soviet Government provided 7.1 million [[pood]]s of grain for food for Ukraine and dispatched an additional 700 agricultural tractors originally intended for other regions of the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

By July, the total amount of aid provided from Central Soviet Authorities for food, sowing and forage for the agricultural sector totaled more than 17 million poods.

Speculative prices of food in the cooperative network (5–10 times more compared to neighboring Soviet republics) brought significant peasant "travel for bread", while attempts to handle the situation had very limited success.  The quota on carried-on foods provision was lifted by Stalin (at [[Stanislav Kosior|Kosior]]'s request) at the end of May 1932. The July GPU reports for the first half of 1932 mentioned the "difficulties with food" in 127 out of 484 rayons and acknowledged the incompleteness of the information for the regions. The decree of Sovnarkom on "Kolkhoz Trade" issued in May fostered rumors amongst peasants that collectivization was rolled back again, as it had been in spring 1930. The number of peasants who abandoned kolkhozes significantly increased.

As a result, the government plans for the central grain collection in Ukraine was lowered by 18.1% compared to the 1931 plan. Collective farms were still expected to return 132,750 tons of grain, which had been provided in spring 1932 as aid.  The grain collection plan for July 1932 was adopted to collect 19.5 million [[pood]]s. The actual state of collection was disastrous, and by July 31, only 3 million poods (compared to 21 million in 1931) were collected. As of July 20, the harvested area was half the 1931 amount. The sovhozes had only sowed 16% of the defined area.

Beginning in July 1932, the Ukrainian SSR met with difficulty in supplying the planned amount of food to the rationing system (implemented in early 1928) to supply extensively growing urban areas with food.  This system almost became the sole source of food delivery to cities, while the alternatives, cooperative trade and black market trading, became too expensive and undersupplied to provide long-range assistance. By December 1932, due to faulty grain procurement, daily rationing for the rural population was limited to 100&amp;ndash;600&amp;nbsp;grams of bread, with some group of rural citizens completely withdrawn from the rationing supply.&lt;ref name="archives1933"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php |title=Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів |publisher=Archives.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109210644/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php# |archive-date=2017-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archives1932"/&gt;

This disparity between agricultural goals and actual production grew later in the year. An expected 190 thousand tons of grain were to be exported, but by August 27, 1932, only 20 thousand tons were ready. Taking into account the situation with the harvest at right bank Ukraine, Stalin lowered procurement plan for the Ukrainian SSR by 40 million poods at the end of August 1932.&lt;ref&gt;"Stalin and Kaganovitch. The letters". Moscow 2001  p.287&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 25, the plan for grain collection was lowered once again. Nevertheless, collection reached only 39% of the annually planned total.&lt;ref&gt;С. Кульчицький, Голодомор-33: сталінський задум та його виконання ([http://www.history.org.ua/Zbirnyk/15/10.pdf pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527222215/http://www.history.org.ua/Zbirnyk/15/10.pdf# |date=2008-05-27 }}), ''Проблеми Історіїї України факти, судження, пошуки'', №15, 2006, сс. 190-264&lt;/ref&gt; A second lowering of goals subtracted 70 million poods but still demanded plan completion and 100% efficiency.  Attempts to reach the new goals of production proved futile in late 1932. On November 29, in order to complete the plan, Ukraine was to collect 94 million poods, 4.8 million of them from sovkhozes. On January 2, targets were again lowered to 62.5 million poods. On January 14, the targets were lowered even further to 33.1 million.  At the same time, GPU of Ukraine reported hunger and starvation in the [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]] and [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] oblasts, and began implementing measures to remedy the situation. The total amount of grain collected by February 5 was only 255 million poods (compared to 440 million poods in 1931), while the numbers of "hunger and malnutrition cases" as registered by the GPU of Ukrainian SSR increased every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1932.php |title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933.

Whilst the long-lasting effect of overall collectivization had an adverse effect on agricultural output everywhere, Ukraine had long been the most agriculturally productive area, providing over 50% of exported grain and 25% of total production of grain in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1913. Over {{convert|228936|km2|acre}}, {{convert|207203|km2|acre}} were used for grain production, or 90.5% of total arable land. This degree of dependency on agriculture meant that the effects of a bad harvest could be almost unlimited. This had been long recognized, and while projections for agricultural production were adjusted, the shock of limited production could not be easily managed. While collections by the state were in turn limited, there were already clear stresses. The 1932 total Soviet harvest was to be 29.5 million tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=March 2008}} in state collections of grain out of 90.7 million tons in production. But the actual result was a disastrous 55–60 million tons in production.  The state ended up collecting only 18.5 million tons in grain.&lt;ref name="DW448"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;  The total Soviet collections by the state were virtually the same in 1930 and 1931 at about 22.8 million tons. For 1932, they had been reduced significantly to 18.5 million tons, with even lower figure in Ukraine. These were the total estimated outcomes of the grain harvests:&lt;ref name="DW448" /&gt;

=== Peasants' reaction ===
Another potential factor contributing to the situation in spring 1933 was that the peasants' "incentive to work disappeared" when they worked at "large collective farms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artukraine.com/famineart/jones4.htm |title=The Great Famine-Genocide in Soviet Ukraine (Holodomor) |publisher=Artukraine.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203120744/http://artukraine.com/famineart/jones4.htm# |archive-date=2009-02-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet archival data for 1930&amp;ndash;32 also support that conclusion. This is one of the factors for reducing the sowing area in 1932 and for significant losses during harvesting.&lt;ref name="Tauger2001"&gt;Mark B. Tauger, Natural Disaster and Human Actions in the Soviet Famine of 1931&amp;ndash;33,''The Carl Beck Papers in Russian &amp; East European Studies'', # 1506, 2001, {{ISSN|0889-275X}}, ([http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20Natural%20Disaster%20and%20Human%20Actions.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824073308/http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger%2C%20Natural%20Disaster%20and%20Human%20Actions.pdf |date=2012-08-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1932, 725,000 hectares of grain in areas of Ukrainian SRR affected by famine remained uncollected in spring 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів. [https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1932.php] Document number № 118&lt;/ref&gt;

A second significant factor was "the massacre of cattle by peasants not wishing to sacrifice their property for nothing to the collective farm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artukraine.com/famineart/jones4.htm# |title=The Great Famine-Genocide in Soviet Ukraine (Holodomor)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203120744/http://artukraine.com/famineart/jones4.htm# |archive-date=2009-02-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During winter and spring 1930–1931, the Ukrainian agricultural authority ''Narkomzem'' issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock and especially draft power caused by poor treatment, absence of [[forage]], stables, and farms, and "kulak sabotage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb7llDJvWIoC&amp;pg=PT130&amp;lpg=PT130&amp;dq=kulak+sabotage++Narkomzem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yu7siQgQyg&amp;sig=0FaZyDoqH_1Hgg3Fw_4wAHMqxzA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i_E7UZuTM8Hr0gHY7oG4CA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA

=== Legislation provisions ===
[[File:Lowsp.jpg|thumb|250px|Law "On the safekeeping of Socialist property" text 12 of August 1932]]
On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law, "On the Safekeeping of Socialist Property",&lt;ref name="TICirc"/&gt; that imposed penalties from a ten-year prison sentence up to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property.&lt;ref name="Potocki, p. 320"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Serczyk, p. 311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Gregorovich 1998"/&gt;  Stalin personally appended the stipulation: "People who encroach on socialist property should be considered [[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]."{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Within the first five months of passage of the law, 54,645 individuals had been imprisoned under it, and 2,110 sentenced to death. The initial wording of the decree, "On fought with speculation”, adopted August 22, 1932 led to common situations where minor acts such as bartering tobacco for bread were documented as punished by 5 years imprisonment. After 1934, by NKVD demand, the penalty for minor offenses was limited to a fine of 500 [[ruble]]s or three months of correctional labor.&lt;ref name="law.edu.ru"/&gt;

The scope of this law, colloquially dubbed the "[[Law of Spikelets|law of the wheat ears]]",&lt;ref name="TICirc" /&gt; included even the smallest appropriation of grain by peasants for personal use. In little over a month, the law was revised, as [[Politburo]] protocols revealed that secret decisions had later modified the original decree of September 16, 1932.  The Politburo approved a measure that specifically exempted small-scale theft of socialist property from the death penalty, declaring that "organizations and groupings destroying state, social, and co-operate property in an organized manner by fires, explosions and mass destruction of property shall be sentenced to execution without trial", and listed a number of cases in which "kulaks, former traders and other socially-alien persons" would be subject to the death penalty. "Working individual peasants and collective farmers" who stole kolkhoz property and grain should be sentenced to ten years; the death penalty should be imposed only for "systematic theft of grain, sugar beets, animals, etc."&lt;ref name="DW167_168_198_203"/&gt;

Soviet expectations for the 1932 grain crop were high because of Ukraine's bumper crop the previous year, which Soviet authorities believed were sustainable. When it became clear that the 1932 grain deliveries were not going to meet the expectations of the government, the decreased agricultural output was blamed on the kulaks, and later to agents and spies of foreign Intelligence Services&amp;mdash;"nationalists", "[[Symon Petlura|Petlurovites]]", and from 1937 on, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. According to a report by the head of the Supreme Court, by January 15, 1933, as many as 103,000 people (more than 14,000 in the Ukrainian SSR) had been sentenced under the provisions of the August 7 decree. Of the 79,000 whose sentences were known to the Supreme Court, 4,880 had been sentenced to death, 26,086 to ten years' imprisonment, and 48,094 to other sentences.&lt;ref name="DW167_168_198_203" /&gt;

On November 8, Molotov and Stalin issued an order stating "from today the dispatch of goods for the villages ''of all regions of Ukraine'' shall cease until kolkhozy and individual peasants begin to honestly and conscientiously fulfill their duty to the working class and the Red Army by delivering grain."&lt;ref name="DW174"/&gt;

On November 24, the Politburo instructed that all those sentenced to confinement of three years or more in Ukraine be deported to labor camps. It also simplified procedures for confirming death sentences in Ukraine. The Politburo also dispatched Balytsky to Ukraine for six months with the full powers of the OGPU.&lt;ref name="DW175"/&gt;

The existing practice of administrative punishment known as ''black board'' ([[blacklist]]) by the November, 18 Decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine was applied to a greater extent and with more harsh methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be underperforming in the grain collection procurement: "Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations."&lt;ref name="Rajca, p. 321"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grainmemo"/&gt; Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants who were not kolkhoz members and who were underperforming in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To "reach the grain procurement quota" amongst peasants, 1,100 brigades, consisting of activists (often from neighboring villages) which had accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it, were organized.

Since most of goods supplied to the rural areas were commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and sometimes obtained by villagers from neighbored cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained so for a long period. As an example mentioned in the December 6 ''Decree'', the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist only on October 17, 1933, when they completed their plan for grain collection early. Beginning in January 1933, the black list regime was softened when 100% of plan execution was no longer demanded. The December 6 ''Decree'' stated that the villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after reaching 88% and 70% plan completion respectively.&lt;ref name="archives1933"/&gt;

Measures were undertaken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was frequently done by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain, and was done regardless of whether the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves, or whether they had enough seed left to plant the next harvest.

=== Procurement practice ===
In 1928, a by contract policy of procurement (contracts for the delivery of agricultural products) was implemented for kolkhozes and ordinary peasants alike (kulaks had a "firm" plan for procurement). Accordingly, from 1928 through January 1933, "grain production areas" were required to submit 1/3 to 1/4 of their estimated yield, while areas designated as grain were required to submit no more than 1/8 of their estimated yield. However, between autumn 1930 and spring 1932, local authorities tended to collect products from kolkhozes in amounts greater than the minimum required, in order to exceed the contracted target, in some cases by more than 200%. Especially harmful methods utilized in the by contract policy were ''counter-plan'' actions, which were additional collection plans implemented in already fulfilled contracts. Such counter-plan measures were strictly forbidden after the Spring of 1933 as "extremely harmful for kolkhoz development."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 1932, a "1/4 of yield" procurement quota for "grain production areas" of the Ukrainian SSR was planned for implementation. On September 23, 1932, a telegram signed by [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] and Stalin noted that the harvest of 1932 was "satisfactory", according to estimates provided by the agricultural planning authorities, and therefore requests for seed for winter crops were refused, while total winter tillage acreage demands were increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1932.php|title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933. Збірник матеріалів і документів|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Stalin blamed the statistical and planning authorities for inaccurately estimating potential yields and thus a "Commissions for yield estimation" was created on December 17, 1932, by his order.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The 1932 harvest figures provided at the time were largely overestimated, and the actual difference between estimated and actual harvest was significant. Such unrealistic figures resulted in demand that was impossible to fulfill and greater grain procurement than was possible from late 1932 through February 5, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Кульчицький С.В., "До оцінки становища в сільському господарстві УСРР у 1931-1933 рр."

Kulchytskyy letter to the ''International Commission of Inquiry'' into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1932 grain procurement quota and the amount of grain actually collected were much smaller than those of any other year in the 1930s. In 1932, some 5.8 million tons of procured grain were returned to the rural sector, more than had been in 1930 or 1931.&lt;ref name="Tauger_SR1991"&gt;Mark B.

== Natural reasons ==
Drought has been mentioned as the major reason for the Holodomor by Soviet sources since 1983.&lt;ref name="Conquest"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]], [http://www.ditext.com/conquest/harvest.html ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine''] [[Oxford University Press]] New York (1986) {{ISBN|0-19-504054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A News Release Communique from the Soviet Embassy in [[Ottawa]] dated April 28, 1983; see also ''Harvest of Sorrow'' by Conquest, page 346.&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation has been modified by the Western historian Dr. Mark Tauger, who concluded that the famine was not fundamentally "man-made".&lt;ref name=Taugercollection&gt;See [http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/soviet.htm collection of papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207160956/http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/soviet.htm |date=February 7, 2006 }} by Mark D. Tauger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weathertheories"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, pp 51, 53, 61-63, 66, 68, 70, 73-76, 109, 119-23, 131, 231, 239, 260, 269, 271n, 400, 439, 458-9&lt;/ref&gt; He says that rustic plant disease, rather than drought, was the cause of the famine. The most that can be said of the contribution of human actions is that draft shortages, lack of labor, systemic economic problems, mismanagement, and peasant resistance exacerbated the crop failures already created by natural disasters.&lt;ref name="Tauger_SR1991"/&gt;

In 1932, extremely dry weather reduced crops in some regions, and unusually wet and humid weather in most others fostered unprecedented infestations. These conditions reduced the potential yield, as drought had in 1931. Drought, rain, and infestations destroyed at least 20% of the harvest, and this would have been sufficient on its own to cause serious food shortages or even famine. The historian Mark Tauger believes that if these factors had not developed in 1931 and 1932, agricultural production would have been considerably larger.

The drought was not as bad as that of the non-famine year of 1936, and the earlier drought was centered outside Ukraine, according to the leading Soviet authority on drought.&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Rudenko. ''Zasukhi v USSR'', see also ''Harvest of sorrow'', p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; The prime cause of the major crop failure of 1932–1933 was plant rust rather than drought. Nevertheless, there was a significant drought in 1931, which caused a considerable decrease in the harvest, while in 1936 the decrease in the harvest was not as catastrophic. Historian James Mace wrote that Mark Tauger's argument "is not taken seriously by either Russians or Ukrainians who have studied the topic."&lt;ref&gt;James Mace, [http://www.day.kiev.ua/261140/ Intellectual Europe on Ukrainian Genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105032311/http://www.day.kiev.ua/261140/|date=January 5, 2012}}, The Day, October 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Stephen Wheatcroft, author of ''The Years of Hunger'', claims Tauger's view represents the opposite extreme in arguing the famine was totally accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Wheatcroft, S. G. ''TOWARDS EXPLAINING SOVIET FAMINE OF 1931-3: POLITICAL AND NATURAL FACTORS IN PERSPECTIVE'', Food and Foodways, 2004, 12:2, 107—136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sovkhozes general fault of 1932 ===
After grain collection difficulties in 1927 and 1928, Stalin ordered the creation of state grain and meat enterprises&amp;mdash;[[sovkhoz]]es&amp;mdash;which according to his initial vision should deliver more than 100 million [[pood]]s of grain in 1932. However, in 1932 their production results were disastrous due to poor general and agricultural management and planning, despite the significant (as compared to [[kolkhoz]]es) amount of modern agricultural mechanisms (agricultural tractors, harvesters, etc.) employed.&lt;ref&gt;Development of the Ukrainian SRR Economy. Kiev-1949 Ukrainian Academy of Science publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for low output was that wheat was continually sown, beginning in 1929, on the same areas without fertilizers. Sovkhozes also suffered from a lack of manpower and infrastructure (roads, elevators etc.). Losses during harvesting were extremely high.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Soviet Agricultural Encyclopedia 2nd ed. (1939), Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, instead of the expected 290 millions of poods (more than 5 million tons) in 1932, sovkhozes produced 5 time less, while the situation with livestock was even worse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Soviet Agricultural Encyclopedia 1st ed. (1932-35), Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; As of 20 July 1932, sovhozes of the Ukrainian SRR had logged 16% of the defined sowing area.

=== Primitive agriculture ===
Another factor in the decline of the harvests was that the shortage of draft power for plowing and reaping was even more acute in 1932 than in the previous year.  The number of working horses declined from 19.5 million on July 1, 1931 to 16.2 million on July 1, 1932. The efforts to replace horses by tractors failed to compensate for this loss. In 1931, the total supply of tractors for agriculture amounted to {{convert|578000|hp|MW|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|393000|hp|MW|abbr=on}} produced at home and {{convert|578000|hp|MW|abbr=on}} imported. But in 1932, because of the foreign trade crisis and home producing establishing, no tractors were imported.&lt;ref name="DW111"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In the whole of 1932, tractors supplied {{convert|679000|hp|MW|abbr=on}} to agriculture, considerably less than in 1931. Only about half became available in time for the harvest, and even less in time for the spring sowing. Animal draft power deteriorated in quality. Horses were fed and maintained even more inadequately than in the previous year.&lt;ref name="DW111"/&gt; The acute shortage of horses led to the decision to employ cows as [[working animal]]s. According to the speech of one Soviet official at one of the most affected by famine region, the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]], "in 1932 we employ only 9000 cows, but in 1933 we involve at least 3/4 of their total number; 57000 employed at sowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Silgosp.php|title=З доповіді І. Гаврилова на сесії ВУЦВК|publisher=Archives.gov.ua|date=|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, the Lower Volga party bureau decided to use 200,000 cows for special field work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1355">'''Concubhair Mac Bruideadha''' ([[fl.]] 1636) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] poet and a man of letters.

A son of [[Maoilin Óg Mac Bruideadha]] (died 1602); both of their names occur frequently in the Inchiquin manuscripts, and were closely connected to the [[Earls of Thomond]] and their family.

Concubhair’s reputation as a man of letters was acknowledged in 1636, when his approbation and signature were sought by Brother [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]] for the [[Annals of the Four Masters]]. His signature reads: ''Mac Bruaideadha .i. Concobhar, mac Maoilin óicc, á Chill Caoidhe 7 ó Leitir Mhaoláin.''

{{wiktionary|connoisseur}}
A '''connoisseur''' ([[French language|French]] [[Reforms of French orthography|traditional]] (pre-1835) spelling of ''connaisseur'', from Middle-French ''connoistre'', then ''connaître'' meaning "to be acquainted with" or "to know somebody/something.") is a person who has a great deal of [[knowledge]] about the [[fine arts]], [[cuisine]]s, or an expert judge in matters of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]].  In many areas the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly [[irony|ironic]] sense, but in the [[art trade]] connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique, where documentary evidence of [[provenance]] is lacking.  The situation in the [[wine trade]] is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through [[wine tasting]].

==Connoisseurship in art==
"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined [...] as connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorynews.com/articles/1101_On_connoisseurship |title=On Connoisseurship| first=Bendor| last=Grosvenor |website=Arthistorynews.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connoisseurs evaluate works of [[art]] on the basis of their experience of the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique of artists. Judgment informed by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of [[empirical evidence]], refinement of [[perception]] about [[wikt:technique|technique]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to [[:wikt:attribute|attribute]] [[authorship]], validate [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the [[art valuation|valuation of works]], and can be collected and organized into a ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of the work of a single [[artist]] or a [[art school|school]].

In his ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (1955), [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains the difference between a connoisseur and an [[art historian]]: "The connoisseur might be defined as a [[laconic]] art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur."

The English dealer and art historian, [[Philip Mould]] says, "it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/moversshakers/qa-bbcs-art-sleuth-philip-mould/1469.article |title=Interview by Gabriella Griffith |publisher=Londonlovesbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Detective|first=Philip|last=Mould|date=2009|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague, [[Bendor Grosvenor]] takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment.&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"/&gt; [[Svetlana Alpers]] confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Alpers|Alpers, Svetlana]], "Style is What You Make It", p. 139, in ''The Concept of Style'', ed. Berel Lang, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 137-162, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hgiUuMCOmOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Concept+of+Style,+ed.+Berel+Lang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXY8Ue2pAcSS7Ab5q4HgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Concept%20of%20Style%2C%20ed.%20Berel%20Lang&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, [[Christie's]] Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.edu/ny_ma_modconnhist.html |title=Christie's MA course components |publisher=Christies.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers "the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists’ studios, conservation labs and museums."

===Earlier views of connoisseurship===
During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend [[critic]].

In 1760, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] said, "[[Painting]] is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour."

In 1890, [[Giovanni Morelli]] wrote, "art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art."

The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995).

==Connoisseurs in other fields==
Connoisseur is also used in the context of [[gastronomy]], i.e. in connection with fine [[food]], [[beer]], [[wine]], [[tea]] and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Connaisseur|"Connaisseur" in its original French]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/Connaisseur |title='Connaisseur' in the '&amp;#39;Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'&amp;#39;, 3rd meaning |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental globalization'''  refers to the internationally coordinated practices and regulations (often in the form of [[international treaties]]) regarding [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt; An example of environmental globalization would be the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]), establishing [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] and promoting [[sustainable management]] of [[tropical forests]]. Environmental globalization is usually supported by [[non-governmental organization]]s and governments of [[developed countries]], but opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.

==Definitions and characteristics==
[[Karl S. Zimmerer]] defined it as "the increased role of globally organized management institutions, knowledge systems and monitoring, and coordinated strategies aimed at resource, energy, and conservation issues."&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl S. Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdLK-UGj7YkC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Grainger]] in turn wrote that it can be understood as "an increasing spatial uniformity and contentedness in regular environmental management practices".&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

Environmental globalization is related to [[economic globalization]], as economic development on a global scale has environmental impacts on such scale, which is of concern to numerous organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenyonDunkerley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Benyon|author2=David Dunkerley|title=Globalization: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doB9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78240-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has environmental impacts, those impacts should not be confused with the concept of environmental globalization.&lt;ref name=Grainger&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/abstract|title=Environmental Globalization|last=Grainger|first=Alan|date=1 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470670590|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regards, environmental globalization is in direct opposition to economic globalization, particularly when the latter is described as encouraging trade, and the former, as promoting pro-environment initiatives that are an impediment to trade.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"/&gt; For that reason, an environmental activist might be opposed to economic globalization, but advocate environmental globalization.&lt;ref name="DobratzWaldner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betty Dobratz|author2=Lisa K Waldner|author3=Timothy Buzzell|title=Power, Politics, and Society: An Introduction to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoK9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34529-9|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grainger has discussed that environmental globalization in the context of international agreements on pro-environmental initiatives. According to him, precursors to modern environmental globalization can be found in the [[colonial era]] [[forestry|scientific forestry]] (research into how to create and restore forests).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

==Supporters and opponents==
According to Grainger, environmental globalization (in the form of pro-environmental international initiatives) is usually supported by various [[non-governmental organization]]s&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

== Biography ==
In an OpEd piece to the [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]], Frances Broaddus-Crutchfield discussed the best advice she'd ever been given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Broaddus-Crutchfield |first1=Frances |title=My Advice to You: Frances Broaddus-Crutchfield |url=https://www.richmond.com/news/local/central-virginia/goochland/goochland-gazette/opinion/my-advice-to-you-frances-broaddus-crutchfield/article_c836ee66-3f5a-11e8-b12f-1fd1a83975d4.html |website=Richmond Times-Dispatch |accessdate=14 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her extended family relationships, in the early 19th century, [[Edmund Ruffin]], a wealthy slaveholder and soil conservationist, experimented with earth rejuvenation on his farm along the [[Pamunkey River]] in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] "spreading a combination of clay and lime called [[marl]] on his fields."

Francis's son, Henry Broaddus, is the great-great-great grandson of Andrew Ruffin, the original owner of the land which is now the site of a new solar farm. Francis and Henry, partnering with SunEnergy1 of North Carolina, proposed a  222-acre solar facility on the family farm along U.S. 360 near the [[King William County]] line. Henry is a vice-president for strategic initiatives and public affairs at [[William and Mary College]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].

===Education===
Francis attended [[St. Catherine's School (Richmond, Virginia)|St. Catherine's School]] in Richmond. She holds a bachelor's degree from [[Salem College]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], and a master's in theater arts from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="RappahannockRecord20061012" /&gt;

===Meade Broaddus===
The farm was where her son Henry's father, Meade Broaddus, said his last goodbye. He was killed in a car accident in 1976, when Henry was five months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=For five years, Henry Broaddus has managed to stop millions of gallons of wastewater from flowing into the Pamunkey River.

===George Crutchfield===
She married George Crutchfield in 1995, and he shared Frances Broaddus-Crutchfield's charitable interests. In 2010 he supported her efforts as [[Powhatan County, Virginia|Powhatan]] Christmas Mother of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Editor |first1=Laura McFarland  News |title=Powhatan Christmas  Mother celebrates five decades |url=https://www.richmond.com/news/local/central-virginia/powhatan/powhatan-today/powhatan-christmas-mother-celebrates-five-decades/article_e712ef6e-d4b2-11e7-a522-b39103a9ad7d.html |accessdate=7 October 2018 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She made a large gift to [[VCU Medical Center|VCU Medical Center's]] Pauley Heart Center. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gift Celebrates Longtime Doctor-Patient Relationship – VCU Health Pauley Heart Center |url=https://vcuphc-thebeat.org/2014/01/gift-celebrates-longtime-doctor-patient-relationship/ |website=vcuphc-thebeat.org |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Broaddus-Crutchfield said that George Crutchfield, the Director of the [[VCU]] School of Mass Communications for many years, who died in March 2011, had already experienced two open heart surgeries by the time she met and married him. “Were it not for the doctors in the [VCU] Pauley Heart Center, most especially Dr. [Michael] Hess, I would not have had a second married life,” she said. 

Dr. Hess was the first president of the [[International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation]] (ISHLT), credited with starting the ISHLT at the annual meeting of the [[American Medical Association]] in 1981. “I would not have known him had they not been able to save him.” Before Crutchfield died, the family hosted a luncheon at [[VCU Medical Center]] Hospital to celebrate the long doctor-patient relationship. There she read a poem which she had written honoring Dr. Hess. The annual lecture series begun by her gift supports and advances education in heart failure.  

"[Dr. Crutchfield and I] were doctor, patient and friends for 34 years," said Dr. Hess, VCU Clinical Professor of Medicine and a noted heart failure and heart transplantation scholar. "[Dr. Crutchfield] was a brilliant man, who built one of the more distinguished schools of [[mass communications]] in the world." [Mrs. Crutchfield's] gift as a tribute to her husband combined medicine, cardiology, education, and communication, all of which were of importance to the life of Dr. Crutchfield. "I am delighted with this gift that will allow us to ensure the intellectual collaboration and stimulation of bringing the top experts in heart failure and heart transplantation to interact with our physicians," said Dr. Kenneth Ellenbogen, Chair of Cardiology Division, Pauley Heart Center.

'''Francisco de Montejo y Álvarez''' ({{IPA-es|fɾanˈθisko ðe mõnˈtexo|lang}}; c. 1479 in [[Salamanca]] &amp;ndash; c. 1553 in Spain) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].

[[File:Monumento_a_los_Montejo.jpg|right|250px|Francisco de Montejo y Alvarez]]

Francisco de Montejo was born in 1479 in Salamanca, Spain, to Juan de Montejo and Catalina Álvarez de Tejeda. He left Spain in 1514, and arrived in Cuba in time to join [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s expedition along the coast of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} There he had the rank of Captain, and command of 4 ships.  On his return to Cuba, he joined the [[Hernán Cortés]] expedition, and helped found the city of [[Veracruz (city)|Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz]] with [[Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero]].&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|54,95,102}} Cortés sent Francisco and Alonso as [[proctor]]s to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles]] of Spain in 1519 to report on the expedition.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|127–128}} While in Spain Montejo married Beatriz de Herrera.

In December 1526 the Spanish King, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], issued a royal decree naming Montejo Adelantado and Capitan General of Yucatán.  He returned to Yucatán in 1528, and attempted to conquer it along the east coast ([[Tulum]], [[Chetumal]]) but was driven back by the ferocity of the resistance of the Maya living along this coast. In 1530 he decided to try conquering Yucatán from the west, and began by pacifying what is today the modern Mexican state of Tabasco.  From 1531–1535 he tried unsuccessfully to conquer western Yucatán, with some successes but in 1535 his forces were driven from Yucatán.  In 1533, Montejo received a royal decree giving him permission to conquer [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]] and Naco in [[Honduras]]. This put him in conflict with [[Pedro de Alvarado]], who had received a similar decree in 1532.  This only became an issue after Alvarado declared he had conquered and pacified the province of Honduras in 1536.  Alvarado continued as Governor of Honduras until 1540, although he was recalled to Spain in 1537.

In 1540, the Spanish King awarded the Governorship of Honduras to Montejo, and he traveled to Gracias a Dios to install an administration loyal to him.

It would fall to Montejo's son, [[Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo)|Francisco de Montejo ("el Mozo")]] (born 1502, died 1565), to conquer Yucatán.  He founded the city of [[San Francisco de Campeche]] in 1540, and [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]] in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Holmes | first=Abiel | year=1829 | title=The annals of America: from the discovery by Columbus in the year 1492, to the year 1826, Volume 1 | page=71 |edition=2 | publisher=Hilliard and Brown |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbuiib5aj1YC&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1546, the elder Montejo assumed the title of Governor and Captain General of Yucatán.  However, by 1550 complaints about him caused him to be recalled to Spain where he died in 1553.

Montejo was survived by his eponymous son, and a daughter, Catalina Montejo y Herrera.

'''Gershon David Hundert''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} (b. 1946) is a noted [[Canadian]] historian of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Early Modern Polish Jewry]] and Leanor Segal Professor at [[McGill University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/history/gershon-hundert|title=Gershon Hundert|website=History and Classical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgill.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/jewishstudies/faculty/hundert|title=Gershon D. Hundert|website=Jewish Studies מדעי היהדות}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born to a Jewish family in Toronto, Gershon Hundert is one of the three sons of Charles and Norma Hundert and a third generation immigrant from Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Charles-Hundert/6000000015677912581|title=Charles Saul Hundert|website=geni_family_tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandparents arrived in Canada in the early 1910s from [[Obertyn]] (part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] before [[Second Partition of Poland|the Second Partition in 1792]], western Ukraine today) and maternal grandparents from [[Łódź]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Szmelke-Hundert/6000000020378665030|title=Szmelke Hundert|website=geni_family_tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Louis-Hundert/6000000015678331406|title=Louis Leibish Hundert|website=geni_family_tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hundert received his B.A. from [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies at Columbia University]] (1968) and M.A. from [[Ohio State University]] (1971), where he wrote a thesis on 18th-Century Hasidic Rabbi [[Abraham Kalisker]] under the supervision of [[Zvi Ankori]] (1920-2012), a specialist of Byzantine Karaites and a student of [[Salo Baron]].&lt;ref&gt;Gershon David Hundert, “Toward a Biography of R. Abraham Kalisker,” (Master Thesis, Ohio State University, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ankori, Hundert returned to Columbia to pursue a doctorate degree in history. He primarily studied with {{ill|Andrzej Kaminski|pl|Andrzej Sulima Kamiński}} (b. 1935), political and diplomatic historian of early modern Poland-Lithuania, and completed his dissertation in 1978 titled “Security and Dependence: Perspectives on Seventeenth-century Polish-Jewish Society Gained Through a Study of Jewish Merchants in Little Poland.”&lt;ref&gt;Gershon David Hundert, “Security and Dependence: Perspectives on Seventeenth-century Polish-Jewish Society Gained Through a Study of Jewish Merchants in Little Poland,” (PhD. Diss., Columbia University, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also deeply influenced and mentored by Israel historian {{ill|Jacob Goldberg|de}} (1924-2011), the pioneer scholar of Polish-Jewish relations.&lt;ref&gt;For Hundert’s three teachers, see Gershon David Hundert, “Security and Dependence,” xxvi-xxvii, and Gershon David Hundert, ''The Jews in a Polish Private Town: The Case of Opatów in the Eighteenth Century'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1975, Hundert came back to Canada and taught at [[McGill University]] ever since.

==Scholarly Contributions==
Succeeding {{ill|Raphael Mahler|pl}} and {{ill|Ignacy Schipper|de}}, Gershon Hundert represents the postwar-born generation of premodern Polish Jewish historians and, along with {{ill|Moshe Rosman|pl}} and {{ill|Ada Rapoport-Albert|he|עדה_רפפורט-אלברט}}, establishes “a new era of the historiography of Polish Jewry.” &lt;ref&gt;Gershon Bacon, Review of ''The Jews in a Polish Private Town: The Case of Opatów in the Eighteenth Century'', by Gershon David Hundert, The Jewish Quarterly Review 86, No. 3/4 (Jan. - Apr., 1996): 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first monograph, ''The Jews in a Polish Private Town'' (1992), studies social and economic history of [[Opatów]] Jewry in the eighteenth century, exemplifying Jewish autonomy and identity and their crucial commercial roles in the later period of the Commonwealth. The work also sheds new light on Polish local history and Jewish microhistory. 

His more renowned second monograph, ''Jews in Poland-Lithuania in the Eighteenth Century'' (2004), is an essential revisionist work in early modern European Jewish historiography. It examines the life of the understudied, but extremely important, East Central European Jewry -- world's largest Jewish community at the time, and argues for their ''mentalité'' of chosenness and their particularities on the path towards modernity. 

Another achievement is the groundbreaking ''The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe'' published in 2008. 450 leading scholars from the world have contributed to this decade-long project, of which Hundert served as the editor-in-chief. The work includes more than 1,800 entries and covers all aspects of Eastern European Jewish experiences from the Middle Ages to the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/about.aspx|title=YIVO - Preface to the Print Edition|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The searchable version of the encyclopedia was launched in 2010. 

Besides, he edited an essay collection on the development of scholarship on Hasidism in 1991 and co-compiled a bibliography on Eastern European Jewish historiography in 1984.

'''''Het Notite Boeck der Christelyckes kercke op de Manner of Philips Burgh'''''&lt;ref&gt;''Notitie Boeck'' would be the proper old Dutch spelling, also a bit strange is the use of the English word ''of'' (in Dutch ''van''), which is clearly not the Dutch word ''of'' which means ''or'' in English &lt;/ref&gt; is a rare surviving record book of the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].&lt;ref name="notite"&gt;Reproduced as: {{cite book

[[Abraham de Revier Sr.]] evidently kept a private memorandum book that is now lost to history, which was heavily drawn upon in 1715 by [[Dirck Storm]] to compose the church's history. The Old Dutch Church's book of records is one of the most important books in early American history—chronicling Dutch Colonial American village life in the English-occupied [[Province of New York]].

The book is divided into five "books" or divisions:
*First Division: Dirck Storm's Brief History of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow. 
*Second Division: Members Registrar, 1697–1775
*Third Division: List of Elders and Deacons, 1697–1776, 1790
*Fourth Division: Baptisms, 1697–{{circa|1778}}, 1791
*Fifth Division: Marriages, 1697–1790

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1660">'''Joachim Bruel''' (''Brulius'') was a theologian and historian, born early in the seventeenth century at [[Forest, Belgium|Vorst]], a village of the [[province of Brabant]], [[Belgium]], died June 29, 1653. After entering the order to assist in the establishment of [[Augustinian]]s he was sent to [[Bourges]], France, to finish his studies in philosophy and theology. At Bourges he received the degree of Master in Sacred Theology. In 1638 he was chosen prior of the convent of his order at [[Cologne]]. Twice afterwards (1640 and 1649) he filled the office of prior provincial. He is of special interest to the student of Peruvian and Chinese missions.

Among his published works are:

*''Historiae Peruanae Ordinis Eremitarum S.P. Augustini: Libri octodecim''. This work follows the Spanish ''Cronica moralizada del Orden de San Augustin en el Peru'', published by Fra [[Antonio de la Calancha]], Barcelona, 1638; continued by Fra [[Diego de Cordova]], and printed at Lima, 1653. Bruel's Latin version was printed at Antwerp, 1651.
*He made also a Latin translation of Mendoza's monumental history of China, ''Rerum Morumque in Regno Chinensi'' etc.

'''KONARE''' or '''Komiteti Nacional Revolucionar''' (Revolutionary National Committee) was a left-wing revolutionary committee of the [[Albanians|Albanian]] political ''[[émigré]]'' in Europe, from 1925 till mid-30s. Its central political figure was Bishop [[Fan Noli]].

After the [[June Revolution]], [[Ahmet Zogu]] and his supporters managed to overthrow Noli's government, making also use of the financials and military support from [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]]. Most of the former democratic opposition fled to Italy, settling later in the western Europe, mainly in [[Vienna]]. Two organizations were formed there; KONARE and "Bashkimi Kombëtar" (National Union). The second consisted of patriotic-democratic anti-Zogist figures, while KONARE comprised also strong left-wing ideology. Beside being the main anti-Zogist opposition during 1925–30,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pano|1992|loc= p.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; it showed was anti-[[feudalism|feudal]], [[anti-imperialist]], and pro-Soviet nuances.&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt; KONARE managed to retrieve financial support by the [[COMINTERN]] with the intermediation of [[Kosta Boshnjaku]], one of the first Communist emissaries deployed by the soviets in Albania with the task of establishing communist cells, and possibly a Communist Party. In addition to young revolutionary activists, KONARE also attracted the members of the [[irredentism|irredentist]] [[Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo|Committee of Kosovo]], who were the sworn enemies of Ahmet Zogu and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vllamasi|Verli|2000|loc="Një pjesë me rëndësi e emigrantëve, me inisiativën dhe ndërmjetësinë e Koço Boshnjakut, u muarrën vesh me “Cominternin”, si grup, me emër “KONARE” (Komiteti Revolucionar Kombëtar), për t’u ndihmuar pa kusht gjatë aktivitetit të tyre nacional, ashtu siç janë ndihmuar edhe kombet e tjerë të vegjël, që ndodheshin nën zgjedhë të imperialistëve, për liri e për pavarësi. Përveç kësaj pjese, edhe emigrantët kosovarë irredentistë, të grupuar e të organizuar nën emrin “Komiteti i Kosovës”, si grup, u ndihmuan edhe ata nga "Cominterni"."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noli and Boshnjaku managed to procure some financial support for the Committee through Comintern, affiliating them with the [[Balkan Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Banac|1988|loc= p.306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;According to [[Sejfi Vllamasi]]'s memoirs, the founder of KONARE beside Fan Noli were: [[Qazim Koculi]], [[Mustafa Kruja]], [[Riza Dani]], and [[Xhevat Korça]] from the former "Krahu Kombëtar" political fraction of the [[Albanian Parliament]], other civilians and officers as [[Kol Tromara]], [[Qazim Kokoshi]], Llano Borshi, [[Major]] [[Shefqet Korça]], captains [[Aziz Çami]] and [[Riza Cerova]]; and most of the youth members of "Bashkimi" (The Union) - a former political group founded by [[Avni Rustemi]], such as [[Halim Xhelo]], [[Sejfulla Malëshova]], [[Llazar Fundo]], Qamil Çela, Demir Godelli, Selim Shpuza, [[Haki Stërmilli]], Reshat Këlliçi, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vllamasi|Verli|2000|loc="Ata që muarrën pjesë në “Konare” prej opozitës së vjetër qenë: Fan Noli, Qazim Koculi, Mustafa Kruja, Riza Dani e Xhevat Korça; nga anëtarët e ish- Krahut Kombëtar, civilë e oficerë: Kol Tromara, Qazim Kokoshi, Llano Borshi, major Shefqet Korça, kapitenët Ariz Çami e Riza Cerova; shumica dërrmuese e rinisë, që kanë qënë anëtarë të shoqërisë “Bashkimi”, si: Halim Xhelo, Sejfulla Malëshova, Llazar Fundo, Qamil Çela, Demir Godelli, Selim Shpuza, Haki Stërmilli, Reshat Këlliçi etj."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;The main press organ of KONARE was ''Liria Kombëtare'' (National Freedom). Early revolutionary figures like Halim Xhelo and Riza Cerova would crystallize their political persona through this newspaper.&lt;ref name="Ersoy 2010 loc= p.155"&gt;{{harvnb|Ersoy|2010|loc= p.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1927,&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt; KONARE changed the name to ''Komiteti i Çlirimit Kombëtar'' (National Liberation Committee). By 1928, it came [[de facto]] under the control of Comintern; 24 young Albanians were sent to [[Moscow]] to follow their studies in high-end Soviet institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer|1999|loc= p.122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the efforts, the committee did not pose any real threats to Zogu's regime, who from his side was elected [[President of Albania]] in 1925 (thus ending the era of the [[Principality of Albania]]), while on 1 September 1928 became Zog I, King of Albania, establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Ersoy 2010 loc= p.155"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Disappointed by the political overturns, Noli decided to retire from political life and move back to the [[US]].&lt;ref name="Ersoy 2010 loc= p.155"/&gt; This would start the end of the committee, which would practically cease by mid 1930s. Many of its political figures moved into the parallel "National Union" organization which would continue to oppose the Zogu's regime in Albania, culminating with the [[Zog I of Albania#Assassination attempts|assassination attempt of 1931]].

{{nihongo|'''Kitabatake Chikafusa'''|北畠 親房||March 8, 1293 – June 1, 1354}}&lt;ref&gt;Paul Varley. (1995).   "Kitabatake Chikafusa", ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Japanese [[kuge|court noble]] and writer of the 14th century who supported the Southern Court in the [[Nanboku-cho]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Seiichi ''et al.'' (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NBlDYE38ODYC ''Dictionnaire historique du Japon''], p. 1553.  {{ISBN|2-7068-1632-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sansom2&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |title=A History of Japan, 1334–1615 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1961 |ISBN=0804705259 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;   serving as advisor to five [[Emperor of Japan|Emperors]].&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|67–68}} Some of his greatest and most famous work was performed during the reign of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]], under whom he proposed a series of reforms, amounting to a revival or restoration of political and economic systems of several centuries earlier. In addition to authoring a history of Japan and a number of works defending the right of Go-Daigo's line to the throne, Kitabatake fought in defense of the Southern Court as a member of the Murakami branch of the [[Minamoto clan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon. (1962). ''Sovereign and Subject,'' pp. 139–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitabatake, in his writings, held a strong distaste for the [[Ashikaga clan]], the ruling family at the time who held the position of Shogun and maintained a rival Imperial court known as the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Court]]. This disdain came not only because they were warriors rather than nobles, who were clumsy and uncouth at Court, but because they were of a less distinguished branch of the famous Minamoto clan than Kitabatake's own Murakami branch. In particular, he disliked [[Ashikaga Takauji]], the first Ashikaga shogun, who had originally supported Go-Daigo's claim to the Throne, but who ultimately headed the Northern Court and sought to destroy all who supported the Emperor's Southern Court.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

Kitabatake also wrote of [[Nitta Yoshisada]], one of the greatest military supporters of Go-Daigo, in a bad light. He saw Nitta as a warrior, little different from the Shoguns, but also accused him of never being available when the Emperor called upon him. Had Nitta been more available in the south of the country, instead of fighting his own battles in the north, Kitabatake claims, Nitta could have prevented the death of [[Kitabatake Akiie]], Chikafusa's son.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|65}}

When Go-Daigo died in 1339, Chikafusa was under siege in his stronghold in [[Hitachi Province]]. He sent copies of his major works to the new emperor, twelve-year-old [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], advising him and his advisors.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|67}} Though he is most well known for his writings and his role as Imperial advisor, Kitabatake was also a competent commander in battle, and held off the superior forces of the shogunate on many occasions. The [[siege of Hitachi]] lasted four years, and though his fortress ultimately fell to the supporters of the shogunate, Kitabatake escaped to Yoshino, the capital of the Southern Court, where he advised the Emperor until his own death in 1354.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|69,84,87–88,97}}

Chikafusa is considered one of the greatest men of his time, along with his rival [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|97–98,102–106}} Though his works are heavily colored by his personal bias and political motives, they are some of the most detailed accounts available on the history of Japan's feudal government and Imperial line.

==Works==
In his writings on the legitimate imperial lineage, Kitabatake delved into the subject of land ownership. In one document he denounces the Provincial [[Shugo]] and [[Jitō]] (Constables and Stewards) as land-hungry, and writes that the creation of this system in 1190 altered the traditional state of the country, and caused it to lose the art of government.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|23}}

Though the full details of his ideas for reform are unknown, it is likely that Kitabatake sought a return to the governmental structures set down during the [[Taihō (era)|Taihō Era]], in 702, before the rise of feudalism and military rule. He recognized that certain privileges gained by the ''bushi'' (great warrior families) and ''[[kuge]]'' (Court nobility) in that time would not be relinquished, but he did seek to abolish the systems of land tenure and tax collection that supported the power of the ''bushi''. Kitabatake viewed the ''bushi'', and by extension the ''bakufu'' ([[Ashikaga shogunate|shogunate]]), the military government, as enemies of the [[Emperor of Japan|throne]].&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|23}}

In 1339, he wrote ''[[Jinnō Shōtōki]]'', which related the history of Japan through analysis of the Imperial reigns, from the earliest legendary semi-mythical emperors down to Daigō II and his successor Murakami II. It was intended largely as a guide to the young Murakami, and as a treatise defending the Southern Court's legitimacy. It was largely written on the road, and recompiled and edited in 1343.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

One of the issues it addressed was the chaotic and unbalanced distribution of land, which he blamed on the government. But he also blamed the government officials and feudal lords who claimed the land. He wrote that seeking rewards was not part of proper behavior, and that it was a warrior's place to give up land and even his life for duty. He also claimed that the chaos of feudalism was derived, ultimately, from an unlimited number of people claiming a limited amount of land.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|30}}

Kitabatake's other major work, ''Shokugen-shō'', was also written in 1339, largely from memory, as the author, under siege in his home province, was unable to perform research at Court. It described the origins and organization of governmental offices and structures, as well as the author's opinions on the promotion and appointment of officials.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''Liberty Park''' is a {{convert|1|acre|m2|spell=in|adj=on}} [[Elevated park|elevated]] [[public park]] at the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], overlooking the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]]. It is located above the [[Vehicular Security Center]] and opened on June 29, 2016. The [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church|St. Nicholas National Shrine]] is located within the park, as well as ''[[The Sphere]]'', the iconic sculpture salvaged from the [[World Trade Center site]]. Another statue, ''[[America's Response Monument]]'', is also located in the park.

==History==
Construction began in 2013 when the [[Vehicular Security Center]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.archdaily.com/452163/elevated-park-planned-for-world-trade-center/|title=Elevated Park Planned for World Trade Center|last=Rosenfield|first=Karissa|date=November 26, 2013|work=ArchDaily|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Park is located on top of the Vehicular Security Center, the latter of which protects the site against unauthorized vehicles.

==Description==
[[File:Liberty Park Sep 2018 25.jpg|left|thumb|The sapling from the Anne Frank tree]]
The park has a capacity of 750 people and is the roof of the Vehicular Security Center. A "living wall", measuring {{Convert|336|ft|m}} long and {{Convert|20|ft|m}} tall, is located on the park's northern [[facade]] adjoining Liberty Street.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2016" /&gt; It contains 826 panels, upon which are attached "periwinkle, Japanese spurge, winter creeper, sedge and Baltic ivy",&lt;ref name="tribecacitizen" /&gt; A walkway from the pedestrian bridge curves along the park. Egresses include three stairways, the pedestrian bridge, and a straight ramp down to [[Greenwich Street]]. One of these stairs, a wide staircase is located on the east side of the park, between Greenwich Street to the east and the back of the church to the west. There are wood benches and a small [[amphitheater]]-like elevated space at the western end of the park, facing [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]]. Finally, there is a "continuous overlook" along much of Liberty Street in addition to "a gently curving balcony" at the church's foot.&lt;ref name="tribecacitizen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribecacitizen.com/2013/10/29/first-look-santiago-calatravas-design-for-st-nicholas-church/|title=First Look: Santiago Calatrava’s Design for St. Nicholas Church|date=October 29, 2013|work=Tribeca Citizen|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sapling from the [[Anne Frank tree]] is located alongside the ramp at the southeastern corner of Liberty Park.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/nyregion/touches-of-whimsy-at-world-trade-centers-liberty-park.html|title=Touches of Whimsy at World Trade Center’s Liberty Park|date=June 28, 2016|website=The New York Times|access-date=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[5 World Trade Center]] was originally planned to be built adjacent to the southern edge of the Vehicular Security Center and Liberty Park on the site of the former [[Deutsche Bank Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/ten-years-after-911-the-wounded-deutsche-bank-tower-vanishes/ |title=10 Years After 9/11, Deutsche Bank Tower Vanishes |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, the Port Authority does not plan to proceed with construction of a mixed-use skyscraper on the site until the rest of the complex is complete, which will be no earlier than 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/12/us-usa-sept11-land-idUSBRE88B00H20120912 |title=World Trade Center museum deal may lead to land sale: sources |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park overlooks the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] and has a connection to the [[West Street pedestrian bridges#Liberty Street Bridge|Liberty Street Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/wtc_getting_elevated_liberty_park_w.php|title=WTC Getting Elevated "Liberty Park" With View Of 9/11 Memorial|last=Fishbein|first=Rebecca|date=November 20, 2013|work=Gothamist|accessdate=April 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123191831/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/wtc_getting_elevated_liberty_park_w.php|archivedate=November 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church|St. Nicholas Church]], destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]], is being rebuilt in the park, with a new design by [[Santiago Calatrava]], who also designed the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub|Transportation Hub]].&lt;ref name="tribecacitizen" /&gt; The park, located {{convert|25|ft|m}} above [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]], is just a little more than {{convert|1|acre|m2|spell=in}} in area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/nyregion/elevated-park-at-trade-center-site-comes-into-view.html?_r=3&amp;|title=Elevated Park at Trade Center Site Comes Into View|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=November 20, 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of ''The Sphere''===
[[File:The Sphere in Liberty Park 2 vc.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Sphere]]'', November 2017]]
''[[The Sphere]]'', a large cast bronze sculpture by German artist [[Fritz Koenig]], had stood in  [[Austin J. Tobin]] Plaza between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers in [[Manhattan]].  Recovered from the rubble after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, intact but visibly damaged, ''The Sphere'' faced an uncertain future and was dismantled and stored. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), which owns ''The Sphere'', considered placing the sculpture in Liberty Park, which will be located between the 90 West Street building and the [[World Trade Center Memorial]] site. Construction on Liberty Park did not start until 2013, so a location was needed to place ''The Sphere'' until Liberty Park was completed. {{As of|February 2011}}, PANYNJ had not made an official final decision on where to place the sculpture once Battery Park construction commences, forcing the sculpture to move.

===St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church===
[[File:Liberty Park Sep 2018 20.jpg|thumb|left|The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church seen in September 2018]]
On July 23, 2008, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] reached a deal with the leaders of the [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]] for the Port Authority to acquire the {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} lot that the church had occupied, for $20 million, $10 million of which is coming from the Port Authority and the other $10 million of which is coming from [[JPMorgan Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25825608/ |title=Church surrenders ground zero lot |author=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="squareone"/&gt;

The Port Authority and the church announced a deal in July 2008 under which the Port Authority would grant land and up to $20 million to help rebuild it in a new location – in addition, the authority was willing to pay up to $40 million to construct a bomb-proof platform underneath.&lt;ref name="tentative"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/nyregion/24church.html |title=Agency in Tentative Accord With Ground Zero Church |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |publisher=The New York Times |date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the Port Authority stated it quit talking with the church and canceled building St. Nicholas altogether. The Port Authority claimed that the church was asking for too much, and that they might delay the whole World Trade Center project.&lt;ref name="squareone"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/nyregion/19church.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=Church Destroyed at Ground Zero Is Still at Square One |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archdioceses says that they just wanted the church back, and a third of the building would be a memorial for 9/11, and a place where people of all faiths could pray and remember those who died in the attacks.

Architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] was awarded the task of designing the new St. Nicholas. His plans drew inspiration from the great [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] churches of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Chora Church|Church of the Holy Savior in Chora]], both in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="nyt-byzant"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/nyregion/st-nicholas-church-destroyed-on-9-11-to-rebuild-with-byzantine-design.html?_r=0 |author=Dunlop, David  W. |title=Church Near Trade Center to Echo Landmarks of East |work=New York Times |date=October 13, 2013 |accessdate=August 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church will be constructed in Liberty Park; the site for the new church is east of the original site at 155 Cedar Street.&lt;ref name="nyt-rebuild"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/way-is-cleared-to-rebuild-greek-orthodox-church-lost-on-911/?scp=1&amp;sq=st.%20nicholas&amp;st=cse |title=Way Is Cleared to Rebuild Greek Orthodox Church Lost on 9/11 |first=David |last=Dunlap |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}}, construction of the new church was scheduled to begin in early 2014, and to end in late 2017.&lt;ref name="arch-shrine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese and Saint Nicholas Church Establish National Shrine at Ground Zero |url=http://www.goarch.org/news/stnicholas-nationalshrine-11132013 |publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |date=November 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213222825/http://www.goarch.org/news/stnicholas-nationalshrine-11132013 |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new church will be created from steel and concrete but the exterior will be clad in stone.

'''Library 2.0''' is a loosely defined model for a modernized form of [[library]] service that reflects a transition within the library world in the way that services are delivered to users. 
The focus is on user-centered change and participation in the creation of content and community.&lt;ref name=lj&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html|title=Library 2.0: service for the next generation library|date=1 September 2006|author1=Michael E. Casey |author2=Laura C. Savastinuk |journal=Library Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of Library 2.0 borrows from that of [[Business 2.0]] and [[Web 2.0]] and follows some of the same underlying philosophies. This includes online services like the use of [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]] systems and an increased flow of information from the user back to the library.

In Library 2.0, library services are constantly updated and reevaluated to best serve library users. Library 2.0 also attempts to harness the library user in the design and implementation of library services by encouraging feedback and participation. Proponents of this concept, sometimes referred to as [[Radical Trust]], expect that the Library 2.0 model for service will ultimately replace traditional, one-directional service offerings that have characterized libraries for centuries.

== Overview ==
The term "Library 2.0" was coined by Michael Casey on his blog LibraryCrunch as a direct start off of the terms Business 2.0 and Web 2.0. Casey suggested that libraries, especially [[public libraries]], are at a crossroads where many of the elements of Web 2.0 have applicable value within the library community, both in technology-driven services and in non-technology based services. In particular, he described the need for libraries to adopt a strategy for constant change while promoting a participatory role for library users.

Library 2.0 made its conference debut at Internet Librarian 2005 in October, 2005, when Michael Stephens of Saint Joseph County Public Library addressed the idea in relation to the typical library website.

A September 2006 article in ''Library Journal'' titled, "Library 2.0: Service for the next-generation library," begins by expressing the benefit of Library 2.0 to library administrators and taxpayers as providing "more efficient ways of delivering services to achieve greater returns on financial investments." The article continued by asserting that the much discussed Library 2.0 is important for librarians as it may radically change our customer service and interaction.&lt;ref name=lj /&gt;

With Library 2.0, library services are frequently evaluated and updated to meet the changing needs of library users.  Library 2.0 also calls for libraries to encourage user participation and feedback in the development and maintenance of library services.  The active and empowered library user is a significant component of Library 2.0. With information and ideas flowing in both directions – from the library to the user and from the user to the library – library services have the ability to evolve and improve on a constant and rapid basis. The user is participant, co-creator, builder and consultant – whether the product is virtual or physical.

An advantage in pursuing digital services is that the library can target more people - including those who may not have previously used the library service.&lt;ref name=lj/&gt;

A concern that Library 2.0 is trying to address is that potential users turn to [[Google]] and [[Wikipedia]] because they are "good enough", and perceive libraries to be slow and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P., (2005). [http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/miller/ Web 2.0: Building the New Library]. [[Ariadne (web magazine)|Ariadne]], No.45 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key principles ==

* [[Web browser|Browser]] + Web 2.0 Applications + Connectivity = Full-featured [[OPAC]]
* Harness the library user in both design and implementation of services
* Library users should be able to craft and modify library provided services
* Harvest and integrate ideas and products from peripheral fields into library service models
* Continue to examine and improve services and be willing to replace them at any time with newer and better services.

In 2009, Holmberg et al. identified 7 key principles for Library 2.0: "interactivity, users, participation, libraries and library
services, web and web 2.0, social aspects, and technology and tools", and offer the following definition for Library 2.0: "Library 2.0 is a change in interaction between users and libraries in a new culture of participation catalysed by social web technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, K., Huvila, I., Kronqvist-Berg, M. &amp; Widén-Wulff, G. (2009). [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/00220410910970294 What is Library 2.0?]. [[Journal of Documentation]], 65(4): 668-681.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Byrne argues that the use of Web 2.0 strategies in the library context changes the role of librarian into someone who can assist in supporting clients [[information literacy]] across the "largely unknown informational universe" rather than helping them navigate the library's own collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Alex|title=Web 2.0 strategy in libraries and information services|journal=The Australian Library Journal|date=November 2008|volume=57|issue=4|pages=365–376|doi=10.1080/00049670.2008.10722517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns and considerations ==

Some concerns about Library 2.0 relate to access to technology, privacy&lt;ref name=lj /&gt; and security.  For example, Casey and Savastinuk suggest allowing patrons to tag or blog anonymously.  In 2006, Steve Lawson, humanities liaison librarian, wrote a blog post entitled, "A Library 2.0 skeptic's reading list" that collected links to blogs which discuss these concerns.  Lawson says "I'm not anti-Library 2.0 ... I like to think of Library 2.0 as a continuing conversation about the future of libraries, and it makes sense to me to try to round up some voices that challenge Library 2.0 conventional wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is that the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies can allow users to spread [[hate speech]] and [[cyberbullying]] in the library system.  It is suggested that librarians define hate speech in their user content policies and identify it when it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southernlibrarianship.icaap.org/content/v09n02/brown-sica_m01.html#_edn1 Library 2.0 and the Problem of Hate Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

When using social networking through [[Facebook]] in a Swedish public library, librarians were described as 'always at the beck and call of Facebook', and capable of losing the relationships they'd built with their clients over the site due to glitches in Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlsson|first1=Hanna|title=Working with Facebook in Public Libraries: A Backstage Glimpse into the Library 2.0 Rhetoric|journal=Libri|date=January 2012|volume=62|issue=3|doi=10.1515/libri-2012-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online Public Access Catalog ==
{{main|Online public access catalog#Next-generation catalogs}}

Library 2.0 is a new way of providing library service through new Internet technologies, with emphasis on “user-centered” change and interaction.  Like Web 2.0, a full-featured Library 2.0 OPAC gets better the more that users are involved in the process of interacting with the catalog and sharing content.

Librarians have been working to retool library catalogs in order to make them more useful for patrons to find, organize, and interact with information in a way that has infinite potential for user customization.  These new types of catalogs are a shift from "isolated information silos" to "interlinked computing platforms." In the past the information flow was mostly one way, from library to user.  With new web tools information can be released to flow in every direction (library to user, user to library, library to library, and user to user).

[[Jessamyn West (librarian)|Jessamyn West]], on her librarian.net website, authored "What We Want: An OPAC Manifesto," which broke down the needs of library staff, geeks, and users in their OPAC.  These valuable suggestions inform librarians of the flexibility, customizability and plain language approach that is desired by users in their OPAC.  Librarians should be aware of these issues so that planning for improvement can begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jessamyn West|title= What We Want: An OPAC Manifesto|url=http://www.librarian.net/opac/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nishat Kazi recommends that the clients interest area should be recorded when they join the library, and when they login to their account on the OPAC, new items which match their interests should be displayed to them.  Kazi also recommends allowing clients to rank and review items in the OPAC, as well as giving other clients the opportunity to respond to these reviews.  [[Key words]] can also be added by clients in addition to key words added by the librarian to facilitate searching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kazi|first1=Nishat|title=Towards Serving User 2.0|journal=International Journal of Information Dissemination &amp; Technology|date=Jan–Mar 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=74–76|issn=2229-5984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial Intelligence and Participatory Library (Library 2.0) ==
In China a participatory library named Xiaotu was developed by Tsinghua University &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Fei|last2=Zhang|first2=Chengyu|last3=Chen|first3=Wu|date=2015-06-15|title=Smart talking robot Xiaotu: participatory library service based on artificial intelligence|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeraldinsight.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1108%2FLHT-02-2015-0010|journal=Library Hi Tech|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=245–260|doi=10.1108/lht-02-2015-0010|issn=0737-8831}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Xiaotu is an artificial intelligence library that allows users to interact with it by talking or chatting through a mobile app or social network. It provides real-time virtual reference service combining Tsinghua University Library  capabilities with social network and third-party resources. The system is composed by a self-learning function that receives updates from users as they find some missing or wrong information. Connected to the largest social network in China, it provides easy access and owns a book reading group accessed by Tsinghua University Students in China. Its knowledge base includes Wikipedia and its Chinese counterpart, content revised by professor of the university, frequent asked questions (FAQ) accumulated from university library and other third-party resources presented in the Chinese internet. Independent of the information quality concerns th of the information provided by this AI library, the concept of a “living” library teaching students in a user-friendly platform is operating, learning and teaching based of patterns learned or dictated.

== Debate ==

Library 2.0 has been a source of debate in the [[blogosphere]].  Some librarian bloggers have argued that these key principles are not new and have been part of the service philosophies of many library reformers since the 19th century.  Others are calling for more concrete examples of how libraries can get to Library 2.0.  [[Walt Crawford]], for example, argues that Library 2.0 comprises a combination of tools and attitudes which are excellent ideas and not new to librarianship, a few business- and tool-focused attitudes which will not serve all users and user communities, and incorrectly places libraries as the appropriate source for all users to gather all information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walt Crawford|year=2006|url=http://citesandinsights.info/civ6i2.pdf|title=Library 2.0 and 'Library 2.0'|journal=Cites and Insights|volume=6|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Library 2.0, such as Stephen Abram,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=S. Abram |author2=M. Casey |author3=J. Blyberg |author4=M. Stephens |year=2006 |url=http://www.sirsidynixinstitute.com/seminar_page.php?sid=56 |title=A SirsiDynix Institute Conversation: The 2.0 Meme - Web 2.0, Library 2.0, Librarian 2.0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311025746/http://www.sirsidynixinstitute.com/seminar_page.php?sid=56 |archivedate=2008-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Stephens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=M.

This includes the use of [[online social networks]] by libraries.

Library 4.0 has been proposed as including makerspaces, [[context-aware technology]], [[open source]], [[big data]], [[cloud service]]s, [[augmented reality]], state-of-the-art displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noh|first1=Younghee|title=Imagining Library 4.0: Creating a Model for Future Libraries|journal=[[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|date=November 2015|volume=41|issue=6|pages=786–797|doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2015.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrohistory''' seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European [[feudalism]] in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often "assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew C. Wells, Ph.D., ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110824015142/http://parallelism.org/13949-WELL-layout2.pdf Parallelism: A Handbook of Social Analysis]''. Archived August 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Examples of macro-historical analysis include [[Oswald Spengler]]'s assertion that the lifespan of [[civilization]]s is limited and ultimately they decay, and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations. The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] is considered by many historians to be of great macro-historical importance,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} as it marked the high water point of Mongol conquests, and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Mannheim''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmanhaɪm|-|Mannheim.ogg}}; [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]]: {{lang|pfl|Monnem}} or {{lang|pfl|Mannem}}) is a city in the southwestern part of [[Germany]], the third-largest in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] after [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]] with a 2015 population of approximately 305,000 inhabitants. The city is at the centre of the larger densely populated [[Rhine-Neckar|Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region]] which has a population of 2,400,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-r-n.com/start/investieren-und-wirtschaften/rhein-neckar-in-zahlen.html|title=Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar|publisher=M-r-n.com|accessdate=2014-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111001411/http://www.m-r-n.com/start/investieren-und-wirtschaften/rhein-neckar-in-zahlen.html|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[Metropolitan regions in Germany|Germany's eighth-largest metropolitan region]].

Mannheim is located at the confluence of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Neckar]] in the northwestern corner of Baden-Württemberg. The Rhine separates Mannheim from the city of [[Ludwigshafen]], just to the west of it in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and the border of Baden-Württemberg with [[Hesse]] is just to the north. Mannheim is downstream along the Neckar from the city of [[Heidelberg]].

Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to its nickname "die Quadratestadt" ("The City of Squares"). The eighteenth century [[Mannheim Palace]], former home of the [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]], now houses the [[University of Mannheim]].

The city's tourism slogan is "''Leben. Im Quadrat.''" (Life. Squared.). The civic symbol of Mannheim is ''der Wasserturm'', a Romanesque [[water tower]] completed in 1886 that rises to {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} above the highest point of the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] area ''Friedrichsplatz''. Mannheim is the starting and finishing point of the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Mannheim}}

===Early history===
The name of the city was first recorded as ''Mannenheim'' in a legal transaction in 766, surviving in a twelfth-century copy in the ''[[Lorsch codex|Codex Laureshamensis]]'' from [[Lorsch Abbey]]. The name is interpreted as "the home of Manno", a short form of a [[Germanic name]] such as ''Hartmann'' or ''Hermann''.&lt;ref&gt;Sonja Steiner-Welz, ''400 Jahre Stadt Mannheim (Dokumente zur Stadtgeschichte). Band 1: bis zur Kaiserzeit'', vol. 1, 2004, {{ISBN|978-3-936041-96-5}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Mannheim remained a mere village throughout the Middle Ages.

===Early Modern Age===
In 1606, [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]] started building the fortress of Friedrichsburg and the adjacent city centre with its grid of streets and avenues. On January 24, 1607, Frederick IV gave Mannheim the status of a "city", whether it really was one by then or not.

Mannheim was mostly levelled during the [[Thirty Years War]] around 1622 by the forces of [[Johan t'Serclaes, Count of Tilly|Johan Tilly]]. After being rebuilt, it was again severely damaged by the [[French Army]] in 1689 during the [[Nine Years' War]].

After the rebuilding of Mannheim that began in 1698, the capital of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] was moved from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720 when [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine]] began construction of Mannheim Palace and the [[Jesuit Church (Mannheim)|Jesuit Church]]; they were completed in 1760.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Mannheim 1758.jpg|thumb|180px|Mannheim in 1758]]
[[File:Stadtplan Mannheim 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Historical map of Mannheim in 1880]]
During the eighteenth century, Mannheim was the home of the "[[Mannheim School]]" of [[European classical music|classical music composers]]. Mannheim was said to have one of the best court orchestras in Europe under the leadership of the conductor [[Carlo Grua]]. The royal court of the Palatinate left Mannheim in 1778. Two decades later, in 1802, Mannheim was removed from the Palatinate and given to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].

In 1819, [[Norwich Duff]] wrote of Mannheim:
{{Quote box |quote = Mannheim is in the Duchy of Baden and situated at the confluence of the [[Rhine]] and [[Neckar]] over both of which there is a bridge of boats. This is the third town of this name having been twice burnt. The houses are large, and the streets broad and at right angles to each other, and is one of the most airy clean towns I have seen in Germany. It was formerly fortified, but the fortifications were razed in 1806 and gardens fill their places. There is a large [[château]] here belonging to the Grand Duke and a very good garden; part of the château was destroyed when the town was bombarded and has never since been repaired, the other part is occupied by the [[Stéphanie de Beauharnais|Grand Duchess, widow]] of the [[Karl, Grand Duke of Baden|late Grand Duke]] who was succeeded by [[Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden|his uncle]] having left only three daughters. She is the sister of [[Eugene Beauharnais]] [sic; in fact, she was his second cousin]. There is a cathedral, a theatre which is considered good, an observatory, a gallery of pictures at the château, and some private collections. About {{convert|2|km|mi|spell=on|abbr=off}} below the town the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] crossed the Rhine in 1813. Population 18,300.|align = center |width=750px |fontsize=90% |bgcolor = #e3e5e5 |quoted=1}}

In 1819, [[August von Kotzebue]] was assassinated in Mannheim.

The [[Year Without a Summer|climate crisis of 1816-17]] caused famine and the death of many horses in Mannheim. That year [[Karl Drais]] invented the first bicycle.

Infrastructure improvements included the establishment of [[Mannheim Harbour|Rhine Harbour]] in 1828 and construction of the [[Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basel railway|first Baden railway]], which opened from Mannheim to Heidelberg in 1840. Influenced by the economic rise of the middle class, another golden age of Mannheim gradually began. In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution of 1848]], the city was a centre for political and revolutionary activity.

In 1865, [[Friedrich Engelhorn]] founded the ''Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik'' (Baden Aniline and Soda Factory, [[BASF]]) in Mannheim, but the factory was constructed across the Rhine in Ludwigshafen because Mannheim residents feared [[air pollution]] from its operations. From this dye factory, BASF has developed into the largest chemical company in the world. After opening a workshop in Mannheim in 1871 and patenting engines from 1878, [[Karl Benz]] patented the first motor car in 1886. He was born in Mühlburg (now part of Karlsruhe).

===Early 20th century and World War I===
The [[List of Schütte-Lanz airships|Schütte-Lanz company]], founded by Karl Lanz and Johann Schütte in 1909, built 22 airships. The company's main competitor was the [[Zeppelin]] works.

When World War I broke out in 1914, Mannheim's industrial plants played a key role in Germany's war economy. This contributed to the fact that, on 27 May 1915, Ludwigshafen was the world's first civilian settlement behind the battle lines to be bombed from the air. French aircraft attacked the BASF plants, thereby killing twelve people. The precedent was set for this attack by Germany's repeated air raids against British civilian populations throughout southeastern Britain during the first half of 1915.

When Germany lost the war in 1918, according to the peace terms, the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by French troops. The French occupation lasted until 1930, and some of Ludwigshafen's most elegant houses were erected for the officers of the French garrison.

===Inter-war period===
After the First World War, the Heinrich Lanz Company built the Bulldog, an advanced tractor, powered by heavy oil. As a result of the invention of the pre-combustion chamber by [[Prosper L'Orange]], [[Benz &amp; Cie.]] developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at its motor works in Mannheim in 1923. In 1922, the ''Grosskraftwerk Mannheim'' (Mannheim large power station) was opened. By 1930, the city, along with its sister city of Ludwigshafen, which had developed out of the old Mannheim Rheinschanze, had a population of 385,000.

===World War II===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-053-59, Mannheim, US-Truppen im Straßenkampf.jpg|thumb|US troops in street fighting in Mannheim, 1945]]

During the [[Third Reich]], at least 2,262 of Mannheim's Jews were [[The Holocaust|despatched for extermination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mannheim.de/tourismus-entdecken/peter-kurz-gedenken-heute Peter Kurz: Gedenken heute] on Mannheim.de: ''"Bislang 2 262 Namen nennt die Liste der Mannheimer jüdischen Opfer, und sie ist noch nicht als vollständig anzusehen."''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bombing of Mannheim in World War II|Air raids on Mannheim]] almost completely destroyed the city during the Second World War. Since Mannheim was an important industrial centre for [[Nazi Germany]], Mannheim was heavily damaged during [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] by the [[Royal Air Force|R.A.F.]] and the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|U.S. Air Force]]. In addition to bombing the important factories, the R.A.F. razed the city center of Mannheim with nighttime [[area bombing]]. Some sources state that the first deliberate "[[terror bombing]]" of the war occurred at Mannheim on December 16, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8J2-kzMxbKYC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;dq=%22Germany+and+the+Second+World+War%22+%22deliberate+terror%22+Mannheim |title=Germany and the Second World War |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2001-11-15|accessdate=2011-04-07|isbn=978-0-19-822888-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Mannheim in late March 1945, which was potentially well-defended by German forces, however, they suddenly abandoned the city and the U.S. [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th Infantry Division]] entered unopposed on 29 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a large American military presence in the Mannheim area ever since (see ''United States military installations'' below).

===1950s to 1980s===
[[File:Wasserturm Mannheim.jpg|thumb|right|The Wasserturm Garden]]
[[File:Victoria-Turm in Mannheim.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria Tower (''Victoria-Turm'')]]
Rebuilding of the city began laboriously. [[Mannheim Palace]] and the [[Mannheim water tower|water tower]] (''Wasserturm'') eventually were rebuilt and the [[National Theatre Mannheim|National Theatre]] was replaced by a new building at a new location. At the old location there is a monument to [[Friedrich Schiller]] and the ''Zum Zwischen-Akt'' pub. The housing shortage led to the development of many new residential areas.

In 1964, the City Hospital (''Städtische Krankenhaus'') became part of the [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Medicine in Mannheim|Neckar Faculty of Heidelberg University for Clinical Medicine in Mannheim]]. In 1967, the [[University of Mannheim]] was established in the city.

In 1975, the [[Bundesgartenschau]] (Federal horticulture show) was celebrated in [[Luisenpark|Luisen]] and Herzogenried parks. A number of pieces of infrastructure were developed for the show: the [[Fernmeldeturm Mannheim|telecommunications tower]] and a [[Kurt-Schumacher Bridge (Mannheim)|second bridge]] across the Rhine were built, the pedestrian zone was established, the new Rosengarten conference centre was opened and the [[Aerobus]] was installed as a temporary transport system.

A number of major projects were completed in the 1980s and 1990s: a planetarium, an extension to the art gallery, the new Reiß Museum, Stadthaus, a new [[Mannheim May Market|May Market]] ground, synagogue, mosque, [[Technoseum|State Museum for Technology and Work]], [[Carl-Benz-Stadion|Carl-Benz stadium]] and the Fahrlach tunnel were opened.

Mannheim has lost many industrial jobs, although in the recent past the city was economically dominated by manufacturing. The city tried in the past to prevent the establishment of service providers by designating some locations as industrial areas. A prime example of the current trend is the construction of the Victoria Tower (Victoria-Turm) in 2001, one of the tallest buildings in the city, on railway land.

===Post-reunification===
Mannheim celebrated its 400th anniversary with a series of cultural and other events throughout 2007. The 400th anniversary proper was in 2006, since [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]] laid the foundations of Mannheim citadel on 17 March 1606. In preparation for the anniversary, some urban activities were implemented, beginning in 2000: the building of the [[SAP Arena]] with access to the city's new eastern ring road, the rehabilitation of the pedestrian zone in Breite Straße, the arsenal and the palace, the complete transformation of the old fair ground, and the new Schafweide tram line. The concept of the anniversary of the city aimed at a diverse range of events without a dominant central event.

==Inventions==
Some important inventions were made in Mannheim.
* [[Karl Drais]] built the first two-wheeled ''[[draisine]]'' in 1817.
* [[Karl Benz]] drove the first automobile on the streets of Mannheim in 1886. At his workshop in Mannheim he produced a lightweight [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|three-wheeled vehicle]] powered by a single cylinder [[gasoline|petrol/gasoline]]-fueled [[internal combustion engine|engine]], first shown in public during 1886. This powered tricycle subsequently came to be widely regarded as the first [[automobile|automobile/motor car]] powered by an internal-combustion engine. Karl's wife [[Bertha Benz]] undertook the world's first [[road trip]] by automobile from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] in August 1888.
* The Lanz Bulldog, a popular tractor with a rugged, simple Diesel engine was introduced in 1921.
* Karl Benz developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at the [[Benz &amp; Cie.]] motor works in Mannheim during 1923
* [[Julius Hatry]] built the world's first rocket plane in 1929.

[[File:Gemeinderat-Mannheim-2009.png|thumb|City council in 2009]]

===City council===
The council has 48 seats and is elected by direct suffrage for five years. In the local elections in Baden-Württemberg, voters are allowed to take advantage of [[cumulative voting]] and [[Panachage|vote splitting]]. Since the Second World War the SPD, except in the elections of 1999 and 2004, has received more votes than the CDU. The next municipal election will take place in 2019.

The outcome of the local elections of 25 May 2014 and the current members of the council is as follows:

==Theatre==
The [[National Theatre Mannheim]] was founded in 1779 and is the oldest "Stage" in Germany. In 1782 the premier of ''Die Räuber'', written by [[Friedrich Schiller]], was shown.

Recently, more smaller stages have opened, such as the Oststadt-Theater, the TIG7 (Theater im Quadrat G7), the Theater Oliv, the Freilichtbühne, the Theater31, the Theater ImPuls, the Theater Felina-Areal, the Mannheimer Puppenspiele, the Kleinkunstbühne Klapsmühl', Schatzkistl, and [[zeitraumexit]].

==Education==
The [[University of Mannheim]] is one of Germany's younger universities. Although founded in 1967, it has its origins in the 1763-established Palatine Academy of Sciences and the former Handelshochschule. Situated in [[Mannheim Palace]], it is Germany's leading university in business and economics and attracts students from around the world. Described by [[Die Zeit|"Die Zeit" magazine]] as the 'Harvard of Germany' it is seen as the alma mater of German businessmen and women.

[[File:SchlossMannheim-Pano-130616.jpg|700 px|thumb|center|The University of Mannheim's main campus – the Palace in a 180-degree panoramic view]]

The university town also houses one of the medical schools of [[Heidelberg University]], the [[Hochschule Mannheim]], a branch of the [[Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University|Duale Hochschule of the State of Baden-Württemberg]] and several musical and theatrical academies, including the Pop Academy Mannheim, the Musikhochschule and the Theaterakademie. These institutions draw a large and diverse student body.

Mannheim is located in Germany's warmest summer region, the "[[Upper Rhine Plain|Rhine shift]]". In summer, temperatures sometimes rise up to {{convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on}} and higher. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|39.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} on August 7, 2015. The daily lows during heat waves can be very high by north European standards (around {{convert|25|°C|0|disp=x| / |abbr=on}}). In comparison to other regions of Germany, Mannheim has a higher humidity in summer which causes a higher heat index. Snow is rare, even in the cold months. Precipitation occurs mostly during afternoon thunderstorms during the warmer period (average days of thunderstorms in a year is 40–50). Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Köppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]" (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=82701&amp;cityname=Mannheim%2C+Baden-W%FCrttemberg%2C+Germany&amp;units=|title=Mannheim, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|work=Weatherbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
===Roads===
[[File:Mannheim-Strassenverkehr.png|Roadmap of Mannheim.|thumb]]

The Mannheim/Ludwigshafen area is surrounded by a ring of motorways connecting it to [[Frankfurt]] in the north, [[Karlsruhe]] in the south, [[Saarbrücken]] in the west and [[Nuremberg]] in the east.

===Railway===
[[Mannheim Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) is at the end of the [[Mannheim-Stuttgart high-speed rail line]] and is the most important railway junction in the southwest of Germany, served by [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] high-speed train system with connections to [[Frankfurt am Main]]–[[Berlin]], [[Karlsruhe]]–[[Basel]], and [[Stuttgart]]–[[Munich]]. A new [[Frankfurt–Mannheim high-speed railway|high speed line to Frankfurt]] also is planned to relieve the existing [[Mannheim–Frankfurt railway]].

===River transport===
[[Mannheim Harbour]] is the second largest [[river port]] in Germany.

===Airports===
[[File:Flugplatz mannheim von mario-andreya.jpg|thumb|[[Mannheim City Airport]]]]
Although [[Frankfurt International Airport]] is only {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north, at various times over the years there were daily passenger flights from [[Mannheim City Airport]] ([[IATA code]] MHG) to [[London]], [[Dresden]], [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], and [[Saarbrücken]]. Currently, scheduled commercial passenger flights serve the airports Berlin-Tegel and Hamburg.

===Local Public Transport===
Local public transport in Mannheim includes the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]], eleven [[tram]] lines, and numerous bus lines operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (Rhine-Neckar transport) (RNV).

The [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]], established in 2003, connects most of the Rhine-Neckar area including lines into the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], [[Odenwald]], and southern [[Hesse]]. All S-Bahn lines run through Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, except S5. Further S-Bahn stations are at present Mannheim-Rangierbahnhof, Mannheim-Seckenheim, and Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld-Süd.

The {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} integrated [[Trams in Mannheim/Ludwigshafen|Mannheim/Ludwigshafen tramway network]] also extends to Heidelberg. It is operated by RNV, a company wholly owned by the three cities mentioned and a couple of municipalities in the Palatinate. RNV is the result of a merger on 1 October 2009 between the region's five former municipal transportation companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.rnv-online.de/rnvGips/Gips;jsessionid=D599A53604ABB5F1D24D663A7F42FD3C?SessionMandant=RNV&amp;Anwendung=CMSTickerEintrag&amp;Methode=ShowHTMLAusgabe&amp;SessionMandant=&amp;RessourceID=56833 | archive-url= https://archive.is/20110719075638/http://www.rnv-online.de/rnvGips/Gips;jsessionid=D599A53604ABB5F1D24D663A7F42FD3C?SessionMandant=RNV&amp;Anwendung=CMSTickerEintrag&amp;Methode=ShowHTMLAusgabe&amp;SessionMandant=&amp;RessourceID=56833 | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 19 July 2011 | title= Press release announcing the merger to form RNV (German-language)| date= 23 September 2009 | accessdate= 2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interurban trams are operated by RNV on a triangular route between Mannheim, [[Heidelberg]], and [[Weinheim]] that was originally established by the [[Upper Rhine Railway Company]] (''Oberrheinische Eisenbahn'', OEG), and the company also operates interurban trams between [[Bad Dürkheim]], Ludwigshafen, and Mannheim. In the 1970s a proposal to build a [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] out of the Mannheim and Ludwigshafen tramways was begun, but only small sections were built due to lack of funds. The only underground station in Mannheim is the Haltestelle Dalbergstraße. U-Bahn planning now has stopped. All public transport is offered at uniform prices set by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar transport union, VRN).

==Sport==
[[File:Carl-Benz-Stadion 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl-Benz-Stadion]], the home stadium of [[SV Waldhof Mannheim]]]]
There are two nationally renowned football clubs in Mannheim, [[SV Waldhof Mannheim]], who currently are playing in the fourth tier [[Regionalliga Südwest]], but who have played in the top tier, the [[Bundesliga]]; and [[VfR Mannheim]], winner of the [[History of German football#Postwar football|German championship in 1949]], now playing in the fifth tier [[Oberliga Baden-Württemberg]].

The [[Adler Mannheim]] (formerly MERC, Mannheimer Eis- und Rollsport-Club) is an [[ice hockey]] team playing in the professional [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]], having won the championship a total of six times.

The city is home to the [[Mannheim Tornados]], the oldest operational baseball and softball club in Germany. The Tornados play in the first division of the [[Bundesliga (baseball)|Baseball Bundesliga]] and have won the championship 11 times, more than any other club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornados.de/modules/info/index.php?cat=2&amp;id=180]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the American football club MTG Rhein-Neckar Bandits was founded. The Bandits are playing in the first German Football League which is called GFL1. In the summer about 500 people watch each game.

[[Rhein-Neckar Löwen|Rhein-Neckar-Loewen]] (Lions) are a [[Team Handball|handball]] team (formerly SG Kronau-Oestringen) playing in the professional [[Bundesliga (handball)|German Handball League]].

Mannheim hosted the [[European Show Jumping Championships]] in 1997, and the [[2007 FEI European Jumping Championship|FEI European Jumping Championships in 2007]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.em2007.de/ |title=FEI European Jumping Championship, Mannheim |publisher=Em2007.de |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234211/http://www.em2007.de/ |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 14–19 August, in the MVV-riding stadium.

2002 [[Hobby Horse Polo]] was invented in Mannheim, evoking the classical rivalry towards "polite society" in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steckenpferdpolo.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Express_23_06_2013_Steckenpferdpolo-001.jpg Express June 23 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steckenpferdpolo.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rheinpfalz_25_Juli_2008.jpg|title=Rheinpfalz July 25 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/steckenpferdpolo-trendsportart-in-duesseldorf-im-rheinpark-a-994129.html|title=Steckenpferdpolo: Trendsportart in Düsseldorf im Rheinpark|author=Eva Gerten, dpa|date=27 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Block Numbering and Computer Mapping==
The center of the city uses an addressing system unique within Germany. Rather than street names and numbers, each block is given a code and a number is given to each building, i.e. C3, 17 is block C3, building 17. This practice dates back centuries, and is a result of the original use of the city center as a fort, with the fort's internal system being adopted when it became public streets. The street themselves are unnamed. The codes are laid out in a simple progressive pattern, i.e. C3 is between C2 and C4 in one direction and B3 and D3 in the other, but those unused to the system will often become lost. A street named Breite Straße goes through the middle of the blocks from south to north, with blocks A-K on the west side of the street and L-U on the east, with each row going 1 to at most 7 based on distance from this road. House numbers begin on the south corner nearest Breite Straße and go counterclockwise for A-K and Clockwise for L-U.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twomonkeystravelgroup.com/7-awesome-things-mannheim-germany/|title=Mannheim, Germany - 7 Awesome Things To Do|website=twomonkeystravelgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This causes major issues with most mapping software, as the databases they use are based on the standard street-number system, and thus aren't able to accommodate a completely different system for a small area. A variety of fixes have been tried, none with a high level of success. In particular, these systems have issues because an address on a block can be on any of up to 4 roads, so attempts to fix the issue by giving the roads false names within the database have often failed to give accurate addressing, though such can still be seen on some platforms, like [[Google Maps]]. Finding an address in this area thus generally requires resorting to asking directions or using one of the many posted public maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSG-zxGRkJw|title=The European City Centre With No Street Names|first=|last=Tom Scott|date=19 February 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince '''Mikhailo Mikhailovich Shcherbatov''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Миха́йлович Щерба́тов}}, July 22, 1733 – December 12, 1790) was a leading ideologue and exponent of the [[Russia]]n [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], on the par with [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Nikolay Novikov]]. His view of human nature and social progress is kindred to [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s [[pessimism]]. He was known as a statesman, historian, writer and philosopher, and was one of the most visible representatives of the nascent Russian conservatism during the second half of the 18th century.

M. M. Shcherbatov received a good-formal education. He studied [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] and [[medicine]]. Until the end of his life he had a vast collection of 40,000 volumes in his home library. Like all educated people of that time he knew [[French language|French]], and in addition to that, he was also competent in [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and a few other western languages. From 1767 onwards, Shcherbatov was in the public service and held responsible posts. He represented the [[Yaroslavl]] nobility at the [[Nakaz]] commission (1767), was a member of a private commission of the middle-class people, a member of the Board of Trade (1770), a president of the Chamber Council and a Senator (1779).

In 1768 he received the position of historiographer and was appointed a Chief Herald of the Senate. In his view the political ideal was to follow the British example of a [[constitutional monarchy]] with separation of powers. He found a certain analogy to this ideal in Pre-Petrian Russia when, in his opinion, [[autocracy]] was confined to the use of such aristocratic organ as the Council [[Boyar]]s. Mikhail's personal view and attitude of [[Peter I of Russia]] or Peter the Great (who ruled Russia from 7 May 1682 until his death in 1725)  in his writings was quite ambiguous. In one of his drafts "An examination of defects and autocracy of Peter the Great" (1782), he openly criticized Peter, arguing that what he did for the prosperity of Russia can be done by more humane means, resulting in smaller losses even though it might take a longer period of time. In Shcherbatov's opinion, without foreign borrowing and the autocracy of Peter the Great, significantly much more time would have been needed for the Russian Enlightenment and [[foreign policy]] opponents meanwhile could have captured the country. Yet, Shcherbatov was aware that, apart from the personal weaknesses, the roughness and cruelty of the autocrat were caused by the viciousness of the time. Peter was forced by the time to be a despot.

Scherbatov's father was a governor-general of [[Moscow]] and a [[Rurikid]] prince. His belonging to the oldest of Russian families may explain Scherbatov's lifelong interest in the national history. In a series of articles published in 1759-61 he defended serfdom and upheld ancient privileges of nobility which had been repealed by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]].

When elected by the nobility of [[Yaroslavl]] to represent their interests at the [[Nakaz|Legislative Assembly]] of 1767, Shcherbatov virulently slammed the existing institutions of the [[Russian Empire]]. He caught the attention of the Empress and was appointed imperial historian in 1768 and president of a ministry in 1778. He worked in the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] from 1779 to 1786.

Scherbatov's ''History of Russia from the Earliest Times'', of which seven volumes appeared between 1771 and 1791, is imbued with rationalistic ideals of the [[Age of Reason]]. He thought that inequality was inherent to human nature and illustrated this tenet in the first Russian [[utopia]], entitled ''Journey to the Land of Ophyr'' (1783). Scherbatov's final and probably most lasting work was a scathing attack on the contemporary social customs in the treatise ''On the Corruption of Morals in Russia'', published in 1797.

== Shcherbatov as a historian and publicist ==

In one of his most famous works "On the corruption of morals in Russia" Shcherbatov criticized the mass abuses committed by the authorities, such as [[bribery]], [[embezzlement]] of public funds, servility, etc. There was also criticism of the methods of Peter the Great by which he promoted "obscure people" and in turn led to a state crisis. Yet, Shcherbatov tried to be unbiased and to show both the positive and negative sides of Peter's [[modernization]]. He wrote about changes made in Russia by Peter's reforms, drawing his attention not only to changes in political and military areas, but also in the field of culture, specifying that due to Europeanization, "in the matter of personal and certain other matters, one can say we truly enjoyed remarkable success and moved forward with giant steps to correcting how we appear to others".

After the accession of [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (who reigned as an Empress of Russia from June 28, 1762 until 1796), Shcherbatov participated in the Established Commission (1767–1771). He supported the elimination of cards on the Table of Ranks and the expansion of the rights of the Russian nobility. However, he was not a pure "court" ideologist, caring only about "narrow interests", as some [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] researchers are inclined to think. In regard to attached [[serf]]s who belonged to merchants and worked in their factories, Shcherbatov considered it necessary to have them registered in their places but not allowing any more to be bought. As far as those serfs who were registered at the factories, he proposed to free them little by little, giving them freedom as a reward for good character and excellent knowledge of arts. Shcherbatov stood for the preservation of serfdom, arguing that the peasants, being uneducated, would not be able to properly use their freedom. He also believed that the problems of serfdom could be solved, not by destroying it, but gradually as a result of changes in attitude and treatment of [[farmer]]s by [[landlord]]s.

Shortly before his death, Shcherbatov created two works, which reflected his views on [[politics]]: "Various Opinions about Government" and "General Thoughts about Legislation". In those works, he distinguished four forms of government: [[monarchy]], [[despotism]] (or autocracy), [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]] and considered the monarchic government the most comprehensible. Shcherbatov saw the ideal [[monarch]] as the one who esteems himself father of the people, who does not reject legislation to establish autocracy, who does not divide his interests with the interests of the State and who is adept at choosing councillors among people, combining diligence to their sovereign with love for [[motherland]] and laws". However, the majority of the governors, being subject to various "passions", could not meet the given characteristics. The aristocratic board was not comprehensible to Russia yet.  Failure or unwillingness of people to suppress their excessive ambition, selfishness and lust for power "generates divisions, parties, hatred and evil, which in essence were a result of those destructive passions". The democratic governments "gnaws at its own entrails dividing into various parties, which in various troubled times are tossed like a ship on a stormy sea, often escaping being sunk by the skill of the pilot, but even more often perishing, sometimes even right at the dock".

Rejecting autocracy as a form of government, Scherbatov wrote "yet there is torture, in which there are no other laws and regulations except for the insane self-will of the despot". The Russian views on legislation were a result of the practical work of Shcherbatov in various public institutions. Since the establishment of the new laws required a thorough examination of the subject, Shcherbatov believed that "laws should be composed by a few impartial people, reasonable, familiar, hardworking and devoted to state affairs ". Comparing laws in the various forms of government, Shcherbatov pointed out the advantage of the monarchy, which, having its solid established laws could provide for its [[citizen]]s' security for their lives, [[property]] and tranquility.

Ideas about the state system received development in Shcherbatov's utopian work "A Journey to the Land of [[Ophir|Ophyr]]". His main idea was that laws should be based on moral principles and the citizens of the state should honour first virtue, then law, and after that – the [[king]] and the authorities. Their lives are dependent, in the first place, on their natural freedom, and after that to their civil responsibilities, which do not try to limit the freedom save only to impose certain duties in relation to the society. In this sense, he believed that people should honour and obey the laws; relationships inside society lie on humane principles and respect for each other and for the monarch, wherein a framework may be created for social balance and political peace within the boundaries of the country.

In that work, Shcherbatov developed his system for the prosperity and well-being of society, the basis of which lay in the idea that honor and respect for the monarch should not be rooted in any form of egoistic servility or hope of receiving a reward. He also supported the idea of a structure within society that is divided into several hierarchical classes, according to which the life of every citizen is regulated. At the top of the pyramid is the king, who should not be seen as almighty but as "the first among equals". Then come the landlords and merchants. The lowest is the class of [[peasant]]s. Although they were not free, the legislation of the [[utopian]] state would require that their masters treat them humanely, provide for their needs, respect their work and refrain from harsh punishment.

Nowadays Scherbatov's ideas still attract the attention of Russian and foreign researchers of Russian [[conservatism]] movement and are fervently discussed in numerous books and articles.

'''Mun Il-yeong''' ([[Hangeul]]: 문일평, [[Hanja]]: 文一平, [[Pen name]]: Ho Am (1888&amp;ndash;1939) was a historian of the late [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]], and an activist in the [[Korean independence movement]] during the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. His research of Korean history in relation to government, culture, diplomacy, and education, helped to inspire nationalism and a deeper love of history in the Korean people.

== Early life ==

Mun Il-pyeong was born in the [[Uiju]] district of the [[North Pyeongan Province]] in the year 1888, the only son of Mun Cheon-du. He spent the majority of his early years in his home town studying Chinese literature and philosophy, until in 1905 when he left to continue his studies in [[Japan]] with colleagues such as [[Yi Kwang-su]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Korea ==

On his return to Korea in 1908, Mun taught at several universities, including Daesung University in [[Pyongyang]], Yangsil University in his hometown of [[Uiju]], and [[Kyeongsin Academy]] in [[Seoul]]. During this period, Mun participated in a secret movement (신민회) established to improve the educational system, instill nationalism, and organize nationalist movements in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;https://domin.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=544934&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued study abroad ==

In 1911, Mun went to study in Japan's [[Waseda University]], where he associated closely with An Jae-hong and Yun Hong-seob, and also with Kim Sung-soo and Jang Deok-soo who would later become founders of ''[[The Dong-a Ilbo]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year in 1912, Mun traveled to [[Shanghai]] [[China]], where he resided in the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] area of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Shanghai, Mun worked at a Chinese newspaper to which he contributed many lead articles, and also at several academies and companies in which he met and associated with [[Park Eun-sik]], Shin Gyu-sik, and [[Shin Chaeho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mun's opinions and views of the Korean people, the power of the press, revolutions, and [[Buddhism]] greatly evolved during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalism and imprisonment ==

Back in Korea, Mun engaged himself in nationalism and Korean independence-promoting activities among the people in the [[Korean independence movement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.daum.net/kdy0404/12027878&lt;/ref&gt; Mun was involved in the [[March First Movement]] and was one of many contributors to the [[Declaration of Korean Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.daum.net/kdy0404/12027878&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven days after the public reading of the Declaration of Korean Independence during the [[March First Movement]], Mun publicly read the Declaration of Korean Independence in a loud voice and wearing a [[durumagi]]. For this he was arrested and imprisoned for 8 months.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.daum.net/kdy0404/12027878&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and death ==

After his release from prison in 1920, Mun taught history at Jung-dong, Jung-ang, Baejae, and Songdo schools, and contributed articles on history to the ''[[Chosun Ilbo]]'', ''Jung-wae Ilbo'', and ''Kaebyeok'', to increase national attention to history. Five years later in 1925 he again left to Japan to study history research, but quickly returned after less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://domin.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=544934&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1933 he became an editor of the ''Chosun Ilbo'' and focused on the popularization of history. He tried to find the essence of Korean traditional culture and spirit from history, and he continued his efforts to make the Korean people interested and aware of the importance of their history until his death in 1939 at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;https://domin.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=544934&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

In a time when the Japanese imperialists aimed to break the Koreans’ patriotism and ethnic spirit, Mun's research and efforts to spread Korean pride in their history had lasting effects on the people even after his death in the early 20th century. He helped lay the foundation of the study of Korean history by his efforts to give history meaning in addition to the study of fundamental historical fact. He also assisted in the work of organizing Korean historic records, and greatly helped in the popularization of history.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p.370&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings dealt with various fields: nature, art, traditional activities, relics, etc. He methodically studied every field related to Korean history. Mun simplified the style of historical writings. He made the titles of history articles simple in that they aptly reflected the context, was objective, and his writings were short and easily understandable for the intention of making history more accessible to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mun was especially interested in foreign policy and diplomacy of the pre-modern era. His study was not focused on finding the advantages of Korean history, but for self-examination and reflection. Like many other historians, he emphasized Joseon-sim (朝鮮心)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115654/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=7461 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the South Korean government conferred him posthumous honors, awarding him the [[Order of Merit for National Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://domin.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=544934&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Neil Christie''' is a British [[archaeologist]] and [[historian]], and a Professor in Archeology at the [[University of Leicester]].

== Biography ==

Prior to joining the Archeology and Ancient History team at the University of Leicester in 1992, Dr Christie was both an undergraduate and doctoral student in Archeology at Newcastle upon Tyne; subsequently gaining a Rome Scholarship at the British School at Rome before being employed there to prepare a major excavation report (Santa Cornelia). Returning to Newcastle as Sir James Knott Fellow, he then held a British Academy Postdoctoral Research fellowship with the Institute of Archeology, Oxford. At Leicester he rose in the ranks to Senior Lecturer, Reader and now Professor.

Outside of the University, he is Reviews Editor for the journal ''[[Medieval Archaeology (journal)|Medieval Archaeology]]'' and Hon. Secretary for the Medieval Settlement Research Group, of which he was a founding member in 1987, and Reviews Editor for their journal. 
He also holds a position as a member of the Faculty for the British School at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/christie |title=Dr Neil Christie — University of Leicester |publisher=.le.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research interests &amp; projects ==

In his own words..
"My principal research interests have focused on the history and archaeology of Italy and the Western Mediterranean between c. AD 300-1000, examining in particular the transition period from Roman to medieval and the evolution of settlement patterns.  Central to this was my in-depth analysis of the Lombard tribe, whilst a major survey of the period (An Archeology of Italy, AD 300-850) was published in 2006.  Core themes in this research include the evolution of towns and the role of defence.  An additional research field relates to castle origins and growth, with Italy again the main zone of interest."

"Archaeological fieldwork forms an important component in my research profile: I directed the Cicolano Castles Project in central Italy (1991–94) centring on excavation and survey work on medieval castles and villages in the high Apennines; I co-directed the Sangro Valley Research Project (1995–2000), assessing evolving settlement patterns in eastern central Italy and excavating a medieval watchtower site; and I co-directed a project in eastern Spain (1994–96), examining post-medieval and early modern upland rural exploitation.  My current project is centred on the study of the town and setting of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in south Oxfordshire and its transition from Saxon [[burh]] to Norman town.  This includes geophysical and topographic survey, targeted excavations, and re-evaluations of previous watching briefs and unpublished excavations to build an image of urban emergence and development from c. AD 800-1300. A pilot project ran in 2001-4; major AHRC funding enables an extended three-year project (organised with Exeter and Oxford Universities) from 2008-10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/school/staff/staff_njc10.html |title=Archaeology and Ancient History at Leicester — University of Leicester |publisher=Le.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ahnlund.jpg|thumb|right|Nils Ahnlund]]
'''Nils Ahnlund''' (23 August 1889 – 11 January 1957) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] historian. He was professor of history at the then-[[Stockholm University College]] 1928–1955 and became a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] in 1941. He was the father of physician [[Hans Olof Ahnlund]], [[Literary science|literary scientist]] [[Knut Ahnlund]] and the grandfather of journalist and writer [[Nathan Shachar]].

Nils Ahnlund was born in [[Uppsala]] as the eldest son of theologian Olof Ahnlund and Hilda Svensson. In 1893 his father was appointed vicar in [[Umeå]], and that is where Nils finished his secondary education. Thereafter he enrolled at [[Uppsala University]], where he quickly became a disciple of [[Harald Hjärne]]. His research mainly focused on the time of [[Swedish Empire]], and his dissertation was on [[Gustavus Adolphus]]' diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia (ed.), ''Great Historians of the Modern Age: An International Dictionary'' (New York, Westport and London, 1991), s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1926 and 1926 he worked at [[Svenska Dagbladet]], where he had a promising career ahead of him. However, he chose the academic path and became the first professor of history at Stockholm University College in 1928. During World War II, he participated in the public debate, exhibiting nationalist sentiments.

Ahnlund was a popularizer of history and became widely known for his contributions in newspapers and radio, but in academia he was also successful and became, among other things, a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]] as early as 1934 and the [[Swedish Academy]]. He was also made a member of several nordic academic societies as well as vice president of the [[Comité International des Sciences Historiques]].&lt;ref&gt;Abridged translation from Swedish Wikipedia (https://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nils_Ahnlund&amp;oldid=30265574)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oshiguma 3-face example.1922.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an ''oshiguma'', with impressions of 3 different kumadori and autographs-inscriptions for each; created in 1922]]

An '''oshiguma''' is an impression of the [[kumadori]] (face [[make-up]]) of [[kabuki]] [[actor]]s on a piece of cloth, usually silk or cotton, created as an [[artwork]] and memento.

Oshigumas are customarily made after the performance of a kabuki play, though not necessarily after every performance, and given as highly valued [[souvenirs]] of the event.  A single oshiguma may have face-impressions from one or several actors, usually all from the same show, illustrating the make-up designs for major characters in the [[Play (theatre)|play]].  It may also include [[autograph]]s, dates and additional inscriptions; sometimes other graphic elements are added to the design.

The same term can also be used to describe an artistic depiction of kabuki make-up created by other means, but intended to emulate the appearance of a face-print.

The '''Paria River''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|iː|ə}} is a tributary of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], approximately {{convert|95|mi}} long,&lt;ref name=NHD&gt;{{cite web| url=http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/| title=The National Map| publisher=U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate=Feb 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in southern [[Utah]] and northern [[Arizona]] in the [[United States]]. It drains a rugged and arid region northwest of the Colorado, flowing through roadless [[slot canyon]]s along part of its course.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Pariah canyon.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A portion of upper Paria Canyon]]
It is formed in southern Utah, in southwestern [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield County]] from several creeks that descend from the edge of the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]], meeting just north of [[Tropic, Utah|Tropic]]. It flows SSE across [[Kane County, Utah|Kane County]] and [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]]. Along the Arizona state line, it descends through the [[Vermilion Cliffs]] in the Paria Canyon and onto the [[Paria Plateau]]. It joins the Colorado from the northwest approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mi (8&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Page, Arizona]] and the [[Glen Canyon Dam]]. The lower 20&amp;nbsp;mi (32&amp;nbsp;km) of the river are within the [[Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness]], which is administered by the [[Bureau of Land Management]]; a permit is required for any overnight visit. The Paria is essentially a large creek and is not navigable.

A 2004 study estimated that the [[Tropic Ditch]], a historic artificial irrigation canal that diverts water from the [[East Fork Sevier River]], loses 1060 acre-feet per year to seepage, and half of that seepage (530 acre-feet per year) ends up in the Paria River, bringing with it 1829 tons of [[Sea salt|salt]] per year.  To help restore the salinity of the Paria and Colorado Rivers to more natural levels, the Tropic and East Fork Irrigation Company has proposed replacing the last 5.5 miles of the ditch with a pipeline.  The cost may be supplemented by a grant from the [[Bureau of Reclamation]]'s [[Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tropic Ditch Replacement Project Final Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact|url=http://www.usbr.gov/uc/envdocs/ea/tropicditch/fea/FinalEA.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Reclamation, Provo Area Office|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractions ==
The Paria is one of the most popular destinations for [[canyoneering]] in the region. [[Buckskin Gulch]], a side canyon along the river in the narrows section, is considered to be one of the longest and deepest slot canyons in the United States.  The Paria is also home to a number of important historical, geological and biological resources.  [[Lee's Ferry]] and the adjoining settlement are located within the canyon just upstream of the confluence with the Colorado River, with a number of other abandoned settlements further north.  The Paria and several nearby rivers and canyons also are the site of several well-preserved specimens of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[petroglyph]]s, prehistoric drawings and symbols carved into stone.  The Paria boasts a vibrant [[desert riparian]] habitat that is home to a number of sensitive and endangered species, and is also the location of [[Wrather Arch]], the longest [[natural arch]] outside of [[Utah]] (although this claim may be superseded by [[Aloba Arch]]).

[[Image:Verm paria canyon.jpg|thumb|right|Buckskin Gulch]]
About a mile south of the river and the [[ghost town]] of [[Pahreah, Utah|Pahreah]] is the Paria Movie Set which was the site for a number of western movies. Among the movies filmed at this site and the surrounding area were ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' (1962), ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951), and ''[[Buffalo Bill]]'' (1944). The old film set in the canyon was a popular attraction but was damaged in a flash flood in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/volunteer/feature/2001/ut/index.html Paria Movie Set Restoration], [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] Volunteer Feature, 2001; retrieved 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings were dismantled and rebuilt in a nearby location by volunteers.  In 2006 these new buildings were destroyed in a suspicious fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_4242201 Fire tears through replica movie sets], [[Salt Lake Tribune]], August 26, 2006; retrieved 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/search/ci_4253660 Rebuilt Kanab set: Volunteers who built the facility are furious], Salt Lake Tribune, August 29, 2006; retrieved 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippine ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Philippine art]]. The tradition of Philippine ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between the Philippines and its neighbours.

== History == 
[[File:Manunggul Jar.jpg|thumb|[[Late Neolithic]] [[Manunggul Jar]] used for burial, topped with two figures, Manunggul Cave]]
[[File:Burnay (tapayan) jars - Philippines.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Tapayan]]'' jars used as lawn ornaments.]]
Traditional pot-making in certain areas of the Philippines would use clay found near the Sibalom River. Molding the clay required the use of wooden paddles, and the clay had to be kept away from sunlight.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/library/webliography/subject/philippine_pottery.asp |title=De La Salle University : University Library : Philippine Pottery |publisher=Dlsu.edu.ph |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120155800/http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/library/webliography/subject/philippine_pottery.asp |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Filipinos created pottery since 3500 years ago.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; They used these ceramic jars to hold the deceased.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Pots.html |title=Anthropomorphic Pots : Metal Age : Ayub Cave, Saranggani Province |publisher=Nationalmuseum.gov.ph |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pottery used to hold remains of the deceased were decorated with anthropomorphic designs. These anthropomorphic earthenware pots date back to 5 BC. - 225 A.D and had pot covers shaped like human heads.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum1"/&gt;

Filipino pottery had other uses as well. During the Neolithic period of the Philippines, pottery was made for water vessels, plates, cups, and for many other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork |title=Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippines: Art for All |publisher=Metmuseum.ph |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalinga Pottery''' &lt;ref name=archaeo2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skibo|first1=J.|title=Pottery Function: A use-alteration perspective|date=1992|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic vessels of Kalinga are divided into three types: rice cooking (ittoyom), vegetable/meat cooking (oppaya), and water storage (immosso) pots. According to Skibo, the rice cooking pots are usually larger, thinner and have a smaller opening than vegetable/meat pots. On the other hand, water storage pots have an average and uniform size and a smaller neck size.

Except for water storage pots, which have a uniform size, the other two kinds can come in three different sizes, large, medium and small. Although this is true in some cases, another larger type of vegetable/meat pot and smaller water storage pot exists.

• Manufacture of Kalinga potteries
[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year .. (1910) (18246004349).jpg|thumb|Group of Igorot pottery makers, from Samoki, Mountain Province (1910)]]
The first step in the manufacture of pots is the acquisition of the starting material, clay. The clay is then pounded, added with enough amount of water, to reach the wanted flexibility, and placed in a rotating plate. Using the hand-modeling and coil-and-scrape techniques, the height, thickness and shape of the pot is established. After this, the rim is designed by placing a wet rag on top of it and then rotating it in the other direction. Furthermore, scraping of the walls can also be done if the walls produced are too thick.

The pot, after the modeling stage, is then dried for a short period of time before the base is shaped. Also, after additional heating, small amounts of clay are added inside and outside the clay to maintain the evenness of the surface. A polishing step can also be done through the use of a polishing stone. In some cases, pots are also painted with red hematite paint for some stylized design.

'''Pottery Functions'''	&lt;ref name="archaeo2"/&gt;

Pots are ceramic vessels that are made by molding clay into its wanted shape and then leaving it in an environment with an elevated temperature thereby making it solid and sturdy. It is widely recognized as one of better tools that humans invented since it managed to store the surplus of food Neolithic humans gathered.

In the book Pottery Function: A Use-Alteration Perspective, the author, [[James Skibo]], reasoned out why the use of pots is far more advantageous than baskets and other organic containers. He said that since potteries are commonly made in clay, heat has little to none effect on the container, and its contents, and that it protects the food from moisture and pests. Furthermore, its range of storable contents is far wider than baskets and animal skins since it can store both liquid and dry goods.

Also, Rice, in his book Pottery Analysis, classified ceramic vessels into 17 categories depending on various factors that concern the use and production of the tool. One of these is the content wherein he further divided a type of pot into four depending on the state (liquid or solid) and temperature (hot or cold) of the food inside it. He also said that a ceramic has three main uses. These three are storage, processing, and transfer.

Based from these three uses that Rice gave, Skibo further characterized the usage of ceramic vessels by dividing the tool’s function into two, (1) intended use and (2) actual use.

Intended use, as the name implies, is how the tool’s supposed to be used. This is the basis of the manufacture of the ceramic vessel since the form follows the function. On the other hand, actual use is how the tool was used. This sometimes disregards the pot’s form as long it can do a specific 
function.

'''Kalinga Pottery and its Uses''' &lt;ref name="archaeo2"/&gt;
[[File:Jar, Republic of the Philippines, ceramic, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|A jar from the Philippines housed at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]], dated from 100–1400 CE.]]
In Kalinga, ceramic vessels can be used for two situations: daily life use and ceremonial use. 
Daily life uses include the making of rice from the pots and the transfer of water from nearby water bodies to their homes.

• Determining actual function of Kalinga pots

As said, a pottery sometimes has a different actual use than intended use. This is the reason why when archaeologists study the function of a pottery, they tend to focus on how the tool was actually used. They do this by studying the alterations that the pottery has. These alterations, accretion and attrition, are commonly the abrasions and scratches on the vessel. In Skibo’s study of Kalinga potteries functions, he relied on three main tests, namely (1) dissolved residue, (2) surface attrition and (3) carbon deposition.	
# Dissolved residue – This test was done to determine the organic matters that were once placed in the vessel. Through the combination of a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrophotometer, the composition of the fatty acids inside the vessel was determined. Although a complete identification of the species of plant and animals was not possible, Skibo managed to know which pots were used for rice and vegetable/ meat cooking. 	
# Surface Attrition – Skibo’s study on the attrition of the pots showed how the pot was used. By looking at the trace attritions inside the vessel, the type, frequency, angle and direction of stirring for each pot was determined. Furthermore, Skibo also concluded that two pots can be differentiated from each other, on the basis of what type of food it cooks, from the abrasions. He said that rice pots will have a little amount of stirring while the vegetable/meat pots will have numerous marks.	
# Carbon Deposition – This test, as said by Skibo, can determine the type of food cooked, how it was cooked and how the pot was placed on the flame. From this, another distinction between rice and vegetable/meat pots was established.

'''Iron Age pottery''' &lt;ref name=archaeo&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Solheim|first1=William|title=The archaeology of central Philippines: A study chiefly of the Iron Age and its relationships.|date=2002|publisher=Bureau of Print|location=Manila}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major complexes in Philippine Iron Age according to Solheim, Kalanay, Novaliches and Bau pottery complexes. Kalanay pottery complex pertains to Beyer’s Early Iron Age pottery of the Visayan Islands found in Negros and Mindoro; novaliches pottery complex to Beyer’s Early Iron Age pottery from Rizal province. Bau pottery, on the other hand, does not fit into the two previous complexes and could correspond instead to the Late Iron Age pottery.

'''Kalanay Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

The type site of the Kalanay pottery complex is the [[Kalanay Cave]] found in Masbate. From this site, the pottery is further subdivided into pottery types Kalanay and Bagupantao.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Paired diagonals and borders, with variations including single diagonals or verticals and borders, or wavy lines and borders
* Curvilinear scrolls and triangles
* Rectangular scroll
* Triangles, with variations including alternating triangles and borders or running triangles
* Rectangles and diagonals
* Zoomorphs
* Punctate fieldwhere areas bonded by incised lines are emphasized by punctuations or dashes
* Diagonals without borders, including a band of horizontal V’s and alternating diagonals off a center line
* Impressed crenelations
* Impressed or carved scallop design
* Impressed tool
* Carved cutouts in ring stands

Kalanay complex pottery can be divided into 16 groups according to Solheim.

# Large jars with wide necks
# Large jars with narrow necks
# Small jars
# Deep bowls
# Shallow bowls
# Very shallow bowls
# Lids
# Shallow bowls with ring stands
# Tetrapods
# Jars with angle between side and bottom
# Spherical jars with small mouths, without angle at rim
# Angular Vessels

'''Bau Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

It has less variation in both form and decoration compared to the Kalanay pottery complex.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Paddle Impressed
* Tool Impressed, including simple-tool and compound-tool impressed
* Stamp Impressed
* Applique ribbons of clay

In terms of forms:

* Small jars with everted rims
* Small jars without everted rim
* Small heavy jars with flat bottom
* Cups with ring feet
* Jars with ring feet

'''Novaliches Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
[[File:Water carriers in Iloilo, 1899.jpg|thumb|Carriers with water pots, in [[Iloilo]] (1899).]]
Most of Novaliches pottery can be distinguished from Bau pottery and Kalanay pottery. While it shares form and decoration with Kalanay pottery, it contains more variability compared to Bau pottery. According to Solheim (2002), “it is the most sophisticated pottery that has yet been found in the Philippines”

Novaliches pottery can be diagnosed by its form being a shallow bowl with a high right-foot. The shallow bowl is generally plain but the feet are highly decorated. Majority of Novaliches pottery were well polished. The form is so symmetrical that it looks as if it was made in a potter wheel, however, examinations showed that it wasn’t.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Cutouts
* Narrow vertical elements; carved, tool impressed, or running impressed lines
* Horizontal and diagonal elements, including simple tool impressions, compound tool impressions and carved elements
* Horizontal broadline impressed lines

Vessel forms are as follows:

* Shallow bowls with high ring stands
* Shallow bowls with low-ring stands
* Jars with low-ring stands
* Angle jars
* Jars with short necks and everted rims

'''Kalanay Cave Site''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

The Kalanay cave site is a small burial cave. It is located at the northwest coast of Masbate.

• Kalanay Pottery

* Kalanay Plain	
* Majority (80 per cent) of the excavated vessels.
* Variations in size and shape
* Technique used in the manufacture:  Paddle-and-anvil technique 
* Differences in the base of the vessels (some have rounded bottom while some use a ring foot or a tetrapod for support).
* Large observable differences in color that is associated with the inability of the potter to control the fire, causing the uneven distribution of the heat.
 
• Kalanay Incised

* Incised around the neck, rim of a jar or the outside of a bowl in a band of repeating elements
* Little care was given so the jars appear poorly made despite its well thought out designs. This can be attributed to the possibility that the certain tradition of this pot was no longer significant to the manufacturer
* Kalanay-Impressed: simple tool and simple and compound tool
* Simple tool impressing found around the jar or bowl with a flange

• Kalanay slipped

* Forms: jars, large with wide mouth and everted rim, or small with everted rim; bowls, deep with inslanting sides, or very shallow which turned out lip
* Some were polished, some were not.

'''Bagupantao Pottery''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
 
• Bagupantao Plain

* Majority of the pots’ paste is red-brown in color, with gray or black as the minority. Its texture ranges from fine to medium and its thickness is usually 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in length. The common forms of the pots are jars with wide to narrow mouths and its normally large (a body diameter of 24 to 35&amp;nbsp;cm). 
* Difference between Kalanay Plain: Evenness of color and cleanness of clay
 
• Bagupantao Impressed 
 
* The type of paste is the same as Bagupantao plain, red-brown in color.  It is also highly decorated on its rim with circles, punctuations and crenellations. 
* Larger (28 –31&amp;nbsp;cm body diameter) and thicker (9-14 thickness) than Bagupantao plain.

• Bagupantao Painted
 
* The paste used is the same as Bagupantao impressed and plain but it is covered with heavy red hematite slip inside and outside of the neck.
* Thinner (2–7&amp;nbsp;mm) and smaller than Bagupantao plain.

• Extraneous Pottery - Three vessels that did not belong to the Bagupantao and Kalanay style were also found.

First pot

* Similar clay used as the Bagupantao and Kalanay vessels. The color, red-brown, was also the same, inside and out.
* Ornamented with small crystals on the paste and black flakes on the surface.
* As thin (3–8&amp;nbsp;mm) as the Bagupantao painted vessel.

Second pot

* Same size and structure as the Bagupantao pots.
* Used a different paste (fibrous texture and contained mineral inclusions)
* Heavily polished and the surface color ranges from red-brown to light gray.
* As thick as the Bagupantao plain jars (5–12&amp;nbsp;mm).

Third pot

* The paste used is chocolate-brown in color and its texture is fine.
* It is very thick (15–20&amp;nbsp;mm) when compared to the other pots.
* Poorly made because of the uneven distribution of heat to the pot (pieces break longitudinally).

In Japan, pottery from [[Luzon]] became especially esteemed and was used in [[Japanese tea ceremony]] as ''[[shimamono]]''.

'''Primitive communism''' is a concept originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] who argued that [[hunter-gatherer]] societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s descriptions of "communism in living" as practised by the [[Iroquois Nation]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. 1881. ''Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical [[social class]] structures or [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man the Hunter |last=Lee |first=Richard |last2=DeVore |first2=Irven |year=1969 |publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=978-0-202-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels offered the first detailed theorization of primitive communism in 1884, with publication of  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some [[subsistence agriculture]] communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism.

Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of ''primitive communism''. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that ''The Origin of the Family'' was published, Engels attacked [[European colonialism]], describing the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch regime]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, "on the basis of the old communistic village communities".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]] showed "how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]".

In a primitive communist society, all able bodied persons would have engaged in obtaining food, and everyone would share in what was produced by hunting and gathering. There would be no private property, which is distinguished from personal property&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pslweb.org/party/marxism-101/eight-myths-about-socialism.html|title=Eight myths about socialism—and their answers|publisher=Party for Socialism and Liberation|accessdate=Aug 30, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025001338/http://www.pslweb.org/party/marxism-101/eight-myths-about-socialism.html|archivedate=2013-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as articles of clothing and similar personal items, because primitive society produced no surplus; what was produced was quickly consumed.

James (eds.), ''Early Human Kinship''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61-82.&lt;/ref&gt; There would have been no [[State (polity)|state]].

Domestication of animals and plants following the [[Neolithic Revolution]] through [[herding]] and [[agriculture]] was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to [[class society]] as it was followed by private ownership and [[slavery]], with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]] which is said to lead to the development of [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ablongman" /&gt;

[[File:Mbendjele meat sharing.jpg|thumb|Mbendjele hunter-gatherer meat sharing.]]
Egalitarian and communist-like hunter gatherer societies have been studied and described by many well-known social anthropologists including James Woodburn,&lt;ref&gt;James Woodburn (1982). "Egalitarian Societies", ''Man'' (NS), Vol. 17, No. 3, pp. 431-451&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Lee, 1992. "Demystifying Primitive Communism".

In ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' 14:2: 297-315.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists such as [[Christopher Boehm]],&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest.

Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; offer theoretical accounts to explain how communistic, assertively egalitarian social arrangements might have emerged in the [[prehistory|prehistoric past]]. Despite differences in emphasis, these and other anthropologists follow Engels in arguing that evolutionary change—resistance to primate-style sexual and political dominance—culminated eventually in a revolutionary transition. [[Richard Borshay Lee]] criticizes the mainstream and [[dominant culture]]'s long-time bias against the possible existence of primitive communism, deriding "[[Bourgeois]] ideology [that] would have us believe that primitive communism doesn't exist. In popular consciousness it is lumped with romanticism, exoticism: the noble savage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= ''Richard B. Lee, 1992. "Demystifying Primitive Communism".

[[File:USA 080727 122-1.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Robert P. Crease]]
'''Robert P. Crease''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|iː|s}}; born 22 October 1953 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is a [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[history of science|historian of science]].  

==Work==
Crease is co-editor of the scholarly journal ''[[Physics in Perspective]]'' and writes a monthly column, "Critical Point", for the international physics magazine ''[[Physics World]]''. 
 
He is Chairman of the ''Department of Philosophy'' at [[Stony Brook University]], where he has been a professor since 1987.  In philosophy his interests lie in performance theory, expertise, and trust.  In history of science his interest focuses on the history of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], one of the first three U.S. national laboratories; he is co-founder of the Laboratory History conferences which have been held bi-annually since 1999.  In 2007 he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) in the United States, and the [[Institute of Physics]] (IOP) in [[London]].

He has written, co-written, translated, or edited over a dozen books.  His articles have appeared in ''[[the Atlantic]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other places.

===History of science===
Robert P. Crease began to work on the history of Brookhaven National Laboratory shortly after arriving at Stony Brook in 1987.  Brookhaven, established in 1947 and the site of several [[Nobel prize|Nobel-prizewinning]] work, was among the first three U.S. National Laboratories.  Due to its scientific ambitions and geographical location (not far from New York City), Brookhaven has experienced the tensions and conflicts affecting U.S. science-society relations “writ large”.  These tensions and conflicts affect the management of science, science policy, the construction of large scientific facilities, and environmental concerns and community trust.  Crease has written about the history of Brookhaven’s first quarter-century: ''Making Physics: A Biography of Brookhaven National Laboratory'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999).  He is currently working on a sequel.

His articles about Brookhaven include:
* ''The National Synchrotron Light Source, Part I: Bright Idea'' – "Physics in Perspective   10 (2008)", ''pp.&amp;nbsp;438–467''.
* ''The National Synchrotron Light Source, Part II: The Bakeout'' – "Physics in Perspective 11 (2009)", ''pp.&amp;nbsp;15–45''.

===Performance theory===
In performance theory Crease treats performance not as merely a praxis – an application of a skill, technique, or practice that simply produces what it does – but a poiesis; a bringing forth of a phenomenon, something with its own identity in the world, able to appear in different ways in different circumstances, but exhibiting some lawlike integrity.  Works of the performing arts are clearly of this sort – but so are scientific experiments.  An experiment is not something automatic, but must be planned, executed, and witnessed – and its result sometimes leads the planners to have to alter an experiment so that what appears in it can be seen more clearly.

Crease treats performance as not simply a metaphor that is extended merely suggestively from the arts to the sciences, but as something that happens alike in artistic and scientific activity.   Treating experiments as performances in the service of inquiry, however, leads us to understand better several features of experiments, such as why they can “give us back” more information than we put into them, causing us to reshape the theories that led us to create them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2376">'''Simon Kaukhchishvili''' ({{lang-ka|სიმონ ყაუხჩიშვილი}}) (October 1, 1895, [[Kutaisi]] – May 11, 1981, [[Tbilisi]]) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historian and philologist known for his critical editions of old Georgian chronicles; Doctor of Historical Sciences (1927), Professor (1930), [[Academician]] of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences|Georgian National Academy of Sciences]] (1968).

He was born to a [[Georgian Catholic Church|Georgian Catholic]] family in [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]). In 1917, he graduated from the [[St. Petersburg University]] and returned to Georgia where he was assigned to the recently established [[Tbilisi State University]] where he attained to the title of Professor in 1930 and chaired the departments of the [[Byzantine Studies]] (1927–38) and of the Classical Philology (1940-1954). Since 1960 until his death, he headed the Department of the Byzantine Studies at the Institute for Oriental Studies in [[Tbilisi]]. Under [[Joseph Stalin]], he was persecuted by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities, being sacked twice, in 1938 and 1953, but survived the [[Great Purge]].

Having left a diverse literary and scholarly legacy and commonly regarded as the founder of the Byzantine studies in Georgia, his crowning achievements are the critical editions of the Georgian Chronicles ("[[Kartlis Tskhovreba]]") and Prince [[Vakhushti]]’s historical-geographical treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts'', p. 16. Peeters Bvba {{ISBN|90-429-1318-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated and critically edited a collection of Byzantine sources on Georgia and Georgians published as ''Georgica'' in eight volumes from 1934 to 1970.

'''Tat’yana Avenirovna Proskuriakova''' ({{lang-ru|Татья́на Авени́ровна Проскуряко́ва}}) ({{OldStyleDate|January 23|1909|January 10}} – August 30, 1985) was a Russian-American [[Mayanist]] scholar and [[archaeologist]] who contributed significantly to the deciphering of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphs]], the [[writing system]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]].

==Early life==

She was born in [[Tomsk]], in the Tomsk Governorate of the [[Russian Empire]], to a chemist and his physician wife. The family travelled to the [[United States]] in 1915, her father being asked by [[Tsar Nicholas II]] to oversee the production of munitions for [[World War I]]. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] forced the family to remain permanently. She was to visit Russia only once after that, to meet the Mayanist [[Yuri Knorozov]].

She was devoted to a career in interpreting art, architecture, and hieroglyphics. She could read proficiently at age 3. She had a talent for drawing and received lessons in art and watercolor.&lt;ref&gt;Char Solomon. "Tatiana Proskouriakoff
(1909-1985) and her Contributions to Mesoamerican Archaeology". June 2007. Retrieved 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family lived for a while in [[Ohio]], then moved to the [[Philadelphia]] area, settling down in [[Lansdowne, Pennsylvania]]. Proskouriakoff graduated valedictorian of her class and  was the editor of the school yearbook.
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wVcgYsesO0 Unearthed in the Archives - Tatiana Proskouriakoff], [[Penn Museum]] }}

In 1926, Tatiana enrolled at the [[Pennsylvania State College]] School of Architecture and graduated the only female in her class in 1930. Initially educated as an architect, she later went on to work for [[Linton Satterthwaite]] and for the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] at the Maya site of [[Piedras Negras, Guatemala|Piedras Negras]] in 1936–37. The Piedras Negras site lies between Mexico and Guatemala in the [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] region. Specializing in architecture, Tatiana's first assignment at Piedras Negras was to illustrate the architectural ruins of the site. These initial travels would be the start of her life's work, as she found a passion for studying the ancient Maya. Upon her return to [[Philadelphia]], she made a reconstruction drawing of the Piedras Negras acropolis which caught the attention of [[Sylvanus Morley|Silvanus Morley]]. Morley realized the young architect's remarkable ability to visualize a ruined structure as it once stood and render it with artistic precision. This would later lead to Tatiana's collaboration with Morley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instituteofmayastudies.org/index.php/features/pioneers-in-maya-archaeology-2/tatiana-proskouriakoff|title=Tatiana Proskouriakoff|last=Merwin|first=Keith|work=Institute of Maya Studies|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

[[File:XpujilByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|300px|left| Xpujil as it appeared in 2000]]

While enrolled in graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Proskouriakoff prepared archeological illustrations as a volunteer at the University Museum.  Through her work with the Museum’s Assistant Curator of the American Section, Linton Satterthwaite, Proskouriakoff received an invitation in 1936 to join the Museum’s excavation work at the Maya site of Piedras Negras.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzati, A. (2001). The Hand of Fate in Tatiana Proskouriakoff's Career. Expedition, 43(3), 3. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Proskouriakoff never received a degree in the field of Maya studies, her dedication and ability for it led to her receiving positions at the Carnegie Institution in Washington D.C., then later at Harvard University. Her position at Carnegie was procured when [[Sylvanus Morley]] saw the panoramic reconstruction on a visit to the Museum; he was impressed, and prevailed upon her to make more for the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. Unable to get the institution to hire her, he raised funds to enable Proskouriakoff to travel to [[Copán]] and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], which she did in 1939. Returning after she completed the drawings, she was given the post of a research associate at the Institution in the early 1940s.

She soon became involved in [[Maya hieroglyphs]] and made significant contributions to the understanding of Mayan written language. For example, her 1942 scholarly analysis of the hieroglyphics at the [[Takalik Abaj|Takalik Abaj ruins]] in [[Guatemala]] establish that the site was in part [[Maya civilization|Maya]], settling a debate at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McNally|first= Shelagh|title= Guatemala: Pocket Adventure Guide|publisher= Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn= 1-58843-528-8|url= https://books.google.com/?id=x7CtmPL5DMQC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=Tatiana+Proskouriakoff|page= 264 |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her greatest contribution was considered the breakthrough for Maya hieroglyphic decipherment in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Utilizing the theories of [[Yuri Knorozov]], she discovered that the writing on the monumental stela and other buildings was actually historical, dealing with the birth, accession, and death dates for the Maya rulers. Analyzing the pattern of dates and hieroglyphs, she was able to demonstrate a sequence of seven rulers who ruled over a span of two hundred years. Knowing the context of the inscriptions, Maya epigraphers were then able to decipher the hieroglyphs.

She became honorary curator, [[Maya art]], of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] in 1958.

==Critical Reception==
''The Good War'' met with positive reviews upon its publication in the fall of 1984. [[Loudon Wainwright Jr.|Loudon Wainwright]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', stated in a review published on October 7, 1984, "Ten, 20, 30 years from now the best witnesses to World War II will be largely gone. But Presidents honoring them will surely have access to a copy of Studs Terkel's most recent exercise in memory harvesting, ''The Good War.'' It is hard to see how any reader now or then can fail to benefit from its 600 pages."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/26/specials/terkel-goodwar.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaddis Smith]], in a capsule review in the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', claimed, "This book sustains Studs Terkel's reputation as the nation's foremost practitioner of the difficult (although seemingly simple) art of oral history."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1984-12-01/good-war-oral-history-world-war-two&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]] assessment of the book, dated October 11, 1984, included the following: "In World War II memories, Terkel has found a great, untold story--with fore-shadowings of Vietnam and aftershocks of atomic warfare."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/studs-terkel/the-good-war/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, ''The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two'' won the [[1985 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]] for General Non-Fiction.

==Subsequent Influence==
[[Max Brooks]] has said that ''The Good War'' inspired him to write his novel ''[[World War Z]]''.  Brooks stated: "It's an oral history of World War II I read when I was a teenager, and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write ''World War Z'', I wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history."&lt;ref name=eat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eatmybrains.com/showfeature.php?id=55 |title=Exclusive Interview: Max Brooks on World War Z |work=Eat My Brains! |date=October 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uyaquq''' (also '''Uyaquk''' or '''Uyakoq'''; sometimes referred to in English as '''Helper Neck''') (ca. 1860&amp;ndash;1924) was a member of the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Yupik]] native American group who became a [[Elder (Christianity)|Helper]] in the [[Moravian Church]], noted for his linguistic genius. He went from being an illiterate adult to inventing a series of writing systems for his native language and then producing translations of the [[Bible]] and other religious works in a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Willard B. 1996. Native writing systems. Handbook of North American Indians, vol 17: Languages, ed. by Ives Goddard. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyaquq was born into a family of [[shaman]]s in the lower [[Kuskokwim River]] valley of central [[Alaska]] in the mid-1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Alley, James. 1991. Biography of Helper Neck. Alaska Native Language Archive, item [http://www.uaf.edu/anla/item.xml?id=CY(MOR)991A1991 CY(MOR)991A1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Even by the standards of the day, Uyaquk was a small man.  He became a shaman in early adulthood, but converted to [[Christianity]] after his father converted.  Although his father became a [[Russian Orthodox]], Uyaquk became a leader and missionary in the Alaskan Moravian Church.  His name means "[[Neck]]"&lt;ref name="yupeskdict"&gt;Jacobson, Steven A. (2012). [http://www.uaf.edu/anla/collections/search/resultDetail.xml?id=CY972J2012 Yup'ik Eskimo Dictionary, 2nd edition]. Alaska Native Language Center.&lt;/ref&gt; in English and he was called that by some English speakers.

As a missionary, Uyaquq is said to have converted whole villages of Yupik in the lower [[Kuskokwim River]] valley to Christianity.  He is said{{By whom|date=October 2012}} to have had a gentle personality and have been a very erudite speaker.

Uyaquq was fascinated by the idea that the English-speaking Moravians could quote a passage of scripture several times using exactly the same words each time.  He discovered that they accomplished this by reading from a written text.  Uyaquk became fascinated with the idea of writing and, according to his descendants, received the idea for the first version of the script he used to write his dialect, [[Yugtun]], in a dream.

Reverend [[John Hinz]], a Moravian missionary in Alaska, and an accomplished [[linguist]], was astonished upon hearing of Uyaquq's invention.{{cn|date=October 2012}}  Hinz took Uyaquq to the Bethel mission house so that he could continue his linguistic work.  Uyaquq is said to have written constantly during the trip, writing as many stories from the Bible as he could in the new script without stopping to sleep.  Hinz and the [[John Henry Kilbuck|Kilbuck]]s aided Uyaquq by telling him scriptures, but Uyaquq refused to learn to read or write English, as he thought that English literacy would make him lose his identity as a Yupik.

In the next five years, Uyaquq's [[Yugtun script]] evolved from its original form of pictographs to a [[syllabary]].  This evolution began when Uyaquq decided that his hieroglyphics were a good memory aid but they did not represent passages with enough accuracy that they could be reproduced verbatim time after time.  Uyaquq identified the concept of a [[syllable]] and his script evolved in five stages until he had created a symbol for each syllable in the language.  Each of the five steps was documented in several notebooks kept by Uyaquq.  He taught his writing system to several of his missionary helpers and they used it in their church work.

Although the system adopted by most people for writing [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] was the Roman-based script of Reverend Hinz, and, in about 1970, the [[University of Alaska]] system, Uyaquq's system has been studied because it may represent the same process of evolution from [[illiteracy]] to [[proto-writing]] to syllabary taken by many ancient written languages, like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], but compressed into a period of five years.  Uyaquq's notebooks and the writings of those who watched him at work have been the subject of research, beginning with Dr. Alfred Schmitt in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Alfred. 1951. Die Alaska- Schrift und Ihre Schriftgeschichtliche Bedeutung. (Münstersche Forschungen 4.) Marburg: Simons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bijker's father was an engineer involved in implementing the [[Delta Works|Delta Plan]] after a disastrous [[dike breach]] in the Netherlands in 1953 when young Bijker was two years old and later became deputy director of the Delft Hydraulics Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bijker | first1 = Wiebe E. | title = The Oosterschelde storm surge barrier: a test case for Dutch water technology, management, and politics | journal = [[Technology and Culture]] special issue, Water Technology in the Netherlands | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 569–584 | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press via JSTOR | date = July 2002 | jstor = 25147960 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, the unique fact of parts of the Netherlands being below sea level, the well-known concerns in innovation surrounding this condition for centuries, and his father's involvement all contributed to the younger Bijker's interest in technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{citation | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | contribution = Centres of calculation | editor-last = Latour | editor-first = Bruno | editor-link = Bruno Latour | title = [[Science in Action (book)|Science in action: how to follow scientists and engineers through society]] | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1987 | page = 230 | isbn = 9780674792913 }} ''et seq.'' Latour, a colleague of the younger Bijker, uses the father's genius in engineering to illustrate how scientists gain control over, or mobilize, difficult-to-manage objects.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
After finishing [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Emmeloord]] (1969), the younger Bijker received his [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in philosophy from the [[University of Amsterdam]] (1974), his [[engineer's degree]] in physical engineering from the [[Delft University of Technology]] (1976), and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from the [[University of Twente]] in 1990.

== Career ==
Bijker was an [[assistant professor|assistant]] and [[associate professor]] of philosophy from 1987 at the [[Maastricht University]] before becoming [[full professor]] of technology and society in 1994. Bijker's fields of research include social and historical studies of [[science, technology and society]]; theories of technology development; methodology of science, technology and society studies; democratisation of technological culture; science and technology policies; ICT, multimedia and the social-cultural dimensions of the information society; gender and technology; and meta studies of architecture, planning, and civil engineering. With [[Trevor Pinch]] he is considered as one of the main adherents of the [[Social Construction of Technology]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Tympas | first = Aristotle | contribution = Methods in the history of technology, Volume 2 M-Z Index | editor-last1 = Hempstead | editor-first1 = Colin | editor-last2 = Worthington | editor-first2 = William E. | title = Encyclopedia of 20th-century technology | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, New York | year = 2005 | page = 487 | isbn = 9781579583866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bijker received criticism regarding his Dutch MFS-II-evaluation of 8,000 pages where he used a one-sided methodology of research with peer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160315040700/http://www.nl-aid.org/large-scale-mfs-ii-evaluation-conducted-by-wiebe-bijker-claims-without-evidence Large-scale MFS II-evaluation conducted by Wiebe Bijker claims without evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2017 Wiebe Bijker became emeritus professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/w.bijker|title=Wiebe Bijker (W.E.)  - Maastricht University|website=www.maastrichtuniversity.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xavier Guichard''' (1870–1947) was a French Director of Police, [[archaeologist]] and writer.
[[File:Xavier GUICHARD directeur de la PJ de Paris de 1930 à 1934 (jeune).jpg|thumb|Xavier Guichard, ca.1900 - 1910]]
His 1936 book ''Eleusis Alesia: Enquête sur les origines de la civilisation européenne'' is an early example of speculative thinking concerning [[Earth mysteries]], based on his observations of apparent alignments between [[Alesia (disambiguation)|Alesia]]-like place names on a map of France.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hutching: ''The World Atlas of Mysteries'', Pan Books (1978), pages 77-80.&lt;/ref&gt; His theories are analogous to those of his near-contemporary in the United Kingdom, [[Alfred Watkins]], concerning [[Ley line]]s.

Xavier Guichard appears as a character in the novels of [[Georges Simenon]], where he is the superior of the fictional detective [[Jules Maigret]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">[[Image:Stingo.jpg|right|thumb|The Yorkshire Stingo]]
The '''Yorkshire Stingo''' was a [[public house]] in [[Marylebone]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, and served as a significant landmark just outside [[central London]].

Located on the south side of the [[Marylebone Road]], it was a rural location when first built, before the construction of [[New Road, London|the New Road]]. An [[Cover charge|admittance charge]] was made, redeemable with the waiters, as a method of preventing those with no money from enjoying the facilities. 

Its name comes from a fashionable slang word of the 18th century for strong or old [[Beer in England#English beer styles|ale]]. The name possibly comes from the sharp, or "stinging" flavour of a well-matured beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicon.x10host.com/?w=stingo|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913)|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor]] used it as one of the centres for distributing [[alms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/journeys/virtual_tour_html/london/marylebone.htm ''The Yorkshire Stingo public house'' (National Archives)] accessed 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bowling green]] and [[pleasure garden]]s were added in the 18th century.

In 1829, it became one of the first terminuses for [[Buses_in_London#Organisation|London buses]]. In 1836, [[Music_hall#Early_music_halls|an early music hall]] for vaudeville and burlesque, called the '''Apollo Saloon''', was added, but by 1848 the gardens were closed. The public house was finally closed in 1964. The site has since been used for the County Court and a [[public baths]].

==Thomas Paine's cast iron bridge==
:''Nothing in the world is as fine as my bridge except a woman.'' – [[Thomas Paine]]
During 1790 the Yorkshire Stingo was the temporary home of the second cast iron bridge ever built. (The first was [[The Iron Bridge]].) This was designed by Thomas Paine, better known as the author of the revolutionary best-seller ''[[Rights of Man]]''. Paine had endeavoured to interest the authorities in Philadelphia and Paris in his design. He had gained a patent for this in 1788 and Walkers, who had an ironworks in [[Sheffield]], agreed to construct it. The original design of {{convert|250|ft|m|1}} – to span the [[Schuylkill River]], Philadelphia – had been scaled down to {{convert|90|ft|m|1}}. Paine discussed the bridge in correspondence with [[Thomas Jefferson]], Sir [[Joseph Banks]], [[George Washington]] and Sir [[George Thomas Staunton|George Staunton]], and entertained hopes that it might be the model for an iron bridge across the [[Thames]] as well as the [[Seine]]. Paine supervised both the work at the Walker factory, and the erection of the bridge in the grounds of the Yorkshire Stingo.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=The Commissioners of Patents |work=Patents for inventions: Abridgments of specifications relating to Bridges, Viaducts and Aqueducts, A.D. 1750–1866 |publisher=The Patent Office |page=xi |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QMzs_yU-cAcC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Thomas+Paine+cast+iron+bridge+stingo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NxDZVJXUDdPYaovagpAD&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Paine%20cast%20iron%20bridge%20stingo&amp;f=false |title=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; It weighed three tons and could bear a weight of six. Peter Whiteside, a Philadelphian merchant, was backing the project, but found himself in financial difficulties and asked Paine to return the money he had lent; in the end, the project had to be abandoned. Parts of it were then used in a bridge over the [[River Wear]] in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. William Yates, who had acted as Paine's foreman, went on to work on the Wear bridge and then [[Southwark Bridge]], built by [[John Rennie (father)|John Rennie]]. Paine later quipped that "the [[French revolution]], and [[Edmund Burke|Mr Burke's]] [[Reflections on the Revolution in France|attacks upon it]], drew me off any pontifical works".
