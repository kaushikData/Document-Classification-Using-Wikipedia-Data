The '''Ain Sakhri Lovers''' figurine is a sculpture that was found in one of the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves near [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110811115432/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/p/phallic_figurine.aspx|title=British Museum - Ain Sakhri lovers figurine|date=2011-08-11|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is considered to be 11,000 years old and to be the oldest known representation of two people engaged in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=ahotw&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/vNEwNR8rSzGPSwSn3yeJwA A History of the World -7], BBC.co.uk, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The sculpture was identified in 1933 by {{ill|René Neuville|fr||de|}}, a French [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|consul]] in [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Neuville represented the French Republic as vice-consul at Jerusalem from 1928 to 1937 and as consul-general from 1946 to 1952; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;ots=FUqickvmd0&amp;dq=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;f=false footnote on page 301 of ''Les Mandats Francais Et Anglais Dans Une Perspective'' (in French)]; he is known for his work with [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids]] in the [[Levant]].&lt;/ref&gt; and prehistorian, when looking through random finds obtained by the French Fathers at [[Bethlehem]]. He found the stone whilst visiting a small museum with [[Henri Breuil|Abbé Breuil]].&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Neuville immediately identified it as important and was able to get an introduction to the [[Bedouin]] who had made the finds at Wadi Khareitoun. He was led to a location within the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves and it is from these caves that the sculpture gets its name. Excavations of the caves revealed that the cave had been used domestically thousands of years ago and the finds were [[Natufian]]. For this reason it is thought that the figurine was used domestically and had not been left there as part of a funeral.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The person who made the sculpture came from the [[Natufians]], an early [[Epipaleolithic]] culture whose members are thought to be the first humans to gather grass seeds that remained attached to their stems.&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; This is an important step in agriculture as it eventually allowed farmers to choose which seeds to eat and which to keep to sow the following season.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; These people hunted gazelle and are the first known to domesticate dogs,&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock1995"&gt;{{Citation |title=The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people |last=Clutton-Brock |first=Juliet |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Serpell, James |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-41529-2 |pages= |chapter=Origins of the dog: domestication and early history }}&lt;/ref&gt; sheep, and goats which also involves [[selective breeding]]. It has been speculated that the stability of having a managed food programme allowed the Natufians to create large communities of two to three hundred people and to create [[art]].&lt;ref name=trans&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00q2p68 A History of the World in 100 objects - Part 7], BBC Radio 4, 26 January 2010, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode7/ transcript], accessed 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The sculpture was made by carving a single "[[calcite]] cobble" which was picked away with a stone point to identify the position of the couple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although it lacks details, such as faces, it is considered to be a clever piece of sculpture. Artist [[Marc Quinn]] has noted that the figure looks different depending on the viewer's perspective, and may resemble a couple, a penis, breasts, or a vagina depending on this perspective,&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; or two testicles when viewed upside-down, from the bottom. Quinn compared it to a modern pornographic film where the action may include close-ups and long shots. It is clear that the figures in the couple are facing each other, but the gender of the figures can only be presumed.&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt;

==Importance and purchase==
After the death of René Neuville in 1952, it was purchased by the [[British Museum]] at Sotheby's in 1958 from M. Y. Neuville.&lt;ref name=bmdb&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1358965&amp;partid=1 figurine], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The object formed the basis of an episode of ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', a BBC radio programme in January 2010 about the dawn of agriculture.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The '''''Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] about [[dress]] and [[ornament (art)|ornament]]ation of the body in different cultures throughout history. It explores themes of personal and social identity related to the universal activity of dressing one's self. Its ten volumes are dedicated to describing and interpreting dress and fashion in different places throughout the world, and are organized geographically. The last volume reviews the global perspectives through research and study of the present-day and the future of dress and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhub-bcn.cat/en/dhubdoc/berg-encyclopedia-world-dress-and-fashion-0 ''Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515182235/http://dhub-bcn.cat/en/dhubdoc/berg-encyclopedia-world-dress-and-fashion-0 |date=May 15, 2012 }} at [[Disseny Hub Barcelona]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Composed of 760 articles and written by more than 600 international experts, it includes multidisciplinary and pluricultural perspectives that allow us to understand the richness and complexity of dress in all of its manifestations. The definitions of dress, apparel and fashion are the starting point and the principal focus of the various contributions: dress is analyzed as a body modification, apparel is connected to history or the exhibition in a [[museum]], and fashion corresponds to the changes related to body alterations and ornamentation, over short periods of time.

== Prizes and awards ==
The ''Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion'' was awarded with the [[Dartmouth Medal]] for the creation of a reference work of outstanding quality and significance, in 2011. This prize is awarded to reference works (dictionaries, encyclopedias, image banks, etc.) by the [[American Library Association]] and it was the first time, that an award has been given to a work in the design sector.

It has also been the recipient of an Award at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2011 and the Best Web 2011 prize by FutureBook bookstore.

[[File:Bowler hat, Vienna, mid-20th century.jpg|thumb|Bowler hat, mid-20th century ([[Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation|PFF]] collection).]]

The '''bowler hat''', also known as a '''billycock''', '''bob hat''', '''bombín''' or '''derby''' (USA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagehatshop.com/content/32/hat-glossary.html|title=Hat Glossary - Village Hat Shop|website=www.villagehatshop.com|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a hard [[felt]] [[hat]] with a rounded crown, originally created by the London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler during 1849.&lt;ref name="bowler history"/&gt; It has traditionally been worn with [[semi-formal attire|semi-formal]] and [[informal attire]]. The bowler, a protective and durable hat style, was popular with the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[United States|American]] [[working class]]es during the second half of the 19th century, and later with the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es in the [[United Kingdom]], Ireland, and the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] United States.&lt;ref name=holkham&gt;{{cite web | title = The history of the Bowler hat at Holkham | publisher = Coke Estates Ltd. | url = http://holkham.co.uk/downloads/THEHISTORYOFTHEBOWLERHATATHOLKHAM.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141222132855/http://holkham.co.uk/downloads/THEHISTORYOFTHEBOWLERHATATHOLKHAM.pdf | archivedate = 22 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The bowler hat is said to have been designed during 1849 by the London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler to fulfill an order placed by the company of hatters [[James Lock &amp; Co.]] of [[St James's]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; which had been commissioned by a customer to design a close-fitting, low-crowned hat to protect [[gamekeeper]]s from low-hanging branches while on horseback at [[Holkham Hall]], the estate of Thomas Coke, [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)]] in [[Norfolk]]. The keepers had previously worn [[top hat]]s, which were knocked off easily and damaged.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; The identity of the customer is less certain, with many suggesting it was William Coke.&lt;ref name=Roetzel&gt;Roetzel, Bernhard (1999). ''Gentleman's Guide to Grooming and Style''. Barnes &amp; Noble.&lt;/ref&gt; However research performed by a younger relation of the 1st Earl casts doubt on this story, and it is now believed that the bowler was invented for [[Edward Coke (1824–1889)|Edward Coke]], the younger brother of Thomas Coke, [[Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester|2nd Earl of Leicester]].&lt;ref name=holkham/&gt; When Edward Coke arrived in London on 17 December 1849 to collect his hat he reportedly placed it on the floor and stamped hard on it twice to test its strength; the hat withstood this test and Coke paid 12 shillings for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Swinnerton | first = Jo | title = The History of Britain Companion | publisher = Robson | year = 2005 | page = 42 | isbn = 1-86105-914-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance in the British Isles ==
[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (012).JPG|thumb|right|Members of the [[Orange Order]] celebrating [[The Twelfth]], Belfast 2011]]

The bowler has had varying degrees of significance in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]. Popular among the working classes in the 19th century, from the early 20th century bowler hats were commonly associated with businessmen working in the financial districts, also known as "City Gents". The traditional wearing of bowler hats with City business attire declined during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="bowler history"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8045026/History-of-the-Bowler-Hat.html |title=History of the Bowler Hat |work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During modern times bowlers are not common, although the so-called City Gent remains a stereotype of Englishmen, wearing a bowler and carrying a rolled [[umbrella]]. For this reason, two bowler-hatted men were used in the logo of the British building society (subsequently bank), [[Bradford &amp; Bingley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7641493.stm |title=Who'll get custody of Bradford and Bingley's bowler hat? |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] the bowler hat is worn traditionally by members of the main [[Loyalist]] fraternities such as the [[Orange Order]], the [[Independent Loyal Orange Institution]], the [[Royal Black Preceptory]] and the [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] for their parades and annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowler Hats, Sashes and Banners: the Orange Order in Northern Ireland|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/30876/bowler-hats-sashes-and-banners-orange-order-northern-ireland#media-30870|publisher=Demotix|accessdate=21 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506052951/http://www.demotix.com/news/30876/bowler-hats-sashes-and-banners-orange-order-northern-ireland#media-30870#media-30870|archive-date=6 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bowler, not the [[cowboy hat]] or [[sombrero]], was the most popular hat in the American West, prompting [[Lucius Beebe]] to call it "the hat that won the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hat That Won the West | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19571026&amp;id=xQQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PkgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7036,5636283 | accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cowboys and railroad workers preferred the hat because it would not blow off easily in strong wind while riding a horse, or when sticking one's head out the window of a speeding train. It was worn by both lawmen and [[outlaw]]s, including [[Bat Masterson]], [[Butch Cassidy]], [[Black Bart (outlaw)|Black Bart]], and [[Billy the Kid]]. In the United States the hat came to be known commonly as the ''derby'',&lt;ref name=Roetzel/&gt; and American outlaw [[Marion Hedgepeth]] was commonly referred to as "the Derby Kid".

In South America, the bowler, known as {{lang|es|bombín}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], has been worn by [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] women since the 1920s, when it was introduced to Bolivia by British railway workers. For many years, a factory in Italy manufactured such hats for the Bolivian market, but they are now made locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Eigo | first = Tim | title = Bolivian Americans | work = Countries and Their Cultures | url = http://www.everyculture.com/multi/A-Br/Bolivian-Americans.html | accessdate = 13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture ==
[[File:Stan Laurel c1920.jpg|thumb|200px|lright|English comedian [[Stan Laurel]] took his standard comic devices from the British [[music hall]]: the bowler hat, the deep comic gravity, and nonsensical understatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=John|title=The Comedy World of Stan Laurel|date=2004|publisher=Robson|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The bowler hat became used famously by certain actors, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Curly Howard]], and [[John Cleese]], and also by the fictional character of [[John Steed]] of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', played by [[Patrick Macnee]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8043423/Bowler-hat-makes-a-comeback.html "Bowler hat makes a comeback"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London). Retrieved 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1964 film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', set in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] [[London]], 1910, the London banker George Banks (played by [[David Tomlinson]]) wears a bowler. The British building society [[Bradford &amp; Bingley]] registered more than 100 separate trademarks featuring the bowler hat, its long-running [[logo]].&lt;ref name="bowler"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7641493.stm |title= Who'll get custody of Bradford and Bingley's bowler hat? |publisher=BBC News |date=30 September 2008 |accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the bank purchased, for £2,000, a bowler hat which had once belonged to [[Stan Laurel]].&lt;ref name="bowler"/&gt;

The bowler is part of the [[Nadsat|Droog]] uniform that the English character [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] wears in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' to the extent that contemporary fancy dress outfits for this character reference the bowler hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clockwork-Orange-Prisoner-Halloween-Costume/dp/B01M8I5HH8|title=Clockwork Orange Fancy Dress Costume Men's Extra Large: Amazon.co.uk: Toys &amp; Games|website=www.amazon.co.uk|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB: Clockwork Orange"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/|title=A Clockwork Orange|date=2 February 1972|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2017|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a chain of restaurants in [[Los Angeles]], California known as [[Brown Derby]]. The first and most famous of these was shaped like a derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://beniciaherald.me/2013/09/27/the-rogue-and-the-little-lady-the-romance-of-wilson-mizner-and-anita-loos/ | title=The Rogue and the Little Lady: The romance of Wilson Mizner and Anita Loos | work=The Bernica Herald | accessdate=1 January 2014 | author=Rubay, Donnell}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chain of Brown Derby restaurants in Ohio are still in business today.

Many paintings by the Belgian surrealist artist [[René Magritte]] feature bowler hats. ''[[The Son of Man]]'' consists of a man in a bowler hat standing in front of a wall. The man's face is largely obscured by a [[Levitation|hover]]ing green [[apple]]. ''[[Golconda (painting)|Golconda]]'' depicts "raining men" all wearing bowler hats.

Choreographer [[Bob Fosse]] frequently incorporated bowler hats into his dance routines. This use of hats as a props, as seen in the 1972 movie ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'', would become one of his trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobfossebio.weebly.com/fosses-inspiration--trademarks.html/|title=Fosse's Inspiration &amp; Trademarks|website=Bob Fosse|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Julian to Gregorian Date Change.png|thumb|This is a visual example of the official date change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian]]

==Conventions==
*Within these tables, January 1 is always the first day of the year.
*The [[Gregorian calendar]] did not exist before October 15, 1582. Gregorian dates before that are ''proleptic'', that is, using the Gregorian rules to reckon backward from October 15, 1582.
*Years are given in [[astronomical year numbering]].
*[[Augustus]] corrected errors in the observance of leap years by omitting leap days until AD 8. [[Julian calendar]] dates before March AD 4 are proleptic, and do not necessarily match the dates actually observed in the [[Roman Empire]]. (Nautical almanac offices of the United Kingdom and United States, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;411)

==Conversion table==
This table is taken from the book by the Nautical almanac offices of the United Kingdom and United States originally published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/astronomicalalmanac1961/page/n427|last=H M Nautical Almanac Office|title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris|date=1974|location=London|pages=416-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using the tables==
Dates near leap days that are observed in the Julian calendar but not in the Gregorian are listed in the table. Dates near the adoption date in some countries are also listed. '''For dates not listed, see below.'''

The usual rules of algebraic addition and subtraction apply; adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the [[absolute value]], and subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the absolute value.

If conversion takes you past a February 29 that exists only in the Julian calendar, then February 29 is counted in the difference.   Years affected are those which divide by 100 without remainder but do not divide by 400 without remainder (e.g., 1900 and 2100 but not 2000).

No guidance is provided about conversion of dates before March 5, -500, or after February 29, 2100 (both being Julian dates).

For unlisted dates, find the date in the table closest to, but earlier than, the date to be converted. Be sure to use the correct column. If converting from Julian to Gregorian, '''add''' the number from the "Difference" column. If converting from Gregorian to Julian, '''subtract'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3600">'''Daniel Cosío Villegas''' (July 23, 1898 – March 10, 1976) was a prominent [[Mexico|Mexican]] economist, essayist, historian, and diplomat.

Cosío Villegas was born in [[Mexico City]]. After studying one year in engineering and two years of philosophy, he received a B.A. in Law from the National University (nowadays [[UNAM]]) and took several courses in economics at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]]. Later, he received master's degrees from the [[London School of Economics]] and the ''École libre de sciences politiques'' of [[Paris]] (now ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]'').

After working briefly for ''[[Excélsior]]'' he joined [[José Vasconcelos]] in the production of ''La Antorcha'' magazine. In 1929, he served as secretary general of the National University, counselor to the [[Bank of Mexico]], director of the National School of Economics of the National University (1933–1934), director of ''El Trimestre Económico'' and founded the [[Fondo de Cultura Económica]], one of the most renowned publishing companies in [[Latin America]].

On April 2, 1951 he was admitted to the [[Colegio Nacional (Mexico)|National College]] and from 1957 until 1963 he chaired [[El Colegio de México]], whose library now bears his name. Simultaneously, he was the Mexican Ambassador to the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] and became its president in 1959. He received the National Literature Award in 1971 and in 1976 he published ''Memorias'' (''Memoirs'').

Several weeks after publishing his memoirs, he died in Mexico City. Cosio Villegas was known for being a heavy smoker, even his last days.

'''Richard George Scott''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM|size=85%}} (born 1923) is a New Zealand historian and journalist.

==Work==
His first book, ''151 Days'', an account of the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute]], was published in 1952.&lt;ref name="OxfordNZ"&gt;{{Cite book| editor1-last = Robinson | editor1-first = Roger | editor2-last = Wattie | editor2-first = Nelson | title =The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature | publisher=Oxford University Press | year =1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott's most well-known work is ''Ask That Mountain'' (1975), which recounts the events of the non-violent Māori resistance to European occupation at [[Parihaka]]. The story had largely been forgotten by non-Māori New Zealanders until the book's publication. It has been reprinted nine times, and former New Zealand Prime Minister, [[Helen Clark]], called it "one of New Zealand's most influential books".&lt;ref name="newword"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewword.com/non-fiction/dscott.html |title=Dick Scott - The New Word |publisher= [[Creative New Zealand]] |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZBC" /&gt; Scott also published an earlier, briefer account of the events in 1954, ''The Parihaka Story''.&lt;ref name="OxfordNZ" /&gt;

Scott has written several histories related to the [[Auckland]] region, such as ''In Old Mount Albert: Being a History of the District'' (1961), ''Fire on the Clay: The Pakeha Comes to West Auckland'' (1979) and ''Seven Lives on Salt River'' (1979), which won the [[New Zealand Book Awards|New Zealand Book Award]] for Non-fiction. He has also written more general New Zealand works, including ''Inheritors of a Dream: A Pictorial History of New Zealand'' (1962) and ''Winemakers of New Zealand'' (1964), and Pacific histories such as ''Years of the Pooh-Bah: A Cook Islands History'' (1991) and ''Would a Good Man Die? Niue Island, New Zealand, and the late Mr Larsen'' (1993).&lt;ref name="OxfordNZ" /&gt;

In 2004, Scott published his autobiography, ''Dick Scott: A Radical Writer's Life'', which recounts his early years in the Communist Party, as well as his writing approach and career.&lt;ref name="NZBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/Writers/Profiles/Scott,%20Dick |title=Scott, Dick |publisher= [[New Zealand Book Council]] |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZHeraldRev"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=9001816 |title=Dick Scott: A Radical Writer's Life (review) |publisher= [[New Zealand Herald]] |last=Stone |first=Russell |accessdate=11 February 2012 |date=6 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott has stated that he no longer writes, and hasn't re-read any of his books for "as long as I can remember ... You don't re-read old history".&lt;ref name="NZHeraldIV"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10716512 |title=Michele Hewitson Interview: Dick Scott |publisher= [[New Zealand Herald]] |last=Hewitson |first=Michele |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Scott was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to historical research in the [[2002 Birthday Honours|2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Julbilee Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/384 |title=Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee honours list 2002 |date=3 June 2002 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 he received the [[Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement]] in Non-fiction.&lt;ref name="NZBC" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Scott has five children, and lives with his second wife in the suburb of [[Mount Eden]], in Auckland, New Zealand. One of his children is the novelist [[Rosie Scott]].&lt;ref name="NZHeraldIV" /&gt;

In 2011, Scott made headlines when he auctioned a [[Don Binney]] painting that he had owned for almost 50 years, and donated the NZD $300,000 proceeds to the [[Christchurch earthquake]] appeal.&lt;ref name="NZHeraldIV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webbs.co.nz/auction-item/kotare-over-ratana-church-te-kao-0 |title=Lot 26: Kotare Over Ratana Church, Te Kao |publisher=Webb's |accessdate=11 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119184733/http://www.webbs.co.nz/auction-item/kotare-over-ratana-church-te-kao-0 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">'''Edward Ernest Hughes''' (7 February 1877 &amp;ndash; 23 December 1953) was the first professor of history at [[University College, Swansea]].

==Life==
Hughes was born on 7 February 1877 in [[Tywyn]], [[Merionethshire]], Wales.  As a result of a childhood accident, he was blind in one eye and his other eye was damaged; he compensated by developing his memory and hearing.  After studying at [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] grammar school, he obtained a first-class degree in history from the [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]] in 1898.  He then obtained a second-class honours degree in modern history from [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1902.  He taught history in the boys' school in [[Llanelli]], south Wales before his appointment as lecturer in history at [[University College, Cardiff]], acting as professor during the illness of the incumbent.  He lectured on Welsh history for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] in Glamorgan at a time when there was no [[extramural]] department at the university.  He was regarded as a "gifted story-teller" and did much to popularise the study of Welsh history.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

He moved to the [[University College, Swansea]] when it was founded in 1920 after being persuaded to do so by the principal, [[Franklin Sibly]], who wanted a Welshman who understood what the new college would need to do in an industrial area.  Hughes, who was the only Arts lecturer for a time, did much to bring the college to the public's attention.  He raised funds by lecturing on Welsh history in the area and donating the proceeds to set up the library of the college.  He was appointed the first professor of history in 1926, but continued to lecture (in both Welsh and English) outside the university to classes and societies.  He required every student in his department to study some Welsh history, but he had [[Glyn Roberts]] (later to be Professor of Welsh History at [[University College, Bangor]]) to teach these classes, since Roberts had research qualifications that Hughes could not obtain with his worsening eyesight.  Hughes taught the constitutional history of England in the Middle Ages and also Europe after the fall of Rome. He retired in 1944, and died on 23 December 1953.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

Outside the university, he was chairman of the Swansea Drama Company (acting and producing as well), and of the Swansea Orpheus Musical Society.  He was a council member and drama adjudicator of the [[National Eisteddfod]], served on committees of the [[University of Wales]] and was a governor of the [[National Library of Wales]]. He also broadcast on the BBC in Wales.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|title=Hughes, Edward Ernest (1877&amp;ndash;1953), first professor of history at the University College, Swansea, and a notable intermediary between the university and the public|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-HUGH-ERN-1877.html|last=Henry Jones|first=Marian|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Scott''' (born 8 July 1960) is a British archaeologist and politician. She founded the [[Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference]] (TRAC) in 1991.&lt;ref name="TRAC"&gt;{{cite web|title=TRAC Proceedings 1991|url=http://trac.org.uk/publications/pubs/#trac-1991-newcastle-upon-tyne-open-access|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Scott is from the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="scott blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio and career|url=http://eleanorscottarchaeology.com/bio-and-career/|website=Eleanor Scott Archaeology|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Newcastle University]] in 1982, subsequently completing her PhD on Romano-British villas funded by the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="scott blog"/&gt; Scott has published several monographs and contributed many articles to journals in addition to contributing to public outreach programmes such as the [[Day of Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/author/e-scott/
|title=THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL WRITER – MY OWN PAST IS MY NEW DAY ||author1=Scott, E. |publisher=Day of Archaeology |date=28 July 2017 |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott founded the Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference in 1991.&lt;ref name="TRAC"/&gt; TRAC was founded as a response of criticism in the late 1980s of a lack of theoretical basis in Roman archaeology and the conference has since become an annual series. The progression of scholars participating in these conferences into academia and museums has consequently positioned theory at the core of Roman Archaeology and changed the direction of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laurence|first1=Ray|title=Roman archaeology for historians|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0415505925|page=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
Scott was a Liberal Democrat member of [[Portsmouth City Council]] from 2002-2015, and she resigned in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Fishwick |title=Councillor resigns over Hancock cabinet job decision|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/politics/councillor-resigns-over-hancock-cabinet-job-decision-1-5834001|publisher= Johnston Publishing|date=26 January 2014 |accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portsmouth City Council]] conferred the title of honorary alderman on her in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agenda for Full Council on Tuesday, 12th July, 2016, 2.00 pm|url=http://democracy.portsmouth.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=3506|accessdate=15 September 2017|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engen''' (延元) was a [[Japanese era name|Japanese era]] of the Southern Court during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Kenmu]] and before [[Kōkoku]], lasting from February 1336 to April 1340.&lt;ref name="nussbaum961"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Engen''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 178;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt;  Reigning Emperors were [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] and [[Emperor Go-Murakami]] in the south and [[Emperor Kōmyō]] in the north.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[Image:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct.  They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]]| Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]   
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Re4djF3oaTMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA199&amp;dq=1911+texbook+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology,'' p. 199 n57], citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

'''François Bordes''' (December 30, 1919 &amp;ndash; April 30, 1981), also known by the [[pen name]] of '''Francis Carsac''', was a French scientist, [[geology|geologist]], and [[archaeology|archaeologist]].

==Biography==
He was a professor of [[prehistory]] and [[quaternary geology]] at the [[Science Faculty of Bordeaux]]. He decisively renewed the approach of focusing on prehistoric lithic industries, introducing statistical studies in typology and expanding the use of experimental [[flint knapping]].  He was known among archaeologists throughout the world for his ability to replicate ancient stone implements.

He also published many science fiction novels under his pen name. His books have not been translated into English. On the other hand, in the [[USSR]] the science fiction of Carsac was very popular. He was translated and published into [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] amongst others.

'''François Chamoux''' (4 April 1915 – 21 October 2007) was a French [[Hellenistic period|Hellenist]] and archaeologist, a member of the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/reg_0035-2039_2008_num_121_2_7975 Edmond Lévy, « Allocution de M. Edmond Lévy, président de l’Association », ''Revue des Études Grecques'', tome 121, fascicule 2, July–December 2008, (p.&amp;nbsp;21–23).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Where he was elected in 1981 to replace [[André Parrot]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Chamoux attended lyceums in [[Chartres]] and [[Metz]] and the [[Lycée Henri IV]] in Paris and studied from 1934 at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and was Agrégé des lettres in classical languages in 1938. After that, he served in World War II (where he received the Silver Croix de Guerre) and in 1941 was severely wounded. Between 1943 and 1948 he was a student at the [[French School at Athens]]. Subsequently, he served as an assistant at the [[University of Lille]] and the [[Sorbonne]] and teacher in a Parisian high school (''lycée''). In 1952 he was awarded his doctorate at the Sorbonne for his thesis dedicated to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyren]] under the [[Battiadae]] and the [[Charioteer of Delphi]] and was subsequently professor at [[Nancy (France)|Nancy]] and from 1960 to 1983 Professor of Greek literature and civilization at the Sorbonne.

He also wrote overviews for Greek culture and art history and a biography of [[Mark Antony]]. He was both an excellent connoisseur of Greek art and ancient Greek poetry (especially [[epigram]]s). As Homer connoisseur, he regularly attended the symposia in Chios.

He did a lot of excavations in Greece (already in his time at the École francaise in Athens in the 1940s), among others in [[Delphi]], [[Thasos]], and the colonies of [[Cyrene, Libya|Kyrene]] in Libya .

From 1981 he was a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] and from 1974 to 1987 he was editor of the ''Revue des Études grecques''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3024">'''Gaius Asinius Quadratus''' ([[floruit|fl.]] AD 248) was a [[Koine Greek|Greek]] historian of [[Rome]] and [[Parthia]] in the third century. He was a senator who wrote a 15-book history of Rome, ''[[Chilieteris]]'' ("The Millennium"), which, according to the [[Suda]], covered the period from the founding of Rome until the rule of [[Alexander Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=N.G.L|last2=Scullard|first2=H.H.|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|date=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198691173|page=905|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a ''Parthika'' in nine books, presumably a narrative of the [[Parthia]]n campaigns of the preceding century. Some scholars attribute to him a ''Germanika'', as well, although this is debated. All of his works were in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Thirty fragments of his work remain, which have been published by [[Felix Jacoby]] in the ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]''. Most of these derive from the dictionary of [[Stephanus of Byzantium]].

The "thousand years" of Quadratus' title has been explained in various ways. Jacoby argues that Quadratus unusually dated the founding of Rome to the first [[Olympiad]] in 776. Zecchini, though, claims that Quadratus used the traditional dating of the founding of Rome and intended the work to extend to 248, when [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated the first millennium, but that he died before its completion.

[[Asinius (disambiguation)|Asinius]] is the [[Roman naming conventions|''nomen'']] of the [[Asinia (gens)|''gens'' Asinia]] of ancient Rome. He was the son of Gaius Julius Asinius Quadratus, who was brother of Gaius Asinius Rufus (born ''circa'' 160) and [[Gaius Asinius Quadratus Protimus]] (born ''circa'' 165), [[Proconsul]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] ''circa'' 211 or in 220. These brothers were sons of Gaius Asinius Nicomachus (born ''circa'' 135) and his wife and cousin Julia Quadratilla (born ''circa'' 145) (or perhaps Asinia Marcellina, descendant of the family of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 23)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]]), and grandchildren of [[Gaius Asinius Rufus]] (''circa'' 110 - after 136), a notable in [[Lydia]] in 134 and 135 who became a  [[Roman senator]] in 136, and wife Julia.

The '''General Intelligence and Security Service''' ({{lang-nl|'''Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst''' ('''AIVD''')}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈɑlɣəmeːnə ˈʔɪnlɪxtɪŋə(n) ɛn ˈvɛiləxɦɛitsdinst}}) is the [[Intelligence agency|Intelligence]] and [[Security agency]] of the [[Netherlands]], tasked with Domestic, Foreign and [[Signals intelligence|Signals]] Intelligence and protecting [[national security]].

==History==
Its predecessor was the 1945–1947 Bureau of National Security ({{lang-nl|[[:nl:Bureau Nationale Veiligheid|Bureau voor Nationale Veiligheid]]}} and later known as the Domestic Security Service ({{lang-nl|Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst (BVD)}}).
For the gathering of intelligence abroad, the Foreign Intelligence Service (Buitenlandse Inlichtingendienst or BID, renamed to Inlichtingendienst Buitenland (IDB) in 1972) had existed since 1946. This service was located in Villa Maarheeze in Wassenaar, just north of The Hague. IDB was dissolved in 1994 after heavy internal turmoil. The foreign intelligence task was eventually handed over to the BVD, which in doing so turned into a combined Intelligence and Security Service. For this reason, it was rebranded Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) on 29 May 2002 .

==Mission==
The AIVD focuses mostly on domestic non-military threats to Dutch [[national security]], whereas the [[Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service|Military Intelligence and Security Service]] (MIVD) focuses on international threats, specifically military and government-sponsored threats such as espionage. The AIVD,  its predecessor BVD, is charged with collecting intelligence and assisting in combating  domestic and foreign threats to national security.

==Oversight and accountability==
The [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] is politically responsible for the AIVD's actions. Oversight is provided by three bodies:
* A review board for the use of special powers by intelligence and security services (Dutch: ''[https://www.tib-ivd.nl/ Toetsingscommissie Inzet Bevoegdheden]'', TIB) appointed by the [[Second Chamber]] of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]].
* An oversight committee (Dutch: ''Commissie van Toezicht op de Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdiensten'', CTIVD) also appointed by the [[Second Chamber]] of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]].
* The Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services (Dutch: ''Commissie voor de Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdiensten'', CIVD), comprising the leaders of all political parties represented in the [[Second Chamber]] of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], although until 2009 the Socialist Party (SP) was not and did not want to be part of this committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nos.nl/audio/25231-agnes-kant-over-toetreding-tot-commissie-stiekem.html |publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] |title=Agnes Kant over toetreding tot 'Commissie Stiekem |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226152842/http://nos.nl/audio/25231-agnes-kant-over-toetreding-tot-commissie-stiekem.html |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIVD publishes an annual report which includes its budget. The published version contains redactions where information is deemed sensitive.

The AIVD can be forced by the courts to publish any records held on a private citizen, but it may keep secret information that is relevant to current cases. No information that is less than five years old will be provided under any circumstance to private citizens about their records.

==Activities==
Its main activities include:
* monitoring specific people and groups of people, such as political extremists and Islamic extremists 
* sourcing intelligence to and from foreign and domestic intelligence services
* performing background checks on individuals employed in "positions of trust," specifically public office and higher-up or privileged positions in industry (such as telecommunications, banks, and the largest companies){{spaced ndash}}this ironically includes members of parliamentary oversight committees
* investigating incidents such as terrorist bombings and threats
* giving advice and warning about risks to national security, including advising on the protection of national leadership
* Netherlands National Communications Security Agency, advising on communication security for government users

==Methods and authorities==
Its methods and authorities include:
* telephone and internet taps authorized by the minister of internal affairs (as opposed to a court order)
* [[Espionage|infiltration]] (rarely by employees of the service, but rather by outsiders who would have easy access to a particular group)
* the use of [[informant]]s (existing members of groups that are recruited)
* open sources intelligence
* unfettered access to police intelligence
* the use of foreign intelligence service liaisons who reside in the Netherlands under a diplomatic status (including full [[diplomatic immunity]]) to collect intelligence in excess of the AIVD's authority

The latter is technically the same as sourcing intelligence from a foreign intelligence service; this method has not been confirmed.

The AIVD operates in tight concert with the Regional Intelligence Service (Regionale Inlichtingen Dienst, RID), to which members of the police are appointed in every police district. It also co-operates with over one hundred intelligence services.

==Criticism==
The service has been criticized for:
* Soon after the arrest of the Dutch businessman [[Frans van Anraat]], who has been convicted of complicity in war crimes for selling raw materials for the production of chemical weapons to Iraq during the reign of [[Saddam Hussein]], Dutch newspapers reported that van Anraat had been an informer of the Dutch secret service AIVD and has enjoyed AIVD's protection.
* letting go of [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who stole Dutch nuclear knowledge and used it for [[Pakistan]] to produce its [[nuclear bomb]]. However, former [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] [[Ruud Lubbers]] claimed in 2005 that this was done on a foreign request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2005/050809-khan-cia.htm |title=CIA asked us to let nuclear spy go, Ruud Lubbers claims |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* not having enough focus and intelligence on Islamic groups, particularly following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the murder of [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] by [[Mohammed Bouyeri]], a member of the [[Hofstad Network]] of [[Islamist terrorism]]
* not having enough focus and intelligence on political violence or environmental groups, particularly following the murder of [[Pim Fortuyn]] by an environmental radical
* delivering hand grenades to members of the Hofstadgroep through alleged informer Saleh Bouali
* investigating family members of the Queen that had had a family rift ([[Princess Margarita, Countess of Colorno|Princess Margarita]] and {{ill|Edwin De Roy van Zuydewijn|nl}}), though this was not ordered by the minister of internal affairs, but rather by the Queen's office
* losing a laptop and a floppy disk with classified information from a regional office of the AIVD. The disk was found by an employee of a car rental agency, and subsequently given to Dutch crime-journalist [[Peter R. de Vries]]. Information on the disks indicated that the service collected information on Dutch politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] and members of his party, as well as on left-wing activists. Among other things, the documents accuse Pim Fortuyn of having sex with underage Moroccan boys.

During the [[Cold War]] the BVD had a reputation for interviewing potential employers of persons they deemed suspicious for any reason, thereby worrying corporations about the employment of these persons. Reasons for being suspect included leftist ideals, membership of the [[Communistische Partij Nederland|Dutch Communist Party]], or a spotty military record (such as being a [[conscientious objector]] with regard to [[conscription]]), although no evidence of the latter has ever been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/31094168/items/31207078/ |title=Geschiedenis 24 - Voorgoed ongeschikt |publisher=Geschiedenis.vpro.nl |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and results==
It is often said that the Netherlands has the largest absolute number of [[Telephone tapping|wiretaps]] and internet taps in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsterdamherald.com/index.php/allnews-list/306-20120523-one-in-1000-dutch-phones-wiretap-interception-police-evidence-gatherin One in 1000 Dutch phones wiretapped], ''Amsterdam Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/how_they_do_it/2006/02/wiretapping_europeanstyle.html|title=Wiretapping, European-Style|first=Eric|last=Weiner|date=14 February 2006|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/07/dutch-police-phone-taps-now-automatically-include-internet/ Police phone taps now automatically include internet], DutchNews.nl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.edri.org/edrigram/number23/cryptophone|title=Dutch parliament questions crypto telephone - EDRI|website=history.edri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elsevierweekblad.nl/politiek/news/2014/02/niet-amerika-maar-nederland-tapte-18-miljoen-gesprekken-1457618W/ Niet Amerika, maar Nederland onderschepte 1,8 miljoen telefoontjes (about how the AIVD tapped 1,8 million foreign phone calls not related to the Netherlands at all)], Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; but that refers to police wiretaps, and  Dutch police rarely uses other observation methods, like infiltration or bugging houses.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

It is likely that the AIVD has significant influence in police and prosecution circles, given recent cases of suspected terrorists being prosecuted (and found not guilty) or successfully extradited ([[Mullah Krekar]]) without credible ''non-secret'' evidence.

==Cozy Bear==
On January 25, 2018 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper [[de Volkskrant]] and TV program [[Nieuwsuur]] reported that in 2014 the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) successfully infiltrated the computers of [[Cozy Bear]] and observed the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|hacking]] of the head office of the [[Democratic National Committee]] and subsequently The White House and were the first to alert the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) about the cyber-intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2213767-dutch-intelligence-first-to-alert-u-s-about-russian-hack-of-democratic-party.html Dutch intelligence first to alert U.S. about Russian hack of Democratic Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''Gerson Levi-Lazzaris''' (born November 25, 1979 in [[Curitiba]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian archaeologist, descendent of [[Ladin people|Ladin]] immigrants. Most of the Lazzaris are from [[Forno di Zoldo]], [[Veneto]], from where most of them emigrated during the end of the 19th century, and also after the [[Second World War]] to [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]] and [[United States]].

== Biography ==
In 1983, his family moved from [[Curitiba]] to [[São Paulo]]. At the age of 15 he moved to [[Lisbon, Portugal]], following a short-experience in [[Finland]]. Accepted in the [[University of São Paulo]], Levi-Lazzaris started his studies in Archaeology and History, focusing [[Anti-semitism]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (2003), obtaining his BA. In 2007 he obtained a master's degree in Archaeology in the same University of São Paulo based on an extensive dissertation about [[Middle Holocene]] hunter-gatherer societies in [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]]. He introduced the ecosystem approach in Brazilian archaeology. On March 2007 he was accepted as graduate student at [[Vanderbilt University]].

Levi-Lazzaris has published articles ranging from political reviews in Trotskyite periodicals to scientific reviews and governamental reports. He has also translated books. Levi-Lazzaris developed his doctoral research in Roraima among the [[Ninam Indians]], a [[Yanomamo]] subgroup,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethnoarchaelogy.blogspot.com NINAM ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY AND INDIGENOUS RIGHTS - Yanomami e Ye'kuana manifestam seu pesar pelo falecimento do antropologo Luis Fernando Pereira]&lt;/ref&gt; developing ethnoarchaeological studies in the Uraricoera valley. He was the second coordinator of the [[Frente de Proteção Etnoambiental Yanomami e Ye´kuana]] through [[FUNAI]] during 2010-2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/anthro/graduate/current_graduate_students Vanderbilt University - Department of Anthropology - Current graduate students]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghazar Parpetsi''' ({{lang-hy|Ղազար Փարպեցի}}, {{lang-la|Lazarus Pharpensis}}; '''Ghazar of Parpi''', alternatively spelled as '''Lazar Parpetsi''' and '''Łazar Parpetsi''') was a 5th to 6th century [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[chronicler]] and [[historian]]. He had close ties with the powerful [[Mamikonian]] noble family and is most prominent for writing a history of Armenia, ''History of Armenia'', sometime in the early sixth century.

==Life==
Ghazar was born in the village of [[Parpi]] (near the town of [[Ashtarak]] in Armenia, then under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule), and was raised by a princess of the Mamikonian family.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} Melik-Bakhshyan, Stepan. ''«Ղազար Փարպեցի»'' (Ghazar Parpetsi). [[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]. vol. vii. Yerevan: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1981, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Muradyan|2018}} Owing to the close ties he held with the Mamikonian family, following the defeat of the Armenians at the [[battle of Avarayr]] in 451, Ghazar moved to the Mamikonian Prince Ashusah's castle in [[Gugark]], where he received his primary education. Studying under the auspices of Aghan Artstruni, he befriended [[Vahan Mamikonian]]; he was an excellent student and from 465 to 470 he attended school in [[Constantinople]], learning new languages, studying [[religion]], [[literature]], and [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"&gt;Hacikyan, Agop Jack, Gabriel Basmajian, Nourhan Ouzounian and Edward S. Franchuk. ''The Heritage of Armenian Literature: The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age, vol. 1''. Detroit: Wayne State University, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8143-2815-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}} Returning to Armenia, Ghazar busied himself with educational and spiritual activities in the town of [[Shirak (town)|Shirak]], then part of the domains of the [[Kamsarakan]] family. From 484 to 486, he lived in [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]] until Vahan Mamikonian, who had been recently appointed the head of [[Marzpanate Period|marzpan Armenia]], invited him to oversee the reconstruction of a monastery being built in [[Vagharshapat]].&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Vahan appointed Ghazar an [[abbot]] at the monastery, although the education that Ghazar had received as well as his educational and spiritual policies did not suit well with the more conservative elements of the church. Accusing him of [[heresy]], he was forced out of the monastery in 490, taking up residence in the city of [[Diyarbakır|Amida]] in [[Byzantium]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;{{rp|214}}

According to Armenian tradition, it is said that Ghazar was buried near the ruins of an Armenian church in Parpi Canyon, south of a village named Lazrev in Armenia.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;

==Works==
Ghazar is best known for writing the ''History of Armenia''. After returning from Amida in 493, Vahan Mamikonian asked his friend to write a new history of Armenia, starting from where historian [[Faustus of Byzantium]] left off; that is, with the reign of king [[Arshak II|Arsaces II (Arshak II)]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;{{rp|215}} ''History'' is composed of three parts: the first is about Armenian history from the mid-fourth century and life in Armenia under Sasanian rule until the deaths of Sahak Partev and [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in the mid-fifth century; the second concerns the events leading up to the [[battle of Avarayr]] as well as its subsequent consequences; and the third follows up on the Vartanank wars and the 484 signing of the [[Nvarsak Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;{{rp|215–6}} The main sources he uses in ''History'' are the primary works of other historians, [[Agathangelos]], [[Koryun]], and Faustus, although he apparently made use of other historians' works, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bedrosian, Robert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12101">'''Health in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]''' was impacted by the [[Balkan War]] of the early 1990s, during which Bosnia and Herzegovina declared their independence. Bosnia faced many challenges during the war, including bombings throughout the country that ruined much of the infrastructure. Parallel regimes took over Bosnia and flipped the country upside down with land mines, bullets, and bombings. The war displaced over 800,000 refugees and killed over 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"&gt;"Bosnia-Herzegovina." United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. United States Holocaust Memorial Council, n.d. Web. 09 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The war in Bosnia also consisted of an ethnic "cleanse" of Bosnian Muslims initiated by Bosnian Serbs, which included containment of Bosniaks in concentration camps. The war ended with NATO involvement and the Dayton Agreement in 1995.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"/&gt; The Dayton Agreement acknowledges Bosnia and Herzegovina as a democratic country and the country is moving toward the basic principals that accompany that, such as civil rights and equality. During the war there was minimal attention given to the standard of health and major public health concerns, such as pest control, hygiene, disinfection, and import and export programs, were all interrupted or stopped.&lt;ref name="Cain"&gt;Cain, J. et al. In Cain, J. and Jakubowski, E., eds. Health care systems in transition: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copenhagen, European Observatory on Health Care Systems, 4(7) (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
The war affected Bosnia in many ways. The war torn country not only lost much of the infrastructure, but the economy and the governmental system were also affected. It is estimated that there are still thousands of people living as refugees and a large portion of the population still fall under the United Nations High Commission of Refugees category of a refugee or displaced person.&lt;ref name="Health Care Systems 2002"&gt;Cain, J. et al. In Cain, J. and Jakubowski, E., eds. Health care systems in
transition: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copenhagen, European Observatory on
Health Care Systems, 4(7) (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The shortcomings of the current health care system include the lack of communication between health care centers, lack of skills, and lack of standards that are uniform throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Cain"/&gt;

== Health issues ==

The war has resulted in lower socioeconomic statuses of Bosnia's citizens, raised new health concerns, caused epidemiological changes, and changed the focus of the community.&lt;ref&gt;"Strategic Plan for Health Care Development in The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Between 2008 and 2018."

In Cain, J. and Jakubowski, E., eds. Health care systems in transition: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copenhagen, European Observatory on
Health Care Systems, 4(7) (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking is a large problem, as well as increased drug and alcohol use after the war.  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as well as other psychological traumas, have appeared in high numbers after the war.&lt;ref name="Cain"/&gt;
The war in Bosnia was different than other modern day wars in terms of the leading cause of death. It is usually the case that the leading cause of death for civilians is the outbreak of infectious disease, but in Bosnia and Herzegovina the leading cause of death was war-related trauma.&lt;ref name="Kunitz, Stephen 1904"&gt;Kunitz, Stephen.

In 2015 it was estimated that 12.01% of the population has diabetes, costing about $523 per person per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10: Which country has the highest rates of diabetes in Europe?

=== Psychological traumas and disorders ===

The war resulted in increased numbers of psychological traumas and disorders. These can cause the individual to face problems in the workforce as well as their personal and family life, and can even lead to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;"Health Care in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Context of the Return of Refugees and Displaced Persons, Sarajevo." UNHCR News. UNHCR Office of the Chief of Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2001. Web. 09 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently in Bosnia the psychiatric and neurologic departments are just one department, with no differentiation between the two. This can cause issues to arise between patients as well as a lack of specialization when it comes to treatment. [[Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]]  is a rising disorder for the post-war country, yet there is very little treatment or focus on the disease. Most of the treatment is done through Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), who will eventually leave Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="Kunitz, Stephen 1904"/&gt;

== Problems ==

Some of the issues that Bosnia is currently facing in terms of bettering their health care system in order to address the rising health concerns includes the fact that there is not enough technical infrastructure and management capacity to cause change in the short term. There is also a weak regulatory process as well as a lack of communication between local and central levels of the health care system. The country is also still receiving aid from international sources that also lack coordination between international and local services and care; the two sources don't function as one but as two separate providers of care.&lt;ref name="Cain"/&gt;
 
According to some experts programs initiated by NGOs, United Nations, and NATO, to name a few, focused more so on long-term effects instead of focusing on long-term as well as short-term reforms. In many places programs focused on academic settings, for the betterment of medical knowledge and schools, before the people had access to basic public health needs, such as clean water.&lt;ref name="Simunovic, Vladimir J 2007"&gt;Simunovic, Vladimir J. "Health Care in Bosnia and Herzegovina Before, During, and after 1992–1995 War: A Personal Testimony." Conflict and Health. BioMed, 2007. Web. 09 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reforms and programs ==

The Federation Health Program of 1994 was implemented as part of the reform process. This included a set of proposals by the Ministry of Health and created two new laws, the Law on Health Care and the Law on Health Insurance.&lt;ref name="Health Care Systems 2002"/&gt; The Law on Health Care focuses on the delivery of services and the family medicine model. The Law on Health Insurance insures each person receives a basic health care package regardless of income and resources available.&lt;ref name="Health Care Systems 2002"/&gt;
A program launched by the National Research Council, called "Trauma and Reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina", focused on conducting research while including cross-cultural experience for American and Bosnian experts.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Briana S.(2003) 'Post-War Trauma and Reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Observations,
Experiences, and Implications for Marriage and Family Therapy', The American Journal of Family Therapy, 31: 4, 305 —
316&lt;/ref&gt; The program organized meetings with professionals from a variety of organizations, including NGOs, children's homes, and women's organizations to gain a local perspective on what should be done to help address the rising health issues due to war caused trauma. They concluded that around 18%-38% of residents suffered from PTSD during or after the war.&lt;ref name="Simunovic, Vladimir J 2007"/&gt;
Other programs, such as those organized by Doctor's without Borders, Harvard Trauma Program for Refugees, and the International Center for Psychosocial Trauma by the University of Missouri-Columbia were all launched with an aim to help provide further education for family doctors when it came to trauma and psychological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Avdibegović, E., M.

National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2008. Web. 11 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) also led a program, "Mental Health", to help address the trauma issues that this vulnerable population might face.&lt;ref name="Herzegovina 2011"&gt;"Support for the Mental Health System in Bosnia and Herzegovina: SDC and Four Cantons Sign an Agreement." SDC - Close-up. Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21028">The '''history of [[webcomics]]''' follows the advances of technology, art, and business of [[comics]] on the [[Internet]]. The first comics were shared through the Internet in the mid-1980s. Some early webcomics were derivatives from print comics, but when the [[World Wide Web]] became widely popular in the mid-1990s, more people started creating comics exclusively for this medium. By the year 2000, various webcomic creators were financially successful and webcomics became more artistically recognized.

In the second half of the 2000s, webcomics became less financially sustainable due to the rise of [[social media]] and consumers' disinterest in certain kinds of merchandise. However, [[crowdsourcing]] through [[Kickstarter]] and [[Patreon]] also became popular in this period, allowing readers to donate money to webcomic creators directly. The 2010s also saw the rise of [[webtoon]]s in [[South Korea]], where the form has become very prominent.

==Early history (1985&amp;mdash;1995)==

{{see also|List of early webcomics}}

The earliest known graphical comic distributed solely through the Internet was [[Eric Millikin]]'s ''Witches and Stitches'', which he started uploading on [[CompuServe]] in 1985. By self-publishing on the Internet, Millikin was able to share his work without having to worry over censorship and demographics.&lt;ref name="Dochak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thegauntlet.ca/story/pioneering-page|publisher=''[[Gauntlet (newspaper)|Gauntlet]]''|title=Pioneering the page: The decline of print comics, the growth of webcomics and the flexibility, innovation and controversy of both|last=Dochak|first=Sarah|date=2011-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133117/http://m.thegauntlet.ca/story/pioneering-page|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/09/22-awesome-webcomics.html|publisher=''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''|title=14 Awesome Webcomics To Distract You From Getting Things Done|last=Smith|first=Alexander, K.|date=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Joe Ekaitis first uploaded ''[[T.H.E. Fox]]'' on CompuServe, a [[list of furry comics|furry webcomic]] drawn on his [[Commodore 64]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|subject = Joe Ekaitis|interviewer = Sherry, accompanied by Lou Schonder|title = Meet Joe Ekaitis&amp;nbsp;— T.H.E. FOX| url = http://cbmfiles.com/genie/geniefiles/Information/T.H.E.-FOX.TXT| date = 1994-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Jeff Lowenthal| date = July 1989| title = Public Domain| journal = [[.info (magazine)|.info]]| issue = 27| page = 59| publisher = Info Publications| location = Iowa City, Iowa| issn = 0897-5868| oclc = 17565429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, it was yet unclear which [[Internet protocol]] would dominate the market in coming years. Hans Bjohrdal's ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam (webcomic)|Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' was shared through [[Usenet]] in 1992. With this technology, Bjohrdal reached an audience at college campuses across a few [[U.S. states]]. [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s [[World Wide Web]] rose in popularity in 1993; usage of the World Wide Web grew by 341,634% in 1993, and competitor protocol [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]'s growth of 997% paled in comparison. [[Web browser]] [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], which saw its [[beta release]] in 1993, allowed the recent introductions of [[GIF]] and [[JPEG]] [[image formats]] to be shown directly on web pages. Before this point, images shared through the internet had to be [[download]]ed to the user's [[hard drive]] directly in order to be viewed.&lt;ref name=CampbellP11-13&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell]] (2006). pp. 10&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archison1&gt;[[#Atchison|Atchison]] (2008). [http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=850 part one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NetBoy_panel.png|thumb|right|Webcomics in the early 1990s could not make use of thick lines and color because of the low [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] capacity.&lt;ref name=Maragos1 /&gt;|alt=A webcomic panel showing a stick-figure character with pointy hair threatening a stick-figure character with a bowtie and mustache that he will hit the man with a SyQuest hard drive if he does not give him a modem upgrade.]]

In 1994 and 1995, webcomics such as ''Jax &amp; Co.'', ''[[NetBoy]]'', and ''[[Argon Zark!]]'' experimented with forms possible only on the Internet, uploading strips in shapes and sizes impossible in print. Mike Wean's ''Jax &amp; Co.'' introduced a "page turning" interface that encourages readers to read the panels in order; a concept that was quickly recreated by other webcomic artists.&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal /&gt;&lt;ref name="CampbellP19-20"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell]] (2006). pp. 18&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, an artist known as Eerie posted an [[ANSI]] art comic on [[bulletin board systems]].&lt;ref name=CampbellP10&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell]] (2006). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AbCMRRD-rAkC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=inspector+dangerfuck#v=onepage&amp;q=inspector%20dangerfuck&amp;f=false|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|title=Everyday Information: The Evolution of Information Seeking in America|last1=Aspray|first1=William|last2=Hayas|first2=Barbara M.|page=298|year=2011|isbn=0262015013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Reinder Dijkhuis]] recalled that, by the end of 1995, there were hundreds of comics being shared through the Internet. Most of these were derived from strips of [[college newspaper]]s and most were short-lived on the Internet.&lt;ref name=CampbellP19-20 /&gt; As ''[[Dilbert]]'' became the first [[comic strip syndication|syndicated comic strip]] to be published on the Internet in 1995, "[lending] a certain legitimacy to the online comic concept," it became clear the Internet could be an effective tool to reach large audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Meginnis, Mike (2005). ''[[#Examiner|The Artistic History of Webcomics]]''. "Scott Adams".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to popularity (1995&amp;mdash;2005)==
In 2000, [[Scott McCloud]] released ''[[Reinventing Comics]]'', a book in which he argued that the future of comics was on the Internet. McCloud stated that the World Wide Web allowed comics to make use of the various advantages of digital media, establishing the idea of [[infinite canvas]]. By 2008, it was clear that McCloud's predictions of infinite canvas did not materialize entirely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/comics-escape-a-paper-box-and-electronic-questions-pop-out.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Comics Escape a Paper Box, and Electronic Questions Pop Out|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|date=2005-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atchison2&gt;[[#Atchison|Atchison]] (2008). [http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=853 part two]&lt;/ref&gt; but creators such as [[Cayetano Garza]] and [[Demian5]] were influenced by his ideas.&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-history-of-webcomics/|publisher=''[[The Comics Journal]]''|title=The History of Webcomics|last=Garrity|first=Shaenon|date=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Bryan McNett started a webcomic hosting provider, calling it Big Panda. Over 770 webcomics were hosted on Big Panda, including ''[[Sluggy Freelance]]'', making it the first major webcomic portal. Due to a lack of interest, McNett shut Big Panda down in 2000. [[Chris Crosby (webcomics)|Chris Crosby]], who ran his webcomic ''Superiosity'' on Big Panda at the time, contacted McNett in order to create a new webcomics portal, which resulted in [[Keenspot]]. This new portal became a major success.&lt;ref name=Archison1 /&gt;

In 2002, [[Joey Manley]] started webcomic portal [[Modern Tales]] as a competitor to Keenspot, which became one of the first profitable subscription models for webcomics. According to T Campbell, webcomics seemed unsustainable at the time, with advertisement rates dropping to an all-time low. Manley's Modern Tales was a popular solution at the time, and Manley spun off websites such as [[Girlamatic]] and [[Webcomics Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2013/11/modern-tales-founder-joey-manley-passes-away/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Modern Tales founder Joey Manley passes away|last=Melrose|first=Kevin|date=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Tales had 2,000 members by 2005, each paying $3 USD per month. In the same year, Keenspot drew in around 125,000 readers per day, grossing over $200,000 USD per year through advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502251_pf.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|title=Comics Looking to Spread A Little Laughter on the Web|last=Walker|first=Leslie|date=2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established comic artists such as [[Carla Speed McNeil]] and [[Lea Hernandez]] found themselves moving towards the Internet in order to reach larger audiences and build "online portfolios".&lt;ref name=Atchison2 /&gt;

With the proliferation of webcomics, [[webcomic awards|awards]] began to emerge. In 2000, the [[Eagle Awards]] introduced the "Favourite Web-based Comic" category, and 2001 saw the first installment of the [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards]]. The [[Ignatz Awards]] also added a "Best Online Comic" accolade in 2001, but the event was canceled this year due to the [[September 11 attacks]]  and the title was first awarded in 2002. The [[Eisner Awards]], the most prestigious comics ceremony, eventually introduced a "Best Digital Comic" category in 2005.&lt;ref name=Archison1 /&gt;

===Video game webcomics===
[[File:Krahulik Holkins, Comicon 2009.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two young men, Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins, sitting at a booth at a convention.|Creators of ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' [[Mike Krahulik]] and [[Jerry Holkins]].]]

The second half of the 1990s saw the introduction of [[video game webcomic]]s as a genre. Chris Morrison posted the first known video game webcomic, titled ''[[Polymer City Chronicles]]'', in 1995. However, the genre wasn't popularized until [[Scott Kurtz]] started ''[[PvP]]'' in May 1998. In September the same year, the concept of [[sprite comic]]s was introduced by Jay Resop's ''Neglected Mario Characters''.&lt;ref name=Maragos1&gt;[[#Maragos|Maragos]] (2005). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1998, the duo of [[Jerry Holkins]] and [[Mike Krahulik]] started ''[[Penny Arcade]]'', a comic Nich Maragos from ''[[1UP.com]]'' described as the "most popular, the most lucrative, and the most influential" video game webcomics,&lt;ref name=Maragos4 /&gt; and by Mike Meginnis as "one of the most commonly emulated comics out there."&lt;ref&gt;Meginnis, Mike (2005). ''[[#Examiner|The Artistic History of Webcomics]]''. "Tycho and Gabe".&lt;/ref&gt;

''Penny Arcade'' also proved to be a huge player in fields outside of webcomics in the early 2000s. In 2003, Holkins and Krahulik founded [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]], a charity that managed to raise over $100,000 USD in its first year, which it used for donating toys for the [[Seattle Children's Hospital]]. The charity has become more successful since and now donates toys to hospitals across the country. In 2004, the duo started the [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX), a yearly video game convention that debuted with an estimated 3,000 guests and has grown in size since.&lt;ref name=Maragos4&gt;[[#Maragos|Maragos]] (2005). p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atchison3&gt;[[#Atchison|Atchison]] (2008). [http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=872 part three]&lt;/ref&gt;

David Anez' ''[[Bob and George]]'', which launched in April 2000, was the first [[sprite comic]] to reach a larger level of popularity. However, it wouldn't be until the release of [[Brian Clevinger]]'s ''[[8-Bit Theater]]'' that the genre really took off. Maragos of ''1-UP.com'' stated that ''8-Bit Theater'' "took the style to its fullest expression and greatest popularity."&lt;ref name=Maragos3&gt;[[#Maragos|Maragos]] (2005). p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Cruz of ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' pointed out that, though sprite comics are still an overwhelmingly popular style, "no other sprite comic [has] really achieve[d] the same amount of popularity" since ''8-Bit Theater''{{'}}s discontinuation in 2010.&lt;ref name=Sprite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/05/will-there-ever-be-another-great-sprite-comic/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Will there ever be another great sprite comic?|last=Cruz|first=Larry|date=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era (2005&amp;mdash;)==

Bradly Dale from ''[[The New York Observer]]'' noted in 2015 that people in the American webcomics industry had been shifting their business practices. While during the early 2000s, webcomics were mainly reliant on [[merchandise]] such as T-shirts for monetization, but this practice became less profitable in the 2010s. [[Dorothy Gambrell]], creator of ''Cat and Girl'', explained that the practice went well until "the great T-shirt crash of 2008." Webcomic merchandise distributor [[Topatoco]] started looking to provide more products than only T-shirts around 2010, while [[Ryan North]]'s "Project Wonderful" aimed to improve webcomic-based [[advertisement]].&lt;ref name=Observer1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/webcomics-changing-business-model/|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|title=The Webcomics Business Is Moving on From Webcomics|last=Dale|first=Bradly|date=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[2008 financial crisis]] had only a minor impact on the webcomic industry, many webcomic artists have been looking for alternative employment in the 2010s. While Topatoco has been seeking work with [[video game developers]], [[podcast]]ers and other internet personalities, some creators moved on to other media entirely. ''[[Toothpaste for Dinner]]''-creator Drew Fairweather, for instance, started focusing his energy on his [[blog]] and his career as a [[rapper]] in 2011, while the creators of ''[[Amazing Super Powers]]'' moved on to developing video games.&lt;ref name=Observer1 /&gt;

{{quote box|My business is not a business in the sense of being a small and medium sized enterprise or even particularly entrepreneurial ... I make comics because I like the activity of writing and drawing. It is a self-sustaining, one-man enterprise.|''[[Scary Go Round]]''-creator [[John Allison (comics)|John Allison]]&lt;ref name=Observer2 /&gt;|align=right|width=30%}}

With the rise of [[social media]] in the second half of the 2000s, webcomic artist began having a more difficult time gaining attention and views. ''[[Wondermark]]''-creator David Malki believes traffic to webcomic websites plateaued in 2012, as visiting content-specific websites generally disappeared from people's daily routines. Sharing of comic strips on social media such as [[Facebook]] has led to more exposure of webcomics, causing some to show signs of growth, but few people access webcomic websites directly.&lt;ref name=Observer3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/webcomics-and-the-changing-web/|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|title=The Changing Internet Through Webcomics|last=Dale|first=Bradly|date=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Gambrell stated that "webcomics are dead," as the period of webcomics only being posted for free on the internet was over and the industry had moved beyond the internet.&lt;ref name=Observer2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/lessons-in-creativity-from-successful-webcomic-artists/|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|title=Lessons in Creativity From Successful Webcomic Artists|last=Dale|first=Bradly|date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many successful webcomic creators in the 2010s do not envision their online craft as their "job", most do not have to worry about basic money issues.&lt;ref name=Observer2 /&gt; However, Sarah Dorchak of ''[[Gauntlet (newspaper)|Gauntlet]]'' proposed in 2011 that the free nature of webcomics may be a leading factor in the decline of economic viability of traditional comic books.&lt;ref name="Dochak"/&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===

In 2004, R.K. Milholland's started a [[crowdsourcing]] project to stabilize the update schedule of his webcomic ''[[Something Positive]]''. After fans donated enough money for Milholland to quit his job and focus exclusively on ''Something Positive'', other webcomic creators followed his example.&lt;ref name=Observer4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/patreon-webcomics-and-getting-by/|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|title=Patreon, Webcomics and Getting By|last=Dale|first=Bradly|date=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Weinersmith of ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' turned to [[Kickstarter]] to fund his related project ''Single Use Monocles'',&lt;ref name=Observer1 /&gt; and [[Andrew Hussie]]'s ''[[Hiveswap]]'' raised over $700,000 USD in 2012, becoming the most successful webcomic-related Kickstarter project of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/homestuck-heads-towards-new-kickstarter-record/| title=‘Homestuck’ heads towards new Kickstarter record| last=McMillan|first=Graeme| work=[[Digital Trends]]| date=2012-09-06| accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of smaller webcomics such as ''[[Cucumber Quest]]'' and ''The Antler Boy'' frequently raise over $50,000 USD on Kickstarter in order to publish their material in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-r-siegel/the-new-serial-revolution_b_1936625.html|title=The New Serial Revolution|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|last=Siegel|first=Mark R.|date=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another large shift in the webcomic industry came with the 2013 introduction of [[Patreon]], through which people can donate money directly to content creators. Weinersmith, North, Allison, and [[Cyanide and Happiness|Dave McElfatrick]] have all pointed at the service as a turning point for the webcomic industry that allowed many artist to produce online comics full-time.&lt;ref name=Observer2 /&gt;

The early 2010s saw the global increase in popularity of [[South Korea]]n [[webtoons]]. Supported by high-speed Internet and large-scale mobile phone usage in South Korea, webtoons achieved a high demand.

'''Carl Jacob Christoph Burckhardt''' (May 25, 1818 &amp;ndash; August 8, 1897) was a Swiss [[historian]] of [[art history|art]] and [[cultural history|culture]] and an influential figure in the [[historiography]] of both fields. He is known as one of the major progenitors of [[cultural history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/historian/Jacob_Burckhardt.html Jakob Burckhardt Renaissance Cultural History &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigfried Giedion]] described Burckhardt's achievement in the following terms: "The great discoverer of the age of the [[Renaissance]], he first showed how a period should be treated in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the social institutions of its daily life as well."&lt;ref&gt;In ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Burckhardt's best known work is ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' (1860).

== Life ==
The son of a [[Protestant]] [[clergyman]], Burckhardt was born and died in [[Basel]], where he studied theology in the hope of taking [[holy orders]]; however, under the influence of [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette]], he chose not to become a clergyman. He was a member of the patrician [[Burckhardt]] family.

He finished his degree in 1839 and went to the [[University of Berlin]] to study history,&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of Jacob Burckhardt, Translated by Alexander Dru, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955; [[Liberty Fund Inc.]], 2001, xxviii-xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; especially art history, then a new field. At Berlin, he attended lectures by [[Leopold von Ranke]], the founder of history as a respectable academic discipline based on sources and records rather than personal opinions. He spent part of 1841 at the [[University of Bonn]], studying under the art historian [[Franz Theodor Kugler]], to whom he dedicated his first book, ''Die Kunstwerke der belgischen Städte'' (1842). 

He taught at the [[University of Basel]] from 1843 to 1855, then at the [[Federal Polytechnic School]]. In 1858, he returned to Basel to assume the professorship he held until his retirement in 1893. He started to teach only art history in 1886. He twice declined offers of professorial chairs at German universities, at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1867 and Ranke's chair at the University of Berlin in 1872.
 
See ''Life'' by Hans Trog in the ''Basler Jahrbuch'' for 1898, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–172.

Burckhardt is currently featured on the Swiss [[Banknotes of the Swiss franc#Eighth series|thousand franc banknote]].

==Work==
Burckhardt's historical writings did much to establish the importance of art in the study of history; indeed, he was one of the "founding fathers of art history" but also one of the original creators of cultural history. According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place. His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow 19th-century notion that "history is past politics and politics current history."&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed. Mark G Malvasi and Jeffrey O. Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Burckhardt's unsystematic approach to history was strongly opposed to the interpretations of [[Hegelianism]], which was popular at the time; [[economism]] as an interpretation of history; and [[positivism]], which had come to dominate scientific discourses (including the discourse of the social sciences).

In 1838, Burckhardt made his first journey to Italy and published his first important article, "Bemerkungen über schweizerische Kathedralen" ("Remarks about Swiss Cathedrals"). Burckhardt delivered a series of lectures at the University of Basel, which were published in 1943 by Pantheon Books Inc., under the title ''Force and Freedom:  An Interpretation of History by Jacob Burckhardt''. In 1847, he brought out new editions of Kugler's two great works, ''Geschichte der Malerei'' and ''Kunstgeschichte'', and in 1853, he published his own work, ''Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen'' ("The Age of [[Constantine the Great]]"). He spent the greater part of the years 1853 and 1854 in Italy, collecting material for his 1855 ''Der Cicerone: Eine Anleitung zum Genuss der Kunstwerke Italiens'' (7th German edition, 1899) ("The Cicerone: or, Art-guide to painting in Italy. For the use of travellers"  Translated into English by A. H. Clough in 1873), also dedicated to Kugler. The work, "the finest travel guide that has ever been written"&lt;ref&gt;Giedion, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which covered [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]], and painting, became an indispensable guide to the art traveller in Italy.

About half of the original edition was devoted to the art of the [[Renaissance]]. Thus, Burckhardt was naturally led to write the two books for which he is best known, his 1860 ''Die Cultur&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; der Renaissance in Italien'' ("The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy") (English translation, by S. G. C. Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878), and his 1867 ''Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien'' ("The History of the Renaissance in Italy"). ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'' was the most influential interpretation of the Italian Renaissance in the 19th century and is still widely read. In connection with this work Burckhardt may have been the first historian to use the term "[[modernity]]" in a clearly-defined, academic context.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 91 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burckhardt developed an ambivalent interpretation of modernity and the effects of the Renaissance, praising the movement as introducing new forms of cultural and [[religious freedom]] but also worrying about the potential feelings of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and [[disenchantment]] modern men might feel.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment" /&gt; These claims proved quite controversial, but the scholarly judgements of Burckhardt's ''History of the Renaissance'' are sometimes considered to be justified by subsequent research according to historians including [[Desmond Seward]] and art historians such as [[Kenneth Clark]]. Burckhardt and the German historian [[Georg Voigt]] founded the historical study of the Renaissance. In contrast to Voigt, who confined his studies to early [[Italian humanism]], Burckhardt dealt with all aspects of Renaissance society.

Burckhardt considered the study of ancient history an intellectual necessity and was a highly respected scholar of Greek civilization. "The Greeks and Greek Civilization" sums up the relevant lectures, "Griechische Kulturgeschichte", which Burckhardt first gave in 1872 and which he repeated until 1885. At his death, he was working on a four-volume survey of Greek civilization.

"Judgments on History and Historians" is based on Burckhardt's lectures on history at the University of Basel between 1865 and 1885.  It provides his insights and interpretation of the events of the entire sweep of Western Civilization from Antiquity to the Age of Revolution, including the Middle Ages, History from 1450 to 1598, the History of the Seventeenth and the Eighteenth Centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt: Judgments on history and historians&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], appointed professor of classical philology at Basel in 1869 at the age of 24, admired Burckhardt and attended some of his lectures. Both men were admirers of the late [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Nietzsche believed Burckhardt agreed with the thesis of his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', that Greek culture was defined by opposing "Apollonian" and "Dionysian" tendencies. Nietzsche and Burckhardt enjoyed each other's intellectual company, even as Burckhardt kept his distance from Nietzsche's evolving philosophy. Their extensive correspondence over a number of years has been published. Burckhardt's student [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] succeeded him at the University of Basel at the age of only 28.

==Politics==
There is a tension in Burckhardt's persona between the wise and worldly student of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and the cautious product of Swiss [[Calvinism]], which he had studied extensively for the ministry. The Swiss polity in which he spent nearly all of his life was a good deal more democratic and stable than was the norm in 19th-century Europe. As a Swiss, Burckhardt was also cool to German nationalism and to German claims of cultural and intellectual superiority. He was also amply aware of the rapid political and economic changes taking place in the Europe of his day and commented in his lectures and writings on the [[Industrial Revolution]], the European political upheavals of his day, and the growing European nationalism and militarism. Events amply fulfilled his prediction of a cataclysmic 20th century, in which violent demagogues (whom he called "terrible simplifiers") would play central roles. In later years, Burckhardt found himself unimpressed by democracy, individualism, socialism and a great many other ideas fashionable during his lifetime.

He also observed over a century ago that "the state incurs debts for politics, war, and other higher causes and 'progress'.... The assumption is that the future will honor this relationship in perpetuity. The state has learned from the merchants and industrialists how to exploit credit; it defies the nation ever to let it go into bankruptcy. Alongside all swindlers the state now stands there as swindler-in-chief".&lt;ref&gt;Judgments on History and Historians (tr. Boston: 1958), p. 171 - cited in "Super Imperialism" by M. Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[parish priest]] at [[Ardres]], and related to the Counts of [[Guînes]]. He wrote for that family a ''Historia comitum Ghisnensium'', between 1194 and 1198. It is mixture of history and folklore. It also contains a contemporary description of a [[donjon]].

The '''law of social cycle''' is a [[social cycle theory]] developed by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]. It is based on the theory of human historical motivity based on "the ancient spiritual ideas of the [[Vedas]]". The theory was developed in the 1950s and expanded by [[Ravi Batra]] since the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarkar Theory of Social Cycles and Class Hierarchy|url=http://kenketchum.tripod.com/newyorkchristianlawlibrary/id4.html|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Galtung]] and [[Sohail Inayatullah]] since the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Sarkar's theory of social change | url=http://www.metafuture.org/Articles/IntroductoryChapterfromthebookSituatingSarkar.htm | accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating the experience of social change|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-4HTCW30-5&amp;_user=713789&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000039858&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=713789&amp;md5=b6a0cb62db026240a72731b35556b7b0|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visions for Global Justice through the Lens of Sarkar's Social Cycle|url=http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/9-3/A04.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playing the neo-humanist game|url=http://www.pspl.com.au/Ideas%20written%20down_files/playing%20the%20neohumanist%20game-1.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human society==
The theory first appeared in [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar|Sarkar's]] book ''Human Society'', Vol. 2 in the late 1950s and has since been reproduced and expanded on in many books. The theory has probably received the widest publication in the West in the many books of Ravi Batra, a disciple of Sarkar, notably ''[[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism, a New Study of History]]'', ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]'' and ''[[The New Golden Age|The New Golden Age: The Coming Revolution against Political Corruption and Economic Chaos]]''. Johan Galtung and Sohail Inayatullah have also written about Sarkars' social cycle theory in the book ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians''. The theory owes to the work of [[Sri Aurobindo]], ''[[The Human Cycle]]'', which was published in 1949 but originally written in 1916–1918 under the title ''The Psychology of Social Development''.

==Four types of people==
The law of social cycle is a theory of [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]], arising out of the Indian [[episteme]] (Inayatullah, 2002). This law states that while people in any society are all relatively similar, they have generally the same goals, desires and ambitions but differ in the way they go about achieving their goals. An individual's specific methods for achieving success depend on his physical and psychological makeup. Essentially, there are four different psychological types of people, warriors, intellectuals, acquisitors and labourers, who find basic fulfillment in four different kinds of ways.

===Warriors===
Warriors, or  ''Kshatriya'' in [[Sanskrit]], have strong bodies, vigorous physical energy and a sharp intellect. Warriors tend to develop the skills that take advantage of their inherent gifts of stamina, courage and vigor. Their mentality is one that is not averse to taking physical risks. Examples of people in our society with the warrior mentality include policemen, firemen, soldiers, professional athletes, skilled carpenters, and tradesmen. They all achieve success through their physical skills and a deep understanding of their profession.

===Intellectuals===
Intellectuals, or ''Vipra'', have a more developed intellect than the warriors, but generally lack the physical strength and vigor. Intellectuals are happiest when they try to achieve success by developing and expressing their intellectual skills and talents. Teachers, writers, professors, scientists, artists, musicians, philosophers, doctors and lawyers, and above all, priests, are professions intellectuals tend to pursue.

===Acquisitors===
Acquisitors, or ''Vaishya'', have a penchant for acquiring money. If money can be made the acquisitors will find a way to make it. They are not considered as bright as the intellectuals, nor as strong as the warriors, but they are keen when it comes to making and accumulating money and material possessions. Such people are the traders, businessmen, managers, entrepreneurs, bankers, brokers, and landlords in our society.

===Laborers===
Laborers, or ''Shudra'', are altogether different from the first three groups. Laborers lack the energy and vigor of the warriors, the keen intellect of the intellectuals, or the ambition and drive of the accumulators. In spite of the fact that their contribution to society is profound – in fact, society could not function without them – the other groups generally look down upon and tend to exploit them. The laborers are the peasants, serfs, clerks, short order cooks, waiters, janitors, doormen, cabdrivers, garbage collectors, truck drivers, night watchmen and factory workers who keep society running smoothly by working diligently and without complaint.

==Epochs of social classes==
[[File:Law of Social Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of P.R. Sarkar's Law of Social Cycle]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Groups of each type of people make up the social classes in society. Sarkar simplifies society into four classes, divided by inherent traits:
*Warriors defend the nation and keep the peace;
*Intellectuals develop our ideas about the world, in the form of religion, art, law and new inventions;
*Acquisitors manage the practical aspects of life, including farms, factories, financial institutions and stores;
*Laborers do the routine work, waiting tables, collecting trash, and other low-tech, low skill jobs.

==Modern social development==
According to Batra (1978), the West is currently in the age of acquisitors, also known as Capitalism. This age succeeded the 'age of intellectuals', which gave birth to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[British parliamentary system]]. Before that the West went through the 'age of warriors' and the [[age of discovery]]. [[Feudalism]], an earlier 'age of acquisitors', reigned before that. It had replaced the 'age of intellectuals', with restrictions on religious thought and also gave birth to the [[Renaissance|Renaissance period]]. Before that, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] ruled the West under the aegis of warriors.

==Exploitation and breakdown==
To Sarkar, each age would run its course, with the social motivity going too far, causing much grief to the majority of people (Sarkar, 1967). The situation could go on unchecked for a long time, before things got so bad that a spontaneous revolution and overthrow of the system took place. In fact, as this was the reason for social change, it was clear that no single class of people could remain dominant indefinitely. Social power was destined to pass from one class to next in the prescribed order, or cycle. The 'age of warriors', which brings strict order to society and a return to fundamental values, essentially leads to excessive focus on strong man rule and warfare. It is followed by an 'age of intellectuals', which bring a sense of liberation in the mental sphere but soon replace that freedom with the yoke of newer ideas. Over time this age merges into an 'age of acquisitors', which brings progress in the material sphere, but this is soon replaced by increased physical and mental exploitation. The [[Servile Wars]] spelled the doom of the [[Roman Republic]]. Labour conflict could be the undoing of Capitalism, according to this theory. And so the cycle moves on its endless round, until the civilisation ceases to exist or is taken over by a superior or more powerful civilisation.

==Preventing the misery of exploitation==
Sarkar's essential view on the implications of each age was to develop a way to avoid the dynamic of exploitation, when the social motivity of one class goes unchecked and too far (Sarkar, 1967). In such cases, it falls on moralists to accelerate the movement to the next age to shorten the exploitative phase of each age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prout's Theory of Revolution|url=http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/04/prouts_theory_o.html|accessdate=2009-06-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060117171449/http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/04/prouts_theory_o.html|archivedate=17 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
In Sarkar's vision social progress is seen to be established on the basis of a new vision of [[Progressive utilization theory|human progress]]. Sarkar's theory focuses on four basic ages of warriors, intellectuals and acquisitors, as well as a brief age of labourers. During such ages humanity has faced an eternal struggle with each [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] deteriorating into a harmful [[wikt:exploit#Verb|exploitative]] phase. Sarkar devises an [[exit strategy]] from such a development, based on the role of enlightened moralists, the [[Sadvipras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/03/sadvipras.html|title=The Place of Sadvipras in the Social Cycle|accessdate=2009-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707004018/http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/03/sadvipras.html|archivedate=7 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is their role, based on their self-less virtues and ideation on the [[Divinity|divine]], to apply energy and accelerate social progress when the evolutionary process is caught up in a [[Stasis (political history)|stasis]] whereby the ruling class has abandoned its original [[virtue]]s and through an intense focus on their [[motivity|social agenda]] inflict [[wiktionary:misery|misery]] on the other sections of society.

==Harmony and cooperation==
For this, Sarkar trained nuns and monks of his ''socio-spiritual movement'' [[Ananda Marga]] and developed the socio-economic [[Progressive Utilization Theory]] (PROUT).

[[Industrial music]] is a form of [[experimental music]] which emerged in the 1970s. After 1980, industrial splintered into a range of offshoots, sometimes collectively named '''post-industrial music'''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This list details some of these offshoots, including fusions with other experimental and [[electronic music]] genres as well as [[rock music|rock]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Industrial genres have spread worldwide and are particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan.

{{main|Industrial music}}
'''Industrial music''' comprises many styles of [[experimental music]], including many forms of [[electronic music]]. The term was coined in the mid-1970s for [[Industrial Records]] artists. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms.{{sfn|Vale &amp; Juno|1983}} Prominent industrial musicians include [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Boyd Rice]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], and [[Z'EV]].{{sfn|Vale &amp; Juno|1983}} [[Test Dept]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic Test Dept"&gt;{{Cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0000030644/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Test Dept — Biography |last=Bush |first=John |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |access-date=2017-09-15 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clock DVA]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic Clock DVA"&gt;{{Cite web |url={{Allmusic|class = artist|id = mn0000788360/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Clock DVA — Biography |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=AllMusic |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=2017-09-15 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nocturnal Emissions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic | class = artist | id =mn0000447197/biography|pure_url=yes}}| title = Nocturnal Emissions — Biography | accessdate = 2017-09-15|df=mdy-all | work= AllMusic|publisher=All Media Network | first = Bradley | last = Torreano }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitehouse (band)|Whitehouse]],&lt;ref name="whitehouseamg"/&gt; [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic Laibach"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/laibach-mn0000780506/biography |title=Laibach — Biography |last=Jeffries |first=David |website=AllMusic |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=2017-09-15 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Leather Nun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url={{Allmusic|class = artist|id = mn0000091821/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Leather Nun — Biography |last=Sutton |first=Michael |website=AllMusic |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=2017-09-15 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently participated in the movement.

===Electro-industrial===
{{main|Electro-industrial}}
'''Electro-Industrial''' draws on [[Electronic body music|EBM]], and developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound.

===Industrial rock===
{{main|Industrial rock|Industrial metal}}
'''Industrial rock''' artists generally employ the basic rock instrumentation of [[electric guitars]], [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Bass guitar|bass]] and pair it with [[white noise]] blasts, [[electronic music]] gear ([[synthesizer]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] and [[drum machine]]s).  Guitars are commonly heavily [[Distortion#Guitar distortion|distorted]] or otherwise [[Effects unit|effected]].

Neofolk can be solely acoustic folk music or a blend of acoustic folk instrumentation with accompanying sounds, such as pianos, strings or elements of industrial music and [[experimental music]]. The genre encompasses an assortment of themes including traditional music, [[Germanic Neopaganism|heathenry]], [[romanticism]] and [[occultism]]. Neofolk musicians often have ties to other genres such as [[martial industrial]]. ''Apocalyptic folk'' predates ''neofolk'' and was used by David Tibet for the music of his band [[Current 93]] during the late 1980s. Initially, Tibet did not intend to imply connection with the folk music genre; rather, that Current 93's music was made by "apocalyptic folk, or guys."&lt;ref name="APOCALYPTICFOLK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/current-93-060516/|title=The Apocalyptic Visions of Current 93|author=Jennifer Kelly|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2017-09-16|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power noise===
{{main|Power noise}}
'''Power noise'''  (also known as '''rhythmic noise''') takes its inspiration from some of the more structured and distorted early industrial acts, such as [[Esplendor Geometrico|Esplendor Geométrico]].&lt;ref name="hymen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hymen-records.com/vinylium/y014/y014.html|title=converter. coma. 12" 33rpm. may 1999|last=|first=|date=|website=hymen-records.com|publisher=Hymen Records|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111040126/http://www.hymen-records.com/vinylium/y014/y014.html|archive-date=2007-11-11|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-16|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian group [[Dive (Belgian band)|Dive]] also anticipated the style in the early '90s.&lt;ref name=hymen/&gt;{{sfn|Kilpatrick|2004|p=87}} Power noise groups meld noise music with various forms of [[electronic dance music]].  The term "power noise" was coined by Raoul Roucka of [[Noisex]] in 1997, with the track "United (Power Noise Movement)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|127104|Noisex – ''Over and Out''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vlad McNeally, review of Noisex, ''ReGen Magazine'', November 29, 2007.

Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is almost always secondary to the rhythm.  Power noise tracks are typically structured and danceable, but are occasionally abstract. This genre is showcased at the annual [[Maschinenfest]] festival in [[Krefeld]], [[Germany]], as well as at [[Infest (festival)|Infest]] in [[Bradford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Other artists include [[Imminent Starvation]], [[Axiome]], [[Converter (music)|Converter]], and [[Terrorfakt]]. The German labels [[Ant-Zen]] and Hands Productions specialize in the style. ''Technoid'' grew out of the scene, taking inspiration from [[Intelligent Dance Music|IDM]], experimental techno and noise music. German label [[Hymen Records]] is responsible for the term and the style. Artists include [[Gridlock (band)|Gridlock]], [[Snog (band)|Black Lung]], [[Revolution State]], and [[Xingu Hill]].

'''Mary Call Darby Collins''' (September 11, 1911 – November 29, 2009&lt;ref name="th"&gt;http://www.tallahassee.com/article/20091130/BREAKINGNEWS/91130017/Collins-died-Sunday-after-long-illness&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[historic preservationist]], widow of former [[Governor of Florida|Governor]] [[LeRoy Collins]] and First Lady of Florida from 1955 to 1961.

== Early years ==
Mary Call was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child and daughter of Thomas Arthur Darby and Jane Kirkman Brevard. Brevard being the daughter of Theodore Washington Brevard Jr. and Mary Laura Call. Mary Laura Call was the daughter of [[Richard Keith Call]], 3rd and 5th [[List of governors of Florida|territorial governor]] of Florida and Mary Letitia Kirkman.

Mary Call was born in New York because her father had business interests there. However, concerned for her health in the harsh northern winters, Jane Darby and Mary moved to Tallahassee and the Brevard family home of her maternal [[grandmother]], Mary Call Brevard, and her Aunt [[Caroline Mays Brevard]] on Monroe Street. Thomas Darby visited his wife and daughter often and planned to establish a home for them in Tallahassee when circumstances permitted him to leave New York.

When Mary Call was nine years old, her best friend and first cousin, Cora, died following a fall from a tree. In 1920 both Mary Call Brevard and Aunt Caroline died from the [[influenza]] [[epidemic]].

In 1923, Thomas Darby was found dead in his New York hotel room at age 66. His business partner then took the proceeds of their successful business and boarded a ship for [[Europe]]. The ship was lost at sea with all hands.

Mary Call attended [[Leon High School]] and appeared as "The Fairy Queen" in a 1916 May Party picture in the history book. Mary Call met [[LeRoy Collins|Thomas LeRoy "Roy" Collins]], whom she later married. Mary Call went on to Florida State College for Women but temporarily withdrew in order to help take care of her mother who was ill with [[cancer]]. In February 1932, Jane Brevard Darby died at the age of 64. Mary Call moved in with Uncle Ephraim and Aunt Bess Brevard. On June 29, 1932 Mary Call married LeRoy Collins at St. John's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Tallahassee. Mary Call returned to college and graduated.

In 1942, the Collins family acquired [[The Grove Plantation]], a circa 1840 plantation home originally built by Mary Collins' great grandfather Richard Keith Call.

== Children and grandchildren ==
LeRoy and Mary Call Collins had 4 children: Roy Jr., Jane Aurell, Mary Call Proctor and Darby Collins and 12 grandchildren.

== Mary Call Darby Collins Award ==
The Mary Call Darby Collins Award, one of three historic preservation awards from the Florida Secretary of State's office is presented to a volunteer who has forever changed the course of historic preservation. (In the 1970s, Mary Call Collins had served, by gubernatorial appointment, as a member of the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board.)

== Death ==
Mary Call Darby Collins died at the age of 98, after a long illness. At this time, she was still living in [[The Grove Plantation|her great-grandfather's home]], and now the State of Florida is hoping to turn the home into a historic museum.&lt;ref name="th" /&gt;

'''May Murr''', sometimes written as '''Mayy Murr''' ({{lang-ar| مي المر}}) (1929–-2008) was a Lebanese professor, historian, writer, poet, and political activist.

Before taking up writing, May Murr taught several subjects at several universities and institutions in Lebanon such as the [[Lebanese University]] and the Lebanese Military School, in which she taught mathematics, literature, history, history of art and geography.&lt;ref name=gotc&gt;[http://www.gotc.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=993:may-murr&amp;catid=119:great-people-from-lebanon&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid=381 Guardians of the Cedars Party - Movement of Lebanese Nationalism - May Murr]&lt;/ref&gt;

She began professionally writing and publishing her works in 1967, as well as founding and presiding many cultural and social associations. She was a member of the ''Société des Gens de Lettres de France'' and of the ''Société Teilhard de Chardin'', headquartered in [[Belgium]]. She was also the President of the Academy of Lebanese Thought and was a founding member of the political party the [[Guardians of the Cedars]].

She figures among the woman poets in the ''Anthologie de la Poésie Féminine Mondiale''. Many international critics have praised her poetry. [[Jean Cayrol]] wrote to her: 'May Murr, you are filled with poetry to infinity',&lt;ref name=gotc/&gt; while Lebanese poet [[Said Akl]] wrote, in 1967, an article entitled 'A woman invades the conscience of Lebanon':
{{quote|May Murr in 'Elissa', a Lebanese Shakespeare, has imposed herself as the creator of the Lebanese drama and a giant among giants... Whole volumes can be written about May Murr's art... May Murr is one of the authors who can create something new with the strangeness of a unique treatment; and in the domain of beauty, she creates wonders.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook |title= Who's Who in Lebanon, Volume 18 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PDJYHn7z28EC |publisher= Les Editions Publitec |location= Lebanon |year=2005 |p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Early life and education==
The younger sister of Lebanese [[member of parliament]] [[Michel Murr]], Murr was born in 1929 to a [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox Christian]] family in the [[Matn District]] village of [[Bteghrine]]. She studied history and geography and has a diploma in both from the [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts]] and a diploma in geography from the [[University of Lyon]], France.&lt;ref name=gotc/&gt;

==Publications==
May Murr has written more than 3,000 articles on several subjects (theology, philosophy, politics, literature, arts, history, geography, social problems...) with an emphasis on the problems of the family, womanhood and childhood, in most of the major Lebanese newspapers and magazines, in three languages: [[Lebanese dialect|Lebanese]], [[French Language|French]] and [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].

She was the editor-in-chief of the weekly ''Lebnan'' since its creation in 1975 until 1982. She published in this weekly political articles, poems and extracts from ''Lubnaniyada'', her epic poem in [[Lebanese Arabic]] (of some 30,000 verses) and historical essays which allowed her to call the history of Lebanon-Phoenicia the Giant of Histories, and to entitle her works on the history of Lebanon in 12 volumes (still manuscript) ''Lebanon-Phoenicia, Land of God''.&lt;ref name=gotc/&gt;

A '''mechane''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|ə|n|iː}}; {{lang-el|μηχανή}}, ''mēkhanḗ'') or '''machine''' was a [[crane (machine)|crane]] used in [[History of theatre#Ancient Greek Theater|Greek theatre]], especially in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Made of wooden beams and pulley systems, the device was used to lift an actor into the air, usually representing flight. This stage machine was particularly used to bring gods onto the stage from above,&lt;ref name="Greek mechane sources"&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Crat]].'' 425d; ''[[Clitophon (dialogue)|Clit]]''. 407a&lt;/ref&gt; hence the Latin term ''[[deus ex machina]]'' ("god from the [[machine]]"). [[Euripides]]' use of the mechane in ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' (431 BC) is a notable use of the machine for a non-divine character. It was also often used by [[Aeschylus]]. It was used to allow actors playing gods to fly through the air.

==Use in Ancient Rome==
Stage machines were also used in ancient [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], e.g. during the sometimes highly dramatic performances at [[Roman funerals and burial|funerals]]. For [[Julius Caesar]]'s funeral service, [[Appian]] reports a mechane that was used to present a blood-stained wax [[effigy]] of the deceased [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to the funeral crowd. The mechane was used to turn the body in all directions.&lt;ref name="Mechane at Caesar's funeral"&gt;App. ''B.C.'' 2.147. ''τὸ μὲν γὰρ σῶμα, ὡς ὕπτιον ἐπὶ λέχους, οὐχ ἑωρᾶτο. τὸ δὲ ἀνδρείκελον ἐκ μηχανῆς ἐπεστρέφετο πάντῃ''. [[Suetonius]] only reports a [[Tropaion|''tropaeum'']] to which the effigy (''simulacrum'') was affixed. (''Jul.'' 84)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey S. Sumi|Geoffrey Sumi]] proposes that the use of the mechane "hinted at Caesar's [[divinity]]".&lt;ref name="Sumi source"&gt;Geoffrey S. Sumi: ''Ceremony and Power — Performing Politics in Rome between Republic and Empire'' (Ann Arbor 2005. 107–109, chapter ''Caesar ex machina''). {{ISBN|978-0-472-11517-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is highly unlikely because Appian doesn't describe the mechane as a genuine ''deus-ex-machina'' device. Furthermore Caesar's [[apotheosis]] wasn't legally conducted until 42&amp;nbsp;BC and Caesar had only been worshipped unofficially as ''[[divus]]'' during his lifetime. First and foremost, [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] attempted to arouse the masses as a means to strengthen Caesar's esteem as well as his own political power.&lt;ref name="Consequences"&gt;That Caesar's [[Resurrection|''resurrectio'']] as god happened later during the funeral as he was [[Cremation|cremated]], and that it spawned the early Caesarian cult by the [[Gaius Marius (Pseudo-Marius)|Pseudo-Marius]], can't explain Antonius' intentions for using a mechane during the funeral.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
In [[Christian]] [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] the mechane has also been identified with the [[Christian cross|cross]]. [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] calls the cross the "theatre mechane" of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="Ignatius source"&gt;Ignatius of Antioch: ''Letter to the Ephesians'' IX, I. ''ἀναφερόμενοι εἰς τὰ ὕψη διὰ τῆς μηχανῆς Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὅς ἐστιν σταυρός''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{history of war}}

'''Modern warfare''' is [[warfare]] using the concepts, methods, and [[military technology]] that have come into use during and after World Wars I and II. The concepts and methods have assumed more complex forms of the 19th- and early-20th-century antecedents, largely due to the widespread use of highly advanced [[information technology]], and [[combatants]] must modernize constantly to preserve their battle worthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Creveld | first1 = Martin Van | title = The Oxford History of Modern War | chapter = Technology and War I:To 1945| editors = Charles Townshend | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2000 | location = New York, USA | pages = 206  | isbn = 978-0-19-285373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although [[total war]] was thought to be the form of international conflicts from the experience of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] to [[World War II]], the term no longer describes warfare in which a [[belligerent]] use all of its resources to destroy the enemy's organized ability to engage in war. The practice of total war which had been in use for over a century, as a form of war policy, has been changed dramatically with greater awareness of [[military tactics|tactical]], [[operational mobility|operational]], and [[military strategy|strategic]] battle information.

War in modern times has been the inclusion of [[civilian]]s and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying the enemy's ability to engage in war.{{disputed-inline|date=February 2014}} The targeting of civilians developed from two distinct [[theory|theories]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The first theory was that if enough civilians were killed, factories could not function. The second theory was that if civilians were killed, the enemy would be so [[demoralization (warfare)|demoralized]] that it would have no ability to wage further war.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, [[UNICEF]] reports that civilian fatalities are down from 20 percent prior to 1900 AD to less than 5 percent of fatalities in the wars beginning in the 1990s.

With the invention of [[nuclear weapons]], the concept of full-scale war carries the prospect of [[global annihilation]], and as such conflicts since WWII have by definition been "low intensity" conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Creveld | first1 = Martin Van | title = The Oxford History of Modern War | chapter = Technology and War II:Postmodern War? | editors = Charles Townshend  | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically in the form of [[proxy war]]s fought within local regional confines, using what are now referred to as "[[conventional weapons]]," typically combined with the use of [[asymmetric warfare]] tactics and applied use of [[intelligence]].

More recently, the [[US Department of Defense]] introduced a concept of [[battlespace]] as the integrated information management of all significant factors that impact on combat operations by [[armed forces]] for the [[military]] [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of operations]], including [[Information warfare|information]], [[Aerial warfare|air]], [[Ground warfare|land]], [[Naval warfare|sea]], and [[Space warfare|space]]. It includes the environment, factors, and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly forces; facilities, weather and terrain within the operational areas and areas of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/b/00692.html US DOD dictionary - battlespace]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Some argue that the changing forms of third generation warfare represents nothing more than an evolution of [[technology during World War I|earlier technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Aerial===
{{main|Aerial warfare}}
Aerial warfare is the use of [[military aircraft]] and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes [[bombers]] attacking enemy concentrations or [[Strategic bombing|strategic targets]]; [[fighter aircraft]] battling for control of airspace; [[attack aircraft]] engaging in [[close air support]] against ground targets; [[naval aviation]] flying against sea and nearby land targets; [[Military glider|gliders]], [[Military helicopter|helicopters]] and other aircraft to carry [[airborne forces]] such as [[paratrooper]]s; [[aerial refueling]] tankers to extend operation time or range; and [[military transport aircraft]] to move cargo and personnel.

===Asymmetric===
{{main|Asymmetric warfare}}
A military situation in which two [[belligerent]]s of unequal strength interact and take advantage of their respective strengths and weaknesses. This interaction often involves strategies and tactics outside the bounds of [[conventional warfare]], often referred to as [[terrorism]].

===Biological===
{{main|Biological warfare}}

Biological warfare, also known as germ warfare, is the use of any organism (bacteria, virus or other disease-causing organism) or toxin found in nature, as a weapon of war. It is meant to incapacitate or kill enemy combatants. It may also be defined as the employment of biological agents to produce casualties in man or animals and damage to plants or material; or defense against such employment.

===Chemical===
{{main|Chemical warfare}}

Chemical warfare is warfare (associated military operations) using the toxic properties of chemical substances to incapacitate or kill enemy combatants.

===Electronic===
{{main|Electronic warfare}}

Electronic warfare refers to mainly non-violent practices used chiefly to support other areas of warfare. The term was originally coined to encompass the interception and [[Code|decoding]] of enemy [[radio communications]], and the communications technologies and [[cryptography]] methods used to counter such interception, as well as [[Radio jamming|jamming]], radio stealth, and other related areas. Over the later years of the 20th century and early years of the 21st century, this has expanded to cover a wide range of areas: the use of, detection of and avoidance of detection by [[radar]] and [[sonar]] systems, [[hack (technology slang)|computer hacking]], etc.

===Fourth generation===
{{main|Fourth generation warfare}}

Fourth generation warfare (4GW) is a concept defined by [[William S. Lind]] and expanded by [[Thomas X. Hammes]], used to describe the [[decentralized]] nature of modern warfare. The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent ideological network. Fourth Generation wars are characterized by a blurring of the lines between war and politics, combatants and civilians, conflicts and peace, battlefields and safety.

While this term is similar to terrorism and asymmetric warfare, it is much narrower. Classical [[insurgencies]] and the [[Indian Wars]] are examples of pre-modern wars, not 4GW. Fourth generation warfare usually has the insurgency group or non-state side trying to implement their own government or reestablish an old government over the one currently running the territory. The blurring of lines between state and non-state is further complicated in a democracy by the power of the [[News media|media]].

===Ground===
{{main|Land warfare}}

Ground warfare involves three types of combat units: [[Infantry]], [[Armoured warfare|Armor]], and [[Artillery]].

Infantry in modern times would consist of [[Mechanized infantry]] and [[Airborne forces]]. Usually having a type of rifle or sub-machine gun, an infantryman is the basic unit of an army.

Armored warfare in modern times involves a variety of [[Armored fighting vehicle]]s for the purpose of battle and support. Tanks or other armored vehicles (such as armored personnel carriers or tank destroyers) are slower, yet stronger hunks of metal. They are invulnerable to enemy machine gun fire but prone to rocket infantry, mines, and aircraft so are usually accompanied by infantry. In urban areas, because of smaller space, an armored vehicle is exposed to hidden enemy infantry but as the so-called "Thunder Run" at Baghdad in 2003 showed, armored vehicles can play a critical role in urban combat. In rural areas, an armored vehicle does not have to worry about hidden units though muddy and damp terrain have always been a factor of weakness for Armored tanks and vehicles.

Artillery in contemporary times, is distinguished by its large calibre, firing an [[explosive]] [[shell (projectile)|shell]] or [[rocket]], and being of such a size and weight as to require a specialized mount for firing and transport. Weapons covered by this term include "tube" artillery such as the [[howitzer]], [[cannon]], [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], [[field gun]], and [[rocket artillery]]. The term "artillery" has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal [[guidance systems]], even though some artillery units employ surface-to-surface [[missile]]s. Recent advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large calibre shells to be fitted with precision guidance fuses, blurring this distinction.

===Guerrilla===
{{main|Guerrilla warfare}}

Guerrilla warfare is defined as fighting by groups of [[irregular military|irregular]] troops (guerrillas) within areas occupied by the enemy. When guerrillas obey the [[laws and customs of war]], they are entitled, if captured, to be treated as ordinary [[prisoners of war]]; however, they are often treated by their captors as [[unlawful combatants]] and executed. The tactics of guerrilla warfare stress deception and ambush, as opposed to mass confrontation, and succeed best in an irregular, rugged, terrain and with a sympathetic populace, whom guerrillas often seek to win over or dominate by propaganda, reform, and terrorism. Guerrilla warfare has played a significant role in modern history, especially when waged by Communist liberation movements in Southeast Asia (most notably in the [[Vietnam War]]) and elsewhere.

Guerrilla fighters gravitate toward weapons which are easily accessible, low in technology, and low in cost. A typical arsenal of the modern guerrilla would include the [[AK-47]], [[Rocket propelled grenade|RPG]]s and [[Improvised explosive device]]s. The guerrilla doctrines' main disadvantage is the inability to access more advanced equipment due to economic, influence, and accessibility issues. They must rely on small unit tactics involving hit and run.  This situation leads to low intensity warfare, [[asymmetrical warfare]], and [[war amongst the people]]. The rules of Guerrilla warfare are to fight a little and then to retreat.

===Intelligence===
'''Propaganda'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{main|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is an ancient form of disinformation concerted with sending a set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people. Instead of impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience. The most effective propaganda is often completely truthful, but usually most modern propaganda presents facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis, or gives loaded messages in order to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the cognitive narrative of the subject in the target audience.

'''Psychological'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{main|Psychological warfare}}
Psychological warfare had its beginnings during the campaigns of [[Genghis Khan]] through the allowance of certain civilians of the nations, cities, and villages to flee said place, spreading terror and fear to neighboring principalities. [[Psychological]] actions have the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives.

'''Information'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{main|Information warfare}}
Made possible by the widespread use of the electronic media during World War II, [[Information warfare]] is a kind of warfare where [[information]] and attacks on information and its system are used as a tool of [[war]]fare. Some examples of this type of warfare are electronic "sniffers" which disrupt international fund-transfer networks as well as the signals of [[television]] and [[radio]] stations. Jamming such signals can allow participants in the war to use the stations for a misinformation [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].

===Naval===
{{main|Naval warfare|Modern naval tactics}}

Naval warfare takes place on the high seas (blue water navy). Usually, only large, powerful nations have competent blue water or deep water navies. Modern navies primarily use [[aircraft carriers]], [[submarines]], [[frigates]], [[cruisers]], and [[destroyers]] for combat. This provides a versatile array of attacks, capable of hitting ground targets, air targets, or other seafaring vessels. Most modern navies also have a large air support contingent, deployed from [[aircraft carriers]]. In World War II, small craft ([[motor torpedo boats]] variously called PT boats, MTBs, MGBs, ''Schnellbooten'', or MAS-boats) fought near shore. This developed in the [[Vietnam War]] into riverine warfare ([[brown water navy]]), in intertidal and river areas.  [[Irregular warfare]] makes this sort of combat more likely in the future.

===Network-centric===
{{main|Network-centric warfare}}

Network-centric warfare is essentially a new [[military doctrine]] made possible by the [[Information Age]]. [[Weapons platform]]s, [[sensor]]s, and [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] centers are being connected through high-speed communication networks. The doctrine is related to the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] debate.

The overall network which enables this strategy in the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] is called the [[Global Information Grid]].

===Nuclear===
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}

Nuclear war is a type of warfare which relies on nuclear weapons. There are two types of warfare in this category. In a limited nuclear war, a small number of weapons are used in a tactical exchange aimed primarily at enemy combatants. In a full-scale nuclear war, large numbers of weapons are used in an attack aimed at entire countries. This type of warfare would target both combatants and non-combatants.

===Space===
{{main|Space warfare}}

Space warfare is the hypothetical warfare that occurs outside the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. No wars have been fought here yet. The weapons would include [[orbital weaponry]] and [[space weapon]]s. High value [[outer space]] targets would include [[satellite]]s and [[weapon platform]]s. Notably no real weapons exist in space yet, though ground-to-space missiles [[Anti-satellite_weapon#Recent_ASATs|have been successfully tested against target satellites]]. As of now, this is purely [[science fiction]].

'''Moira Furnace''' is a nineteenth-century iron-making [[blast furnace]] located in [[Moira (Leicestershire)|Moira]], [[Leicestershire]], on the banks of the [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal]]. Built by the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Moira]] in 1804, the building has been preserved by North West Leicestershire District Council as a [[museum]] featuring [[Limekiln|lime kilns]] and craft workshops.

It is a most important industrial monument, since it is remarkably well-preserved, and dates from a formative period of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Cranstone"&gt;Cranstone, D., ed. (1985) ''The Moira Furnace: A Napoleonic Blast Furnace in Leicestershire'' Coalville: North West Leicestershire District Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Moira Furnace was a [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-fuelled, [[steam-engine]] blown [[blast furnace]] for the smelting of [[iron]] from local [[iron ore]], with an attached [[foundry]] for the manufacture of [[cast-iron]] goods.

The preserved furnace consists of the blast furnace, the attached bridgehouse, and the loading ramp. The blast furnace is the vertical structure with the blank arches at the lowest part of the site. The furnace within was supplied with raw materials (iron ore, coke, and [[limestone]]) by tipping them in through a charging port at the top, accessed from the bridgeloft. The loading ramp, which spans the [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal|Ashby Canal]], allowed the raw materials to be raised into the bridgeloft, which comprises the top floor of the bridgehouse, the large building with the pitched roof behind the furnace. In the bridgeloft the materials were probably weighed and, maybe, mixed before being charged into the furnace.

When the furnace was fired the steam engine blower, now gone, forced a continuous blast of air into the bottom of the furnace in order to make the coke burn brighter and raise the temperature inside high enough to melt the iron (1,538&amp;nbsp;°C, 2,800 °F). The hot gases exhausted from the low chimney at the top of the furnace. When ready, the molten iron was tapped from the bottom of the furnace and run into moulds to produce [[pig iron]].

Moira Furnace is one of the few remaining blast furnaces from this period of innovation - because it was a commercial failure. Had it been successful then it is highly likely that over time the site would have developed and the first furnace replaced.

==History==
In 1804, the Earl of Moira had the furnace constructed to take advantage of the iron ore and abundant coal which were present underground in the surrounding Ashby Woulds area owned by him. The location was chosen for its proximity to the [[Ashby Canal]] for transport, and the lie of the land which allowed the furnace to be built low down so the raw materials did not need raising very high.

However, this was a period of development in blast furnace design and some of the features of Moira Furnace do not appear to have been successful. It was brought into blast in 1806, and used intermittently until 1811, though the foundry remained in use until after 1844 by utilising iron brought in from elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Cranstone"/&gt;

The historical evidence shows that, although saleable iron was at times produced, over the period that the furnace operated it experienced continual problems. Documents mention bad design, bad construction, bad raw materials, and bad management, but many of the documents were written by individuals trying to divert the blame from themselves. The furnace was abandoned with its final charge still inside, partially smelted. Metallurgical examination has shown a high [[sulfur|sulphur]] content in the raw materials, which may have been a contributory factor, and the chimney shows signs of severe overheating, indicating a design fault or operating problem.&lt;ref name="Cranstone"/&gt;

The attached foundry continued to be used for some years, using brought-in pig iron, though it was demolished later in the 19th century. Meanwhile the bridgehouse and the engine house, which was a separate building to the side of the furnace, were converted to dwellings and survived. However, by the 1970s they had become derelict and affected by mining subsidence and the engine house was demolished. After pressure by Philip Riden and from Leicestershire Industrial History Society, the furnace and bridgehouse were scheduled as an [[scheduled ancient monument|ancient monument]]. The site was acquired by North West Leicestershire District Council in 1981, who sponsored a Community Programme to restore the site and develop it as a museum and country park.&lt;ref name="Cranstone"/&gt;

Inside the bridgehouse there is now a museum, operated by the Moira Furnace Museum Trust, which is open regularly. It has information boards and displays about Moira Furnace and the industrial heritage of the area.

The furnace has become a popular site for the detection of [[paranormal]] activity by Swadlincote Paranormal Investigations, who first visited the furnace with [[Richard Felix]] and [[Phil Whyman]]. They hold nocturnal events here, which are open to the public.

The '''Museum of Ancient Iran''' is the first [[Iran]]ian museum{{fact|date=November 2018}} and is located at the western part of Mashhq Square in [[Tehran]]. A French architect, named [[André Godard]], started the construction of the museum on May 11, 1934 by the order of [[Reza Shah]]. The museum building was completed in 1937 and then was opened for first public visits.
The land allocated to this museum is 5,500 square meters, of which 2,744 square meters is used for the foundation of the museum.&lt;ref name="kalouttour"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kalouttour.com/iran-bastan-museum-pictorial-book/|title=Iran Bastan museum pictorial book &amp;#124; Kalout Travel Agency|website=kalouttour.com|accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building==
Since the design of a museum should be relevant to its theme and the objects inside it, as well as being linked to the history and the art of that land, therefore, the facade and the entrance of the museum were both made in the same style of [[Taq Kasra]]. Taq Kasra was a palace in [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. The porch to the palace is 35 meters tall, 50 meters wide and 25 meters deep. Bricks used are dark red to reflect the [[Sasanian architecture]]. The museum is about 11,000 square meters, with its main building built in three floors.

The architects of this building, Andre Godard, along with Maxim Sirow, were French architects whose designs were inspired from the Palace of Kasra in the city of  Ctesiphon of the Sasanian  era.&lt;ref name="tavoosonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavoosonline.com/Articles/ArticleDetailEn.aspx?src=90&amp;Page=1|website=tavoosonline.com|title=National Museum of Iran (Iran-e Bastan) - Tavoos Online &amp;#124; Iran's First Bilingual Art Magazine &amp;#124;|accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the museum was started in the year 1934 and was completed within two years by Haj Abbasali Memar and Professor Morad Tabrizi. It was officially opened in 1937. Primarily, the first floor of the museum was dedicated to pre-Islamic [[history of Iran]] and the second floor to the post-Islamic era.

The development of [[archaeological excavations]] and the increasing accumulation of works in the Museum of Ancient Iran caused the museum to be in several stages, quantitative and qualitative expansion between the years 1979 to 1991, in addition to replacing museum displays, modernizing the heating system and the electrical system of the museum. Also the warehouse and treasures were built and added to the museum.

In 1996, the works of the Islamic era were officially separated from the Museum of Ancient Iran and moved to the adjacent building, which had been built in 1958.

This building was originally intended to be an [[anthropology]] museum. But after [[Iranian revolution]], with the establishment of the Cultural Heritage Organization and the concentration of ancient objects in the Museum of Ancient Iran, it was suggested that the museum be renamed   to the [[National Museum of Iran]] and another museum named Museum of the [[Islamic Art]] be added to it. Eventually, in 1996, with the official opening of the Islamic Museum, the whole complex of the Museum of Ancient Iran and the Museum of Islamic Era was officially named as the National Museum of Iran.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/national-museum-iran|title=National Museum of Iran &amp;#124; SILK ROADS|website=en.unesco.org|accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/k_amj/tehran_museum|website=pbase.com|author=Ali Majdfar|title=ANCIENT IRAN MUSEUM Photo Gallery – PERSIA the ANCIENT IRAN |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iran_s_Museums.htm Iran's Museums]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The oldest part of the museum, built by hand is made of [[quartz]] stones found in the basin of the river Kashaf Rud east of the city of [[Mashhad]]. The stones are more than a million years old. In this section, you will also find a [[treasure trove]] of [[Gilan province]] also of near [[Mahabad]], which goes back to 200 to 700&amp;nbsp;thousand years ago. From [[middle Paleolithic]] period, which coincides with the emergence of [[Neanderthal]] human in [[Iran]], also remains of interesting tools made of [[pyrite]] or remains of animal fossil fountains, found in caves in [[Zagros Mountains]] and central [[Iranian Plateau]] like the caves of [[Bisotun]] and [[Khorramabad]] which are put on show in the museum.

In the New Paleolithic period, which corresponds with the expansion of modern human intelligence in Iran, the construction of a [[blade]] of tools became common place. The oldest human remains discovered in Iran are seen in this section, which is known for its tooth. This tooth is the oldest remains of human fossils in Iran, which has been directly narrated and discovered in a cave, near [[Kermanshah]], called Wazma. This small Asian tooth, which is related to a nine-year-old child, belonged to 20–25&amp;nbsp;thousand years ago was discovered by [[gamma-ray spectroscopy]].

In the new Paleolithic period, making [[bone]] tools and using personalized decorations such as pillow pendants, animal teeth, and flowers were also common in Iran. One of the most important places of this period is the cave named Yafteh in [[Lorestan]] province which displays many of these objects in the museum hall. Some examples of hybrid instruments, the application of stratification, and the preservation of foodstuffs from the Ali Tappeh cave in [[Mazandaran]] and Shalom cave in [[Ilam Province|Ilam]] which are associated to the Metamorphosed Rock period can also be seen in the museum.

From the [[Neolithic]] and [[Romanesque art]], works such as the oldest Iranian clay from the Gange Darre Hill, the oldest human and animal mud samples from the Sarab Hill, and some stone tools are shown in the hall... Shoush ([[Khuzestan]]), Ismail-Abad and Cheshmeh Ali ([[Tehran]]), Taleyakon ([[Fars Province|Fars]]) from the most important sites in the 5th and 4th [[millennium]] BC. (Copper and stones) in Iran, with samples of their [[pottery]] are painted and seen in the hall. Interesting patterns of this period can be seen in the simplified pattern of mountain goats, which are seen at the level of pottery of Ismail-Abad and Cheshmeh Ali.

Vessels of Jiroft and Shahdad with diverse designs such as the battle of man with mythological beasts and the pattern of geometric, animal and plant elements are typical examples of these vessels displayed in showcases. Another important work of this period in the museum is the flower of Shahdad, which shows the naked man with his hands on the chest, probably in [[prayer]] mode. Containers, war devices, decorative objects, human and animal buildings, including the metal objects of the late [[Bronze Age]] and the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], are shown in the hall.

A number of objects displayed in the [[prehistoric art]] section of the hall belong to the Ilam civilization.

Of all the periods in Ilam, many works of art have survived, but the middle era of Ilam, is known as one of the most beautiful trials of the Ilamis. Chogha Zanbil. Temple is one of the most important architectural remnants of this period, with remarkable works such as cow's statue with inscriptions, glass tubes, bricks and [[clones]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} on it, are featured in the hall.

The works in the museum hall attributable to the [[Medes]] era are from the ancient places of Nowshajan, Hasanlu, Godin, and Babajan. During this era, the construction of iron objects expanded, including the objects of Hasanlu, which is one of the most prominent examples in the hall. Also a beautiful glazed pottery was created, a spectacular example of which is the glaze of Zivia, showing two goats on the two sides of a Lotus flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/museum/tehran-national-museum/ Tehran, National Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nautical Archaeology Program''' (NAP) is a degree-granting program within the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929210141/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/index.htm Anthropology Department] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]].

The Nautical Archaeology Program offers admission to students seeking graduate degrees in [[Maritime archaeology|nautical archaeology]]. The primary focus is on training archaeologists to become divers, rather than teaching divers the principles of anthropology and archaeology.  Students are also required to learn the principles of archaeological conservation, with primary emphasis on the treatment of waterlogged artifacts.

==Academic Program==
The program has six full-time faculty members and many research associates who conduct surveys, excavations, conservation and reconstruction of ancient, medieval, and early modern shipwrecks. Each professor holds an endowed fellowship.  All NAP students are required to take several core courses: History of Wooden Shipbuilding, Research and Reconstruction of Ships, Conservation of Cultural Resources, and Archaeological Methods and Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/academic/classes.html NAP Class Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The average time to complete a master's degree is three to five years; for a Ph.D. the average is five to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Donny L. 2005. ''The Institute of Nautical Archaeology &amp; The Nautical Archaeology Program: A History of Both Institutions, Their Interaction, and Their Role in Student Education''. The INA Quarterly, 32(2) 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The program admits between eight and ten students each year. Graduating students are awarded their M.A. or Ph.D. in Anthropology.

==History of the Program==
The Nautical Archaeology Program began after the [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]] (INA) became affiliated with Texas A&amp;M University in 1976.  As part of the affiliation, Texas A&amp;M established the Nautical Archaeology Program as a separate entity.  Since the first excavations INA carried out were in the Mediterranean, the main focus was initially on Old World nautical archaeology; after affiliating with the University, a New World archaeologist joined the staff, and work began in North America and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, George F. "Introduction: Reclaiming Lost History from Beneath the Seven Seas" ''In Beneath the Seven Seas: Adventures with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology'', ed. George F. Bass, 10-27. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishment of a department dedicated to the discipline allowed [[nautical archaeology]] to develop into an important subfield of archaeology.

===Creation of Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation===
In 2005, the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents established the [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] (CMAC), a research center intended to be the main mechanism of cooperation between the Nautical Archaeology Program and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. All of the laboratories once part of the Nautical Archaeology Program are now administered by CMAC. CMAC is meant to be the Nautical counterpart of the Center for the Study of the First Americans (CSFA), a highly regarded research institute affiliated with Texas A&amp;M which works closely with the terrestrial archaeologists in the Anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nautical Archaeology Program Faculty===
The staff of six full-time professors of Nautical Archaeology makes the NAP one of the largest academic programs in nautical archaeology in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; NAP professors direct most of INA's projects, since the security offered by their permanent positions allows a long-term commitment to excavation and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Each professor holds an endowed fellowship, professorship, or chair&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of the program, there have been only 11 faculty members: Dr. [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]], Dr. Frederick van Doornick, Jr., Dr. Fred Hocker, J. Richard Steffy, Dr. Deborah Carlson, Dr. Filipe Vieira de Castro, Dr. Kevin Crisman, Dr. Donny Hamilton, Dr. Cemal Pulak, Dr. C. Wayne Smith, and Dr. Shelley Wachsmann.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bass and Dr. van Doornick are now professors emeriti and Dr. Hocker left the program in 1999 after eight years of teaching to take a position with the Center for Maritime Archaeology, part of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in Roskilde. J. Richard Steffy died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder on November 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04steffy.html NY Times Obituary, December 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation "Wooden Leg"''' ({{lang-he|מבצע רגל עץ}} ''Mivtza Regel Etz'') was an attack by [[Israel]] on the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) headquarters in [[Hammam Chott]], near [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], on October 1, 1985. With a target 1,280 miles (2,060&amp;nbsp;km) from the operation's starting point, this was the most distant publicly known action undertaken by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] since [[Operation Entebbe|Operation "Entebbe"]] in 1976. It has been [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 573|condemned]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]].

== Background ==

After the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] had been based in [[Tunisia]]. On September 25, 1985, during the Jewish holy day of [[Yom Kippur]], three Palestinian gunmen hijacked an Israeli [[yacht]] off the coast of [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], and killed three Israeli tourists on board. In [[Jerusalem]], an anonymous caller told the western agency that the attack was carried out by the PLO's elite [[Force 17]] unit. However, PLO officials denied that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/26/world/3-israelis-slain-by-palestinians-in-cyprus.html|title=3 ISRAELIS SLAIN BY PALESTINIANS IN CYPRUS|last=Times|first=Margaret L. Rogg and Special To the New York|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israelis were allowed to write down their final thoughts before being shot. The nature of the killings provoked widespread shock in Israel. The PLO claimed that the victims were [[Mossad]] agents monitoring Palestinian naval traffic out of Cyprus. The attack was a response for the capture and imprisonment of senior Force 17 commander [[Faisal Abu Sharah]] by the [[Israeli Navy]] two weeks earlier. Sharah had been sailing on the ''Opportunity'', a small ship that regularly shuttled between [[Beirut]] and Larnaca, when it was stopped by an Israeli naval [[patrol boat]] with Mossad agents on board. Sharah was arrested, taken to Israel and interrogated. He was then tried and given a heavy prison sentence. Since then, the Israeli Navy and the Mossad had intercepted several other vessels and arrested passengers suspected of terrorist activity.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Thomas, Gordon: ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seale, 1993.  p237&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] and the [[Israeli Air Force]] desired immediate retaliation, and chose the [[Tunis]] headquarters of the PLO as their target. Intelligence supplied to Israel by [[Jonathan Pollard]] on the Tunisian and Libyan air defense systems greatly facilitated the raid.&lt;ref name="Does Jonathan Pollard Deserve a Life Sentence?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/796.html |title=Does Jonathan Pollard Deserve a Life Sentence? |last=Black |first=Edwin |date=20 June 2002 |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, the Arab press had published numerous warnings of Israeli retaliation. Many of the stories were planted by {{ill|Lohamah Psichologit|lt=LAP|fr}}, the Mossad's department of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;

On the eve of the attack, Tunisia expressed concern to the United States that it may be attacked by Israel. However, the United States, according to a high-ranking Tunisian official, assured Tunisia there was no reason to worry.&lt;ref name =seelye/&gt;

== Operation ==

The strike was carried out by eight [[F-15 Eagle]]s. At 07:00 on October 1, the aircraft took off from [[Tel Nof Airbase]]. A [[Boeing 707]] heavily modified for refueling operations [[Aerial refueling#Israeli Tunisian Strike|refueled]] the F-15s in mid-flight over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in order to allow the operation to be executed over such a distance. The [[Israeli Navy]] stationed a helicopter-carrying vessel near [[Malta]] to recover downed pilots, but these were never needed. The route was designed to avoid detection by [[Egypt]]ian and [[Libya]]n radars, and [[United States Navy]] vessels patrolling the Mediterranean. IAF commander [[Amos Lapidot]] saw little chance of resistance from the [[Tunisian Air Force]] or from Tunisian air defenses, but believed that on such a long flight, technical problems could arise.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Ian: ''Israel's Secret Wars: A History of Israel's Intelligence Services''&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-15s flew low over the shore, and fired [[precision-guided munition]]s on the PLO headquarters, a cluster of sand-colored buildings along the seaside. The planes attacked the southern location first, so that the northern wind would not pull smoke over the northern targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaf.org.il/46940-33087-en/IAF.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The attack lasted for six minutes, after which the F-15s flew back to Israel, refueled again by the Boeing 707.

The PLO headquarters was completely destroyed, although [[Yasser Arafat]], the head of the organization, was not there at the time and escaped unharmed. Israel claimed that some 60 PLO members were killed, including several leaders of Force 17, and several of Arafat's bodyguards. In addition, the operation resulted in casualties among civilian bystanders.&lt;ref name=seelye&gt;{{cite news |last=W. Seelye |first=Talcott |title=Ben Ali Visit Marks Third Stage in 200-Year-Old US-Tunisian Special Relationship |newspaper=The Washington Report |pages=7  |date=March 1990 |url=http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0390/9003007.htm |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, 56 Palestinians and 15 Tunisians were killed and about 100 wounded.&lt;ref name="s138"&gt;Seale, 1993. p.238&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital sources put the final count at 47 dead and 65 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/world/tunisia-s-leader-bitter-at-the-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the attack was conducted so far from Israel, Tunisian sources believed that attack must have been known by the United States, if not actually involving American collaboration.&lt;ref name=seelye/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The attack provoked a strong outcry, even in the [[United States]], Israel's strongest ally. Though initially labeling the strike a "legitimate response to terror," the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] later said the attack "cannot be condoned." The attack also harmed [[Tunisia–United States relations|relations between the US administration and the Tunisian president]], [[Habib Bourguiba]]. Believing the US knew about the attack, and was possibly involved, Tunisia considered breaking diplomatic ties with the US.&lt;ref name =seelye/&gt;

[[Egypt]] suspended negotiations with Israel over the disputed border town of [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]]. [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Shimon Peres]] was quoted as saying "It was an act of self-defense. Period."

In the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 573]] (1985), the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] voted (with the United States [[Abstention|abstaining]]) to condemn the attack on Tunisian territory as a flagrant violation of the [[United Nations Charter]] and considered that Tunisia had the right to appropriate [[Reparation (legal)|reparations]].&lt;ref name="UN_SRES5731985"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-573(1985) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1985 |accessdate=2007-08-10| date=4 October 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Tunisia, there was public outrage. For a week after the attack, the country's small Jewish community found itself the target of individual acts of antisemitism,  such as insults and stone-throwing against Jewish shops. On October 8, 1985, on the island of [[Djerba]], a Tunisian police officer who had lost a brother in the attack fired into a synagogue during [[Simchat Torah]] services,  killing three people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4614387,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paradise Lost''''' is an [[epic poem]] in [[blank verse]] by the 17th-century English poet [[John Milton]] (1608–1674). The first version, published in 1667, consisted of ten books with over ten thousand lines of [[verse (poetry)|verse]]. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in the manner of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'') with minor revisions throughout and a note on the versification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |year=1674 |last=Milton |first=John  |title=Paradise Lost; A Poem in Twelve Books  |publisher=S.

The poem concerns the [[The Bible|biblical]] story of the [[Fall of Man]]: the temptation of [[Adam and Eve]] by the [[fallen angel]] [[Satan]] and their expulsion from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Milton's purpose, stated in Book I, is to "justify the ways of God to men".{{refn|Milton's original line read "...justifie the wayes of God to men."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton]].

==Composition==
[[File:Paradise Lost 10.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]], ''The Heavenly Hosts,'' c. 1866, illustration to ''Paradise Lost''.]]
In his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''Paradise Lost'', the Milton scholar John Leonard notes, "John Milton was nearly sixty when he published Paradise Lost in 1667. The biographer [[John Aubrey]] (1626–97) tells us that the poem was begun in about 1658 and finished in about 1663. However, parts were almost certainly written earlier, and its roots lie in Milton's earliest youth."{{sfn|Leonard|2000|p=xii}} Leonard speculates that the [[English Civil War]] interrupted Milton's earliest attempts to start his "epic [poem] that would encompass all space and time."{{sfn|Leonard|2000|p=xii}}

Leonard also notes that Milton "did not at first plan to write a biblical epic".{{sfn|Leonard|2000|p=xii}} Since epics were typically written about heroic kings and queens (and with pagan gods), Milton originally envisioned his epic to be based on a legendary Saxon or British king like the legend of [[King Arthur]].{{sfn|Leonard|2000|p=xiii}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1972|p=54}} In the 1667 version of ''Paradise Lost'', the poem was divided into ten books. However, in the 1672 edition, ''Paradise Lost'' contained twelve books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forsythe|first1=Neil|title=The Satanic Epic|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having gone totally blind in 1652, Milton wrote ''Paradise Lost'' entirely through dictation with the help of [[Amanuensis|amanuenses]] and friends. He also wrote the epic poem while he was often ill, suffering from [[gout]], and despite the fact that he was suffering emotionally after the early death of his second wife, Katherine Woodcock, in 1658, and the death of their infant daughter. &lt;ref&gt;Abrahm, M.H., Stephen Greenblatt, Eds. ''[[The Norton Anthology of English Literature]]''. New York: Norton, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The poem is divided into "books" (ten originally, twelve in Milton's revised edition of 1674). The Arguments (brief summaries) at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradise Lost: A Norton Critical Edition|last=Teskey|first=Gordon|publisher=Norton|year=2005|isbn=978-0393924282|location=New York|pages=xxvii-xxviii|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Martin, John - Satan presiding at the Infernal Council - 1824.JPG|thumb|[[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], ''[[Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council]]'', c. 1823–1827]]
[[File:GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gustave Doré]], ''Depiction of Satan'', the central character of [[John Milton]]'s ''Paradise Lost'' c.&amp;nbsp;1866]]

The poem follows the epic tradition of starting ''[[in medias res]]'' (Latin for ''in the midst of things''), the background story being recounted later.

Milton's story has two narrative arcs, one about [[Satan]] ([[Lucifer#Christianity|Lucifer]]) and the other following [[Adam and Eve]]. It begins after Satan and the other [[fallen angel|rebel angels]] have been defeated and banished to [[Hell]], or, as it is also called in the poem, [[Tartarus]]. In [[Pandæmonium (Paradise Lost)|Pandæmonium]], the capital city of Hell, Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organize his followers; he is aided by [[Mammon]] and [[Beelzebub]]. [[Belial]] and [[Moloch]] are also present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to corrupt the newly created [[Earth]] and God's new and most favoured creation, Mankind. He braves the dangers of the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]] alone in a manner reminiscent of [[Odysseus]] or [[Aeneas]]. After an arduous traversal of the Chaos outside Hell, he enters God's new material World, and later the Garden of Eden.

At several points in the poem, an [[War in Heaven|Angelic War]] over Heaven is recounted from different perspectives. Satan's rebellion follows the epic convention of large-scale warfare. The battles between the faithful angels and Satan's forces take place over three days. At the final battle, the Son of God single-handedly defeats the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishes them from Heaven. Following this purge, God [[Genesis creation narrative|creates the World]], culminating in his creation of Adam and Eve. While God gave Adam and Eve [[free will|total freedom]] and power to rule over all creation, he gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] on penalty of death.

The story of Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without [[sin]]. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with [[rhetoric]]. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another – if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a [[heroic]] figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong.

After eating the fruit, Adam and Eve have lustful sex. At first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]] for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination.

Meanwhile, Satan returns triumphantly to Hell, amidst the praise of his fellow fallen angels. He tells them about how their scheme worked and Mankind has fallen, giving them complete dominion over Paradise. As he finishes his speech, however, the fallen angels around him become hideous snakes, and soon enough, Satan himself turned into a snake, deprived of limbs and unable to talk. Thus, they share the same punishment, as they shared the same guilt.

Eve appeals  to Adam for  reconciliation of their actions.   Her encouragement enables them to approach God,  and sue for grace, bowing on supplicant knee, to receive forgiveness.  In a vision shown to him by the [[Michael (archangel)|angel Michael]], Adam witnesses everything that will happen to Mankind until the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]]. Adam is very upset by this vision of the future, so Michael also tells him about Mankind's potential redemption from original sin through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (whom Michael calls "King Messiah").

Adam and Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find "a paradise within thee, happier far". Adam and Eve also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the [[Garden of Eden]]).

==Characters==

===Satan===
[[Satan]], formerly called [[Lucifer]], is the first major character introduced in the poem. He was once the most beautiful of all angels, and is a tragic figure who famously declares: "Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven." Following his failed [[War in Heaven|rebellion]] against [[God in Christianity|God]], he is cast out from Heaven and condemned to Hell. Satan's desire to rebel against his creator stems from his unwillingness to be subjugated by God and his Son, claiming that angels are "self-begot, self-raised,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Milton|1674}}, [[s:Paradise Lost/Book V|5:860]].&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby denying God's authority over them as their creator.

Satan is deeply arrogant, albeit powerful and [[charism]]atic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Satan's persuasive powers are evident throughout the book; not only is he cunning and deceptive, but he is also able to rally the fallen angels to continue in the rebellion after their agonizing defeat in the Angelic War. He argues that God rules as a tyrant and that all the angels ought to rule as gods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Milton|1674}}, [[s:Paradise Lost/Book V|5:794–802]].&lt;/ref&gt; Though commonly understood to be the antagonizing force in ''Paradise Lost'', Satan may be best defined as a tragic or Hellenic hero. According to William McCollom, one quality of the classical tragic hero is that he is not perfectly good and that his defeat is caused by a tragic flaw, as Satan causes both the downfall of man and the eternal damnation of his fellow fallen angels despite his dedication to his comrades. In addition, Satan's Hellenic qualities, such as his immense courage and, perhaps, lack of completely defined morals compound his tragic nature.&lt;ref&gt;McCollom, William G. ―The Downfall of the Tragic Hero.‖ College English 19.2 (1957): 51- 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Satan's status as a protagonist in the epic poem is debated.  Milton characterizes him as such, but Satan lacks several key traits that would otherwise make him the definitive protagonist in the work. One deciding factor that insinuates his role as the protagonist in the story is that most often a protagonist is heavily characterized and far better described than the other characters, and the way the character is written is meant to make him seem more interesting or special to the reader. &lt;ref name="Taha, Ibrahim 2002"&gt;(Taha, Ibrahim. "Heroism In Literature." The American Journal of Semiotics18.1/4 (2002): 107-26. Philosophy Document Center. Web. 12 Nov. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; For that matter, Satan is both well described and is depicted as being quite versatile in that he is shown as having the capacity to do evil whilst retaining his characteristic sympathetic qualities and thus it is this complex and relatable nature that makes him a likely candidate for the story's overarching protagonist.&lt;ref name="Taha, Ibrahim 2002"/&gt;

By some definitions a protagonist must be able to exist in and of himself or herself and that the secondary characters in the work exist only to further the plot for the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Taha, Ibrahim. "Heroism In Literature." The American Journal of Semiotics18.1/4 (2002): 107-26. Philosophy Document Center. Web. 12 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Because Satan does not exist solely for himself, as without God he would not have a role to play in the story, he may not be viewed as the protagonist because of the continual shifts in perspective and relative importance of characters in each book of the work. Satan's existence in the story involves his rebellion against God and his determination to corrupt the beings he creates in order to perpetuate evil so that there can be a discernable balance and justice for both himself and his fallen angels. Therefore, it is more probable that he exists in order to combat God, making his status as the definitive protagonist of the work relative to each book. Following this logic, Satan may very well be considered as an antagonist in the poem, whereas God could be considered as the protagonist instead.

Satan's status as a traditional hero in the work is similarly up to debate as the term "hero" evokes different meanings depending on the time and the person giving the definition and is thus a matter of contention within the text. According to Aristotle, a hero is someone who is "superhuman, godlike, and divine" but is also human.&lt;ref name="Steadman, John M 1959 pp. 89"&gt;Steadman, John M. "Heroic Virtue and the Divine Image in Paradise Lost. "Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 22.1/2 (1959): pp. 89&lt;/ref&gt; A hero would have to either be a human with God-like powers or the offspring of God. While Milton gives reason to believe that Satan is superhuman, as he was originally an angel, he is anything but human. Therefore, according to Aristotle's definition of a hero alone, Satan is not a hero. [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Francesco Piccolomini]] expanded on Aristotle's definition and declared that for someone to be considered heroic one has to be perfectly or overly virtuous.&lt;ref name="Steadman, John M 1959 pp. 90"&gt;Steadman, John M. "Heroic Virtue and the Divine Image in Paradise Lost. "Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 22.1/2 (1959): pp. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Satan repeatedly demonstrates a lack of virtue throughout the story as he intends to tempt God's creations with evil in order to destroy the good God is trying to create. Satan goes against God's law and therefore becomes corrupt and lacking of virtue and, as Piccolomini warned, "vice may be mistaken for heroic virtue".&lt;ref name="Steadman, John M 1959 pp. 89"/&gt; Satan is very devoted to his cause, although that cause is evil but he strives to spin his sinister aspirations to appear as good ones. Satan achieves this end multiple times throughout the text as he riles up his band of fallen angels during his speech by deliberately telling them to do evil to explain God's hypocrisy and again during his entreaty to Eve. He makes his intentions seem pure and positive even when they are rooted in evil and, according to Steadman, this is the chief reason that readers often mistake Satan as a hero.&lt;ref name="Steadman, John M 1959 pp. 90"/&gt;

Although Satan's army inevitably loses the war against God, Satan achieves a position of power and begins his reign in Hell with his band of loyal followers, composed of fallen angels, which is described to be a "third of heaven". Satan's characterization as the leader of a failing cause folds into this as well and is best exemplified through his own quote, "to be weak is to be miserable; Doing or Suffering", as through shared solidarity espoused by empowering rhetoric, Satan riles up his comrades in arms and keeps them focused towards their shared goal.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, John. Paradise Lost. The Norton Anthology of English Literature. 9th ed. Vol. B. New York ; London: W.W. Norton, 2012. 1950. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to Milton's republican sentiments of overthrowing the King of England for both better representation and parliamentary power, Satan argues that his shared rebellion with the fallen angels is an effort to "explain the hypocrisy of God", and in doing so, they will be treated with the respect and acknowledgement that they deserve. As scholar Wayne Rebhorn argues, "Satan insists that he and his fellow revolutionaries held their places by right and even leading him to claim that they were self-created and self-sustained" and thus Satan's position in the rebellion is much like that of his own real world creator.&lt;ref&gt;Rebhorn, Wayne A. "The Humanist Tradition and Milton's Satan: The Conservative as Revolutionary". Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900, Vol. 13, No. 1, The English Renaissance (Winter 1973), pp. 81-93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam===

[[File:William Blake - The Temptation and Fall of Eve (Illustration to Milton's "Paradise Lost") - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Blake]], ''The Temptation and Fall of Eve'', 1808 (illustration of Milton's ''Paradise Lost'')]]
[[Adam]] is the first human being created by God. Finding himself alone, Adam complains and requests a mate from God, who grants his request and creates Eve to be Adam's conjugal companion and helpmate. God appraises Adam and Eve most of all his creations, and appoints them to rule over all the creatures of the world and to reside in the Garden of Eden. Adam is more gregarious than Eve, and yearns for her company. His complete infatuation with Eve, while pure of itself, eventually contributes to his deciding to join her in disobedience to God.

Unlike the biblical Adam, before Milton's Adam leaves Paradise he is given a glimpse of the future of mankind by the Archangel Michael—including a synopsis of stories from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.

===Eve===
[[Eve]] is the second human created by God, who takes one of Adam's ribs and shapes it into a female form of Adam. Not the traditional model of a good wife, Milton's Eve is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is the more intelligent of the two and more curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge, specifically for self-knowledge. (Her first act in existence is to turn away from Adam to look at and ponder her own reflection.) Eve is beautiful and though she loves Adam she may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam to separate for a time and work in different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God by eating of the Tree of Knowledge. Soon thereafter, Adam follows Eve in support of her act.

===The Son of God===
The [[Son of God]] is the spirit who will become incarnate as [[Jesus Christ]], though he is never named explicitly because he has not yet entered human form. Milton believed in a [[Subordinationism|subordinationist]] doctrine of Christology that regarded the Son as secondary to the Father and as God's "great Vice-regent" (5.609). Milton's God in ''Paradise Lost'' refers to the Son as "My word, my wisdom, and effectual might" (3.170). The poem is not explicitly anti-trinitarian, but it is consistent with Milton's convictions. The Son is the ultimate hero of the epic and is infinitely powerful—he single-handedly defeats Satan and his followers and drives them into Hell. After their fall, the Son of God tells Adam and Eve about God's judgment: He, the Son, volunteers to journey into the World and become a man himself; then he redeems the Fall of Man through his own sacrificial death and resurrection. In the final scene, a vision of Salvation through the Son of God is revealed to Adam by Michael. Still, the name Jesus of Nazareth, and the details of Jesus' story are not depicted in the poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|1961|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are alluded to when Michael explains that "Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call," prefigures the Son of God, "his name and office bearing" to "quell / The adversarie Serpent, and bring back [...] long wander[e]d man / Safe to eternal Paradise of rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Milton|1674}}, [[s:Paradise Lost/Book XII#40|12:310-314]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===God the Father===
[[God the Father]] is the creator of Heaven, Hell, the world, of everyone and everything there is, through the agency of His Son. Milton presents God as all-powerful and all-knowing, as an infinitely great being who cannot be overthrown by even the great army of angels Satan incites against him. Milton's stated purpose for the poem is to justify the ways of God to men, so he portrays God as often conversing about his plans and his motives for his actions with the Son of God. The poem shows God creating the world in the way Milton believed it was done, that is, God created Heaven, Earth, Hell, and all the creatures that inhabit these separate planes from part of Himself, not out of nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lehnhof|2008|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Milton, the ultimate authority of God over all things that happen derives from his being the "author" of all creation. Satan tries to justify his rebellion by denying this aspect of God and claiming self-creation, but he admits to himself the truth otherwise, and that God "deserved no such return/ From me, whom He created what I was."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Milton|1674}}, [[s:Paradise Lost/Book IV#40|4:42–43]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lehnhof|2008|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raphael===
[[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] is the archangel whom God sends to warn Adam of Satan's infiltration of Eden and to warn that Satan will try to curse them (Adam and Eve). Raphael also discusses at length with the curious Adam some details about the creation and about events that transpired in Heaven.

===Michael===
[[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] is a mighty [[archangel]] who fought for God in the Angelic War. In the first battle, he wounds Satan terribly with a powerful sword that God fashioned to cut through even the substance of angels. After Adam and Eve disobey God by eating from the Tree of Knowledge, God sends the angel Michael to visit them in the garden. Before he escorts them out of Paradise, Michael shows them visions of the future that disclose an outline of Bible stories from that of [[Cain and Abel]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] through the story of Jesus Christ in the [[New Testament]].

==Motifs==

===Marriage===
Milton first presented Adam and Eve in Book IV with impartiality. The relationship between Adam and Eve is one of "mutual dependence, not a relation of domination or hierarchy." While the author placed Adam above Eve in his intellectual knowledge and, in turn, his relation to God, he granted Eve the benefit of knowledge through experience. Hermine Van Nuis clarifies, that although there is stringency specified for the roles of male and female, Adam and Eve unreservedly accept their designated roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Nuis|2000|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than viewing these roles as forced upon them, each uses their assignment as an asset in their  relationship with each other. These distinctions can be interpreted as Milton's view on the importance of mutuality between husband and wife.

When examining the relationship between Adam and Eve, some critics apply either an Adam-centered or Eve-centered view of [[hierarchy]] and importance to God. David Mikics argues, by contrast, these positions "overstate the independence of the characters' stances, and therefore miss the way in which Adam and Eve are entwined with each other".&lt;ref name="Mikics2004-p22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikics|2004|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Milton's narrative depicts a relationship where the husband and wife (here, Adam and Eve) depend on each other and, through each other's differences, thrive.&lt;ref name="Mikics2004-p22"/&gt;
Still, there are several instances where Adam communicates directly with God while Eve must go through Adam to God; thus, some have described Adam as her guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/52299|title=Miltonic Marriage and the Challenge to History in Paradise Lost|first=David|last=Mikics|date=24 February 2004|publisher=|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=46|issue=1|pages=20–48|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/tsl.2004.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Milton does not directly mention divorce, critics posit theories on Milton's view of divorce based upon their inferences from the poem and from his [[Milton's divorce tracts|tracts on divorce]] written earlier in his life. Other works by Milton suggest he viewed marriage as an entity separate from the church. Discussing ''Paradise Lost'', Biberman entertains the idea that "marriage is a contract made by both the man and the woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberman|1999|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas imply Milton may have favored that both man and woman have equal access to marriage and to divorce.

===Idolatry===
Milton's 17th-century contemporaries by and large criticised his   ideas and considered him as a radical, mostly because of his Protestant views on politics and religion. One of Milton's most controversial arguments centred on his concept of what is idolatrous, which subject is deeply embedded in ''Paradise Lost''.

Milton's first criticism of [[idolatry]] focused on the constructing of temples and other buildings to serve as places of worship. In Book XI of ''Paradise Lost'', Adam tries to atone for his sins by offering to build altars to worship God. In response, the angel Michael explains that Adam does not need to build physical objects to experience the presence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Milton|1674}}, [[s:Paradise Lost/Book XI|Book 11]].&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Lyle points to this example, explaining "When Milton objects to architecture, it is not a quality inherent in buildings themselves he finds offensive, but rather their tendency to act as convenient loci to which idolatry, over time, will inevitably adhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyle|2000|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the idea is pure in nature, Milton thought it would unavoidably lead to idolatry simply because of the nature of humans. That is, instead of directing their thoughts towards God, humans will turn to erected objects and falsely invest their faith there. While Adam attempts to build an altar to God, critics note Eve is similarly guilty of idolatry, but in a different manner. Harding believes Eve's [[narcissism]] and obsession with herself constitutes idolatry.&lt;ref name="Harding2007-p163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harding|2007|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Harding claims that "... under the serpent's influence, Eve's idolatry and self-deification foreshadow the errors into which her 'Sons' will stray."&lt;ref name="Harding2007-p163"/&gt; Much like Adam, Eve falsely places her faith in herself, the Tree of Knowledge, and to some extent the Serpent, all of which do not compare to the ideal nature of God.

Milton made his views on idolatry more explicit with the creation of [[Pandæmonium (Paradise Lost)|Pandæmonium]] and his allusion to [[Solomon's temple]]. In the beginning of ''Paradise Lost'' and throughout the poem, there are several references to the rise and eventual fall of Solomon's temple. Critics elucidate that "Solomon's temple provides an explicit demonstration of how an artefact moves from its genesis in devotional practice to an idolatrous end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyle|2000|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This example, out of the many presented, distinctly conveys Milton's views on the dangers of idolatry. Even if one builds a structure in the name of God, the best of intentions can become immoral in idolatry. Further, critics have drawn parallels between both [[Pandæmonium (Paradise Lost)|Pandemonium]] and [[Saint Peter's Basilica]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. The majority of these similarities revolve around a structural likeness, but as Lyle explains, they play a greater role. By linking Saint Peter's Basilica and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] to [[Pandæmonium (Paradise Lost)|Pandemonium]]—an ideally false structure—the two famous buildings take on a false meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyle|2000|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison best represents Milton's Protestant views, as it rejects both the purely Catholic perspective and the Pagan perspective.

In addition to rejecting Catholicism, Milton revolted against the idea of a monarch ruling by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. He saw the practice as idolatrous. [[Barbara Lewalski]] concludes that the theme of idolatry in ''Paradise Lost'' "is an exaggerated version of the idolatry Milton had long associated with the Stuart ideology of divine kingship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewalski|2003|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of Milton, any object, human or non human, that receives special attention befitting of God, is considered idolatrous.

==Interpretation and critique==
[[File:MedinaPL3.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Creation of Man'', engraving from the 1688 edition, by [[John Baptist Medina]].]]

The writer and critic [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote that ''Paradise Lost'' shows off "[Milton's] peculiar power to astonish" and that "[Milton] seems to have been well acquainted with his own genius, and to know what it was that Nature had bestowed upon him more bountifully than upon others: the power of displaying the vast, illuminating the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the gloomy, and aggravating the dreadful."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel. ''Lives of the English Poets''. New York: Octagon, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton scholar John Leonard interpreted the "impious war" between Heaven and Hell as [[civil war]]:&lt;ref name="LeonardJohn"&gt;Leonard, John. "Introduction." Paradise Lost. New York: Penguin, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Paradise Lost'' is, among other things, a poem about civil war. Satan raises 'impious war in Heav'n' (i 43) by leading a third of the angels in revolt against God. The term 'impious war' implies that civil war is impious. But Milton applauded the English people for having the courage to depose and execute [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. In his poem, however, he takes the side of 'Heav'n's awful Monarch' (iv 960). Critics have long wrestled with the question of why an antimonarchist and defender of [[regicide]] should have chosen a subject that obliged him to defend monarchical authority.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editors at the Poetry Foundation argue that Milton's criticism of the English monarchy was being directed specifically at the Stuart monarchy and not at the monarchy system in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-milton|title=John Milton|date=19 April 2018|website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, critic and writer [[C.S. Lewis]] argued that there was no contradiction in Milton's position in the poem since "Milton believed that God was his 'natural superior' and that Charles Stuart was not." Lewis interpreted the poem as a genuine Christian morality tale.&lt;ref name="Leonard, John 2000"&gt;Leonard, John. "Introduction". Paradise Lost. New York: Penguin, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2016}} Other critics, like [[William Empson]], view it as a more ambiguous work, with Milton's complex characterization of Satan playing a large part in that perceived ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Leonard, John 2000"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2016}} Empson argued that "Milton deserves credit for making God wicked, since the God of Christianity is 'a wicked God.'" Leonard places Empson's interpretation "in the [Romantic interpretive] tradition of [[William Blake]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]."&lt;ref name="LeonardJohn" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2016}}

Blake famously wrote, "The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels &amp; God, and at liberty when of Devils &amp; Hell, is because he was a true Poet and of the Devil's party without knowing it."&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William. ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. 1793.&lt;/ref&gt; This quotation succinctly represents the way in which the 18th- and 19th-century English Romantic poets viewed Milton.

Empson's view is more complex. Leonard points out that "Empson never denies that Satan's plan is wicked. What he does deny is that God is innocent of its wickedness: 'Milton steadily drives home that the inmost counsel of God was the Fortunate Fall of man; however wicked Satan's plan may be, it is God's plan too [since God in ''Paradise Lost'' is depicted as being both omniscient and omnipotent].'"&lt;ref name="LeonardJohn" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2016}} Leonard calls Empson's view "a powerful argument", he notes that this interpretation was challenged by [[Dennis Danielson]] in his book ''Milton's Good God'' (1982).&lt;ref name="LeonardJohn" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2016}}

==Iconography==

[[File:Sin-Death-and-the-Devil-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Sin, Death and the Devil'' (1792), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the political battle between [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Thurlow]] as a scene from ''Paradise Lost''. Pitt is Death and Thurlow Satan, with [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] as Sin in the middle.]]

The first illustrations to accompany the text of ''Paradise Lost'' were added to the fourth edition of 1688, with one engraving prefacing each book, of which up to eight of the twelve were by Sir [[John Baptist Medina]], one by [[Bernard Lens II]], and perhaps up to four (including Books I and XII, perhaps the most memorable) by another hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/darknessvisible/illlustration/illustration.html ''Illustrating Paradise Lost''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201090932/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/darknessvisible/illlustration/illustration.html |date=1 February 2008 }} from Christ's College, Cambridge, has all twelve on line. See Medina's article for more on the authorship, and all the illustrations, which are also in Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; The engraver was [[Michael Burghers]] (not 'Burgesse' as given in the Christ's College website). By 1730 the same images had been re-engraved on a smaller scale by [[Peter Fourdrinier|Paul Fourdrinier]].

Some of the most notable illustrators of ''Paradise Lost'' included [[William Blake]], [[Gustave Doré]] and [[Henry Fuseli]]. However, the epic's illustrators also include [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], [[Edward Francis Burney]], [[Richard Westall]], [[Francis Hayman]], and many others.

Outside of book illustrations, the epic has also inspired other visual works by well-known painters like [[Salvador Dalí]] who executed a set of ten colour [[engraving]]s in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockportstreetgallery.com/ParadiseLost.htm Lockport Street Gallery].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With great difficulty his father sponsored his education till matriculation. After that he kept on getting scholarships and even did private tuitions to support his education.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; In his youth he came in contact with peasant leaders like [[Karyanand Sharma]] and [[Sahajanand Saraswati]] and scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and perhaps from them he imbibed the determination to fight for social justice and an abiding concern for the downtrodden which drew him to left ideology.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; His later association with Dr. [[Sachchidananda Sinha]], a social reformer and journalist, broadened his mental horizon and firmly rooted him in the reality of rural India and thus strengthened his ties with the left movement and brought him into the front rank of anti-imperialist and anti-communal intellectuals of the country.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

Sharma was foremost among the [[India]]n intellectuals who wanted historians to realise that the discipline of history was not just about what happened in the past but what its lessons were for imaginatively and intelligently responding to the challenges of the present.&lt;ref name="P.C.

Professor [[Sumit Sarkar]] opines: "Indian historiography, starting with [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] in the 1950s, is acknowledged the world over – wherever South Asian history is taught or studied – as quite on a par with or even superior to all that is produced abroad. And that is why [[Irfan Habib]] or [[Romila Thapar]] or R. S. Sharma are figures respected even in the most diehard anti-Communist American universities.

==As an institution builder==
Impatient with inefficiency and guided by his radicalism, Sharma had been a great builder of institutions.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; Under his guidance the department of History, [[Patna University]], drastically changed its syllabi and made a sharp departure from the communal and imperialist historiographical legacy of the colonial period.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; He has the credit of activising the department which was suffering from an almost incurable inertia and of initiating academic programmes which gave a distinct character to the History department of Patna University and thereby bringing it into the vanguard of secular and scientific historiography.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

In [[Delhi]], where he spent a smaller part of his teaching career, Sharma's achievements are no less significant. The development of the department of History, [[Delhi University]], owes a great deal to the efforts of Professor Sharma who radicalised it by converting it into a citadel of secular and scientific History and waged an all out war against communalist historiography.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

It is largely because of his efforts that the largest body of professional Indian historians, the [[Indian History Congress]], of which he was the general president in 1975 and which honoured him with [[H.K. Barpujari Award]] in 1989, has now become the symbol of secular and scientific approach to History.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

Sharma combined lifelong commitment to high-quality historical research on ancient India with equal commitment to high-quality teaching and imparting historical knowledge to several generations of students, a large number of whom grew under his care and guidance into serious scholars and researchers in their own right and enriched the profession.&lt;ref name="P.C. Joshi"/&gt; Further, he was also engaged for a large part of his life in nurturing and building institutions engaged in the teaching of history and historical research.&lt;ref name="P.C. Joshi"/&gt;

==Personality==
Sharma was known for his simplicity.&lt;ref name="K.M.Shrimali"/&gt; He was tall, fair and was always clad in dhoti-kurta.&lt;ref name="K.M.Shrimali"/&gt; Historian [[Suvira Jaiswal]], Sharma's first PhD student, remembers her teacher not only giving a lesson in good writing but even mundane stuff like how to put a pin in papers so it did not hurt anyone.&lt;ref name="Akshaya Mukul, TNN"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of his student, historian [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha]], "''A man of courage, conviction, utter humility and a strong social commitment, Professor Sharma is as unassuming as indefatigable in his academic pursuits. Full of compassion, he has been a constant source of inspiration to his pupils and other younger scholars. While he has been all warmth to his friends, he is extremely decent and generous to his detractors. His qualities of head and heart make him a truly great man.''"&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

==Writing style==
Professor Sharma's mastery of epigraphic, literary and archaeological texts enabled him to demolish many myths created by imperialist-colonialist historiography as well as by the cultural chauvinists of more recent times, and made scientific study of the ever-changing Indian society in all its dimensions possible.&lt;ref name="K.M.Shrimali"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His humility had no limits – he was always ready to learn even from a novice working in the discipline of history and go to the extent of acknowledging him/ her in his works.&lt;ref name="K.M.Shrimali"/&gt; Such a combination of scholarship and humility is not seen easily today, when even toddlers in history writing prefer to blow their own trumpets in the din of the market.&lt;ref name="K.M.Shrimali"/&gt;

In his writings Professor Sharma has focused on early Indian social structure, material and economic life, state formation and political ideas and the social context of religious ideologies and has sought to underline the historical processes which shaped [[Indian culture]] and civilisation.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; In his study of each of these aspects of [[Ancient India]]n History he has laid stress on the elements of change and continuity.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; This has significantly conditioned his methodology which basically rests on a critical evaluation of sources and a correlation between [[Text (literary theory)|literary texts]] with [[archaeology]] and [[ethnography]].&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; His methodology is being increasingly extended to the study of various aspects of Indian history just as the problems studied by him and the questions raised by him have generated a bulk of historical literature in recent years.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

In contrast to his predecessors who had focussed their attention on the study of higher orders, he published his ''Sudras in Ancient India'' as early as 1958 and examined the relationship of the lower social orders with the means of production from the [[Vedic age]] up to the [[Gupta period]].&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; In the following year (1959) his ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in Ancient India'', apart from national chauvinist and revivalist approach of earlier Historians, emphasised the material basis of the power structure in [[Ancient India]], a point he also stressed in his later work ''The Origin of State in India (1990)''.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; In 1965, his ''Indian Feudalism'' posed a major problem as to whether India passed through the phase of [[Feudalism]] (see [[Indian feudalism]]).&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; His ''Social Changes in Early Medieval India'', being the first Dev Raj Chanana Memorial Lecture, brought into focus the changes in social structure that accompanied the origin and growth of feudalism in early India and in 1987 his ''Urban Decay in India (c.300–1000)'' drew attention to the overwhelming mass of archaeological evidence to demonstrate the decline of urban centres in early medieval period which reinforces his arguments regarding the genesis and growth of feudalism in India.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; In another work, ''Material Culture and Social Formations in Ancient India (1985)'', on which he worked as Jawaharlal Nehru Fellow, Professor Sharma has sought to unravel the process of class formation, and social implications of the material changes in the [[Vedic period]] and in the age of the [[Buddha]] on the basis of literary and archaeological sources.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

Professor Sharma's researches cover the whole range of early Indian history and are largely summarised in his popular textbook ''Ancient India (1977)'' written for the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt; When this book was withdrawn under pressure of obscurantist elements he launched an attack on them in his ''In Defence of "Ancient India" (1979)'' and the book was subsequently restored.&lt;ref name="Jha 1996"/&gt;

===Theory of Feudalism===
The publication of his monograph ''[[Indian Feudalism (book)|Indian Feudalism]]'' in 1965 caused almost a furore in the academia, generating intense debate and sharp responses both in favour of and against the applicability of the model of "feudalism" to the Indian situation at any point of time.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; The concept of "feudalism" was initially used by [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] to analyse the developments in the socio-economic sphere in the late ancient and medieval periods of Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharma, while differing from Kosambi on certain significant points, added a great deal of depth to the approach with his painstaking research and forceful arguments.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; The work has been called his magnum opus.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; Criticism goaded Sharma into reinforcing his thesis by producing another work of fundamental importance, ''[[Urban Decay in India (c.300-1000)]]'', in which he marshalled an impressive mass of archaeological data to demonstrate the decline of urban centres, a crucial element of his thesis on feudalism.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; It won him the H.K. Barpujari award instituted by the [[Indian History Congress]].&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; However, the redoubtable professor was unstoppable, and in his ''[[Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation]]'' (Orient Longman, 2001), he further rebutted the objections of his critics point by point.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt;

Sharma applied the tool of historical materialism not only to explain social differentiation and stages of economic development, but also to the realm of ideology.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; His investigations into the "feudal mind" and "economic and social basis of tantrism" are thought-provoking, opening up new lines of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; In an earlier article, he examined "the material milieu of the birth of Buddhism", which now forms a part of his ''[[Material Culture and Social Formations in Ancient India]]'' (Macmillan, 1983).&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; The monograph, full of seminal ideas, has been translated into several Indian and foreign languages and has had 11 editions.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt;

===Other writings===
Sharma wrote two books, ''[[Looking for the Aryans]]'' (Orient Longman, 1995) and ''Advent of the Aryans in India'' (Manohar, 1999), to argue against the notion that [[Indigenous Aryans|Indo-European languages]] speakers were original inhabitants of India and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]] was their creation.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; After that, Sharma was part of a Government of India appointed committee to examine the historical veracity of claims made regarding [[Adam's Bridge|Ram Sethu]] by certain devout Hindus- specifically, that Ram Sethu was made by the Hindu God Ram and not a result of natural formation (the result of continuous wave action).&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; Sharma, who was the historian on the committee, submitted his report in December 2007 and thus helped in diffusing the crisis.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt; Incidentally, work on the report occasioned his last visit to Delhi.&lt;ref name="Suvira Jaiswal"/&gt;

==Views on communalism==
Sharma has denounced [[communalism (South Asia)|communalism]] of all types. In his booklet, ''Communal History and Rama's Ayodhya'', he writes, "[[Ayodhya]] seems to have emerged as a place of religious pilgrimage in medieval times. Although chapter 85 of the [[Vishnu]] [[Smriti]] lists as many as 52 places of pilgrimage, including towns, lakes, rivers, mountains, etc., it does not include [[Ayodhya]] in this list."&lt;ref name="countercurrents.org"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharma also notes that [[Tulsidas]], who wrote the [[Ramcharitmanas]] in 1574 at Ayodhya, does not mention it as a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="countercurrents.org"/&gt; After the demolition of [[Babri masjid]], he along with historians [[Suraj Bhan (archaeologist)|Suraj Bhan]], [[M. Athar Ali]] and [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha]] came up with the ''Historian's report to the nation'' on how the communalists were mistaken in their assumption that there was a temple at the disputed site and how it was sheer vandalism in bringing down the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Political controversies==
His 1977 ''Ancient India'' was banned by the [[Janata Party]] government in 1978, among other things for its criticism of the historicity of [[Krishna]] and the events of the [[Mahabharata]] epic, reporting the historical position that
:"Although Krishna plays an important role in the Mahabharata, inscriptions and sculptural pieces found in Mathura dating back to 200 BC and 300 AD do not attest to his presence. Because of this, ideas of an epic age based on the Ramayana and Mahabharata have to be discarded..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He has supported the addition of the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ayodhya dispute]] and the [[2002 Gujarat riots]] to school syllabus calling them 'socially relevant topics' to broaden the horizons of youngsters.&lt;ref name="The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his remark when the NCERT decided to include the Gujarat riots and the Ayodhya dispute besides the 1984 [[anti-Sikh riots]] in the Class XII political science books, arguing that these events influenced the political process in the country since Independence.&lt;ref name="The Times of India"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Andre Wink, professor of history at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] criticises Sharma in ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'' (Vol. I) for drawing too close parallels between European and Indian feudalism. Wink writes that R.S. Sharma's "''Indian Feudalism'' has misguided virtually all historians of the period."&lt;ref&gt;Wink, A. (1991) Al- Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World. Brill, page 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

On his death, at a function organised by the Indian Council of Historical Research and hosted by the [[Nehru Memorial Museum and Library]], eminent historians [[Romila Thapar]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|D N Jha]], [[Satish Chandra]], Kesavan Veluthat and ICHR Chairperson Basudev Chatterji paid rich tributes to Sharma and emphasised his influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{More citations needed|date=May 2011}}
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] is acknowledged to have been inspired by many sources. These include southern and eastern Asian religions, [[Qigong]], [[philosophy]], [[classical mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]], [[Zoroastrianism]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shintō]] and [[Taoism]], and countless cinematic precursors. Creator [[George Lucas]] stated "Most of the spiritual reality in the movie[s] is based on a synthesis of all religions. A synthesis through history; the way man has perceived the unknown and the great mystery and tried to deal with that or dealing with it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Science of Star Wars (miniseries)|Science of Star Wars]] (2005 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also speculated that ''Star Wars'' also takes inspirations from pre-Roman [[Celtic mythology|Celtic folklore]] ([[Arthurian legends]] are post-Roman, set around the third century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/weird-and-wonderful/celtic-myths-tales-might-have-inspired-star-wars-and-harry-potter|title=Celtic myths: the tales that might have inspired ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter''|work=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas has also said that [[chivalry]], [[knighthood]], [[paladin]]ism and related institutions in [[Feudalism|feudal societies]] inspired some concepts in the ''Star Wars'' movies, most notably the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]]. The work of the mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', directly influenced Lucas,&lt;ref name="Dreams"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy |date=2004 |medium=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is what drove him to create the "modern myth" of ''Star Wars''. The natural flow of energy known as [[the Force]] is believed to have originated from the concept of ''[[qi|qi/chi/ki]]'', "the all-pervading vital energy of the universe".

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of ''Star Wars'', [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] premiered a two-hour event covering the entire ''Star Wars'' saga entitled ''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]].'' Featuring interviews from the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Peter Jackson]], acclaimed [[scholar]]s and others, the program delved further into the [[Hero]]ic Epic concept and the influences of mythology and other motifs that were important in making ''Star Wars''. Subjects include [[Ancestral sin|sins of the father]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redeeming the father]], [[coming of age]], [[Interstellar travel in fiction|exiting the ordinary world]] and others.

==Similarities and inspirations==
&lt;!--Additional examples without references/citations may be removed. --&gt;

===Film and television===
[[File:Poster - Flash Gordon (Chapter 13, Rocketing to Earth) 03.jpg|thumb|The classic science fiction film serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' served as an inspiration for ''Star Wars''.]]
* ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' includes many elements derived from the 1936 Universal serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]''—the original property which George Lucas had sought to license before making the first ''Star Wars'' film—and its sequel, ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''. The basic plot involving the infiltration of a megalomaniacal outer-space Emperor's fortress by two heroes disguised in uniforms of soldiers of his army is drawn from ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'', with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo filling the roles of [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Prince Barin]], respectively, and [[Ming the Merciless]] the Emperor. The Emperor's deadly, hostile planet (the [[Death Star]]/[[Mongo (planet)|Mongo]]), a sometimes scantily-clad brunette space Princess whom the hero defends ([[Princess Leia]]/[[Princess Aura]]), a big, strong, hairy, animal-like ally ([[Chewbacca]]/[[Prince Thun]] of the Lion Men), a fearsome monster found underground and/or fought in an arena by the hero (the Rancor/the Gocko or Orangopoid), a city in the sky ruled by someone who originally works with the villains but later joins the heroes ([[Lando Calrissian]] of Cloud City), ray-guns, and dogfighting spaceships were all elements retained from the first Universal Flash Gordon serial. The opening text crawl of Star Wars is in the same style as the text openings of each chapter of the ''Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe'' serial.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* ''Star Wars'' was also influenced by the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] created for [[Buck Rogers]], a character appearing in late 1920s pulp magazines, comic strips (1929–67) and later a [[Buck Rogers (serial)|1939 film serial]] and a 1950–51 TV series.&lt;ref name="Dreams"/&gt;
* In an interview, Lucas has specifically cited the fact that he became acquainted with the term ''[[jidaigeki]]'' ("period drama", the Japanese genre of samurai films) while in Japan, and it is widely assumed that he took inspiration for the term [[Jedi]] from this.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php |title=History of the Jedi &amp; The Jedi Religion |publisher=Jedi Sanctuary |first=Jedi M. |last=Duggan |accessdate=2007-07-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190015/http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php |archivedate=2007-06-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb-trivia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/trivia|title=Trivia for Star Wars (1977)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="docu"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed |network= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |airdate=2007-05-28 |minutes=about 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Akira Kurosawa]] films:
** ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) {{ndash}} ''A New Hope'' features the exploits of [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], whereas the plot of ''The Hidden Fortress'' is told from the point of view of two bickering peasants.  The two peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are first shown escaping a battle, while C-3PO and R2-D2 are first shown fleeing an attack in ''A New Hope''. Additionally, both films feature a battle-tested General – Rokurota Makabe in ''The Hidden Fortress'' and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in ''A New Hope'' – who assist a rebellion led by a princess and engage in a duel with a former rival whom they fought years earlier.  Lucas also features many horizontal [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]] scene transitions in ''Star Wars'', a technique used thoroughly by Kurosawa in his films. Similarly, the Princess trades places with a slave girl in ''The Hidden Fortress'', with the slave girl acting as a decoy for the real Princess. In ''The Phantom Menace'', [[Queen Amidala]] trades places with one of her handmaidens who acts as a decoy.
** ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961) inspired the brawl scene in the Cantina. Its sequel ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962) inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick.&lt;ref name="InspirationsLucas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=10 films that influenced Star Wars|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/star-wars/10817059/10-films-that-influenced-Star-Wars.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=May 10, 2014|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' (1975), just two years before the first ''Star Wars'' movie, there are two scenes that bear a striking resemblance to scenes in ''Star Wars''. The first is the Captain and Dersu looking out over the horizon, seeing both the setting sun and the rising moon at the same time. This is much like when Luke Skywalker stares out on the sky with binary suns in ''A New Hope''. The other scene is when Dersu and the Captain are suddenly caught in a blizzard, and they have to quickly build a shelter to spend the night, to survive the cold. The Captain collapses from the cold and Dersu has to drag and stuff him into the shelter. This is similar to the scene in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' where Han Solo cuts a tauntaun open with Luke's [[lightsaber]] and stuffs the unconscious Luke into it, when they get caught in a blizzard on the snow planet [[Hoth]].
* The costume for Darth Vader was visually inspired by the character "The Lightning" in the [[Republic Pictures]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Fighting Devil Dogs]]''. The Lightning also had an army of white-armored stormtroopers and flew through the sky in a large triangular airship (the "flying wing").
* Darth Vader's need to wear his helmet to breathe recalls the oxygen helmets of the underground-dwelling Muranians in the 1935 Mascot serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'', which are required by the caped Thunder Riders to be able to breathe on the surface.
* ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' features a pod racing action sequence. This entire sequence is inspired by the famous Chariot Race of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]''. The climactic moment when Sebulba's Pod attaches itself to Anakin's Pod mimicks, almost shot for shot, the climactic moment of the scene in ''Ben Hur'' when Messala accidentally locks wheels with Ben Hur.
* Lucas has also cited [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' as references for the style—if not the story—used in the films. A more direct homage to ''Lawrence of Arabia'' occurs in ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'', as Padme and Anakin talk while walking around the Theed palace on [[Naboo]]. It was filmed at the Plaza de España in [[Seville, Spain]], which in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was the site of the British Army headquarters in Cairo, and was shot in the exact manner as the scene in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' where Allenby ([[Jack Hawkins]]) and Dryden ([[Claude Rains]]) discuss whether to give artillery to Lawrence's Arab troops. In the same film, Padme and Anakin also retreat to an estate called Varykino – the name of the Gromeko family estate in ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.  (Some{{who|date=May 2011}} also have considered [[Tom Courtenay]]'s Pasha/Strelnikov character from ''Zhivago'' as an inspiration for Anakin/Darth Vader, but the similarities are likely coincidental.) Similarly, the chase sequence with Zam Wesell on Coruscant likely references ''[[Blade Runner]]''; Lucas based many of the Coruscant cityscapes on Los Angeles in 2019. A reference to ''The Searchers'' occurs in ''Star Wars'', when Luke discovers the burning moisture farm, while the Tusken Raiders sequence in ''Attack of the Clones'' recalls the climax of ''The Searchers''. Han's showdown with Greedo in ''Star Wars'' resembles a scene in another John Ford movie, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.
* Lucas is also a fan of [[Sergio Leone]]'s film ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', and according to Leone's biographer, [[Christopher Frayling]], he listened to the score from Leone's film while editing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Many{{who|date=May 2011}} have considered Vader's first appearance in ''A New Hope'' as being an "homage" to the introduction of [[Henry Fonda]]'s villainous Frank in the Leone film.
* The death scene of [[Yoda]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' is taken almost shot-for-shot from the death scene of the similarly mystical High Lama in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (Yoda and the High Lama also both share a diminutive form and odd cadence of speech).
* The attack on the [[Death Star]] in the climax of the film ''A New Hope'' is similar in many respects to the strategy of [[Operation Chastise]] from the 1954 British film, ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.  Rebel pilots have to fly through a trench while evading enemy fire and drop a single special weapon at a precise distance from the target to destroy the entire base with a single explosion; if one run fails another run must be made by a different pilot. Some scenes from the ''A New Hope'' climax are similar to those in ''The Dam Busters'' and some of the dialogue is nearly identical in the two films. These scenes are also heavily influenced by the action scenes from the fictional wartime film ''[[633 Squadron]]''. That film's finale shows the squadron's planes flying down a deep [[fjord]] while being fired at along the way by anti-aircraft guns lining its sides. George Lucas has stated in interviews that this sequence inspired the 'trench run' sequence in ''Star Wars''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* The march on the Jedi Temple sequence in ''Revenge of the Sith'' potentially derives from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s "[[Potemkin Stairs]]" montage in ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|title=Movies Star Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge of the Sith|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html|accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508031043/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html |archivedate = May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the execution of Order 66, the slaughter of the Jedi and the declaration of the Galactic Empire are reminiscent of the montage of massacres during the christening scene of ''[[The Godfather]]'', a film directed by his friend and mentor [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. They are similar in the christening of one (the baby and the Empire) with the death of a group of others (the other dons and the Separatists).&lt;ref name="Christian"/&gt;
* The [[Maschinenmensch]] – the robot in [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' – inspired the look of C-3PO, although the Maschinenmensch is a [[gynoid]] whereas C-3PO has masculine programming.
* [[Ray Harryhausen]] used [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] to create a mechanical owl, Bubo, in ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981). Despite Bubo's similarities (Bubo is metallic and expresses by whistling and rotating its head) to the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]] [[R2-D2]] of the 1977 film ''Star Wars'', Harryhausen claimed Bubo was created before ''Star Wars'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Tony Dalton]], ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life'', page 270 (London: [[Aurum Press]] Ltd, 2003) {{ISBN|1-85410-940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Lucas]] claims he became a fan of ''Star Trek'' when [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]] broadcast in the late 1960s which played an influence on the development of ''Star Wars''.{{clarify|date=December 2015}} He claimed he also visited ''Star Trek'' conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trek Nation]] (2010 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lucas used the term ''[[the Force]] '' to "echo" its use by cinematographer [[Roman Kroitor]] in ''[[21-87]]'' (1963), in which Kroitor says, "Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God".&lt;ref name="mythologyofsw"&gt;''[[The Mythology of Star Wars]]'' (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that "similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/05/lucas-2/|title=Life After Darth|last=Silberman|first=Steve|date=May 1, 2005|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:The marriage of King Arthur by Lancelot Speed.jpg|thumb|The legendary [[King Arthur]] (illustrated in the center) has a significant parallel to Luke Skywalker as a young orphaned hero embarking on a journey to restore peace and justice to his society. Arthur's use of his sword [[Excalibur]] as a tool of achieving objectives is reflected by Luke's use of his [[lightsaber]] in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/studying-skywalkers-excalibur-and-the-lightsaber|title=Studying Skywalkers: Excalibur and the Lightsaber - StarWars.com|date=3 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;!--In a biography written shortly after the original ''Star Wars'' was released, George Lucas acknowledged the influence of [[science fiction]] literature and particularly the works of [[E. E. Smith|Edward Elmer "E. E. Doc" Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;citation required&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
* [[Joseph Campbell]]'s [[comparative mythology]] book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', directly influenced Lucas, and is what drove him to create the "modern myth" of ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/07/the_heros_journey_the_idea_you_never_knew_had_shaped_star_wars/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |title=The Hero’s Journey: The idea you never knew had shaped ''Star Wars'' |first=John |last=Higgs |date=November 7, 2015 |accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/mythic-discovery-within-the-inner-reaches-of-outer-space-joseph-campbell-meets-george-lucas-part-i |publisher=StarWars.com |title=MYTHIC DISCOVERY WITHIN THE INNER REACHES OF OUTER SPACE: JOSEPH CAMPBELL MEETS GEORGE LUCAS – PART I |first=Lucas O. |last=Seastrom |date=October 22, 2015 |accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[E.E. Smith|E.E. 'Doc' Smith]]'s writings contain elements central to the ''Star Wars'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wookie books: the science fiction that inspired George Lucas's Star Wars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/04/sci-fi-books-inspired-star-wars-legend-george-lucas-force-awakens|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements include:
** Spherical, moon-size spaceships. 
** Smaller, spherical, jet-less fighters with accumulators for beamed power.
** [[Spacehounds of IPC]] includes light swords of slicing "blade of flame" and "planes of force" wielded by spherical ships, also attested in melee combat. 
** Smith's [[Lensman series|Lensmen]] have the telepathic powers of the Jedi derived from crystalline lenses mirroring [[Kyber crystals]] in ''Star Wars''.
** In ''[[Triplanetary (novel)|Triplanetary]]'', a "tractor beam" from an artificial planetoid captures another vessel and a damsel in distress adventure ensues.
** Space armor with a general focus on melee combat using space axes.
** Norlaminian worship of "the All-Controlling Force" along with general use of "force" powers throughout.
** A ''Golden Meteor'' is the emblem and insignia of the galactic protectors.
** A galactic trade in drugs which are used as currency: Thionite in Smith, Spice in ''Star Wars''.
** A galactic corps of heroes with telepathic powers. (Note: ''Lensman'' was written 10 years before [[Green Lantern]])
** Benevolent guardians seeking to fight evil.  (Called ''Arisians'' in ''Lensman''; ''Aquillian'' in the second draft script for ''Star Wars''.)
** A dark, unseen enemy seeking galactic domination.  (Called ''Boskone'' in ''Lensman''; ''Bogan'' in the second draft script for ''Star Wars''.)
** Special powers running down through family lines, with twins playing a significant role.
** Epic space battles involving fleets of ships.
** Large-scale weapons including a free-roaming planet-sized fortress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=E.E.|title=Gray Lensman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''sunbeam''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=E.E.|title=Second Stage Lensman}}&lt;/ref&gt; (capable of focusing the sun's rays, similar to Starkiller Base in ''[[The Force Awakens]]'').
** Jettisoning a space lifeboat with a data spool containing secrets of the enemy's ultimate weapon, the 'Grand Base'.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/doc.html|website=Star Wars Origins|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Training with a helmet with a blast shield, yet able to 'see' due to special powers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
** Passing a ship off as a chunk of loose metal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
** Numerous uses of the word ''coruscant'', a term which had declined in use after the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=7&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;content=coruscant&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Ccoruscant%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcoruscant%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCoruscant%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCORUSCANT%3B%2Cc0|website=Google Books Ngram Viewer|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[science fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]] stated on several occasions that George Lucas's galaxy-wide [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] bore a close resemblance to the galaxy depicted in Asimov's [[Foundation Series]]. The greatest differences are that Asimov's Galaxy contains almost no robots and no non-human aliens. Asimov addressed both issues directly in the saga's later volumes, most notably ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. Since Asimov's death in 1992, the ''Star Wars'' cinematic universe has gained new Asimov-esque elements: ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' introduced the planet [[Coruscant]], which bears a close resemblance to Asimov's [[Trantor]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* The section of ''A New Hope'' in which the heroes are trapped in the belly of the Death Star and must make a daring escape has similarities to ''[[Fellowship of The Ring]]''. The group is unwillingly drawn down an alternative path when they discover the traditional safe route is destroyed by the enemy. The group is attacked by a tentacled monster and pursued by a resident army (Orcs in Tolkien's novel, Stormtroopers in the film). Looking for an exit, the group only manages to escape after the old wizard sacrifices his life to an evil monster (the Balrog in Fellowship, and Darth Vader in ''Star Wars'') to buy the rest time to escape. With his last words he yells at his friends to "fly" ("Run" in modern English) instead of trying to rescue him. There are other similarities between [[The Lord of the Rings]] and the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, including the second entry of each franchise, [[The Two Towers]] and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' portraying the military advancement of the antagonists. ''[[Return of the King]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' share a similar title, and also similar finale in which the heroes are assisted to victory by an Army they initially did not know existed (The Ewok Army in ''Jedi'', The Army of the Dead in ''King''). The real climactic battle is occurring elsewhere with Luke confronting the Emperor in the Death Star throne room, and in King, Frodo is inside Mount Doom fighting Gollum for the ring.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* ''Star Wars'' borrows significantly from [[Arthurian mythology]]; especially with respect to plot and main character development. The life and character development of [[Luke Skywalker]] resembles that of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. Both are orphans who later become heroes in their early adulthood. Both also have mentors who are much older and provide them guidance and/or training. Arthur was mentored by [[Merlin]]; whereas Luke was mentored and trained by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] prior to continuing his training and mentor-ship with [[Yoda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/4407.html|title=FREE Luke Skywalker vs. King Arthur Essay|work=exampleessays.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/vi/knight_1192/SW/SW_theories/SWAL.html|title=Star Wars/Arthurian Legend Comparison Tale|work=angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LupackLupack2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Lupack|author2=Barbara Tepa Lupack|title=King Arthur in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-k6mg3zM24QC&amp;pg=PA324|year=2001|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85991-630-1|pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[Anakin Skywalker]] as the father of the hero, Luke Skywalker, mirrors that of [[Uther Pendragon]] who is King Arthur's father.

* ''Star Wars'' shares many similarities with [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/frank-herberts-epic-dune-series/|title=Frank Herbert's Epic Dune Series|work=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[desert planet]] setting with a moisture-based economy, spice smugglers, obese interstellar antagonists, and a mystical [[mind control]]-using sect with great influence over galactic politics — Herbert himself once enumerated 37 similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07853-dune-david-lynch-bfi-season|title=The Quietus - Opinion - In Defence Of... - Wild Sting: In Defence Of Dune|work=The Quietus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence was even more distinct in early ''Star Wars'' versions, with Princess Leia guarding a shipment of "aura spice" instead of the Death Star plans. The script for ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'' was circulating in Hollywood at the time of Lucas' early work on ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/dune.html|title=Star Wars Origins - Frank Herbert's Dune|work=moongadget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/05/20/how-dune-almost-prevented-star-wars-from-ever-being/|title=How ‘Dune’ almost prevented ‘Star Wars’ from ever being|first=Chris|last=Kensler|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/q-a-jodorowskys-dune-explores-690348|title=Q&amp;A: 'Jodorowsky's Dune' Explores the Unmade Space Epic That Paved the Way for 'Star Wars'|first=Chris|last=O'Falt|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There has been a long debate among fans about the influence that [[comic book]] writer [[Jack Kirby]] had on the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/dynamics/2010/12/18/kirby-lucas-and-campbell/|title=Kirby, Lucas, and Campbell|work=Kirby Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby's time at [[DC Comics]] between [[Jack Kirby#DC Comics and the Fourth World saga|1971 and 1975]] was defined by his creation of the [[New Gods]] saga. This [[Intergalactic space|intergalactic]] story involved the New God, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] of the planet [[New Genesis]], being prophesied by the [[Source (comics)|Source]] as the warrior to defeat [[Darkseid]] - the tyrannical ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], and, by doing so, bring peace to the universe and end the conflict between the two planets. Unknown to Orion was that he was the son of the evil Darkseid. Parallels can thus be drawn between the nature of the relationships between Orion and Darkseid to Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, as well as between the mythical Source and [[the Force]] . According to some accounts, Lucas met comic book writer and editor [[Roy Thomas]] at a dinner in 1972, during which Lucas described the plot of ''Star Wars'', to which Thomas noticed the similarity between this and Kirby's New Gods, which was then already a published series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ro|first=Ronin|title=Tales To Astonish : Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=1-58234-345-4|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many Chinese fans{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} of the franchise believe the characters and plot of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy to be directly analogous to [[Jin Yong]]'s [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]''. Supporting this theory, the mythical concept of the Force bears striking resemblance to the concepts of internal energy and qi, which form a primary element in traditional wuxia literature. Other arguments may include the clothing style in the Star Wars movies being similar to that in early adaptations of Jin Yong's novels, as well as the similarity in the main leads' motivation and relationship.
* Lucas mentioned that he read the American translation of ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'', a [[German science-fiction]] [[pulp novel]] series in the late 1960s and early 1970s and considers the series to be an "inspiration, less strong than Flash Gordon, but it influenced the design of many starships of ''Star Wars''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKLlUnyG4IQC&amp;pg=PA342 |title=Der deutsche Zukunftsroman 1918-1945: Gattungstypologie und ... - Dina Brandt - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/aus-aller-welt/science-fiction-serie-aus-rastatt-soll-verfilmt-werden-perry-rhodan-fordert-darth-vader-zum-duell-seite-2/2504942-2.html |title=Science-Fiction-Serie aus Rastatt soll verfilmt werden: Perry Rhodan fordert Darth Vader zum Duell - Seite 2 - Aus aller Welt - Panorama |language=de |publisher=Handelsblatt |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
* ''Star Wars'' is widely considered to resemble [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' in themes, plot elements, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trell.org/wagner/starwars.html|title=Star Wars and Wagner's Ring|date=12 February 2004|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212113647/http://www.trell.org/wagner/starwars.html|archivedate=12 February 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samurai9555226484.jpg|thumb|199px|The [[Samurai]], [[nobility]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] [[caste]] of [[History of Japan#Medieval Japan (1185–1573/1600)|medieval]] and [[Edo period|early-modern]] [[Japan]], are a strong influence on the concept of the Jedi as sword fighting martial artist warriors who served as guardians of society.]]

====Modern and early modern history====
The [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] from the movies share a name with the [[Germany|German]] [[stormtrooper]]s. Imperial officers' uniforms also resemble some historical German Army uniforms (see [[Wehrmacht]]) and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad SS down to the imitation silver death's head insignia on their officer's caps (although the uniforms technically had more basis with the German [[Uhlans]] within the Prussian Empire&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starwars.com/news/from-world-war-to-star-wars-stormtroopers&lt;br /&gt;"The exact cut of the uniforms was certainly familiar, but didn’t rely precisely on the dress of the Second World War. The overall color palette and feel for the Empire was intended to be fascist, but earlier Prussian military uniforms inspired the actual cut of the uniforms designed by John Mollo.  The tunic and pants worn by Imperial officers were based on the uniform of German Uhlans, a division of mounted lancers that predated Nazi Germany. This style of uniform was used through the end of World War I, but was not a hallmark of the Third Reich."&lt;/ref&gt;). World War II terms were used for names in ''Star Wars''; examples include the planets Kessel (a group of [[Kessel (cauldron)|encircled forces]]), Hoth ([[Hermann Hoth]] was a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front), and Tatooine ([[Tataouine]] - a province south of Tunis in Tunisia, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet; Libya was a WWII arena of war).&lt;ref name="christopherklein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-real-history-that-inspired-star-wars|title=The Real History That Inspired "Star Wars"|first=Christopher|last=Klein|work=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palpatine being Chancellor before becoming Emperor mirrors [[Adolf Hitler]]'s role as Chancellor before appointing himself Dictator. The [[Great Jedi Purge]] alludes to the events of [[The Holocaust]], the [[Great Purge]], the [[Cultural Revolution]], and the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. In addition, Lucas himself has drawn parallels between Palpatine and his rise to power to historical dictators such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and Adolf Hitler. The final medal awarding scene in ''A New Hope'', however, references Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Star Wars: Attack of the Clones |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020429/story2.html |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |date=2002-04-21 |accessdate=2009-12-13|quote=The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea ... That's the issue I've been exploring: how did the Republic turn into the Empire?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020605161308/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020429/story2.html|archivedate=2002-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2016}}  The space battles in ''A New Hope'' were based on filmed [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] [[dog fight|dogfights]].&lt;ref name="Dreams"/&gt;

Continuing the use of Nazi inspiration for the Empire, [[J. J. Abrams]], the director of ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', has said that the First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]], is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to [[Argentina]] after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about what would have happened if they had started working together again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=45203|title=JJ Abrams Spills Details On Kylo Ren|first=James|last=Dyer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas was asked the origins of the name "Darth Vader", and replied: "Darth is a variation of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's basically Dark Father." (Rolling Stone, June 2, 2005). ''Vader'' is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "father" (the Dutch word is instead pronounced "fah-der"), and the [[German language|German]] word for "father" (''Vater'') is similar. However, in the earliest scripts for ''Star Wars'', the name "Darth Vader" was given to a human Imperial general with no apparent relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/george-lucas-and-the-cult-of-darth-vader-20050602|title=George Lucas and the Cult of Darth Vader|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have noted the strong political analogies in the ''Star Wars'' universe to contemporary American politics. Major analogies include Lucas's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] being seen in the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=O'Connor | first1=Michael | title=What are the Politics of 'Star Wars'? | url=http://www.newsweek.com/does-star-wars-endorse-political-republican-democrat-498365 | date=September 14, 2016 | publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas even said in 2005 that ''Star Wars'' "was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where [[Richard Nixon]] was trying to run for a [second] term, which got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships. Because the democracies aren't overthrown; they're given away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-18/features/0505180309_1_star-wars-sith-palpatine | title='Star Wars' inadvertently hits too close to U.S.'s role | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | first=Mark | last=Caro | date=May 18, 2005 | accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was likewise backed up by the 1973 draft for the first movie, then-called ''The Star Wars'', where Lucas specifically mentioned that the theme involved an independent planet named Aquillae that was compared to North Vietnam, and that the Empire was "America 10 years from now",&lt;ref&gt;Rinzler, J.W., ''The Making of Star Wars'', page 7-8, 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chris. ''How Star Wars Conquered the Universe''. p. 87-88, 109-110, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Walter Murch]], who claimed Lucas, after his failure with ''Apocalypse Now'', decided to do ''Star Wars'' as a way to channel the anti-war and pro-Vietcong ideology in a disguised form.&lt;ref&gt;The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film. Ondaatje, Michael; Knopf (2005). p.70.&lt;br /&gt;"Originally George Lucas was going to direct ('Apocalypse Now'), so it was a project that George and John [Milius] developed for [American] Zoetrope. That was back in 1969. Then when Warner Brothers cancelled the funding for Zoetrope, the project was abandoned for a while. After the success of 'American Graffiti' in 1973, George wanted to revive it, but it was still too hot a topic, the [Vietnam] war was still on, and nobody wanted to finance something like that. So George considered his options: What did he really want to say in 'Apocalypse Now?' The message boiled down to the ability of a small group of people to defeat a gigantic power simply by the force of their convictions. And he decided, All right, if it's politically too hot as a contemporary subject, I'll put the essence of the story in outer space and make it happen in a galaxy long ago and far away. The rebel group were the North Vietnamese, and the Empire was the United States. And if you have 'the force,' no matter how small you are, you can defeat the overwhelmingly big power. 'Star Wars' is George's transubstantiated version of 'Apocalypse Now.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Ian McDiarmid, when recalling something Lucas told him during filming of ''Return of the Jedi'', also implied that the Oval Office, and in particular, Nixon's presidency, played a role in the design of the Emperor's throne room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/nov/07/theatre1|title=Lindesay Irvine talks to Ian McDiarmid|first=Lindesay|last=Irvine|date=7 November 2005|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political themes in ''[[Rogue One]]'' have also been noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Somin | first1=Ilya | title=Rogue One and the Politics of Star Wars | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/29/rogue-one-and-the-politics-of-star-wars/ | date=December 29, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Doescher | first1=Ian | title=The Empire Is Us: The Politics of ‘Rogue One’ | url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/politics-of-rogue-one-214549 | date=December 26, 2016 | publisher=''[[Politico Magazine]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Khachatrian | first1=Harry | title=REVIEW: 'Rogue One' Is Far More Conservative Than Liberal | url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/11725/review-star-wars-rogue-one-harry-khachatrian# | date=December 19, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Daily Wire]]'' | accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient and medieval history====
[[File:User-Deevad.png|thumb|330px|A depiction of a science fictional civilization living a [[medieval]] Earth-like existence; a concept that ''Star Wars'' is a major example of.&lt;ref name="Classen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Classen|title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – Methods – Trends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez_edSWAQGAC&amp;pg=PA862|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-021558-8|page=862}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* Ancient and medieval history play amongst the strongest and significant influences on ''Star Wars'' which reflects ancient Earth history in its settings, including [[Architecture of Star Wars|architectural]], social and hierarchical structures (i.e. the existence of monarchies and empires) as well as story lines which reflect ancient and medieval history. The transformation of the [[Old Republic (Star Wars)|Old Republic]] into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] parallels that of the [[Roman Republic]] which transformed into the [[Roman Empire]] in the same manner of conspiracy and manipulation. Lucas was quoted as saying: "I love history, so while the psychological basis of ''Star Wars'' is mythological, the political and social bases are historical".&lt;ref name="christopherklein"/&gt;
* Author Nick Jamilla explains that unlike mainstream futuristic stories, with ''Star Wars'', George Lucas ties in science fiction with ancient history, comparing the Jedi to the [[Samurai]] and historical European swordsmanship. He also parallels the spiritual aspects of the Jedi to eastern [[monks]] and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jamilla2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jamilla|title=Sword Fighting in the Star Wars Universe: Historical Origins, Style and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g23D4YMmdb0C|date=25 June 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5179-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamilla2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jamilla|title=Shimmering Sword: Samurai, Western, and Star Wars Sword Fighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmNBAAAACAAJ|year=2002|publisher=NBK Pub.|isbn=978-0-9718796-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Star Wars'' reflects ancient history in its planetary settings. For example, the planet [[Coruscant]] imitates [[Ancient Rome]] as the capital of the Old Republic and later the Galactic Empire; whereas [[Tatooine]] imitates the ancient [[Middle East]] (specifically the [[Arabian Peninsula]]) and [[North Africa]] in ancient times as being barren desert and sparsely populated (which it still is today to a certain degree).&lt;ref&gt;The Mythology of Star Wars (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Coruscant and [[Naboo]] are also two of many planets in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy exhibit architecture inspired by those of ancient Greece, Rome and other ancient southern/southeastern European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1997 special edition, 2004 DVD edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his book ''The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy'', author Tom Henthorne argues that 1970s science fiction movies such as the ''Star Wars'' films and ''[[E.T.]]'' bring back neo-medieval themes at young boys with a masculine tone in his view. He argues the knighthood-type plots give a sense of encouragement to young boys and give girls the image of being their prizes or captives waiting to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;Henthorne, Tom. ''Boys to Men: Medievalism and Masculinity in Star Wars and ET: The Extra-Terrestrial''. The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy (2004): 73-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Samurai]] warriors of [[Japan]] are somewhat parallel to the concept of the Jedi as an elite warrior class specialized in combat and swordsmanship techniques charged with protecting their respective societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]] (2015 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department''' or '''Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology''' is the archaeology department of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. Founded in 1961, the department is headed by an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer with the designation Commissioner for Archaeology and conducts archaeological excavations in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]].

== Headquarters ==

The department initially functioned from a rented house in [[Besant Nagar]], Chennai. In 2003, it moved to its present premises - a newly constructed building named "Tamil Valarchi Valagam" in Halls Road, [[Egmore]].

== Library ==

The department has a library at its headquarters in Chennai with over 11,500 volumes on [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[art]], [[history]], [[epigraphy]] and [[palaeography]]. It houses copies of important journals such as ''[[Indian Antiquary]]'', ''Asiatic Researches'', ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'', ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics'' and ''Journal of Tamil Studies''.

== Publications ==

The department publishes a quarterly journal called ''Kalvettu''. Like the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI), it also publishes excavation reports and guide books for tourists, as well as district-wise lists of inscriptions and museum guides.

== Epigraphy ==

An epigraphy wing was inaugurated in 1966. Since its inception, the epigraphy wing has prepared [[estampage]]s of about 14,000 inscriptions which are preserved at a facility in [[Udagamandalam]]. The department started an institute for epigraphy in 1973-74. The institute conducts one year post graduate diploma courses in epigraphy and archaeology for Tamil, Sanskrit or history graduates of the [[University of Madras]].

== List of Directors ==

* [[T. N. Ramachandran]] (1964–66)
* [[R. Nagaswamy]] (1966–88)
* [[Natana Kasinathan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2013/jun/26/Tamils-knew-language-in-10000-BC-itself-490604.html|title='Tamils knew language in 10,000 BC itself'|newspaper=The New Indian Express|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[T. Udhayachandran ]] (Tamil: த. உதயச்சந்திரன்) Commissioner of Archaeology, Government of TamilNadu.

'''''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended''''' is an approximately 87,000-word composition written by Sir [[Isaac Newton]], first published posthumously in 1728 in limited supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last= Newton |title=The chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended : To Which is Prefix'd, A Short Chronicle From the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great  |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-37430|year=1728|publisher= Printed for J. Tonson ; J. Osborn ; T. Longman |place=London |edition=1 |volume=|access-date= June 17, 2016| via=e-rara.ch (ETH-Bibliothek Zürich)|doi= 10.3931/e-rara-37430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it had been republished in mass paperback format.  The work represents one of Newton's forays into the topic of [[chronology]], detailing the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms throughout antiquity.

The treatise is composed of eight primary sections.  First is an introductory letter to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] by Newton's estate manager [[John Conduitt]], followed by a short advertisement.  After this is found a section entitled "''A Short Chronicle''" which serves as a brief historical list of events listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest listed date of 1125 BC and the most recent listed at 331 BC.  The majority of the treatise, however, is in the form of six chapters that explore the history of specific civilizations.  These chapters are titled:

*Chap. I. Of the Chronology of the First Ages of the Greeks.
*Chap. II. Of the Empire of Egypt.
*Chap. III. Of the Assyrian Empire.
*Chap. IV. Of the two Contemporary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes.
*Chap. V. A Description of the Temple of Solomon.
*Chap. VI. Of the Empire of the Persians.

According to John Conduitt's introductory letter, ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' was Isaac Newton's last personally revised work before his death but had actually been written much earlier.  Some of its subject material and contents have led many people to categorize this work as one of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].

==Summary==

The book attempts to revise the accepted ancient chronology of Newton's day, in order to prove that [[Solomon]] was the earliest king in the world, and that his Temple the first ever built, with all others being copies, beginning with [[Sesostris]], King of Egypt, followed by others. Newton's results, therefore, diverge widely from presently accepted dates, often more widely than the system that he attempted to displace.

Newton attempted to [[Euhemerism|identify various mythological figures as historical]] or Biblical individuals, such as arguing that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was [[Noah]], the [[Sky deity|god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was [[Shem]], and [[Osiris]] and [[Dionysus]] were [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref name="Ernest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/Newton.pdf |title=Review of Newton and the Origin of Civilization, by Jed Z.

'''''The [[Hyksos]]: A New Investigation''''' is a book by [[John Van Seters]] published in 1966 by [[Yale University Press]]. 

The main contribution of this volume is a careful [[linguistics|linguistic]] analysis by Van Seters in which he argues that the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]] does not belong to the [[First Intermediate Period]] of Egyptian History (c. 2300-2200 BCE), as previously thought, but rather to the [[Second Intermediate Period]] (c. 1700-1600 BCE). Van Seters' case has not been universally accepted by Egyptologists, who continue to suggest a range of dates for the composition of Ipuwer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7164">The '''theory of historical trajectory''' is part of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[historical materialism]].&lt;ref name="Turner2006"/&gt; This theory has been analyzed by [[Erik Olin Wright]], whose work has been cited in relation to it.&lt;ref name="ElliottCollective1998"/&gt;

According to Wright, while Marx's theory of [[social change]] is often regarded as obsolete, it is nonetheless an important and likely still the "most ambitious attempt to construct a scientific theory of alternatives to capitalism".&lt;ref name="Wright2010-89"/&gt; What Marx attempted was to develop a [[deterministic]] theory of "long term impossibility of capitalism".&lt;ref name="Wright2010-89"/&gt; According to Marx, the very same problems that should make capitalism fail should also provide the means for the new, more democratic and egalitarian society to arise.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90"/&gt;

==Theory==
Wright identifies five core arguments in Marx's thought.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90"/&gt;

The first of these is that capitalism is an unsustainable economic system in the long run.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90-92"/&gt; Here, Marx claims that capitalism's replacement by another economic system is an inevitability, as through time it creates conditions in which it can no longer function.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90-92"/&gt; This part of Marx's argument does not predict what type of system will replace capitalism, it simply stresses the capitalist self-destructive nature.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90-92"/&gt; This prediction is based on four trends Marx observed:
* productivity is steadily increased;
* the reach of capitalism increases both in the geographical sense and in the penetration of the society ([[commodification]]);
* [[Capital (economics)|capital]] tends to be increasingly concentrated;
* periodic economic crises ([[recession]]s) tend to be increasingly more severe.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90-92"/&gt;
A related, more theoretical argument that Marx made here was based on the [[labor theory of value]] (only labor produces value).&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90-92"/&gt; Marx believed that as non-labor (and by extension of the labor theory, non-profitable) factors become increasingly important, profits will decline, eventually approaching zero.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-90-92"/&gt; This is commonly referred to as the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]].

Second, Marx predicted the increase in the [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="Wright2010-93-94"/&gt; Here, Marx argued that over time, the [[working class]] will grow in numbers ([[proletarianization]]), and it will also become more aware of the inefficiencies of the capitalist system ([[class consciousness]]).&lt;ref name="Wright2010-93-94"/&gt;

Third, according to Marx, when the working class and its allies would become sufficiently numerous and organized, they would challenge and overthrow the system in a [[revolution]] ([[world revolution]]).&lt;ref name="Wright2010-95-97"/&gt; Marx assumed here that the resistance of the [[capitalism|capitalist class]] would continue to the end, preventing any non-violent, democratic transformation, and thus that the transition into a post-capitalism era would require the use of violence to overcome such resistance.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-95-97"/&gt;

Next, Marx argued that a post-capitalist system would most likely be one where [[means of production]] are collectively owned and democratically controlled ([[socialism]]).&lt;ref name="Wright2010-97-98"/&gt; This likelihood was the result of the fact that the overthrow of capitalism was to be carried out primarily by the working class, and thus after the revolution, it would be the class to hold power and thus most influential and shaping the new world order.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-97-98"/&gt;

Finally, Marx proposed the "[[communism]] destination thesis": that socialism will eventually lead to the development of a [[classless society]], without the need for a [[Sovereign state|state]] ([[stateless communism]]), and operating according to the principle, "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref name="Wright2010-99-100"/&gt;

==Praise and criticism==
Wright describes the theory framed by Marx as "brilliant, if ultimately unsatisfactory."&lt;ref name="Wright2010-89"/&gt; Wright outlined four major deficiencies he believed to have existed in the theory:
* periodic crises (recessions) have not, so far, exhibited any clear trend of becoming increasingly severe;
* class structures, rather than producing a homogenous working class, have become increasingly complex;
* the working class did not become increasingly organized and powerful; and,
* capitalism, even when overthrown, was not replaced by democratic socialist societies and certainly not by communism.&lt;ref name="Wright2010-99-100"/&gt;

'''''Unequal crossing over''''' is a type of gene duplication or deletion event that deletes a sequence in one strand and replaces it with a duplication from its sister [[chromatid]] in [[mitosis]] or from its homologous chromosome during [[meiosis]].  It is a type of [[chromosomal crossover]] between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes.  Along with [[gene conversion]], it is believed to be the main  driver for the generation of [[gene duplication]]s and is a source of mutation in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution |edition=Second |last1=Graur |first1=Dan |last2=Li |first2=Wen-Hsiung |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0878932666 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Molecular_Evolution.html?id=Bf5-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
During [[meiosis]], the duplicated chromosomes ([[chromatids]]) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the [[centromere]] region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other.  During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur.  The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence.

When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other.  The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication.  This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics |last=Russel |first=Peter J. |date=2002 |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for the organism==
Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences.  With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes.  Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="szostak1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=J. W. |last2=Wu |first2=R. |title=Unequal crossing over in the ribosomal DNA of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''| doi = 10.1038/284426a0 |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=426–430 |date=1980 |issue=5755|bibcode=1980Natur.284..426S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal crossover can be followed by the [[concerted evolution]] of  duplicated sequences.

It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta-globin genes.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=E. A. |last2=Martin |first2=S. M. |last3=Beverley |first3=S. M. |last4=Kan |first4=Y. W. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. C. |title=Rapid duplication and loss of genes coding for the alpha chains of hemoglobin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=77 |pages=2158–2162 |date=1980 | pmc=348671 | doi =10.1073/pnas.77.4.2158 |pmid=6929543|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.2158Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution.

When unequal crossing over creates a [[gene duplication]], the duplicate has 4 [[evolution]]ary fates. This is due to the fact that [[purifying selection]] acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong.  Now that there is a redundant copy, [[neutral mutation]]s can act on the duplicate.  Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a [[pseudogene]].  If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy.  [[Neofunctionalization]] is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor.  If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a [[subfunctionalization|subfunctional event]] occurs.  This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy&lt;ref name=force1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Force |first1=Allan |last2=Lynch |first2=Michael |last3=Pickettb |first3=F.

===Genome size===
Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome.

====Junk DNA====
When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome.  For example, over 50% of the ''Dipodmys ordii'' genome is made up of three specific repeats. ''Drosophila virilis'' has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the ''Absidia glauca'' is repetitive DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.&lt;ref name="zhang2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=J. |title=Evolution of the human ASPM gene, a major determinant of brain size |journal=Genetics |volume=165 |pages=2063–2070 |date=2003 | pmid = 14704186 |issue=4 |pmc=1462882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a professor [[emeritus]] of classics at [[California State University, Fresno]], and is currently the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow in classics and military history at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]]. He chairs the Hoover working group on Military History and Contemporary Conflict as well as being the general editor of the Hoover online journal, ''Strategika''. He has been a visiting professor at [[Hillsdale College]] where he teaches an intensive course on world, ancient or military history in the autumn semester, as the Wayne and Marcia Buske Distinguished Fellow in History since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://victordavishanson.pajamasmedia.com/2006/08/29/back_to_the_future.php "Works and Days: Back to the Future?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107094931/http://victordavishanson.pajamasmedia.com/2006/08/29/back_to_the_future.php |date=November 7, 2006 }} by Victor Davis Hanson, PajamasMedia.org, August 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson is the author of ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power'' (2001), a ''New York Times'' best-selling book.

Hanson was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2007 by President [[George W. Bush]], and was a presidential appointee in 2007–2008 on the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] that oversees the cemeteries and monuments of U.S. war dead abroad. Hanson is a student of current affairs, particularly regarding the U.S. in the Middle East, national defense issues and illegal immigration. He is also a fifth-generation landowner, growing raisin plants on a family farm in [[Selma, California]], where he resides, and is a commentator on social trends related to farming and [[agrarianism]].

==Early life, education and today==
Hanson, who is of [[Swedish American|Swedish]] and [[Welsh American|Welsh]] descent, grew up on a family farm outside of [[Selma, California]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and has worked there most of his life.  His mother, Pauline Davis Hanson, was a lawyer and a California superior court and state appeals court justice, his father was a farmer, educator and junior college administrator. Along with his older brother Nels, a writer, and fraternal twin Alfred, a farmer and biologist, Hanson attended public schools and graduated from [[Selma High School (Selma, California)|Selma High School]]. Hanson received his BA with highest honors in classics and general college honors, Cowell College, from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1975&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorhanson.com/Author/index.html "VDH Private Papers"] Hanson is married to Jennifer Heyne (married  November 2013).{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125054349/http://www.victorhanson.com/Author/index.html |date=January 25, 2013 }} Victor Davis Hanson website, accessed August 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and his PhD in [[classics]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1980. He is a [[Protestant]] Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/12_2_do_we_want.html "Do We Want Mexifornia?"], Victor Davis Hanson, ''[[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]]'', Spring 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the Raphael Demos scholarship at the College Year in Athens (1973–74) and was a regular member of the [[American School of Classical Studies, Athens]], 1978–79.

Hanson is currently a Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]] and professor emeritus at [[California State University, Fresno]],&lt;ref name=fresno&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnostate.edu/artshum/mcll/faculty-staff/hanson.html|title=Classical Studies Program|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he began teaching in 1984, having created the [[classics|classical studies]] program at that institution.

In 1991, Hanson was awarded an [[American Philological Association]]'s Excellence in Teaching Award, which is given annually to the nation's top undergraduate teachers of Greek and Latin, and he was named distinguished alumnus of the year (2006) at University of California, Santa Cruz.&lt;ref name=fresno /&gt; He has been a visiting professor of classics at Stanford University (1991–92), a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences]], Stanford, California (1992–93), an [[Alexander Onassis]] traveling fellowship to [[Greece]] (1999), as well as Nimitz Fellow at UC Berkeley (2006) and held the visiting Shifrin Chair of Military History at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]], [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (2002–03), and often the William Simon visiting professorship at the [[School of Public Policy at Pepperdine University]] (2009–15), and was awarded in 2015 an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the graduate school at [[Pepperdine]].  He gave the Wriston Lecture in 2004 for the [[Manhattan Institute]].  He has been a board member of the [[Bradley Foundation]] since 2015, and served on the [[HF Guggenheim Foundation]] board for over a decade.

Since 2004, Hanson has written a weekly column [[Print syndication|syndicated]] by [[Tribune Content Agency]],&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;{{cite web |title=Victor Davis Hanson articles |url=https://tribunecontentagency.com/premium-content/opinion/international/victor-davis-hanson/ |website=Tribune Content Agency |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a weekly column for National Review Online since 2001, and has not missed a weekly column for either venue since he began.  He has been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', and ''[[The New Criterion]]'', among other publications. He was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]] (2007) by President [[George W. Bush]], as well as the [[Eric Breindel Prize for opinion journalism]] (2002), and the William F. Buckley Prize (2015).  Hanson was also awarded the Claremont Institute's Statesmanship Award at its annual Churchill Dinner, and the Bradley Prize from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in 2008.&lt;ref name=fresno /&gt;

==Writing==
Hanson's ''Warfare and Agriculture'' (Giardini 1983), his PhD thesis, argued that Greek warfare could not be understood apart from agrarian life in general, and suggested that the modern assumption that agriculture was irrevocably harmed during classical wars was vastly overestimated. ''The Western Way of War'' (Alfred Knopf 1989), for which [[John Keegan]] wrote the introduction, explored the combatants' experiences of ancient Greek battle and detailed the Hellenic foundations of later Western military practice.

''The Other Greeks'' (The Free Press 1995) argued that the emergence of a unique middling agrarian class explains the ascendance of the [[Greek city-state]], and its singular values of consensual government, sanctity of private property, civic militarism and individualism. In ''Fields Without Dreams'' (The Free Press 1996, winner of the Bay Area Book Reviewers Award) and ''The Land Was Everything'' (The Free Press 2000, a ''Los Angeles Times'' notable book of the year), Hanson lamented the decline of family farming and rural communities, and the loss of agrarian voices in American democracy. ''The Soul of Battle'' (The Free Press 1999) traced the careers of [[Epaminondas]], the Theban liberator, [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], and [[George S. Patton]], in arguing that democratic warfare's strengths are best illustrated in short, intense and spirited marches to promote consensual rule, but bog down otherwise during long occupations or more conventional static battle.

In ''Mexifornia'' (Encounter 2003)—a personal memoir about growing up in rural California and an account of immigration from Mexico—Hanson that predicted illegal immigration would soon reach crisis proportions, unless legal, measured, and diverse immigration was restored, as well as the traditional melting-pot values of integration, assimilation, and intermarriage.

''Ripples of Battle'' (Doubleday 2003) chronicled how the cauldron of battle affects combatants' later literary and artistic work, as its larger influence ripples for generations, affecting art, literature, culture, and government. In ''A War Like No Other'' (Random House 2005, a ''New York Times'' notable book of the year), a history of the [[Peloponnesian War]], Hanson offered an alternative history, arranged by methods of fighting—triremes, hoplites, cavalry, sieges, etc.) in concluding that the conflict marked a brutal watershed event for the Greek city-states. ''The Savior Generals'' (Bloomsbury 2013) followed the careers of five great generals, arguing that rare qualities in leadership emerge during hopeless predicaments that only rare individuals can salvage.

''The'' ''End of Sparta'' (Bloomsbury 2011) is a novel about a small community of [[Thespiae|Thespian]] farmers who join the great march of [[Epaminondas]] (369/70 BC) into the heart of the [[Peloponnese]] to destroy [[Spartan]] hegemony, free the Messenian [[helots]], and spread democracy in the Peloponnese.

In addition, Hanson has edited several collected essays (''Hoplites'', Routledge 1991), ''Bonfire of the Humanities'' (with B. Thornton and J. Heath, ISI 2001), and ''Makers of Ancient Strategy'' (Princeton 2010), as well as a number of his own collected articles (''An Autumn of War'' [2002 Anchor], ''Between War and Peace'' [Anchor 2004], and ''The Father of Us All'' [Bloomsbury 2010]). He has written a number of chapters for scholarly works such as the ''Cambridge History of War'', and the ''Cambridge History of Ancient Warfare''.

===''Carnage and Culture''===
Hanson is the author of the 2001 book ''Carnage and Culture'' (Doubleday), published in Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries as ''Why the West Has Won'', in which he argued that the military dominance of [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Western culture|civilization]], beginning with the ancient Greeks, results from certain fundamental aspects of [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] culture, such as consensual government, a tradition of self-critique, secular rationalism, religious tolerance, individual freedom, free expression, free markets, and individualism. Hanson's emphasis on cultural exception rejects racial explanations for Western military preeminence and disagrees as well with environmental or geographical determinist explanations such as those put forth by [[Jared Diamond]] in ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/214502/decline-and-fall-victor-davis-hanson Decline And Fall: A review of ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''], by Victor Davis Hanson, ''National Review Magazine'', May 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanson, Western [[Value system|values]] such as [[political freedom]], [[capitalism]], [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Scientific method|scientific inquiry]], [[rationalism]], and [[dissent|open debate]] form an especially lethal combination when applied to warfare. Non-Western societies can win occasional victories when warring against a society with these Western values, writes Hanson, but the "Western way of war" will likely prevail in the long run. Hanson emphasizes that Western warfare is not necessarily more (or less) moral than war as practiced by other cultures; his argument is simply that the "Western way of war" is unequaled in its emphases on devastation and decisiveness, fueled by superior technology and logistics.

''Carnage and Culture'' examines nine battles throughout history, each of which is used to illustrate a particular aspect of Western culture that Hanson believes contributes to the dominance of Western warfare. The battles or campaigns recounted (with themes in parenthesis) are the [[Battle of Salamis]] (480 BC; free citizens), the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC; the decisive battle of annihilation), the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC; civic militarism), the [[Battle of Tours]]/[[Poitiers]] (732; infantry), the [[Battle of Tenochtitlan]] (1521; technology and reason), the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] (1571; capitalism), the [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]] (1879; discipline), the [[Battle of Midway]] (1942; individualism), and the [[Tet Offensive]] (1968; dissent).

Though ''Carnage and Culture'' appeared before the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, its message that the "Western way of war" will ultimately prevail made the book a bestseller in the wake of those events. Immediately after 9/11, ''Carnage and Culture'' was re-issued with a new afterword by Hanson in which he explicitly stated that the [[United States government]] would win its "[[War on Terror]]" for the reasons stated in the book.

The American military officer Robert Bateman in a 2007 article on the [[Media Matters for America]] website criticized the Hanson thesis, arguing if Hanson's point about Western armies preferring to seek out a decisive battle of annihilation is rebutted by the [[Second Punic War]], where the Roman attempts to annihilate the Carthaginians instead led to the Carthaginians annihilating the Romans at the Battle of Cannae.&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite web

In his final responses, Hanson argued that Bateman was unfamiliar with any foreign language, did not understand the practice of translation or scholarly citation, and was utterly confused by basic issues of geography and history.

===United States education and classical studies===
Hanson co-authored the book ''Who Killed [[Homer]]?: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom'' with John Heath. This book explores the issue of how [[Classics|classical education]] has declined in the US and what might be done to restore it to its former prominence. This is important, according to Hanson and Heath, because knowledge of the classical Greeks and Romans is necessary to fully understand Western culture. To begin a discussion along these lines the authors state, "The answer to why the world is becoming Westernized goes all the way back to the wisdom of the Greeks—reason enough why we must not abandon the study of our heritage".&lt;ref&gt;Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath, ''Who Killed Homer? The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom'' (San Francisco: Encounter Books, 2001), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson and Heath, in their populist argument for a return to undergraduate teaching, fault the academic classicists themselves for the decline, accusing them of becoming so infected with [[political correctness]] and [[postmodern]] thinking, not to mention egoism and money-grubbing (grants, visiting professorships, conference-hopping, promotion based on unreadable publications), that they have lost sight of what Hanson and Heath feel the classics truly represent. They say it this way, "the study of Greek in the last twenty years became a profession, a tiny world—but a world of sorts nonetheless—of jets, conferences, publicity, jargon, and perks."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath, ''Who Killed Homer? The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom'' (San Francisco: Encounter Books, 2001), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientist [[Francis Fukuyama]], reviewing ''Who Killed Homer?'' favorably in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', noted, {{Cquote|The great thinkers of the Western tradition—from [[Hobbes]], Burke, and [[Hegel]] to Weber and [[Nietzsche]] (who was trained as a classical philologist)—were so thoroughly steeped in Greek thought that they scarcely needed to refer back to original texts for quotations. This tradition has come under fire from two camps, one postmodernist that seeks to deconstruct the classics on the grounds of gender, race, and class, and the other pragmatic and career-minded that asks what value the classics have in a computer-driven society. The authors' defense of a traditionalist approach to the classics is worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Killed Homer? The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1998-07-01/who-killed-homer-demise-classical-education-and-recovery-greek|publisher=''Foreign Affairs''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The classicists Victoria Cech and [[Joy Connolly]] have found ''Who Killed Homer?'' to have considerable pitfalls. Reviews of the book have noted several problems with the authors' perception of classical culture.

Per Victoria Cech, Director of Grants &amp; Program Development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtha.org/whomha8.htm|title=MHA...An Association of Montana Health Care Providers|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904083557/http://www.mtha.org/whomha8.htm|archivedate=September 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{Cquote|One example is the relation of the individual to the state and the "freedom" of belief or of inquiry in each. Socrates and Jesus were put to death by their respective states for articulating inconvenient doctrines. In Sparta, where the population of citizens (male) were carefully socialized in a military system, no one seems to have differed from the majority enough to merit the death penalty. But these differences are not sorted out by the authors, for ''their mission is to build an ideal structure of classical attitudes by which to reveal our comparative flaws'', and their point is more what is wrong with us than what was right with Athens. I contend that Hanson and Heath are actually comparing modern academia not to the ancient seminal cultures but to the myth that arose about them over the last couple of millenia. &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Killed Homer?|url=http://mtprof.msun.edu/Win1999/Cech.html|publisher=The Montana Professor}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Per Joy Connolly, Professor of Classics at [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.as.nyu.edu/object/JoyConnolly.html|title=NYU &gt; Classics &gt; Joy Connolly|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{Cquote|Throughout history, the authors say, women have never enjoyed equal rights and responsibilities. At least in Greece, "the veiled, mutilated, and secluded were not the norm" (p. 57). Why waste time, then, as feminist scholarship does, "merely demarcating the exact nature of the sexism of the Greeks and the West" (p. 102)? From their point of view, in fact, the real legacy of feminism is the destruction of the values of family and community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath, Who Killed Homer?

==Political views==
Hanson is a traditional [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] who voted for [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,NI_Interview_0303,00.html Interview], ''[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]]'', March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been described as a [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] by some commentators, for his support of maintaining U.S. troops to rebuild society after successful military interventions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/22/nation/na-neocons22?pg=2 Bush pulls neocons out of the shadows] [[Los Angeles Times]], January 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7825039.stm The end of the neo-cons?] [[BBC News]], February 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated, "I came to support neocon approaches first in the wars against the Taliban and Saddam, largely because I saw little alternative."&lt;ref name="WAD200807"&gt;[http://victorhanson.com/articles/hanson071208.html The Neocon Slur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213081306/http://victorhanson.com/articles/hanson071208.html |date=February 13, 2012 }}, Victor Davis Hanson, July 12, 2008 (originally [http://pajamasmedia.com/victordavishanson/catching-up-with-correspondence/ posted] at Hanson's ''Works and Days'' blog)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Hanson wrote of why he did not find the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] populist or reflective of its prior concerns: "The Democratic Party reminds me of the Republicans circa 1965 or so—impotent, shrill, no ideas, conspiratorial, reactive, out-of-touch with most Americans, isolationist, and full of embarrassing spokesmen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://victorhanson.com/articles/Private%20Papers/Question%20Log/February05.html Question Log] on Hanson's website, February 2005{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103929/http://victorhanson.com/articles/Private%20Papers/Question%20Log/February05.html |date=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Hanson has appeared to reject the term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column "Hillary's Neoliberals" that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Hillary's Neoliberals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hillary's Neoliberals|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9415|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for [[Hillary Clinton]] as preferable to [[Donald Trump]] on grounds that Clinton has a long history of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the [[Clinton Foundation]] and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as "neoliberals" who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates [[George McGovern in 1972]] and [[United States presidential election, 1976|Jimmy Carter in 1976]] as opposed to converting to conservatism.&lt;ref name="Hillary's Neoliberals" /&gt;  Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America—the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton.&lt;ref name="Hillary's Neoliberals" /&gt; Hanson wrote: "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the other side of the aisle than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of [[NPR]], [[CBS]], and the ''[[New York Times]]'' against the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', [[conservative talk radio]], and the [[Drudge Report]]. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], onetime Bush officials [[Hank Paulson]] and [[Brent Scowcroft]], and billionaire [[Meg Whitman]] certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties."&lt;ref name="Hillary's Neoliberals" /&gt;
  
Hanson was a defender of George W. Bush and his policies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson200408130813.asp On Loathing Bush – It's not about what he does], Victor Davis Hanson, [[National Review]], August 13, 2004{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724132535/http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson200408130813.asp |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson200408130813.asp Myth or Reality – Will Iraq work?

Hanson wrote of Rumsfeld that he was: "a rare sort of secretary of the caliber of [[George Marshall]]" and a "proud and honest-speaking visionary" whose "hard work and insight are bringing us ever closer to victory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson122304.html Leave Rumsfeld Be – He is not to blame for our difficulties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713205844/http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson122304.html |date=July 13, 2012 }}, Victor Davis Hanson, ''[[National Review]]'', December 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issues pertaining to the constant political turmoil in the Middle East, Hanson emphasizes the lack of individual and political freedom, as well as transparency and self-critique, in many Middle Eastern nations as a major factor retarding economic, technological and cultural progress. He further relates the root cause of radical [[Islamic terrorism]] to insecurities resulting from a failure to achieve parity with the West, and a reactionary need to regain honor and pride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0806/hanson080306.php3 It's not just about land] by Victor Davis Hanson, ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', August 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===
Hanson believed that the [[Iraq War]], given the repeated serial violations by Iraq of UN sanctions, congressional mandates, and the threats that [[Saddam Hussein]] posed, in a post-9/11 climate, to the long-term security of the Middle East, was a necessary and worthwhile undertaking—and was, after a flawed occupation, eventually a laudable success that had led to a workable government in 2009 and relative calm in Iraq: analogous to the foundations of the successful American occupation of South Korea in the latter 1950s that led to the democratic society of today. However, he stated in 2008 that he, "...&amp;nbsp;disagreed with many of the decisions made about the Iraq war," such as the dissolution of the old [[Iraqi army]].&lt;ref name=WAD200807 /&gt;

Hanson argued that [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|the "surge" of 2007]] had largely won the Iraq War by the beginning of 2009, and that rise of the Islamic State terrorist group which seized control of much of Iraq in mid-2014 was the result of what Hanson sees as the unwise withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq in December 2011, which he blames on the Obama administration.&lt;ref name="The Ruins of the Middle East"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ruins of the Middle East|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7922#more-7922|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson argued that if only American troops had stayed in Iraq after December 2011, then the government of Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] would have been less sectarian and the Islamic State group would have never emerged.&lt;ref name="The Road to Middle East Perdition"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Road to Middle East Perdition|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8720#more-8720|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson argued that the December 2011 withdrawal from Iraq was motivated to help improve Obama's chances of reelection in 2012, an act that he compared to being equivalent to the United States pulling its troops out of South Korea in 1955, arguing if only the Americans had stayed in Iraq, then that nation would have evolved into a Near Eastern version of South Korea.&lt;ref name="Iraq Was Then, Syria Is Now"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Was Then, Syria Is Now|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7896#more-7896|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The U.S. and the world===
In 2004, Hanson gave a mostly favorable review to the book ''Colossus'' by the British historian [[Niall Ferguson]], where Ferguson argued that the United States should be an imperial power in the sense of preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership in the same way that people in 19th century Britain did.&lt;ref name="The Power To Do Good"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power To Do Good|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=4685#more-4685|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=June 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, given our wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive."&lt;ref name="The Power To Do Good" /&gt; Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principal problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are.&lt;ref name="The Power To Do Good" /&gt; Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the [[British Empire]] as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a bad rap as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a pretty good job of it as well."&lt;ref name="The Power To Do Good" /&gt; Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the [[European Union]] as being both "busy triangulating with our enemies" and "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." He appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the U.S., a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the U.S.&lt;ref name="The Power To Do Good" /&gt;

===Israeli–Arab conflict===
In his article ''Israel did it'', Hanson asked why [[Israel]], during the [[2006 Lebanon war]], was being blamed for responding to attacks by [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="Israel did it"&gt;{{cite web|title= Israel did it! |publisher =[[National Review]] |url = http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/219504/israel-did-it/victor-davis-hanson|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson was critical of the Middle East policies of the administration of Barack Obama and accused the Obama administration of distancing itself from Israel, despite its exceptional position as a tolerant Western nation in the Middle East, and of preferring the Palestinian Authority and [[Hamas]] despite their being anti-Western.&lt;ref name="Obama's Hope-and-Change Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama's Hope-and-Change Foreign Policy|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8693#more-8693|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race relations===
Hanson has often argued that in a 21st-century multiracial America there is little overt racism on the part of whites, and that generic complaints of racism too often are automatic from an often  privileged African-American elite that uses such charges of racism to advance careerist concerns not often synonymous with those in the inner city.&lt;ref name="The Weariness of the Whiners"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Weariness of the Whiners|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8657#more-8657|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the [[Henry Louis Gates arrest controversy|Gates affair]] in which the Harvard professor [[Henry Louis Gates]] was arrested in his home when a white policeman responded to a report of a possible break-in, Hanson argued that the policeman's actions were understandable given that "...&amp;nbsp;African-American males commit crimes at rates both higher than the general population's, and at levels higher than other minority groups that likewise struggle with poverty and systemic unfairness."&lt;ref name="Lose, Lose When You Talk About Race "&gt;{{cite web|title= Lose, Lose When You Talk About Race |publisher =Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=2377#more-2377|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 column titled "The New Racial Derangement Syndrome", Hanson argued again that class considerations now more often trump racial differences, and  that racism in modern America is not confined to any one particular group, citing various statements by prominent African-Americans such as [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Chris Rock]] and [[Rob Parker (sports journalist)|Rob Parker]] that he saw as racially chauvinistic and often blatantly anti-white, and thus as signs of a new "racialist derangement" sweeping across black America that had set back considerable progress in making racial considerations prior to 2009 incidental rather than essential to an American citizen's identity.&lt;ref name="The New Racial Derangement Syndrome"&gt;{{cite web|title= The New Racial Derangement Syndrome|publisher =Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=151#more-151/?p=2377#more-2377|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 column titled "The Weariness of the Whiners", Hanson illustrated the paradoxes of race and class, by citing the talk show hostess [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s claim that she was a victim of racism when a clerk at the ''Trois Pommes'' boutique refused to show a $38,000 handbag to her.&lt;ref name="The Weariness of the Whiners" /&gt; In a 2016 column, "The New Segregationism", Hanson lamented growing racial polarization, mostly on the part of elites who take refuge in racial chauvinism when their own careerist concerns are unmet. He used as an example of what he sees as the unlikelihood of the claim that there is anti-black racism in modern America in the complaint by the actor [[Will Smith]] that he was not nominated for an Oscar.&lt;ref name="The New Segregationism"&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Segregationism|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=  http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8982#more-8982|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson has been critical of the group [[Black Lives Matter]], which he maintains is a group based on "racial chauvinism" and "whining" which has told a "series of lies"—beginning with the "hands up don't shoot" untruth in the Ferguson shooting of Michael Brown—about the supposedly statistically-proven epidemic of police killings of black men, the majority of which Hanson argued were found to be justified on the basis of current police practice and protocols.&lt;ref name="'Black Lives Matter'—a Year From Now"&gt;{{cite web|title='Black Lives Matter' – a Year From Now|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8671#more-8671|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson claimed that responsibility for declining racial relations often rested with [[Barack Obama]], whom Hanson suggested had deliberately inflamed racial tensions between whites and blacks, with a series of gratuitous and racially charged commentaries, dating from the 2008 campaign to editorializing about the Trayvon Martin killing case, as a way of securing the votes of black Americans for the Democrats.&lt;ref name="Obama: Transforming America"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama: Transforming America|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=6573#more-6573|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson faulted Obama for having "...systematically adopted a rhetoric and an agenda that is predicated on dividing up the country according to tribal grievances, in hopes of recalibrating various factions into a majority grievance culture. In large part, he has succeeded politically. But in doing so he has nearly torn the country apart. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to suggest that no other recent president has offered such a level of polarizing and divisive racial bombast."&lt;ref name="Fundamentally Transformed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentally Transformed|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9383#more-9383|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson has also been consistently critical of unchecked and unmonitored illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico and the Central American republics, which he sees as threatening to overwhelm the United States with millions of Spanish-speakers who make assimilation difficult and some of whom he charges have criminal records and do not establish a record of work history. In a 2014 column "1984 Redux: Orwellian Illegal Immigration" Hanson wrote that Hispanic groups that use the name ''[[La Raza]]'' are racialists who have "hijacked" America's immigration policy to permit non-diverse, illegal, and unrestricted illegal immigration into the United States to further demographically-based political agendas, and who have made often false claims of suffering continual racial prejudice from a supposed prejudiced white majority, while arguing that Latinos as members of La Raza should keep themselves separate from the rest of Americans.&lt;ref name="1984 Redux: Orwellian Illegal Immigration"&gt;{{cite web|title=1984 Redux: Orwellian Illegal Immigration|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7731#more-7731|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson has condemned groups such as the [[National Council of La Raza]] as he argued that term ''La Raza'' has an unfortunate history as a "racialist term," whose origins he claims go back to [[Francoist Spain]] of [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|fascist Italy]], and those Mexican-American leaders who self-identify with the Francoist term ''La Raza'' are themselves guilty of operating as racial separatists.&lt;ref name="America: One Nation, Indivisible"&gt;{{cite web|title=America: One Nation, Indivisible|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8497#more-8497|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Hanson has voiced qualified support for [[Donald Trump]]'s plans to deport illegal immigrants from the United States, after offering a chance for [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] residence to those who were vetted and found to have no [[criminal record]], no history of public support, and residence of some duration. Blanket deportation policy, Hanson argued, would be as "unworkable", as is the present open-borders status quo.&lt;ref name="Absurd—and Not-so-Absurd—Immigration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Absurd – and Not-so-Absurd – Immigration|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8615#more-86153|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson is also opposed to the unvetted, and often illegal [[European migrant crisis|mass influx of mostly young male refugees from the war-torn Middle East into Europe]], alluding to the resulting tensions in EU society by using premodern/postmodern allusions to H.G. Well's 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'' that the millions of Muslims fleeing to Europe are the "Morlocks" (i.e. a fierce underclass) who will devour the Europeans who are "Eloi" (i.e. largely defenseless and overly refined creatures).&lt;ref name="Europe at the Edge of the Abyss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe at the Edge of the Abyss|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9204#more-9204|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson wrote that: "Europe's immigration policy is a disaster—and for reasons that transcend the idiocy of allowing the free influx of young male Muslims from a premodern, war-torn Middle East into a postmodern, pacifist, and post-Christian Europe."&lt;ref name="Europe at the Edge of the Abyss" /&gt; Hanson has called the German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] "unhinged" for welcoming about a million refugees fleeing from the [[Syrian Civil War]] into her nation without plans to assimilate or integrate such numbers, instead of sending them to their countries of origin. Hanson has denied that all Syrians fleeing into Europe are refugees from the civil war, writing that uncharacteristically most refugees are "...young, single men from the Middle East who pour into Europe not as political refugees but as opportunists eager for European social largesse".&lt;ref name="The Decline of Modern Germany"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Decline of Modern Germany|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8887#more-8887|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson wrote "Merkel's disastrous decision to open the borders of Germany—and with them Europe's as well—is proving both selfish and suicidal."&lt;ref name="The Decline of Modern Germany" /&gt; Wether Hanson was talking about the continued uninterrupted traveling within the [[Schengen Area]] or the lack of enforcement of the external European Union border was unclear.

Along the same lines, Hanson has argued that history proves that multi-cultural societies have too often proved disastrous failures, and that only way of preventing a society from collapsing into tribal bloodbaths is a "common culture, one that artificially suppresses the natural instinct of humans to identify first with their particular tribe".&lt;ref name="Fundamentally Transformed" /&gt; As an example of what he sees as a law of history, Hanson wrote: "The Italian Roman Republic lasted about 500 years. In contrast, the multiracial Roman Empire that after the Edict of Caracalla in AD 212 made all its diverse peoples equal citizens endured little more than two (often violent) centuries."&lt;ref name="America: History's Exception"&gt;{{cite web|title=America: History's Exception|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9339#more-9339|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines Hanson wrote in the 2016 column "Diversity: History's Pathway to Chaos" that: "Emphasizing diversity has been the pitfall, not the strength, of nations throughout history".&lt;ref name="Diversity: History's Pathway to Chaos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversity: History's Pathway to Chaos|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9430#more-9430|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson charged that the current celebration of diversity was destroying America and ended with the statement if the celebration of diversity did not end: "Otherwise, we will end up as 50 separate and rival nations—just like other failed states in history whose diverse tribes and races destroyed themselves in a Hobbesian dog-eat-dog war with one another."&lt;ref name="Diversity: History's Pathway to Chaos"/&gt; In a 2013 column titled "Western Cultural Suicide", Hanson wrote: "Multiculturalism—as opposed to the notion of a multiracial society united by a single culture—has become an abject contradiction in the modern Western world... Western hosts lost confidence in the very society that gives us the wealth and leisure to ignore or caricature its foundations. The result is that millions of immigrants flock to the West, enjoy its material security, and yet feel little need to bond with their adopted culture, given that their hosts themselves are ambiguous about what others desperately seek out."&lt;ref name="Western Cultural Suicide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Western Cultural Suicide|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=6001#more-6001|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about the murder of a British soldier by two Nigerian Muslims on the streets of London in May 2013, Hanson wrote the murder reflected what he viewed as cultural decline, stating: "In Britain, as in the West in general, deportation is a fossilized concept. Unity is passé. Patriotism is long suspect. The hip metrosexual cultures of the urban West strain to find fault in their inheritance, and seem to appreciate those who do that in the most cool fashion—but always with the expectation that there will be some poor blokes who, in terms of clean water, medical care, free speech, and dependable electricity, ensure that London is not Lagos, that Stockholm is not Damascus, and that Los Angeles is not Nuevo Laredo."&lt;ref name="Western Cultural Suicide" /&gt; Through acknowledging that in the early years of the American republic that to be American was to be white, Hanson argued that the "ultimate logic" of the American constitution led to the United States becoming a society where "multiracialism under one common culture" was the norm, but unfortunately in the late 20th century "multiculturalism, in which each particular ethnic group retained its tribal chauvinism and saw itself as separate from the whole" become the new norm.&lt;ref name="America: History's Exception" /&gt;

In July 2013, the Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] gave a speech when he mentioned that as a black man the need to deliver "the Talk" to his children, namely he would have to inform his children that some, mostly white people who were going to hate them not because what they did, but simply because of their skin color. In response to Holder's speech, Hanson wrote a column titled "Facing Facts about Race" where he offered up his own version (and others') of "the Talk", namely the need to inform his children to be careful of young black men when venturing into the inner city, who Hanson argued were statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than young men of other races, and that therefore it was understandable for the police to focus on groups with the highest statistical crime rates, which turn out to be young black males.&lt;ref name="Facing Facts About Race"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facing Facts About Race|publisher=National Review Online|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/354122/facing-facts-about-race-victor-davis-hanson|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson wrote his father once had been robbed by young black men, and had given him "the Talk" warning his son to exercise caution in known crime-ridden areas and to note that African-American male youth have a far higher incidence of assault than other groups; and Hanson added that having been robbed himself by black men, he had given "the Talk" warning his children to avoid situations when in dangerous areas and to exercise caution there when encountering groups of young African-American men when alone, whom Hanson argue were statistically more likely to have had criminal records.&lt;ref name="Facing Facts About Race"/&gt; Hanson therefore criticized Holder and Obama for suggesting that racism may have been a factor in the trial of Hispanic [[George Zimmerman]] who had been charged and acquitted of murder with the shooting death of [[Trayvon Martin]]—and especially for intruding in an ongoing criminal case before a jury had even been selected.&lt;ref name="Facing Facts About Race"/&gt; Hanson argued that Zimmerman was later found by a jury of his peers to be justified in shooting Martin in self-defense, and he suggested that Obama was alluding to racism being a factor in the case, to distract attention from his then unpopular presidency.&lt;ref name="Facing Facts About Race"/&gt;

Referring to the concurrent case at the time of two Vietnamese-Americans killed by a black convicted felon, Hanson wrote: "The world will long remember Trayvon Martin, but few people—and certainly not Barack Obama or Eric Holder, who have a bad habit, in an increasingly multiracial country, of claiming solidarity on the basis of race—will care that Khin Min and Lina Lim were torn to pieces by bullets and a knife. Few will care that they died in a vicious assault that had nothing to do with stereotyping, Stand Your Ground self-defense, weak gun laws, insufficient federal civil-rights legislation, or any of the other causes of interracial violence falsely advanced by the attorney general—but quite a lot to do with an urban culture that for unspoken reasons has spawned an epidemic of disproportionate violent crime on the part of young African-American males."&lt;ref name="Facing Facts About Race"/&gt;

====Criticism for his views on race relations====

In response to "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] accused Hanson of racism and stupidity.&lt;ref name="It's the Racism, Stupid!"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's the Racism, Stupid!|publisher=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/its-the-racism-stupid/278026/|author=Te-Nehisi Coates|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to Hanson's "Talk", Coates wrote: "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this "talk" as stupid advice. If I were to tell you that I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because "Jews are really successful," you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is ... There is no difference between my argument above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity."&lt;ref name="It's the Racism, Stupid!" /&gt;

The Anglo-American journalist [[Andrew Sullivan]] called Hanson's column "spectacularly stupid", writing: "Treating random strangers as inherently dangerous because of their age, gender and skin color is a ''choice'' to champion fear over reason, a ''decision'' to embrace easy racism over any attempt to overcome it".&lt;ref name="It's Not Racist …"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Not Racist …|publisher=The Daily Dish|url=http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/07/23/its-not-racist//|author=Andrew Sullivan|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American journalist Arthur Stern called "Facing Facts About Race" an "inflammatory" column based upon crime statistics that Hanson never cited, writing: "His presentation of this controversial opinion as undeniable fact without exhaustive statistical proof is undeniably racist."&lt;ref name="A Millennial Takedown Of Victor Davis Hanson's 'Facts About Race'"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Millennial Takedown Of Victor Davis Hanson's 'Facts About Race'|publisher=News.Mic|url=https://mic.com/articles/56449/a-millennial-takedown-of-victor-davis-hanson-s-facts-about-race#.VoX2WUxxl|author=Arthur Stern|date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-American journalist [[Kelefa Sanneh]] in response to "Facing Facts About Race" wrote that Hanson was wrong to claim that white and Asian-Americans were all victims of black criminals, writing: "It's strange, then, to read Hanson writing as if the fear of violent crime were mainly a "white or Asian" problem, about which African-Americans might be uninformed, or unconcerned—as if African-American parents weren't already giving their children more detailed and nuanced versions of Hanson's "sermon," sharing his earnest and absurd hope that the right words might keep trouble at bay."&lt;ref name="A Sermon on Race from National Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Sermon on Race from National Review|publisher=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-sermon-on-race-from-national-review|author=Kelefa Sanneh|date=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-American journalist [[John Derbyshire]], who was fired from the ''National Review'' for writing a similar column in 2012 titled "The Talk: Nonblack Version", came to Hanson's defense, praising him for "spot-on observations" about race relations in modern America, through he argued that his column was much superior.&lt;ref name="John Derbyshire Wonders: Will NATIONAL REVIEW Derbyshire Victor Davis Hanson?"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Derbyshire Wonders: Will National Review Derbyshire Victor Davis Hanson?|publisher=V-Dare.com|url=http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-wonders-will-national-review-derbyshire-victor-davis-hanson/|author=John Derbyshire |date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Talk: Nonblack Version", Derbyshire, who had earlier been criticized by Hanson on his advocacy for racial stereotyping well beyond the context of traveling in high crime areas, went well beyond what Hanson had advocated, telling his children not to live in cities with black mayors, never to help a black person in distress, to avoid all public gatherings with large numbers of black people and only have a few black people as friends to avoid allegations of prejudice.&lt;ref name="The Talk, Nonblack Version"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Talk: Nonblack Version|publisher=Taki's Magazine|url=http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/print#axzz4K6HKsUNI|author=John Derbyshire|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contra Coates, Derbyshire argued in support of Hanson that the best way to avoid being a victim of crime was: "..stay well clear of crowds of unfamiliar blacks. Might application of those rules leave someone with hurt feelings?  Probably.  So in this pan we have some stranger's hurt feelings. In the other pan, we have our kids' safety. What's the beam doing, Ta-Nehisi?".&lt;ref name="John Derbyshire Wonders: Will NATIONAL REVIEW Derbyshire Victor Davis Hanson?" /&gt; Hanson in response to Sanneh's essay accused him of a "McCarthyite character assassination" and "infantile, if not racialist, logic".&lt;ref name="Untruth at The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Untruth at the New Yorker|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=6271 |date=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confrontation with Iran===
Hanson has argued that the U.S. may be forced to take a much more confrontational stance towards [[Iran]]ian violation of prior nuclear enrichment prohibitions, advocating, if necessary,  unilateral responses to the country should it continue its aggressive acts of war. On the [[Hugh Hewitt]] show in August 2007, Hanson stated, "We really need to start doing some things beyond talking, and if that is going into Iranian airspace, or buzzing Iranians, or even starting to forget where the border is and taking out some of these training camps, we need to do that and send a message, because they're a [[paper tiger]]. They really are."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/talkradio/transcripts/Transcript.aspx?ContentGuid=5c9ebf47-99c1-496a-91a0-94b8893f4e81, Hugh Hewitt Show transcript, August 13, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209071742/http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/talkradio/transcripts/Transcript.aspx?ContentGuid=5c9ebf47-99c1-496a-91a0-94b8893f4e81 |date=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 column Hanson faulted the Obama administration for engaging in "appeasement" of Iran and of fruitlessly attempting to negotiate an end to the [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian program to acquire nuclear weapons]], predicating if Iran continued enrichment unchecked that: "Accordingly, it is more than likely that in the next two years Iran will become a nuclear power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Sizing America Up|publisher= Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers |url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7974#more-7974|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2018, Iran is still not a nuclear power.

===China===
Hanson has argued that [[China]] is an increasingly aggressive power that is set upon eventually dominating East Asia. In a 2014 column titled "Is China copying the Old Imperial Japan?", Hanson answered his question in the affirmative.&lt;ref name="Is China copying the old imperial Japan?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is China copying the old imperial Japan?|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=6901#more-6901|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson maintained that economically successful Asian nations without the deterrent power of the United States are naturally inclined to expansionism.&lt;ref name="Is China copying the old imperial Japan?" /&gt; Hanson claimed that Japan, as a result of late nineteenth-century Meiji era reforms, had become powerful at the same time the United States had temporarily retreated into isolationism which allowed Japan to embark upon an imperialistic foreign policy; that the same thing was happening today with China and the United States under the leadership of Barack Obama.&lt;ref name="Is China copying the old imperial Japan?" /&gt; Along these lines, Hanson has cited China for attempting to create its version of  "Greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere", which would incorporate all of East Asia.&lt;ref name="Barack Obama, Empire Builder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barack Obama, Empire Builder|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8166#more-8166|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Hanson repeatedly accused President Barack Obama of engaging in "appeasement" of [[Russia]]. Hanson argues that [[Vladimir Putin]] is the embodiment of "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, there is something about constitutional government and liberal rule that bothers Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, the more likely they are to bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much".&lt;ref name="History Never Quite Ends"&gt;{{cite web|title= History Never Quite Ends|publisher =Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers |url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=926#more-926|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism."&lt;ref name="What Drives Vladimir Putin"&gt;{{cite web|title= What Drives Vladimir Putin?ļ|publisher =Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url =http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7301#more-7301|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people out of a sense of hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again.&lt;ref name="What Drives Vladimir Putin" /&gt; In 2014, Hanson called Putin "evil", writing: "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations."&lt;ref name="The Value of Putin"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Value of Putin|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=6999#more-6999|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: {{cquote|Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American "reset" diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine. Should Putin wish to absorb Estonia or other Baltic States, NATO probably would not stop him."&lt;ref name="The New World Map"&gt;{{cite web|title= The New World Map|publisher= Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8489#more-8489|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hanson stated that Obama's much heralded "reset" of relations with Russia in 2009 had "empowered" Putin and, in this way, Obama was responsible for the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2014.&lt;ref name="The Road to Middle East Perdition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Value of Putin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The New World Map" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Our Russia Experts"&gt;{{cite web|title= Our Russia Experts |publisher =[[Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers]] |url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7721#more-7721|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hanson wrote about the "reset": "...former Soviet republics understand that Russia's Putin has a de facto green light to "readjust" their present-day, "ad hoc" borders—with President Obama about as clear on any future dispute as candidate Obama was about Georgia."&lt;ref name="Resetting the Reset Button"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resetting the Reset Button|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=2103#more-2103|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Hanson predicted that Russia might very well invade Estonia in the near future, stating: "Future targeted states, perhaps like Estonia, should understand that they are slated to play the 1939 role of Poland after the earlier ''Anschluss'' and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia."&lt;ref name="Why Is the World Becoming Such a Nasty Place?"&gt;{{cite web|title= Why Is the World Becoming Such a Nasty Place?|publisher =Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7712#more-7712|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date= July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Hanson predicted that the Russian-dominated [[Eurasian Economic Union]], which Hanson calls the "Russian Union" would continue to grow, writing: "Soon the Russian Union could dwarf the European Union, as the former consolidates and the latter threatens to fragment."&lt;ref name="The New World Disorder"&gt;{{cite web|title= The New World Disorder|publisher =Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url =http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=7822#more-7822|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Hanson wrote: {{cquote|Obama's reset was a green light for Putin. Who in the real world of serious diplomacy shows up in Geneva with a red plastic toy reset button, complete with a mistranslated Russian label? When Putin soon sized up the Obama administration's appeasement around the globe—from fake red lines for Syria, to a scramble out of Iraq, to chaos in Libya—he moved into Crimea...As he swallows Eastern Ukraine, he now eyes the Baltic States. He does not quite have a map on his wall of a new czarist Orthodox state the size of the Soviet Union, but he does have a general sense that there are a lot more former Soviet republics to be had—and he is eager to poke here and there to find out which will be the easiest to grab next.&lt;ref name="The Putin Way"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Putin Way|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8303#more-8303|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: {{cquote|Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and sizing up Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another former Soviet republic, as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran.&lt;ref name="The Four Horsemen of a Looming Apocalypse"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Four Horsemen of a Looming Apocalypse|publisher=Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers|url=http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8533#more-8533|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hanson is opposed to the Russian intervention in the [[Syrian civil war]], which he argues is a part of a bid by Putin to construct an anti-American Russian-Syrian-Iranian-Iraqi alliance that will dominate the Middle East and intimidate the Gulf states.&lt;ref name="Don't Trust Putin in the Mideast"&gt;{{cite web|title= Don't Trust Putin in the Mideast|publisher =[[Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers]] |url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8716#more-8716|author=Victor Davis Hanson |date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson has made the claim that the primary responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War was not due to [[Adolf Hitler]], but was rather due to the British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and the French Premier [[Édouard Daladier]] who failed to maintain credible threats of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].&lt;ref name="How Barack Obama's Foreign Policy De-Stabilized the World"&gt;{{cite web|title= How Barack Obama's Foreign Policy De-Stabilized the World |publisher =[[Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers]] |url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9308|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson has argued Obama has likewise failed to maintain a credible threat of deterrence, and as such, the world is on the verge of another war comparable to the Second World War.&lt;ref name="How Barack Obama's Foreign Policy De-Stabilized the World" /&gt; Hanson has predicted that Putin will sometime in the near-future invade one or more of the Baltic states if the United States does not provide more deterrence to Russia.&lt;ref name="The Next President Is Going to Be Hated"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Next President Is Going to Be Hated |publisher =[[Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers]] |url = http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=9247#more-9247|author=Victor Davis Hanson|date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Hanson wrote about the [[Russia–United States relations]]: {{cquote|No one doubts that Vladimir Putin's Russia is no ally of the U.S. But rivalry is quite a different notion than returning to the Cold War, when enemies faced each other down with arsenals of nuclear missiles. Quite strangely, the supposedly pacifist Left now seems to welcome that dangerous polarity...The new progressive hatred of Russia is baffling. Of course, Vladimir Putin is a thug and a killer who in the grand tradition of Russian autocracy has no intention ever of holding free elections. But he is perhaps no more a murderer than are the Castro brothers in Cuba, with whom we have concluded a détente and who have no arsenal capable of destroying the U.S...As a result of a McCarthy-like Russian-under-every-American-bed hysteria, we now have all became far less safe in an already very, very dangerous world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Does the Left Suddenly Hate Russia? |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/08/left-red-scare-democrats-suddenly-hate-russia/ |work=National Review |date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Wilhelm Oechsli''' (6 October 1851, [[Riesbach]] – 26 April 1919) was a Swiss historian.

Oechsli studied theology and history at [[Berlin University|Berlin]] and [[University of Zurich|Zürich]], under [[Theodor Mommsen]] among others. In 1887 he took up the new chair of Swiss history at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]]. From 1893 to 1919 he was professor of history at the [[University of Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;James Murray Luck, ''A history of Switzerland: the first 100,000 years'', Society for the Promotion of Science and Scholarship, 1985, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to popularize critical historiography, challenging the legendary traditions about the Swiss national past:

{{quote|However painful it may be to the Swiss to do without their [[William Tell|Tell]] and their [[Rütlischwur|Rütli]], in the field of scholarly inquiry the search for truth must prevail over any other consideration. For, as things stand today, there can be no doubt that the old and much-loved notions not only do not correspond with the sources of our national history, but also are frankly contradicted by the available sources... the legend as a whole is indeed a creation of fantasy, particularly in the form in which it was first recorded by [[Aegidius Tschudi|Tschudi]] and subsequently adopted in the influential works of [[Johannes von Müller]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[William Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Oechsli, ''Ueber die historischen Stifter der Eidgenossenschaft'', Zurich: Schulthess, 1889, p.6. Quoted in Oliver Zimmer, ''A contested nation: history, memory and nationalism in Switzerland, 1761-1891'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.216&lt;/ref&gt;}}
