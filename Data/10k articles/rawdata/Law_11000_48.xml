'''Alfred Swaine Taylor''' (11 December 1806 in [[Northfleet]], Kent – 27 May 1880 in [[London]]) was an English [[toxicologist]] and medical writer, who has been called the "father of British forensic medicine"&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Louis, [http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/31/7/1235 'Alfred Swaine Taylor (1806–1880), pioneer toxicologist – and a slight case of murder'],''Clinical Chemistry'' 31:7 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/4355 Alfred Swaine Taylor]. Royal College of Physicians of London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an early experimenter in photography.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Roger, ''Impressed by Light. British Photographs from Paper Negatives, 1840-1860'', (Yale University Press, 2007), p.378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor studied medicine at [[Guy's Hospital]] and [[St Thomas's Hospital]] and was appointed Lecturer in Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital in 1831. In 1832 he succeeded Alexander Barry as joint Lecturer on Chemistry with [[Arthur Aitken]]. He published textbooks on [[medical jurisprudence]] and [[toxicology]], contributed to the ''[[Dublin Quarterly Journal]]'' and medical periodicals, and edited the ''[[Medical Gazette]]''. He appeared as expert witness in several widely reported murder cases. He also developed the use of [[hyposulphate of lime]] as a fixing agent for photography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20718">'''Biometric voter registration''' implicates using [[Biometrics|biometric technology]] (capturing unique physical features of an individual – [[fingerprinting]] is the most commonly used), most of the times in addition to demographics of the voter, for [[Voter registration|polling registration]] and/or [[Electronic authentication|authentication]]. The enrollment infrastructure allows collecting and maintaining a database of the biometric templates for all voters.

A biometric voting project might include introducing biometric registration kits for enrolment of voters; using electronic voter identification devices before and on Election Day; issuing of voter [[Identity document|identification documents]] (i.e. biometric voter cards), among others. The chronological stages for adopting a biometric voting registration project usually include assessment; feasibility studies; securing funding; reviewing legislation; doing [[Mock election|pilot projects]] and mock registration exercises; procurement; distribution of equipment, installation, and testing; recruitment and [[Electoral education|training]] of staff; voter information; deployment and, [[Election audits|post-election audits]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/introducing-biometric-technology-in-elections.pdf|title=Introducing Biometric Technology in Elections|last=Wolf|first=Peter|date=2017|publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/361712092|title=Biometric Voter Registration: Skills required and problems encountered?|publisher=aceproject.org|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final aim of implementing biometric election technology is achieving [[de-duplication]] of the voting register,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifes.org/sites/default/files/biometrics_in_elections_2011_0.pdf|title=Biometrics in Elections|last=Holtved|first=Ole|date=February 2011|publisher=International Foundation for Electoral Systems and USAID}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus preventing multiple voter registration and multiple voting; improving identification of the voter at the polling station, and mitigating the incidence of [[voter fraud]] (e.g. buy/rent of voters IDs before an election).

However, it is vital that commissions carrying out these election projects first and foremost guarantee that the legal framework supports biometric voter identification,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/Biometrics_Friend_or_foe.pdf|title=Biometrics: Friend or foe of privacy?|publisher=Privacy International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/11/biometrics-development-aid-work|title=Using biometrics in development: lessons and challenges|last=Gelb|first=Alan|date=2013-02-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-18|last2=Clark|first2=Julia|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then that the data captured during the registration process will be secured while maintaining two basic requirements: personalization and privacy. Likewise, it is imperative to have contingency mechanisms in place, in case biometric systems malfunction. One of the main challenges is to ensure that given the eventualities of technological hitches and failures, not a single voter is disenfranchised.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/916219364|title=Biometric Voter Registration and Voter Identification|publisher=aceproject.org|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries with biometric voter registration ==
According to [[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|International IDEA]]'s ICTs in Elections Database,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/icts-elections|title=ICTs in Elections Database|publisher=International IDEA|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2016, the number of [[Countries applying biometrics|countries adopting biometrics]] in elections has steadily increased to over 50, with significant differences between regions. "While there are virtually no users in Europe, about half of the countries in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] use this technology in elections."&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; 35 per cent of over 130 surveyed Electoral Management Bodies is capturing biometric data (such as fingerprints or photos) as part of their voter registration process (2016).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Countries which have used Biometric voting registration include Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/blog/2017/03/10/new-voter-authentication-devices-vads-tested-in-armenia/|title=New Voter Authentication Devices (VADs) tested in Armenia|publisher=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/armenia/293071|title=Parliamentary Elections, 2 April 2017|publisher=OSCE|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angola,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_14382-1522-2-30.pdf?080902095246|title=Angola votes!

== Advocacy and criticism ==
Some promoters of biometric voting registration point out that this technology, if properly customised to the country's needs and well implemented, could offer better accessibility for citizens; help avoiding long queues and waiting times for registration and voting; add simplicity and speed to the election cycle (i.e. voter identification documents can make it easier for polling staff to verify voter details);&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; make voters and Commissions feel confident about the quality of their registry (more accurate, reliable and complete data); improve e-voting security,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://findbiometrics.com/mcafee-atlantic-council-joint-study-sees-important-role-for-biometrics-in-e-voting/|title=McAfee-Atlantic Council Joint Study Sees Important Role for Biometrics in e-Voting|date=2014-10-08|work=FindBiometrics|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2016/10/voting-online-made-possible-with-selfie-recognition-technology/|title=Voting online made possible with selfie recognition technology|date=2016-10-17|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; considerably reduce or eliminate multiple registration and multiple voting, while mitigating the risk of impersonation, identity theft, the misuse of records of deceased voters, carousel voting and ballot-box stuffing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the other hand, those who criticise and disapprove the use of biometrics for voter identification maintain that using biometrics for election purposes raises concerns over voters' privacy, human dignity and governmental disclosure of personal information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/biometrics-coming-along-serious-security-concerns/|title=Biometrics Are Coming, Along With Serious Security Concerns|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics go further to claim that biometrics in voting poses a serious threat to democracy, due to fears of violation of the secrecy of the vote (or correlation voter-vote).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thepatrioticvanguard.com/analysis-of-biometric-voter-registration-and-voting-process-in-sierra-leone|title=Analysis of Biometric Voter Registration and Voting Process in Sierra Leone|last=Vanguard|first=The Patriotic|date=2011-10-02|work=The Patriotic Vanguard|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concerns as with any other application of biometrics for identification and authentication can be manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ccD1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170|title=Adopting Biometric Technology: Challenges and Solutions|last=Das|first=Ravindra|date=2016-04-21|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4987-1745-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; There is, for example, the possibility of voter disenfranchisement when characteristics typically used to identify or verify voters might become unavailable (e.g. bandaged finger, loss of a finger, failure to acquire due to dirt or fingerprint quality degradation).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Similarly, there are also claims of potential logistical and procedural "new problems" that biometric identification devices can bring to an election cycle: increasing costs (initial purchase costs of biometric readers and infrastructure, costs linked to maintenance, storage and upgrades) and resources' allocation (human, time, material); additional training of commissions and polling staff, technological failures that could disenfranchise voters; and extra data storage that demands higher security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CNMS rect color1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|CNMS logo]]  --&gt;The '''Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences'''(CNMS) was the first to open of the five Nanoscale Science Research Centers the [[United States Department of Energy]] sponsors. The Center's location is in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. The CNMS is a collaborative [[nanoscience]] user research facility for the synthesis, characterization, theory/ modeling/ [[simulation]], and design of [[nanoscale]] materials and is co-located with [[Spallation Neutron Source]]. 

==Science at the CNMS==

The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) is a [[United States Department of Energy|U.S.Department of Energy]] / Office of Science Nanoscale Science Research Center (NSRC) operating as a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary user research facility.  The CNMS is one of five DOE NSRCs that form an integrated national user network. Each NSRC is associated with other major national research facilities at one of DOE’s National Laboratories, enabling their application to nanoscale science and technology.
 
To accomplish this, the CNMS integrates nanoscale science with three highly synergistic national needs: 
*[[Neutron]] Science, using the Spallation Neutron Source, SNS, and the recently upgraded [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR).
*Synthesis Science, also called “science-driven synthesis,” facilitated by extensive and novel synthesis capabilities in the CNMS' first five Scientific Themes (described below) and by a new Nanofabrication Research Laboratory.
*Theory, Modeling and Simulation, through establishing a new Nanomaterials Theory Institute, with close connections to the staff expertise and computational capabilities of ORNL's Center for Computational Sciences and the new national Leadership Scientific Computing Facility. 

==Scientific Themes==
Research in the CNMS is organized under seven related scientific themes and a Nanofabrication Research Laboratory, (NRL; [[clean room]]), that have been selected to address grand challenges to scientific understanding as well as nanotechnology opportunities and needs. 

* [[Macromolecular]] Complex Systems
* Functional Nanomaterials
* [[Catalysis]] and Nano-Building Blocks
* NanoPhysics: [[Magnetism]], Transport, and Scanning Probes
* Bio-Inspired Nanomaterials
* Nanomaterials Theory Institute (NTI): Theory, Modeling, and Simulation
* Nanoscale Structure and Dynamics: Neutrons, [[Electron]]s, and [[X-ray]]s
* Nanofabrication Research Laboratory (NRL)

==Facility and Capabilities==
The CNMS is housed in a new 80,000-ft2 building on Chestnut Ridge adjacent to the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).  Construction of the CNMS facility began in August 2003 and was completed in April 2005, with the nanoscience user research program beginning operation in October 2005.  The four-level main building comprises wet and dry laboratories, office space, and common areas to promote interaction among staff, long-term research guests, and users.  It is equipped with a wide range of specialized tools for synthesis, characterization, and integration of hard and soft materials.  The 10,000-ft2 Nanofabrication Research Laboratory, housed in a one-level wing of the building, includes clean rooms and an area designed to meet the requirements of electron beam imaging and writing instruments (low electromagnetic field, low vibration, low acoustic noise).  The Nanomaterials Theory Institute provides collaborative workspaces, visualization equipment, and high-speed connections to the terascale computing facilities of ORNL’s National Center for Computational Sciences and the national Leadership Scientific Computing Facility.  The intense neutron beams of the SNS and of the recently upgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor afford unique opportunities for fundamental studies of the structure and dynamics of nanoscale materials.  The CNMS will provide a gateway to these and other ORNL user facilities, including [[electron microscopy]], for users whose research can benefit from access to multiple facilities.

==User research program==
The CNMS user program provides access to equipment for nanoscale research and engineering.  Access is through brief user research proposals that are peer-reviewed by an external Proposal Review Committee.  Nanoscience user activities were initiated during 2003, prior to completion of the CNMS building, with the first CNMS "Jump Start" Call for Proposals (July-August 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">The ''' Children Act 1948''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that established a comprehensive [[childcare]] service.&lt;ref&gt;Law and Ethics in Children's Nursing by Judith Hendrick&lt;/ref&gt; It reformed the services available to deprived children, consolidating existing childcare legislation and establishing departments “in which professional social work practice would develop in child care and, in due course, in work with families.”&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Social Policy by Michael James Hill&lt;/ref&gt; The Act made it clear that it was the duty of local authorities to receive into care any child who was without parents or whose parents could not care for him for any reason, if it was in the interest of the child’s welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Labour and inequality: sixteen fabian essays edited by Peter Townsend and Nicholas Bosanquet&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new duties imposed upon local authorities by the legislation (particularly to receive deprived children into care) resulted in childcare services working more closely with families. The Act also led to a new approach towards parent-child relations, encouraging the newly established Children’s Departments ‘to view children as individual human beings with both shared and individualised needs, rather than an indistinct mass.”&lt;ref&gt;Law and Ethics in Children's Nursing by Judith Hendrick&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">A '''Clerk of Assize''' was a [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the [[Assizes (England and Wales)|Assize Courts]] of England and Wales, a position which existed from at least 1285 to 1971, when the [[Courts Act 1971]] eliminated the Assize Courts. Originally the judges' private clerks tasked with enrolling [[plea]]s, the Clerks grew into the heads of administrative departments tasked with keeping each Assize running smoothly, and at one point sat as judges in their own right.

==History==
The first known reference to Clerks of Assize was made in 1285, when a procedural rule was created stating that justices on Assize should be accompanied by a clerk tasked with enrolling [[plea]]s.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;Cockburn 1969, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; The first few sets of Assize Clerks were the private clerks of the judges themselves, but by 1380 records show that the [[Western Circuit]] had a permanent employed Clerk, Simon of Lichfield, a barrister of the Old Temple.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt; From then onwards the position was normally filled by barristers. Although a 1541 statute prohibited a Clerk from actively practising as a barrister while serving, the position offered a chance to make connections with the Westminster judges and of power in local politics, and records show that in 1657 the [[Oxford Circuit]] clerkship, for example, changed hands for the then-massive sum of £2,575.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn 1969, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clerks' income was initially the fees paid by parties to have a case come before the court, and as a result their pay depended on the business of the court itself. By the 1650s there were over 100 ''[[nisi prius]]'' cases on each Circuit, worth approximately 10s in fees, along with 50 criminal cases worth between 2s to 16s.&lt;ref name=c2&gt;Cockburn 1969, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Clerks were expected to pay for the expenses of the judge and the bailiff and Marshall's fees, but despite this still prospered: by the 1660s some were making more money than the Assize judges themselves.&lt;ref name=c2/&gt; The Clerk positions eventually ceased to exist in 1971, when the [[Courts Act 1971]] eliminated the [[Assizes (England and Wales)|Assize Courts]].

==Duties and restrictions==
Clerks were initially tasked only with drafting and accepting pleas, but for a period from the late 16th to mid 17th centuries they worked as full-fledged Assize judges to cut down the workload.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn 1969, pp. 321–2.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually headed up an entire department of administrators to keep the Assize running smoothly, and manuals written for Clerks in the late 17th century attest to the complexity of their duties, which only ended when every assize plea had been written, accepted and filed.&lt;ref name=11d3&gt;Cockburn 1969, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about their assistants: almost all were legally trained, but their duties and identities remain unknown. Assistants were appointed by the Clerk, with the approval of the Assize Judges.&lt;ref name=11d3/&gt;

When a barrister became a clerk he was statutorily debarred from acting as a barrister.&lt;ref name=11s&gt;Cockburn 1969, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions were occasionally made: at the 1682 Bedford Assize John Luke, the Clerk, represented Robert Chambers for an unspecified offence.&lt;ref name=11s/&gt;

A '''collective work''' under the [[copyright law of France]] is a [[collective work]] that contains the works of several authors created, assembled, harmonized and published under the direction of a person or  organization who owns the commercial and moral rights of the work as a whole. 
The work as a whole is distinct from the individual contributions, which are owned by the authors.
It is common for publication of articles on the Internet, in a different context and layout from the printed work, to be considered to be outside the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.

==Definitions==

Article L113-2 of the French Intellectual Property Code defines three types of multi-author works:{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2}}
* "Work of collaboration" shall mean a work in the creation of which more than one natural person has participated.
* "Composite work" shall mean a new work in which a preexisting work is incorporated without the collaboration of the author of the latter work.
* "Collective work" shall mean a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created.{{efn|The definition in Spanish copyright law, much influenced by French law, says a collective work "consists of the collection of contributions from different authors whose personal contributions are based on autonomous creation, and for whom it is not possible to attribute separately a right over the whole of the work."{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 28}} This is perhaps clearer than the French form "in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2}} }}

Article L113-5 states that "A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author’s rights shall vest in such person."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2–3}}
Article L123-3 states that "In the case of pseudonymous, anonymous or collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=7}}

==Interpretations==

The concept of a collective work (''œuvre collective'') in French law is complicated and unclear, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Bernard Edelman, in his ''l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable'' (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as "obscure and tangled".{{sfn|Jacobacci Avocats|2014}}
However, all authorities agree that the concept of an ''oeuvre collective'' in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical
works such as newspapers or magazines.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Courts have also ruled that collective works may include such things as the elements of a car body, a computer program, a poster and a guide of administrative formalities.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=70}}

Basic conditions for a collective work are that there must be a promoter, presenter or orchestrator, and the work must not be joint authorship.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The work's ''maître'', a natural or legal person, directs creation of the collective work, harmonizes the contributions, edits, publishes and discloses the work.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
The  ''maître'' decides on the theme, treatment and spirit of the work, assembles the contributions, harmonizes it and publishes the overall work. 
The contributors have not significantly cooperated in creating the overall work, but have each worked independently under the direction of the ''maître''.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
It does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}

In a 1999 dispute over the rights of the daily newspaper [[Le Progrès]] to publish articles online, the lower court refused to designate Le Progrès a collective work, but the Court of Appeal ruled that it was a collective work by virtue of assembling a newspaper in several editions, selecting and presenting the contributions at the sole discretion of the owner, Groupe Progrès.{{sfn|Blocman|2000}}
By working under the direction of the owner, the contributors lose their creative independence, however important their contributions are to the collective work.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

==Proprietary rights==

A collective work is unusual in French law in that a juristic person may be the initial owner of a work without having to show evidence that the copyright was assigned.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=71}}
As a rule, French courts do not recognise that an employee has transferred their rights to an employer unless there is evidence of such a transfer in the form of an agreement.
A collective work is an exception.
The ''maître'' takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the ''maître'' rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the ''maître'' directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}

The 1885 [[Berne Convention]] stated that journalists owned their work, but this depends on whether a newspaper is seen as a collection of works or as a collective work.
In France, journalists own their work in either case.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}
Article L121-8 states that whether or not a newspaper or periodical is considered to be a collective work the journalists retain the rights to exploit their contributions.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
The promoter is the sole owner of the rights in the collective work as a whole, but the contributors have author rights in their own contributions.
Case law has determined that the investor's initial right of property is limited to the first commercial release of the collective work.
The contributors can then commercialize their contributions separately as long as this does not adversely affect commercialization of the collective work as a whole.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The contributors to a newspaper thus have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

==Moral rights==

Moral rights are seen as personality rights in French law, attached to the personality of the author and inalienable.
They are retained by the author even when the patrimonial rights are sold.{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
The Intellectual Property Code says the ''maître'' has the author's rights, and does not distinguish between moral and economic rights.
However, only a natural person can be an author, and moral rights cannot be alienated from the author, giving rise to uncertainty over whether the ''maître'' could claim any moral rights in the collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
However, in a 22 March 2012 decision the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]] (''Cour de cassation'') reversed the decision of a lower court and stated that "the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives".{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
The owner of the collective work may not be a natural person, so they are not an author in the strict sense, but they own the moral rights as well as the economic rights, and may therefore prohibit violations of their moral rights such as distortion of the collective work.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

Each contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution, and may enforce this right against third parties or against the ''maître'' if they make unauthorized changes to the contribution. 
Despite this, the ''maître'' may modify the contributions as far as is needed to harmonize them with the collective work as a whole.
The moral right of the contributor is limited by the fusion of their contribution with those of the other co-authors.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

==Electronic reproduction==

The rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}
When a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.
Publication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.
Electronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.
However, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

As an example of digital reproduction of the full work, since 2005 the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (BnF) has been digitizing editions of daily and weekly periodicals that were published before 1943. Some of this has been through agreements with the publishers ''L’Ouest-Éclair'' and ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''. 
Where the BnF does not have such an agreement, the BnF considers the newspaper to be a collective work that entered the public domain 70 years after publication.{{sfn|Presse écrite numérisée – BnF}}
Some of these digitized journals may contain contributions for which the individual author's rights have not expired.
Thus the cover of the digitized ''[[:fr:La Baïonnette|La Baïonnette]]'' of 2 December 1915 has an illustration by the artist [[:fr:Albert Jarach|Albert Jarach]], who died in 1962 and whose rights would not expire until 2033.{{sfn|La Baïonnette – BnF}}

France was the first country to introduce an online newspaper, with the [[Minitel]] service in the 1980s.
Today the online and print versions of newspaper are typically run by different departments and have different appearance, with the online versions updated frequently and providing video boxes and  interactive features. Some newspapers are online only.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Print Media versus Electronic Media}}
A case between the French national union of journalists and ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper was heard on 14 April 1999 by the Court of First Instance in Paris.
''Le Figaro'' had created a website where articles by the journalists could be consulted online.
The court ruled that although the printed newspaper was a collective work, the rights of the journalists concerning their articles had been infringed.
''Le Figaro'' only had the right to publish the articles in the printed newspaper, and the website would be considered another newspaper or magazine.{{sfn|Delcros|1999}}

On 9 December 1999 the Lyon Court of Appeal ruled similarly that the daily newspaper ''[[Le Progrès]]'' was guilty of forgery for having published its journalists' articles on the internet.
Although the newspaper was a collective work, the right of the owner to reproduction was limited to the paper edition, and the website could not be seen as an extension of that edition.{{sfn|Blocman|2000}}
A similar judgement was issued by the Court of Cassation  on 3 July 2013 in a case concerning the newspaper ''L'Union''.
The court said that whether or not that newspaper was a collective work, which had not been proven, the consent of a contributor was required before his contributions could be reproduced on an Internet site and reproduced in another newspaper.{{sfn|Audience publique du mercredi 3 juillet 2013}}

Newspapers have responded by signing agreements with journalist's unions that took different approaches to cover online publication of articles.
''Les Derniéres Nouvelles d'Alsace'' paid journalists for online use. 
''[[Le Monde]]'' compensated journalists for ceding their copyright. 
''[[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Échos]]'' made an agreement that treated the print and online versions as one.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}

'''Common-law marriage''', also known as '''''[[sui iuris]]'' marriage''', '''informal marriage''', '''marriage by habit and repute''', or '''marriage in fact''', is a legal framework in a limited number of jurisdictions where a couple is legally considered [[married]], without that couple having formally registered their relation as a [[civil marriage|civil]] or [[religious]] marriage. The original concept of a "common-law marriage" is a marriage that is considered valid by both partners, but has not been formally recorded with a state or religious registry, or celebrated in a formal religious service. In effect, the act of the couple representing themselves to others as being married, and organizing their relation as if they were married, acts as the evidence that they are married.

The term ''common-law marriage'' has wide informal use, often to denote relations that are not legally recognized as common-law marriages. The term ''common-law marriage'' is often used colloquially or by the media to refer to [[cohabiting]] couples, regardless of any legal rights that these couples may or may not have, which can create public confusion both in regard to the term and in regard to the legal rights of unmarried partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn03372|title="Common law marriage" and cohabitation - Commons Library Standard Note|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology, misuse of the term, and public misconceptions==
The term "common-law marriage" is often used incorrectly to describe various types of couple relationships, such as [[cohabitation]] (whether or not registered), or other legally formalized relations. Although these interpersonal relationships are often called "common-law marriage" they differ from ''true'' common-law marriage, in that they are not legally recognized as "marriages", but are a parallel interpersonal status, known in most jurisdictions as "domestic partnership", "registered partnership", "conjugal union", "civil union", etc. In Canada, for instance, while couples in "marriage-like relationships" may have many of the rights and responsibilities of a marriage (laws vary by province), couples in such partnerships are not legally considered married, although they may be legally defined as "unmarried spouses" and for many purposes (such as taxes, financial claims, etc.) they are treated as if they were married.&lt;ref name=clicklaw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.nl.ca/supreme/family/faq.html#Q13|title=Family Law FAQ|publisher=Court.nl.ca|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Following reference is self-published, with advertisement as a goal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonlawrelationships.ca/|title=Home - Common-Law Relationships|publisher=Commonlawrelationships.ca|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In recent years, the term ''common-law marriage'' has gained increased use as a generic term for all unmarried couples – however, this term has a narrow legal meaning. First of all, one can only talk of "common-law marriage" if such marriage was formed in a jurisdiction which actually applies the [[common law]]. A 2008 poll in the UK showed that 51% of respondents incorrectly believed that cohabitants had the same rights as married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=“Common Law Marriage” myth needs addressing, say MPs|url=http://www.resolution.org.uk/news-list.asp?page_id=228&amp;n_id=207|website=Resolution|accessdate=11 September 2017|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-marital relationship contracts are not necessarily recognized from one jurisdiction to another, and neither are ''[[de facto]]'' couples, whereas common-law marriages, being a legal marriage, are valid marriages worldwide (if the parties complied with the requirements to form a valid marriage while living in a jurisdiction that allows this form of marriage to be contracted).

==Essential distinctions from statutory marriage==
{{Disputed|date=November 2012}}
{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}
Common-law and statutory marriage have the following characteristics in common:

# Both parties must freely consent to the marriage
# Both parties must be of legal age to contract a marriage or have parental consent to marry
# Neither party may be under a disability that prevents him or her from entering into a valid marriage – e.g. they must both be of sound mind, neither of them can be currently married, and some jurisdictions do not permit prisoners to marry.

Otherwise, common-law marriage differs from statutory marriage as follows:

# There is no marriage license issued by a government and no marriage certificate filed with a government
# There is no formal ceremony to solemnize the marriage before witnesses
# The parties must hold themselves out to the world as spouses (this is not a requirement of statutory marriage)
# Most jurisdictions require the parties to be cohabiting at the time the common-law marriage is formed. Some require cohabitation to last a certain length of time (e.g. three years) for the marriage to be valid. But cohabitation alone does not create a marriage.  The parties must intend their relationship to be, and to be regarded as, a legally valid marriage.

==History==
In ancient Greek and Roman civilization, marriages were private agreements between individuals and families. Community recognition of a marriage was largely what qualified it as a marriage. The state had only limited interests in assessing the legitimacy of marriages. Normally civil and religious officials took no part in marriage ceremonies, nor did they keep registries. There were several more or less formal ceremonies to choose from (partly interchangeable, but sometimes with different legal ramifications) as well as informal arrangements. It was relatively common for couples to cohabit with no ceremony; cohabiting for a moderate period of time was sufficient to make it a marriage. Cohabiting for the purpose of marriage carried with it no social stigma.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In medieval Europe, marriage came under the jurisdiction of [[canon law]], which recognized as a valid marriage one where the parties stated that they took one another as wife and husband, even in absence of any witnesses.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The [[Catholic Church]] forbade [[Clandestinity (canon law)|clandestine marriage]] at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215), which required all marriages to be announced in a church by a priest. The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) introduced more specific requirements, ruling that in the future a marriage would be valid only if witnessed by the pastor of the parish or the local ordinary (i.e., the bishop of the diocese), or by the delegate of one of said witnesses, the marriage being invalid otherwise, even if witnessed by a Catholic priest. The Tridentine canons did not bind the [[Protestant]]s or the [[Eastern Orthodox]], but clandestine marriage was impossible for the latter, since marriage required the presence of a priest for validity. England abolished clandestine or common-law marriages in the [[Marriage Act 1753]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} requiring marriages to be performed by a priest of the [[Church of England]] unless the participants in the marriage were [[Jew]]s or [[Quaker]]s. The Act applied to [[Wales]]. The Act did not apply to Scotland because by the [[Acts of Union 1707]] Scotland retained its own legal system. To get around the requirements of the Marriage Act, such as minimum age requirements, couples would go to [[Gretna Green]] in southern Scotland, or other border villages such as [[Coldstream]], to get married under Scots law.

Marriages ''per verba de praesenti'', sometimes known as common-law marriages, were an agreement to marry, rather than a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Misunderstood Contract Per Verba De Praesenti|ssrn=1504026|publisher=Rebecca Probert, University of Warwick, School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marriage Act of 1753 also did not apply to Britain's overseas colonies of the time, so common-law marriages continued to be recognized in the future United States and Canada. All other European jurisdictions have long abolished "marriage by habit and repute",{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Scotland]] became the last to do so in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abolition of marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute |url=http://legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/2/section/3 |work=Family Law(Scotland) Act 2006 |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]] |accessdate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101063517/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/2/section/3 |archivedate=1 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Australia===
{{See also|Australian family law}}

In [[Australia]] the term ''[[de facto relationship]]'' is often used to refer to relationships between any two persons who are not married, but are effectively living in certain domestic circumstances. Since March 1, 2009 de facto relationships have been recognized in the Family Law Act (Commonwealth), applicable in states that have referred their jurisdiction on de facto couples to the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. In [[Western Australia]], the only state that has not referred its jurisdiction, state legislation is still valid. There is also no federal recognition of de facto relationships existing outside of Australia (see [[Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution]]), and so this is also a state matter.

The legal term for such relationships varies by state and territory; however, ''common-law marriage'' is not used anywhere in Australia.

Although property aspects of these relationships are dealt with under state law, the law relating to children of such relationships is contained in the federal ''Family Law Act 1975''. Most laws dealing with taxation, social welfare, pensions, etc., treat de facto marriages in the same manner as solemnized marriages.

The Family Law Act states that a de facto relationship can exist between two people of different or the same sex and that a person can be in a de facto relationship even if legally married to another person or in a de facto relationship with someone else. Family property laws, however, are excepted from jurisdiction when a person is both married and in a de facto relationship at the same time. This exception is due to federal polygamy laws. Same-sex de facto relationships have been recognized in New South Wales since 1999. There are a number of methods by which these relationships are recognized in Australian law and they include the same entitlements as ''de jure'' marriage.

The federal ''Marriage Act 1961'' provides for marriage, but does not recognize 'common-law marriages'. Since midnight 9 January, 2018 [[same-sex marriage]] became legally effective throughout Australia.

===Canada===
{{Further information|Common-law relationships in Manitoba|Marriage 'à la façon du pays'}}

Canada does not have true common-law marriage (as in parts of the US), although common-law ''relationships'' are recognized for certain purposes across [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For my spousal sponsorship application, what is a common-law partner?|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=346&amp;top=14|website=Government of Canada|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the legal definition and many implications of marriage-like relationships fall under [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] jurisdiction. The term "common law" appears informally in documents from the federal government.&lt;ref name=CRA/&gt;

[[Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|Citizenship &amp; Immigration Canada]] states that a common-law partner refers to a person who is living in a conjugal relationship with another person (opposite or same sex), and has done so continuously for a period of at least one year.&lt;ref name=CIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship and Immigration Canada|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=346&amp;t=14|publisher=Citizenship and Immigration Canada|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conjugal relationship exists when there is a significant degree of commitment between two people. This can be shown with evidence that the couple share the same home, that they support each other financially and emotionally, that they have children together, or that they present themselves in public as a couple. Common-law partners who are unable to live together or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for reasons beyond their control (for example, civil war or armed conflict) may still qualify and should be included on an application.

[[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) states, as of 2007, a common-law relationship is true if at least one of the following applies:&lt;ref name=CRA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/mrtl/menu-eng.html|title=Marital status|publisher=Cra-arc.gc.ca|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the couple has been living in a [[Marriage|conjugal]] relationship for at least 12 continuous months;
# the couple are parents of a child by birth or adoption; or
# one of the couple has custody and control of the other partner's child (or had custody and control immediately before the child turned 19 years of age) and the child is wholly dependent on that person for support.

The complete [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/prsnl-nf/mrtl-eng.html CRA definitions] for marital status is available.

In many cases, couples in marriage-like relationships have the same rights as married couples under federal law. Various federal laws include "common-law status", which automatically takes effect when two people (of any gender) have lived together in a conjugal relationship for five full years. Common-law partners may be eligible for various federal government spousal benefits. As [[family law]] varies between provinces, there are differences between the provinces regarding the recognition of common-law relationship. No province other than Saskatchewan and British Columbia sanctions married persons to be capable in family law of having more than one recognized partner at the same time.

In 1999, after the court case ''[[M. v. H.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decided that [[same-sex marriage|same-sex partners]] would also be included in common-law relationships. In Saskatchewan, Queen's Bench justices have sanctioned common-law relationships as simultaneously existing in Family law while one or more of the spouses were also civilly married to others.

====Ontario====
In [[Ontario]], the [[Ontario Family Law Act]] specifically recognizes common-law spouses in section 29, dealing with [[alimony|spousal support]] issues; the requirements are living together continuously for no less than three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definitions |url=http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/f-3/20070614/whole.html#BK32 |work=Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 |date=20 July 2009 |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=24 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221143638/http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/f-3/20070614/whole.html#BK32 |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or having a child in common and having "cohabited in a relationship of some permanence". The three years must be continuous, although a breakup of a few days during the period will not affect a person's status as common law.

Married people may also have a recognized common-law spouse even before being divorced from the first spouse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20141118052239/http://canlii.ca/t/fq62d |website=CanLII] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canlii.ca/t/ftj4k |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141118052239/http://canlii.ca/t/ftj4k |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 November 2014 |title=Carrigan v. Carrigan Estate, 2012 ONCA 736 (CanLII) |publisher=Canlii.ca |accessdate=16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, common-law spouses do not have automatic rights under the ''Family Law Act'' to their spouses' property because section 29 of the Act (which extends the definition of spouses beyond those who are married) applies only to the support sections of the Act. Thus, common-law partners do not have a statutory right to divide property in a breakup, and must ask courts to look to concepts such as the constructive or resulting [[Trust law|trust]] to divide property in an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] manner between partners.

Another difference that distinguishes common-law spouses from married partners is that a common-law partner can be [[spousal testimonial privilege|compelled to testify against his or her partner in a court of law]].

====Quebec====
The [[Civil Code of Quebec]] has never recognized a common-law partnership as a form of marriage. However, many laws in Quebec explicitly apply to common-law partners (called ''conjoints de fait'') in "''[[de facto]]'' unions" (marriages being "''[[de jure]]'' unions"), as they do to marriage spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/union-a.htm#free |title=Your rights and freedoms |publisher=Justice.gouv.qc.ca |accessdate=16 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723025230/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/union-a.htm |archivedate=23 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex partners are also recognized as "conjoints de fait" in de facto unions, for the purpose of social benefit laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avocat.qc.ca/public/iiconjointsfait.htm|title=Le Réseau juridique du Québec : L'union de fait, votre couple et la loi|author=Jurismedia inc.|publisher=Avocat.qc.ca|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, common-law partners do not have any legal rights between them, such as [[alimony]], [[family patrimony]], [[compensatory allowance]] and [[matrimonial regime]]. The [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] ruled this restriction to be unconstitutional in 2010; and on January 25, 2013 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that common-law couples do not have the same rights as married couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/01/quebec-common-law-couples-do-not-have-same-rights-as-married-couples.php|title=JURIST -  Canada top court: Quebec common-law couples do not have rights of married couples|publisher=Jurist.org|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 amendment to the Civil Code, recognizes a type of domestic partnership called a [[civil union]] that is similar to marriage and is likewise available to same-sex partners. {{Further information|Civil unions in Quebec}} No citizen of Quebec can be recognized under family law to be in both a civilly married state and a "conjoints de fait" within the same time frame. Divorce from one conjugal relationship must occur before another conjugal relationship may occur in family law.

Same-sex partners can also marry legally in Quebec, as elsewhere in Canada.

====British Columbia====
The term "common-law marriage" does not appear in BC law. A distinction is made between being a ''spouse'' and being ''married''. Married couples include only those who have engaged in a legal marriage ceremony and have received a marriage licence. ''Spouses'' include married couples as well as those, of same or opposite gender, who satisfy criteria for being in a ''marriage-like relationship'' for a time period that depends on the law that is being considered. Hence the meaning of the term ''unmarried spouse'' in BC depends on the legal context. The criteria for a relationship being accepted as ''marriage-like'' include cohabitation for at least the specified period, unbroken by excessively long intervals that are unexplained by exigent circumstances. If dispute arises about whether the relationship was ''marriage-like'', a court would consider a comprehensive set of further criteria including the domestic and financial arrangements, degree and nature of intimacy, and the sense of the relationship presented to friends and families (especially by each spouse to his/her own family). "Mere roommates will never qualify as unmarried spouses. There needs to be some other dimension to the relationship indicative of a commitment between the parties and their shared belief that they are in a special relationship with each other."&lt;ref name=clicklaw/&gt; The criteria do not exclude the existence of a previous marriage to a third person during the period of the ''marriage-like relationship'' of the unmarried spouses. Hence a person may have more than one spouse at the same time.&lt;ref name=clicklaw&gt;{{cite web| title=Unmarried Spouses| url=http://wiki.clicklaw.bc.ca/index.php/Unmarried_Spouses| work=| date=24 October 2014 | publisher=JP Boyd on Family Law| accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSS&gt;{{cite web| title=Thinking about moving in together? Think about this...| url=http://www.familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/thinkingAboutMovingInTogether.php| work=| date=2015 | publisher=Legal Services Society, BC, Canada| accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of becoming an unmarried spouse include:

* ''Child support''.  A spouse is responsible for contributing towards support of a child and possibly the other spouse if he/she is a biological or adoptive parent, or has contributed to support of the child for at least one year during the "marriage-like relationship" with the child's parent and the parent applies to the court for continuing support after separation and within one year of the last support contribution. (The contribution towards child support expected from a non-parent is not as great as from a parent.)  
* ''Financial support and division of property and debts after separation''.  If the "marriage-like relationship" has continued for two years, the laws that apply upon separation are the same as those that apply to married couples, according to the "Estate Administration Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/36th3rd/3rd_read/gov100-3.htm|title=BILL 100 — 1999 : DEFINITION OF SPOUSE AMENDMENT ACT, 1999|publisher=Government of British Columbia|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All property and debts acquired prior to the relationship are exempt. If no agreement between the partners about property and/or debts is written during or after the relationship, then the law specifies equal sharing of all acquired during the relationship, as well as any changes in the value of those brought into the relationship. (There is an exemption from equal sharing for certain categories, such as gifts and inheritances received by one spouse.) The degree of participation &lt;!-- or even knowledge and consent? --&gt; of each spouse in the acquisition of property or debt does not affect the sharing. Financial support may also be requested from the former spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/Vancouver/BCs_new_law_erases_line_between_marriage_and_commonlaw-13162.aspx |title=BC's new law erases line between marriage and common-law |author=Niko Bell |publisher=Xtra.ca |accessdate=16 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616165141/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Vancouver/BCs_new_law_erases_line_between_marriage_and_commonlaw-13162.aspx |archivedate=16 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A claim for financial support or the division of property and debt must be made within two years of the date of separation.
* ''Inheritance''. A spouse is eligible for inheritance if the "marriage-like relationship" has existed for at least two years immediately prior to the death of the other spouse. All property and debts held in common are fully inherited automatically by the surviving spouse.  Those brought into the relationship are subject to any existing valid will, which may be vulnerable to challenge if it does not provide for the surviving spouse and any children.
* ''Benefits from government programs''. Access to benefits from government programs or policies can become more (or less) available upon becoming an unmarried spouse. In general, these become similar or identical to those of married couples, but the criteria for qualifying as ''unmarried spouses'', such as longevity of the relationship, differ for the various programs. Social assistance is often immediately reduced when there is perceived to be a "spouse in the house", regardless of the nature of the relationship.&lt;ref name=clicklaw/&gt;

====Other provinces====
The requirements in some other provinces are as follows:

* In [[Nova Scotia]], a couple must cohabit for two years in a marriage-like relationship, and may not have been married to another person during this time.
* In [[New Brunswick]], a couple must live together for three years or have a natural or adopted child together. They cannot have been married to another person during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/sponsor/familymembers.html#common]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118040836/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/sponsor/familymembers.html#common|date=November 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Alberta]], common-law relationships have been subsumed since 2003 under the terms of the [[Adult interdependent relationship in Alberta|Adult Interdependent Relationship Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/sa-2002-c-a-4.5/latest/sa-2002-c-a-4.5.html |title=Adult Interdependent Relationships Act, SA 2002, c A-4.5 |publisher=Canlii.org |accessdate=16 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017044950/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/sa-2002-c-a-4.5/latest/sa-2002-c-a-4.5.html |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may additionally apply to any two unrelated people living together in a mutually dependent relationship for three years. Only one interdependent relationship is allowed at a time. In the event either of the common-law spouses are married to other persons during this time, neither of the common-law couple can begin to be "interdependent" until divorce from other spouses occurs.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], courts and a few statutes (such as social security which grants death and disability benefits) have recognized an institute of ''yeduim batsibur'' ([[:he:ידוע בציבור|{{Hebrew|ידועים בציבור}}]]) meaning a couple who are "known in the public" (lit. translation) as living together as husband and wife. Generally speaking the couple needs to satisfy two tests which are: 1) "intimate life similar to married couple, relationship based on same emotions of affection and love, dedication and faithfulness, showing they have chosen to share their fate" ([[Supreme Court of Israel]], judge [[:he:צבי ברנזון|{{Hebrew|צבי ברנזון}}]]  (intimacy test)), and 2) sharing household (economic test). In addition courts usually are more likely to recognize such relationship as marriage for granting benefits if the couple could not get married under the Israeli law.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew|ע"א 621/69 קרול נסיס נגד קוינה יוסטר, פד"י כד(1) עמ' 617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] does not recognize common-law marriage, but the [[Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010]] gives some rights to unmarried cohabitants.

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] a couple can sign a [[samenlevingscontract]] (cohabitation agreement). This is also commonly done by couples who don't want to get married legally.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Cohabitation in the United Kingdom}}

====England and Wales====
The term "common-law marriage" has been used in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to refer to unmarried, cohabiting [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships.&lt;ref name="Probert, R. p.1"&gt;Probert, R., ''Common-Law Marriage: Myths and Misunderstandings'', Child &amp; Family Law Quarterly vol.20 issue 1 p.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is merely a social usage. The term does not confer on cohabiting parties any of the rights or obligations enjoyed by spouses or [[civil partnership|civil partners]]. Unmarried partners are recognised for certain purposes in legislation: e.g., for means-tested benefits. For example, in the [[Jobseeker's Allowance|Jobseekers Act 1995]], "unmarried couple" was defined as a man and woman who are not married to each other but who are living together in the same household as husband and wife other than in prescribed circumstances. But in many areas of the law cohabitants enjoy no special rights. Thus when a cohabiting relationship ends ownership of any assets will be decided by [[property law]]. The courts have no discretion to reallocate assets, as occurs on [[divorce]].

It is sometimes mistakenly claimed&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, A., Duncan, S., James, G., and Park, A., (2005) ''Cohabitation, Marriage and the Law: Social Change and Legal Reform in the 21st Century'' (Oxford, Hart), p.53&lt;/ref&gt; that before the [[Marriage Act 1753]] cohabiting couples would enjoy the protection of a "common-law marriage". In fact, neither the name nor the concept of "common-law marriage" was known at this time.&lt;ref name="Probert, R. p.1"/&gt; Far from being treated as if they were married, couples known to be cohabiting risked prosecution by the [[church courts]] for [[fornication]].&lt;ref&gt;Probert, R. (2012) The Legal Regulation of Cohabitation, 1600–2012: From Fornicators to Family (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is equally mistakenly claimed that couples who lived together without undergoing a marriage ceremony before the [[Marriage Act 1753]] would be presumed to have undertaken a "contract marriage" by mutual consent{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. However, contract marriages (or more strictly contracts ''per verba de praesenti''), were not understood as having the legal status of a valid marriage until the decision in ''Dalrymple'' in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Dalrymple v Dalrymple|link=|reporter=ER|year=1811|num=463|volume=161|firstpage=665|parallelcite=2 Hag Con 54|date=16 July 1811|courtname=[[Consistory court|Consistory Court]], [[Doctors' Commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision affected the subsequent development of English law due to the fact that the Marriage Act 1753 did not apply overseas. English courts later held that it was possible to marry by a simple exchange of consent in the [[British Empire|colonies]] although most of the disputed ceremonies involved the ministrations of a priest or other clergyman.

The English courts also upheld marriages by consent in territories not under British control but only if it had been impossible for the parties to marry according to the requirements of the local law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the case of ''Phillips v Phillips'' (1921) 38 TLR 150&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a spate of cases arising out of the [[Second World War]], with marriages in [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s in [[Germans|German]]-occupied [[Europe]] posing a particular problem for judges.&lt;ref name="Probert, R. p.1"/&gt; (Some British civilians interned by the [[Japan]]ese during the Second World War were held to be legally married after contracting marriages under circumstances where the formal requirements could not be met.) To this limited extent, English law does recognise what has become known as a "common-law marriage". English legal texts initially used the term to refer exclusively to ''American'' common-law marriages.&lt;ref name="Probert, R. p.1"/&gt; Only in the 1960s did the term "common-law marriage" begin to be used in its contemporary sense to denote unmarried, cohabiting heterosexual relationships&lt;ref name="Probert, R. p.1"/&gt; and not until the 1970s and 1980s did the term begin to lose its negative connotations.&lt;ref name="Probert, R. p.1"/&gt; The use of the term is likely to have encouraged cohabiting couples to believe falsely that they enjoyed legal rights. By the end of the 1970s a myth had emerged that marrying made little difference to one’s legal rights, and this fuelled the subsequent increase in the number of couples living together and having children together outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Probert, R. (2012) The Legal Regulation of Cohabitation, 1600–2012: From Fornicators to Family (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), chs. 7 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
{{Main article|Marriage in Scotland}}

Under [[Scots law]], there have been several forms of "irregular marriage", among them:

# Irregular marriage by declaration de presenti—declaring in the presence of two witnesses that one takes someone as one's wife or husband.
# Irregular marriage conditional on consummation.
# Marriage contracted by correspondence.
# Irregular marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute.

The Marriage (Scotland) Act 1939 provided that the first three forms of irregular marriage could not be formed on or after 1 January 1940. However, any irregular marriages contracted prior to 1940 can still be upheld. This act also allowed the creation of regular civil marriages in Scotland for the first time. (The civil-registration system started in Scotland on 1 January 1855.)

Until this act, the only regular marriage available in Scotland was a religious marriage. Irregular marriages were not socially accepted and many people who decided to contract them did so where they were relatively unknown. In some years up to 60% of the marriages in the Blythswood Registration District of Glasgow were "irregular".

In 2006, "marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute", the last form of irregular marriage that could still be contracted in Scotland, was abolished in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006. Until that act had come into force, Scotland remained the only European jurisdiction never to have totally abolished the old-style common-law marriage. For this law to apply, the minimum time the couple have lived together continuously had to exceed 20 days.

As in the American jurisdictions that have preserved it, this type of marriage can be difficult to prove. It is not enough for the couple to have lived together for several years, but they must have been generally regarded as husband and wife. Their friends and neighbors, for example, must have known them as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so (or at least they must have held themselves out to their neighbors and friends as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so). Also, like American common-law marriages, it is a form of lawful marriage, so that people cannot be common-law spouses, or husband and wife by cohabitation with habit and repute, if one of them was legally married to somebody else when the relationship began.

It is a testament to the influence of American legal thought and English colloquial usage that, in a study conducted by the [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]] in 2000, 57% of Scots surveyed believed that couples who merely live together have a "common-law marriage". In fact, that term is unknown in Scots law, which uses "marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute". "Common-law marriage" is an American term.

Otherwise, men and women who otherwise behave as husband and wife do ''not'' have a common-law marriage or a marriage by habit and repute merely because they set up housekeeping together, but they ''must'' hold themselves out to the world as husband and wife. (In many jurisdictions, they must do so for a certain length of time for the marriage to be valid.) The Scottish Survey is not clear on these points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/lsf43-00.asp|title=Family Formation and Dissolution: Trends and Attitudes Among the Scottish Population - Research Findings|publisher=Scotland.gov.uk|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It notes that "common-law marriage" is not part of Scots law, but it fails to note that "marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute", which is the same thing but in name, ''was'' part of Scots law until 2006.

===United States===
{{Main article|Common-law marriage in the United States}}

[[Common-law marriage in the United States|In the United States]], common-law marriage can be contracted in eight states and the [[District of Columbia]]. Once they meet the requirements of common-law marriage, couples in those true common-law marriages are considered legally married for all purposes and in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Common Law Marriage|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family_law/common_law.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 September 2017|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common-law marriage can still be contracted in [[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marriage Laws of the Fifty States, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/table_marriage |work=[[Wex]]|publisher=[[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gore|first1=Leada|title=Common law marriage in Alabama ending Jan. 1, 2017|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/common_law_marriage_in_alabama_1.html|accessdate=11 September 2017|agency=Al.com|publisher=Alabama Media Group|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common law marriage may also be valid under [[military law]] for purposes of a bigamy prosecution under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=United States v. Juillerat, ACM 206-06 (A.F.C.C.A. 2016)|url=http://afcca.law.af.mil/content/afcca_opinions/cp/juillerat-2016-03.u.pdf|website=Court of Criminal Appeals|publisher=United States Airforce|accessdate=11 September 2017}} (A ceremonial marriage had been declared invalid by the state because it was not filed as required by law, but the marriage was treated as valid under military law such that the servicemember was convicted of bigamy.)&lt;/ref&gt;

All U.S. jurisdictions recognize common-law marriages that were validly contracted in the originating jurisdiction, because they are valid marriages in the jurisdiction where they were contracted. see: [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]]. However, absent legal registration or similar notice of the marriage, the parties to a common law marriage or their eventual heirs may have difficulty proving their relationship to be marriage. Some states provide for registration of an informal or common-law marriage based on the declaration of each of the spouses on a state-issued form.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Declaration and Registration of Informal Marriage|url=https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vs/field/docs/vs1801-(3)-fillable.pdf|website=Texas Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English-speaking Caribbean===
Due to their colonial past, the islands of the [[English-speaking Caribbean]] have statutes concerning common-law marriage similar to those in England. However, in the Caribbean, the term "common-law" marriage is also widely described, by custom as much as by law, to any long term relationship between male and female partners. Such unions are widespread, making up a significant percentage of the families many of which have children and may last for many years. The reasons for people choosing common-law arrangements is debated in sociological literature. Although the acceptance of this type of union varies, men being more inclined to consider them as legitimate than women, they have become an institution.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman Rodman, "Illegitimacy in the Caribbean Social Structure:  A Reconsideration",  ''American Sociological Review'' 31 (1966):  673–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Schlesinger, "Family Patterns in the English-Speaking Caribbean", ''Journal of Marriage and Family'' 30 (1968):  49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''death squad''' is an armed group that conducts [[extrajudicial killing]]s or [[forced disappearance]]s of persons for the purposes such as [[political repression]], [[assassination]]s, [[torture]], [[genocide]], [[ethnic cleansing]], or [[revolutionary terror]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--A definition should be sourced.--&gt; These killings are often conducted in ways meant to ensure the secrecy of the killers' identities. Death squads may have the support of domestic or foreign governments (see [[state terrorism]]). They may comprise a [[secret police]] force, [[paramilitary]] [[militia]] groups, government soldiers, policemen, or combinations thereof. They may also be organized as [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]]. When death squads are not controlled by the state, they may consist of insurgent forces or [[organized crime]], such as the ones used by [[Mexican cartel]]s.

''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' were paramilitary death squads created by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Holocaust]]. These groups were mainly made up of police officers who killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nazi-hunters-identify-living-members-of-death-squads-9768317.html|title=Nazi hunters identify living members of death squads|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although the term "death squad" did not rise to notoriety until the activities of such groups became widely known in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] during the 1970s and 80s, death squads have been employed under different guises throughout history. Apparently, the term was first used by the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] in [[Romania]]. It officially installed Iron guard death squads in 1936 in order to kill political enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Laignel-Lavastine, Alexandra. Cioran, Eliade, Ionesco. L'oubli du fascisme. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 2002, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used during the [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] by [[Paul Aussaresses]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview of [[Paul Aussaresses]] by [[Marie-Monique Robin]] in ''Escadrons de la mort – l'école française'' ([http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/2926696/ See here, starting at 8min38])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold War usage ===

In [[Latin America]], death squads first appeared in [[Brazil]] where a group called ''Esquadrão da Morte'' (literally "Death Squad") emerged in the 1960s; they subsequently spread to [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] in the 1970s, and they were later used in Central America during the 1980s. Argentina used extrajudicial killings as way of crushing the liberal and communist opposition to the [[military junta]] during the '[[Dirty War]]' of the 1970s. For example, [[Alianza Anticomunista Argentina]] was a far-right death squad mainly active during the "Dirty War". The Chilean military regime of 1973–1990 also committed such killings. See [[Operation Condor]] for examples.

During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety on March 24, 1980, when a [[sniper]] assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] as he said [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] inside a convent chapel. In December 1980, three American nuns, [[Ita Ford]], [[Dorothy Kazel]], and [[Maura Clarke]], and a lay worker, [[Jean Donovan]], were [[gang rape]]d and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of real and suspected Communists. Priests who were spreading [[liberation theology]], such as Father [[Rutilio Grande]], were often targeted as well. The murderers were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and [[military advisors]] during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration. These events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid at the end of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onas, "U.S. Suspends New Aid to El Salvador until Deaths Are Clarified," ''New York Times,'' Dec. 6 1980, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Death Squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was the army unit [[Battalion 316]]. Hundreds of people, teachers, politicians, and union bosses were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html |title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=11 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southeast Asia]], extrajudicial killings were conducted by both sides during the [[Vietnam War]]. For example, [[Viet Cong]] member [[Nguyễn Văn Lém]], famous for being extrajudicially executed on camera by General [[Nguyễn Ngọc Loan]] on 1 February 1968 in Saigon, was himself later claimed to have commanded a death squad{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} targeting South Vietnamese policemen and their families during the [[Tet Offensive]] in [[Saigon]].&lt;!--For it to qualify as a death squad, extrajudicial killing of civilians as opposed to combat would need to be its *primary* function, not just something that has occurred. That claim would need to be sourced.--&gt;

{{As of|2010}}, death squads have continued to be active in several locations, including [[Chechnya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6168959.ece|title=Russian death squads 'pulverise' Chechens |location=London |work=The Times  | first=Mark | last=Franchetti | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Colombia, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Philippines among others.

==== Kenya ====
In December 2014, Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confessed to Al-Jazeera that they were responsible for almost 500 of the [[extrajudicial killing]]s. The murders reportedly totaled several hundred homicides every year. They included the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed "Makaburi", an Al-Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicated that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consisted of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] and the National Security Council of Kenya members denied operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggested that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They asserted that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicated that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the [[International Bar Association]], Mark Ellis, cautioned that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law. The United Kingdom and Israel denied participation in the Kenyan National Security Council's reported death squads, with the UK Foreign Office indicating that it had approached the Kenyan authorities over the charges.&lt;ref name="Kctpctejk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan counter-terrorism police confess to extra judicial killings|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/585087/1/kenyan-counter-terrorism-police.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|agency=Al Jazeera Africa|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Africa ====
Beginning in the 1960s, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and its ally, the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan-Africanist Congress]] (PAC), began a campaign to topple South Africa's [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP)-controlled [[apartheid]] Government. Both the ANC's armed wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), and South African security forces routinely engaged in bombings and targeted killings, both at home and abroad. Particularly notorious apartheid death squads were the [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] (CCB) and the [[South African Police]]'s counter-insurgency unit C10, commanded by Colonel [[Eugene de Kock]] and based at the [[Vlakplaas]] farm west of [[Pretoria]].

After the end of Apartheid, death squad violence conducted by both the National Party and the ANC was investigated by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].

In a way similar to the [[American Indian Wars]], the early Mexican nation struggled against Apache raids. Between 1835 and 1837, only 15 years after the Mexican independence and at the midst of the Texan Revolution, the local governments of the Mexican states of [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] (that border with the U.S. states of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona ) put a bounty on the [[Apache]] bands that scourged the area. In the case of Chihuahua the bounty atracted "bounty hunters" from the United States, that were often Anglo Americans, runaway slaves and even from other indian tribes, it was payed based on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James L. |last=Haley |authorlink=James L.

* '''After the Mexican Revolution'''
For more than seven decades following the [[Mexican Revolution]], the Mexican State was a [[One-party state]] ruled by the ''[[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]]'' (PRI). During this era, death squad tactics were routinely used against suspected enemies of the state.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the PRI's founder, President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], used death squads against Mexico's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] majority. Calles explained his reasons in a private telegram to the Mexican Ambassador to the [[French Third Republic]], [[Alberto José Pani Arteaga]]. ''"...Catholic Church in Mexico is a political movement, and must be eliminated  ... free of religious hypnotism which fools the people... within one year without the sacraments, the people will forget the faith..."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Meyer]], PhD ''La Cristiada: The Mexican People's War for Religious Liberty'', {{ISBN|978-0-7570-0315-8}}. SquareOne Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calles and his adherents used the [[Mexican Army]] and police, as well as paramilitary forces like the [[Red Shirts (Mexico)|Red Shirts]], to abduct, torture, and execute priests, nuns, and actively religious laity. Mexican Catholics were also routinely hanged from telegraph poles along the railroad lines. Prominent victims of the Mexican State's campaign against Catholicism include the teenager [[Jose Sanchez del Rio]], the [[Jesuit]] priest Father [[Miguel Pro]], and the [[Christian Pacifist]] [[Anacleto González Flores]]. (see also [[Saints of the Cristero War]]).

In response, an armed revolt against the Mexican State, the [[Cristero War]], began in 1927. Composed largely of peasant volunteers and commanded by retired General [[Enrique Gorostieta Velarde]], the Cristeros were also responsible for atrocities. Among them were the assassination of former Mexican President [[Álvaro Obregón]], train robberies, and violent attacks against rural teachers. The uprising largely ended after the [[Holy See]] and the Mexican State negotiated a compromise agreement. Refusing to lay down his arms despite offers of [[amnesty]], General Gorostieta was [[killed in action]] by the Mexican Army in [[Jalisco]] on 2 June 1929. Following the cessation of hostilities, more than 5,000 Cristeros were summarily executed by Mexican security forces. The events of the Cristero War are depicted in the 2012 film ''[[For Greater Glory]]''.

* '''During the cold war'''
During the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, death squads continued to be used against anti-PRI activists, both Marxists and social conservatives. One example of this is the 1968 [[Tlatelolco massacre]], in which an anti-regime protest rally was attacked by security forces in [[Mexico City]]. After this event paramilitary groups like "Los Halcones" (The hawks) and the "Brigada blanca" (White brigade) were used to attack, hunt and exterminate political dissidents.

Allegations have been made by both journalists and American law enforcement of collusion between senior PRI statesmen and the Mexican [[drug cartel]]s. It has even been alleged that, under PRI rule, no drug traffickers were ever successful without the permission of the Mexican State. If the same drug trafficker fell from favor, however, Mexican law enforcement would be ordered to move against their operation, as happened to [[Pablo Acosta Villarreal]] in 1987.

* '''Regime change and "Drug war tactics"'''
By the early 1990s, the PRI started to lose the grip on its absolute political power, however its corruption became so pervasive that [[Juarez Cartel]] boss [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]] was even able to purchase a window in Mexico's air defense system. During this period, his airplanes were permitted to smuggle narcotics into the United States without the interference of the [[Mexican Air Force]]. As a result, Carillo Fuentes became known as "The Lord of the Skies."

It is believed by American and Mexican investigators that the PRI would also use the cartels to commit assassinations which were too sensitive to be traced back to the ruling party. One murder believed to be an example of this is the 1993 murder of Cardinal [[Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo]].

The PRI also used death squad tactics against the Zapatista guerilla movement. In 1997, [[Acteal massacre|forty-five people were killed]] by a Mexican security forces in Chenalho, [[Chiapas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epw.in/journal/1998/1-2/commentary/mexico-massacre-chenalho-erasing-chiapas-uprising.html|title=MEXICO-Massacre at Chenalho Erasing Chiapas Uprising|website=Economic and Political Weekly|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/604071.stm|title=Chiapas massacre convictions overturned|date=2000-01-14|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, however, during an internal power struggle between former President Salinas and President Zedillo, the PRI was peacefully voted out from power, until 2013  when they partially regained their influence and power, only to lose again in 2018.
It is also alleged that, during the time they first lost the presidency, some of the most powerful PRI members were supporting and protecting drug cartels that they used as death squads against their criminal and political rivals, being this one of the real reasons the PAN party government accepted to start the Mexican drug war against the Cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmanana.com/diario/noticia/nacional/noticias/elchapometiomuchodineroalacampanadepenanietoagentedeladea/2391737|title=El Chapo metió mucho dinero a la campaña de Peña Nieto: agente de la DEA|work=elmanana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Diariocambio.com/mx|title=EPN y PRI pactaron la liberación de Caro Quintero: ex agente de la DEA|date=February 26, 2014|url=http://www.diariocambio.com.mx/2014/nacional/item/49167-epn-y-pri-pactaron-la-liberacion-de-caro-quintero-ex-agente-de-la-dea}}&lt;/ref&gt; How ever, it is also alleged that during this period of time the turmoil of war has been used by the parties in power to exterminate even more political dissidents, activists and their own rivals. An example of this is the case of the 2014 forced disappearence and [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping|assasination of 43 activist rural students from the Ayotzinapa]] Teachers' College, in the hands of police officers colluded with the "Guerreros Unidos" drug cartel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-43422705&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2015/09/caso-ayotzinapa-fue-el-estado-dice-morena-y-prd-de-guerrero-completa-el-pri/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/269157-dea-oculto-mexico-ayotzinapa-iguala&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/1204/mexico/mensajes-entre-guerreros-unidos-muestran-debilidad-de-verdad-historica-del-caso-ayotzinapa-centro-pro/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
During the [[California Gold Rush]], the state government between 1850 and 1859 financed and organized militia units to [[California Gold Rush#Impact on Native Americans|hunt down and kill Native Americans]] in the state. Between 1850 and 1852 the state appropriated almost one million dollars for the activities of these militias, and between 1854 and 1859 the state appropriated another $500,000, almost half of which was reimbursed by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html|title=Militia and Indians|work=militarymuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These death squads were part of the reduction of the indigenous population of California from 150,000 in 1848 to just 15,000 in 1900. Some scholars contend that the state financing of these militias, as well as the US government's role in other massacres in California, such as the [[Bloody Island Massacre|Bloody Island]] and [[Yontoket Massacre]]s, in which up to 400 or more natives were killed in each massacre, constitutes acts of genocide against the native people of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|editor1=Joel R.

[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|Quantrill's 1863 raid burned the town of [[Lawrence Massacre|Lawrence]] and killed 164 defenders]]
Beginning in the 1850s, pro-slavery [[Bushwhacker]]s and anti-slavery [[Jayhawker]]s waged war against each other in the [[Kansas Territory]]. Due to the horrific atrocities committed by both sides against civilians, the territory was dubbed "[[Bleeding Kansas]]". After the [[American Civil War]] began, the fraternal bloodshed increased.

The most infamous atrocity in Kansas during the American Civil War is the [[Lawrence Massacre]]. A large force group of Bushwhackers led by [[William Clarke Quantrill]] and [[Bloody Bill Anderson]] attacked and burned down the pro-Union town of [[Lawrence, Kansas]] in retaliation for the Jayhawkers' earlier destruction of [[Osceola, Missouri]]. The Bushwhackers shot down nearly 150 unarmed men and boys.

During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], embittered Confederate veterans supported the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and similar [[vigilante]] organizations throughout the American South. The Klan and its counterparts threatened and even [[lynching|lynched]] African-Americans, northern [[carpetbagger]]s, and Southern "[[scalawag]]s". This was often with the unofficial support of the Democratic Party leadership. Historian Bruce B. Campbell has called the KKK, "one of the first proto-death squads". Campbell alleges that the difference between it and modern death-squads is that the Ku Klux Klan was composed of members of a defeated regime rather than the ruling governmental. "Otherwise, in its murderous intent, links to private elite interests, and covert nature, it very closely resembles modern death squads."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur D. Brenner and Bruce B. Campbell, Eds. "Death Squads in Global Perspective: Murder With Deniability," New York: St. Martin's Press (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in the American South and gave the [[United States Army]] power to break up the Klan. Some Klansmen were tried before military tribunals and hanged.

In 1915, [[D.W. Griffith]]'s film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' romanticized the KKK and led directly to its re-emergence at a conference at [[Stone Mountain]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The Klan soon had ''klaverns'' not only in the South, but also in the Midwestern states of [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]].

Unlike its counterpart, the re-constituted KKK opposed not only non-whites, but also Jews and Roman Catholics. Among its most famous victims are Father [[James Coyle]], [[Medgar Evers]], [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]]. (see also [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]]).

During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads (known in Spanish by the name of Escuadrón de la Muerte, "Squadron of Death") achieved notoriety when a [[sniper]] assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] while he was saying [[Mass (Roman Rite)|Mass]] in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|three American nuns and a lay worker]] were [[gangrape]]d and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing thousands of peasants and activists. Funding for the squads came primarily from right-wing Salvadoran businessmen and landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, Raymond, Weakness and Deceit:: U.S. Policy and El Salvador, New York Times Books, 1984, p.330&lt;/ref&gt; Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military security forces, which were receiving U.S. arms, funding, training and advice during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] administrations, these events prompted some outrage in the U.S. Human rights activists criticized U.S. administrations for denying Salvadoran government links to the death squads. Veteran Human Rights Watch researcher Cynthia J. Arnson writes that "particularly during the years 1980–1983 when the killing was at its height (numbers of killings could reach as far as 35,000), assigning responsibility for the violence and human rights abuses was a product of the intense ideological polarization in the United States. The Reagan administration downplayed the scale of abuse as well as the involvement of state actors. Because of the level of denial, as well as the extent of U.S. involvement with the Salvadoran military and security forces, the U.S. role in El Salvador- what was known about death squads, when it was known, and what actions the United States did or did not take to curb their abuses- became an important part of El Salvador's death squad story.".&lt;ref&gt;Arnson, Cynthia J. "Window on the Past: A Declassified History of Death Squads in El Salvador" in ''Death Squads in Global Perspective: Murder with Deniability'', Campbell and Brenner, eds, 88&lt;/ref&gt; Some death squads, such as [[Sombra Negra]], are still operating in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://banderasnews.com/0709/nw-manoblanco.htm |title=El Salvador Death Squads Still Operating |publisher=Banderasnews.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Guatemala ====
Throughout the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], both military and "civilian" governments utilized death squads as a counterinsurgency strategy. The use of "death squads" as a government tactic became particularly widespread after 1966. Throughout 1966 and the first three months of 1967, within the framework of what military commentators referred to as "el-contra terror", government forces killed an estimated 8,000 civilians accused of "subversive" activity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael MeClintock, The American Connection, vol. 2, State Terror and Popular Resistance in Guatemala (London: Zed, 1985), pp. 84—85.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a turning point in the history of the Guatemalan security apparatus, and brought about a new era in which mass murder of both real and suspected subversives by government "death squads" became a common occurrence in the country. A noted Guatemalan sociologist estimated the number of government killings between 1966 and 1974 at approximately 5,250 a year (for a total death toll of approximately 42,000 during the presidencies of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] and [[Carlos Arana Osorio]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Aguilera Peralta, "The Militarization of the State", in Guatemala in Rebellion: Unfinished History&lt;/ref&gt; Killings by both official and unofficial security forces would climax in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the presidencies of [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García]] and [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], with over 18,000 documented killings in 1982 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ciidh/qr/english/chap4.html |title=Chapter 4: The 1980s |publisher=Shr.aaas.org |date=31 January 1980 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Grandin claims that "Washington, of course, publicly denied its support for paramilitarism, but the practice of political disappearances took a great leap forward in Guatemala in 1966 with the birth of a death squad created, and directly supervised, by U.S. security advisors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/12/14/unholy_trinity/index1.html |title=America's trinity of terrorism |first=Greg |last=Grandin |work=salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013172719/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/12/14/unholy_trinity/index1.html |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An upsurge in rebel activity in Guatemala convinced the US to provide increased counterinsurgency assistance to Guatemala's security apparatus in the mid to late 1960s. Documents released in 1999 details how United States military and police advisers had encouraged and assisted Guatemalan military officials in the use of repressive techniques, including helping establish a "safe house" from within the presidential palace as a location to coordinate counter insugency activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB11/docs/|title=U.S. POLICY IN GUATEMALA, 1966-1996|work=gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, it was reported by Amnesty International that this same "safe house" was in use by Guatemalan security officials to coordinate counterinsurgency activities involving the use of the "death squads."&lt;ref&gt;AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, 1981, Guatemala: A Government Program of Political Murder, in: The New York Review of Books, 19 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a victim's brother, Mirtala Linares "He wouldn't tell us anything; he claimed they hadn't captured [Sergio], that he knew nothing of his whereabouts – and that maybe my brother had gone as an illegal alien to the United States! That was how he answered us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Nate|title=Astonishing Discovery of Remains of Guatemalan Death Squad Diary Victims|url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2011/12/04/astonishing-discovery-of-remains-of-guatemalan-death-squad-diary-victims/|publisher=NSA Archive|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nicaragua ====
Throughout the Ortega regime, starting in 2006, but escalating with the [[2018 Nicaraguan protests]], the dictatorship has employed death squads also known as "Turbas" or para military groups armed and aided by the National Police to kill over 300 unarmed protesters including infants, and people burned alive, as well as "disappear" hundreds more to unknown locations and fate. These actions have been roundly condemned by the international community, the Organization of American States, Human Rights Watch, and the local and international Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/facing-down-the-death-squads-of-nicaragua-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.mercopress.com/2018/06/20/ortega-s-paramilitary-groups-on-shooting-spree-against-protestors-church-dialogue-backed-talks-collapse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/22/oas-condemn-egregious-abuses-nicaragua&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Argentina ====
Amnesty International reports that "the security forces in Argentina first started using "death squads" in late 1973. One example was [[Alianza Anticomunista Argentina]], a far-right death squad mainly active during the "[[Dirty War]]". By the time military rule ended in 1983 some 1,500 people had been killed directly by "death squads", and over 9,000 named people and many more undocumented victims had been "disappeared"—kidnapped and murdered secretly—according to the officially appointed National Commission on Disappeared People (CONADEP).&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Amnesty International – Getting Away With Murder: Political Killings and Disappearances in the 1990s, 1993,36&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
The ''Esquadrão da Morte'' ("Death Squad" in Portuguese) was a paramilitary organization that emerged in the late 1960s in the context of the [[Military dictatorship (Brazil)|Brazilian Military Dictatorship]]. It was the first group to have received the name "Death Squad" in Latin America, but its actions resembled traditional vigilantism as most executions were not exclusively political-related. The greater share of the political executions during the 21 years of Military Dictatorship (1964–1985) were done by the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]] itself. The purpose of the original "Death Squad" was, with the consent of the military government, to persecute, torture and kill suspected criminals (''marginais'') regarded as dangerous to society. It began in the former [[Guanabara State|State of Guanabara]] led by Detective Mariel Mariscot, one of the "Twelve Golden Men of Rio de Janeiro's Police", and from there it spread throughout Brazil in the 1970s. In general, its members were politicians, members of the judiciary, and police officials. As a rule, these groups were financed by members of the business community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qSzkF0bosWQC ''Sociedade, cultura e política: ensaios críticos'']. Ana Amélia da Silva, Miguel Wady Chaia, Carmen Junqueira – 2004 – p. 625&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, several other organizations were modeled after the 1960s ''Esquadrão da Morte.'' The most famous such organization is ''Scuderie Detetive Le Cocq'' (English: ''Shield of Detective Le Cocq''), named after deceased Detective Milton Le Cocq. The group was particularly active in the Brazilian Southeastern States of Guanabara and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], and remains active in the state of [[Espírito Santo]]. In the State of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Death Squads and individual gunmen called "justiceiros" were pervasive and executions almost were exclusively the work of off-duty policemen. In 1983, a police officer nicknamed "Cabo Bruno" was convicted for murdering more than 50 victims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp3pXKrcDqAC&amp;lpg=PA211 Vigilantism and the state in modern Latin America: essays on extralegal violence] Martha Knisely Huggins (ed.) – 1991 – p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Death Squads" active under the rule of the military dictatorship continue as a cultural legacy of the Brazilian police. In the 2000s, police officers remain linked with death-squad-type executions. In 2003, roughly 2,000 extrajudicial murders occurred in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with Amnesty International claiming the numbers are likely far higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4463010.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Brazilian police 'execute thousands' | date=23 November 2005 | accessdate=1 May 2010 | first=Angus | last=Stickler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amnesty-demands-crackdown-on-police-death-squads-in-brazil-517886.html |work=The Independent |location=London  | title=Amnesty demands crackdown on police death squads in Brazil | first=Karin | last=Goodwin | date=3 December 2005 | accessdate=1 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522223304/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amnesty-demands-crackdown-on-police-death-squads-in-brazil-517886.html|deadurl=yes|archivedate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notorious murder gangs operated by the [[Chilean Army]] was the '''Caravan of Death''', whose members travelled by helicopter throughout Chile between 30 September and 22 October 1973.

According to the report, throughout the 1980s political killings rose to a peak of 3,500 in 1988, averaging some 1,500 victims per year since then, and "over 1,500 civilians are also believed to have "disappeared" since 1978."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr29/015/1996/en/ El Salvador: The Spectre of Death Squads | Amnesty International] &lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], formed in 1997, was the most prominent paramilitary group. 

According to a 2014 report published by [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) on [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], a port town in Colombia, "entire neighborhoods were dominated by powerful paramilitary successor groups" HRW reports that the groups "restrict residents' movements, recruit their children, extort businesses, and routinely engage in horrific acts of violence against anyone who defies their will." It is reported that scores of people have been "disappeared" from the town over the years. Bodies are dismembered before they are disposed of and residents have reported the existence of ''casas de pique'', "chop-up houses" where people are slaughtered. Many residents have fled and are considered to have been "forcibly displaced": 22,028 residents fled in 2011, 15,191 in 2012, and 13,468 between January and October 2013.&lt;ref name=kovalik /&gt;

In Colombia, the terms "death squads", "[[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]" or "[[self-defense]] groups" have been used interchangeably and otherwise, referring to either a single phenomenon, also known as [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitarism]], or to different but related aspects of the same.&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Alfredo (editor); William Ramírez Tobón, Juan Carlos Garzón, Stathis Kalyvas, Ana Arjona, Fidel Cuéllar Boada, Fernando Cubides Cipagauta (2005).

This extrajudicial killings were conducted by the state government using [[SULFA]] members and the security forces in the name of counter-insurgency operations.

At least 400,000 to 500,000 people, perhaps as many as 3 million, were killed over a period of several months, with thousands more being interred in prisons and concentration camps under extremely inhumane conditions.

==== Thailand ====
During the [[cold war]], in the short period of democracy in Thailand (1973 - 1976), three right-wing paramilitary groups, [[Nawaphon]], [[Red Gaurs]], and [[Village Scouts]] were founded and supported by [[Internal Security Operations Command]] and [[Border Patrol Police]] to promote national unity, loyalty to [[Thai royal family]], and [[anti-communism]]. They were also heavily funded and backed by the [[United States]] government, and were under the patronage of the royal family themselves. Among their ranks were former soldiers, veterans of the [[Vietnam War]], former mercenaries in Laos, and violent vocational students.

These groups were first employed to counter protests of the pro-democracy and left-wing students movement, attacking them with firearms and grenades. When the ideological conflict escalated, they started assassinating labor and peasants union officials and progressive politicians, the most famous was Dr. [[Boonsanong Punyodyana]], the general secretary of the [[Socialist Party of Thailand]]. The conflict reached its peak with the [[Thammasat University massacre]] in 1976, which the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]] and [[Royal Thai Police]], supported by the three aforementioned paramilitary groups, stormed [[Thammasat University|the university]] and shot mostly unarmed student protesters indiscriminately, resulting in at least 46 deaths. A military coup was staged later in the same day. During the military rule, the paramilitary groups' popularity dimished.

In contemporary Thailand, many [[Human rights in Thailand#Deaths relating to the 2003 war on drugs|extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort]] of Thailand's prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] were attributed to government-sponsored death squads. Rumors still persist that there is collusion between the government, rogue military officers and radical right wing/anti-drugs death squads,

====Germany====

===== Weimar Republic =====
Death squads first appeared in [[Germany]] following the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and [[German Revolution of 1918–19|the overthrow]] of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. In order to prevent a [[coup d'etat]] by Soviet-backed German Communists, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]-dominated government of the [[Weimar Republic]] declared a [[state of emergency]] and ordered the recruitment of war veterans into militias called the [[Freikorps]]. Although officially answering to Defense Minister [[Gustav Noske]], the Freikorps tended to be drunken, trigger happy, and loyal only to their own commanders. However, they were instrumental in the defeat of the 1919 [[Spartacist Uprising]] and the annexation of the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. The most famous victims of the Freikorps were the Communist leaders [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who were captured after the suppression of the Spartacist Uprising and shot without trial. After the Freikorps units turned against the Republic in the [[monarchist]] [[Kapp Putsch]], many of the leaders were forced to flee abroad and the units were largely disbanded.

Some Freikorps veterans drifted into the [[Nationalism#Ultranationalism|ultra-nationalist]] [[Organisation Consul]], which regarded the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 Armistice]] and the [[Versailles Treaty]] as treasonous and assassinated politicians who were associated with them. Among their victims were [[Matthias Erzberger]] and [[Walter Rathenau]], both of whom were cabinet ministers in the Weimar regime.

In addition, the city of [[Munich]] remained a headquarters of Russian [[White émigré]] hit teams, which targeted those who were believed to have betrayed [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsar]]. Their most infamous operation remains the 1922 attempt on the life of [[Russian Provisional Government]] statesman [[Pavel Miliukov]] in Berlin. When newspaper publisher [[Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov]] attempted to shield the intended victim, he was fatally shot by assassin [[Piotr Shabelsky-Bork]].

During the same era, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] also operated its own assassination squads. Titled, the [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]] they carried out assassinations of carefully selected individuals from the Weimar regime as well as assassinations of members of rival political parties. The most infamous operations of Weimar-era Communist death squads remain the 1931 slayings of Berlin police Captains [[Paul Anlauf]] and [[Franz Lenck]]. Those involved in the ambush either fled to the [[Soviet Union]] or were arrested and prosecuted. Among those to receive the death penalty was [[Max Matern]], who was later glorified as a [[martyr]] by the [[East Germany|East German]] State. The last surviving conspirator, former [[Stasi|East German secret police]] head [[Erich Mielke]], was belatedly tried and convicted for the murders in 1993. The evidence needed to successfully prosecute him had been found in his personal safe after [[German reunification]].

===== Nazi Germany =====
{{main|Einsatzgruppen}}
[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942|thumb|''Einsatzgruppen'' murder Jews in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]] 
Between 1933 and 1945, Germany was a [[one-party state]] ruled by the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Nazi Party]] and its leader, [[Adolf Hitler]]. During this period, the Nazis made extensive use of death squads and targeted killings.

In 1934, Hitler ordered the extrajudicial killings of [[Ernst Röhm]] and all members of the [[Sturmabteilung]] who remained loyal to him. Simultaneously, Hitler also ordered a mass purge of the German armed forces, targeting officers who, like General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], had opposed his drive for absolute power. These massacres have gone down in history as, "The [[Night of the Long Knives]]."

Following the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, the German military was followed by four travelling death squads called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' to hunt down and kill Jews, Communists and other so-called undesirables in the occupied areas. This was the first of the [[massacre]]s which comprised [[the Holocaust]]. Typically, the victims, who included women and children, were forcibly marched from their homes to open graves or ravines before being shot. Many others suffocated in specially designed poison trucks called [[gas van]]s. Between 1941 and 1944, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' killed some two million people, including about 1.3 million Jews, as well as tens of thousands of suspected political dissidents, most of the Polish upper class and intelligentsia, [[POW]]s, and uncounted numbers of [[Romani people|Romany]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}}

Another use of death squad tactics in [[Nazi Germany]] took place after the failure of the [[July 20th Plot]], which had aimed to assassinate Hitler and dismantle the Nazi Party. More than 4,000 members and sympathizers of the [[German Resistance]] and their families were either killed out right or subjected to [[judicial murder]] by Judge [[Roland Freisler]] of the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]]. Those whom Freisler sentenced to death were routinely hanged from piano wire nooses within hours of their trials.

These tactics ended only with the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.

===== East Germany =====
Between the end of World War II and 1989, Germany was divided into the capitalist [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the Communist [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], a one-party state under the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] and its [[secret police]], the [[Stasi]]. During these years, kangaroo courts and cavalier use of the [[death penalty]] were routinely used against suspected enemies of the State. In order to prevent East German citizens from defecting to the West, orders were issued to border guards to [[Schießbefehl|shoot suspected defectors on sight]]. During the 1980s, the Stasi carried out a mission to hunt down and assassinate West Germans who were suspected of smuggling East Germans.

On the orders of the Party leadership and Stasi chief [[Erich Mielke]], the East German Government financed, armed, and trained, "urban guerrillas," from numerous countries. According to ex-Stasi Colonel [[Rainer Wiegand]], ties to terrorist organizations were overseen by [[Markus Wolf]] and Department Three of the Stasi's foreign intelligence wing.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 362-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the West German ''[[Rote Armee Fraktion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 387-401.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chile]]an ''[[Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 311-315.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[South Africa under Apartheid|South Africa]]n ''[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]''&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 316-318.&lt;/ref&gt; were brought to East Germany for training in the use of military hardware and, "the leadership role of the Party."&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar treatment was meted out to Palestinian terrorists from the ''[[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]'', ''[[Abu Nidal]]'', and ''[[Black September (group)|Black September]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 359-386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Stasi agents worked as [[military adviser]]s to African Marxist guerrillas and the governments they later formed. They included the [[Namibia]]n ''[[SWAPO]]'' and the [[Angola]]n ''[[MPLA]]'' during the [[South African Border War]], the ''[[FRELIMO]]'' during the [[Mozambican War of Independence]] and [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]], and [[Robert Mugabe]]'s ''[[ZANLA]]'' during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), page 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel Wiegand revealed that Mielke and Wolf provided bodyguards from the Stasi's counter-terrorism division for Senior PLO terrorist [[Carlos the Jackal]]&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 368-371.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Black September'' leader [[Abu Daoud]]&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 363-367.&lt;/ref&gt; during their visits to the GDR. Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 [[Munich massacre]] and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest. When he protested, Wiegand was told that Abu Daoud was, "a friend of our country, a high-ranking political functionary," and that there was no proof that he was a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Wiegand secretly recruited a Libyan diplomat into spying on his colleagues. Wiegand's informant told him that the [[La Belle bombing]] and other terrorist attacks against western citizens were being planned at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. When Wiegand showed him a detailed report, Mielke informed the SED's Politburo, which ordered the Colonel to continue surveillance but not interfere with the plans of the Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler (1999), pages 325-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before [[German Reunification]], West Germany's [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] indicted former Stasi chief Erich Mielke for collusion with two [[Red Army Faction]] terrorist attacks against U.S. military personnel. The first was the [[car bomb]] attack at [[Ramstein Air Base]] on 31 August 1981. The second was the [[attempted murder]] of [[United States Army]] General [[Frederick Kroesen]] at [[Heidelberg]] on 15 September 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-28/news/mn-1594_1_east-germans Ex-E.

===== Federal Republic of Germany =====
Following [[German reunification]], death squads linked to foreign intelligence services have continued to operate in Germany. The most infamous example of this remains the 1992 [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations]], in which a group of anti-Islamist Iranians were fatally machine-gunned in a Greek restaurant in Berlin. A German court ultimately convicted the assassins and exposed the involvement of intelligence services of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The murder and subsequent trial has been publicized in the nonfiction bestseller ''The Assassins of the Turquois Palace'' by [[Roya Hakakian]].

==== Hungary ====
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Holocaust-ArrowCross-DohanySynagogue.jpg|thumb|Jewish victims of Arrow Cross men in the court of the [[Dohány Street Synagogue]]]] --&gt;
For most of [[World War II]], Hungary was an ally of [[Nazi Germany]]. However, the Regency Council of Admiral [[Miklos Horthy]] refused to permit the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Nazi death camps.

Then, in October 1944, Horthy announced a cease-fire with the Allies and ordered the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]] to lay down their arms. In response, Nazi Germany launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]], a covert operation which forced Horthy to abdicate in favour of the Fascist and militantly racist [[Arrow Cross Party]], which was led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. This was followed by an Arrow Cross [[coup]] in Budapest on the same day. Szálasi was declared "Leader of the Nation" and prime minister of a "[[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]]".

Arrow Cross rule, despite lasting only three months, was brutal. Death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarians. Arrow Cross officers helped [[Adolf Eichmann]] re-activate the deportation proceedings from which the Jews of Budapest had previously been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labor details and many more straight to death camps. Many Jewish males of conscription age were already serving as slave labor for the Hungarian Army's [[Labour service (Hungary)|Forced Labor Battalions]].  Most of them died, including many who were murdered outright after the end of the fighting as they were returning home. Quickly formed battalions raided the Yellow Star Houses and combed the streets, hunting down Jews claimed to be partisans and saboteurs since Jews attacked Arrow Cross squads at least six to eight times with gunfire.&lt;ref name="remeny.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remeny.org/node/36| title=Szita Szabolcs: A budapesti csillagos házak (1944–45)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approximately 200 Jews were taken to the bridges crossing the Danube, where they were shot and their bodies borne away by the waters of the river because many were attached to weights while they were handcuffed to each other in pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Society Archives |publisher=Central European University |url=http://www.osa.ceu.hu/galeria/sites/siege/section2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124928/http://www.osa.ceu.hu/galeria/sites/siege/section2.html |archivedate= 2 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red Army]] troops reached the outskirts of the city in December 1944, and the [[Battle of Budapest]] began, although it has often been claimed that there is no proof that the Arrow Cross members and the Germans conspired to destroy the Budapest ghetto.&lt;ref name="remeny.org" /&gt; Days before he fled the city, Arrow Cross Interior Minister Gabor Vájna commanded that streets and squares named after Jews be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;Patai, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt;

As control of the city's institutions began to decay, the Arrow Cross trained their guns on the most helpless possible targets: patients in the beds of the city's two Jewish hospitals on Maros Street and Bethlen Square, and residents in the Jewish poorhouse on Alma Road. Arrow Cross members continually sought to raid the ghettos and Jewish concentration buildings; the majority of Budapest's Jews were saved only by a handful of Jewish leaders and foreign diplomats, most famously the Swedish [[Raoul Wallenberg]], the [[Papal Nuncio]] Monsignor [[Angelo Rotta]], Swiss Consul [[Carl Lutz]] and [[Francoist Spain]]'s [[consul general]], [[Giorgio Perlasca]].&lt;ref&gt;Patai, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; Szálasi knew that the documents used by these diplomats to save Jews were invalid according to international law, but ordered that they be respected.&lt;ref name="nepszava.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszava.com/index.php?topic=102&amp;page=4147| title=Szálasi Ferenc és a hungaristák zsidópolitikája volt a jobb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arrow Cross government effectively fell at the end of January 1945, when the Soviet Army took Pest and their enemies forces retreated across the Danube to Buda. Szálasi had escaped from Budapest on December 11, 1944,&lt;ref name="nepszava.com" /&gt; taking with him the [[Holy Crown of Hungary|Hungarian royal crown]], while Arrow Cross members and German forces continued to fight a rear-guard action in the far west of Hungary until the end of the war in April 1945.

After the war, many of the Arrow Cross leaders were captured and tried for [[war crime]]s. Many were executed, including Ferenc Szálasi. Fr. [[András Kun]], a [[Roman Catholic]] priest who commanded an Arrow Cross death squad while dressed in his [[cassock]], was also convicted and hanged after the war. Fr. Kun's cassock remains on permanent display at the [[House of Terror]] in [[Budapest]].

[[Image:Cairo gang.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A group of British intelligence agents (reputedly either the [[Cairo Gang]] or [[Igoe Gang]]) formed to counter IRA actions during the Irish War of Independence]]
; '''Irish War of Independence'''
During the [[Irish War of Independence]], the [[Irish Republican Army]] under [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] made use of death squads and targeted killings. At the beginning of the conflict, Collins recruited a group of men from the IRA's Dublin Brigade, who were dubbed "[[The Squad (IRA unit)|The Twelve Apostles]]". At Collins' orders, the Twelve Apostles strategically assassinated members of Crown security forces, [[British Intelligence]] [[spymaster]]s, and [[mole (espionage)|moles]] within IRA ranks. Collins was assisted in this by IRA moles within [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. Furthermore, several secretaries working for the British Army High Command in Dublin were also working as spies for Collins.

As British authority in Ireland began to disintegrate, [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] declared a [[state of emergency]]. In order to break the IRA, [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], suggested the recruitment of [[World War I]] veterans into paramilitary death squads. Lloyd George agreed to the proposal, and advertisements were filed in British newspapers. Former enlisted men were formed into the [[Black and Tans]], so called because of their mixture of [[British Army]] and police uniforms. Veterans who had held officers rank were formed into the [[Auxiliary Division]], the members of which were higher paid and received better supplies. Members of both units, however, were despised by Irish civilians, against whom the "Tans" and "Auxies" routinely retaliated for IRA raids and assassinations.

To make matters worse, it was also far from unheard of for the regular [[British Army]], the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], or the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] to use the same tactics. In many cases, mixed forces of Army, policemen, and paramilitaries would abduct, torture, and summarily execute Irish civilians who were unconnected with the IRA. This further eroded support for the British rule among the Irish people.

[[File:Outside the London and North Western Hotel in Dublin, April 21, 1921.jpg|thumb|300px|A group of [[Black and Tans]] in Dublin, April 1921]]
On 20 March 1920, [[Tomás Mac Curtain]], the nationalist [[Lord Mayor]] of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], was shot dead in front of his wife and son by a group of RIC officers with blackened faces.&lt;ref name="tpc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Coogan | first = Tim Pat| authorlink = Tim Pat Coogan | title = Michael Collins | publisher = Arrow Books | year = 1991 | pages = 123–124 | doi =  | isbn = 0-09-968580-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enraged, Collins ordered the Twelve Apostles to hunt down and assassinate every one of the RIC officers involved in Mac Curtain's murder. On 22 August 1920, RIC District Inspector Oswald Swanzy, who had ordered the assassination, was shot dead with Mac Curtain's revolver while leaving a Protestant church service in [[Lisburn]], [[County Antrim]]. This sparked a "[[pogrom]]" against the Catholic residents of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'When the killing starts do you defend God or family?' [[Irish Independent]], [http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/when-the-killing-starts-do-you-defend-god-or-family-1462108.html Independent.ie], accessed 15/12/09,&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]], Collins' men killed fourteen [[MI5]] agents who comprised the [[Cairo Gang]]. In one incident, the IRA group was heard to scream, "May the Lord have mercy on your souls", before opening fire.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ryle Dwyer, ''The Squad and the Intelligence Operations of Michael Collins'', [[Mercier Press]], 2005. Pages 172–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins later said of the incident,

&lt;blockquote&gt;My one intention was the destruction of the undesirables who continued to make miserable the lives of ordinary decent citizens. I have proof enough to assure myself of the atrocities which this gang of spies and informers have committed. If I had a second motive it was no more than a feeling such as I would have for a dangerous reptile. By their destruction the very air is made sweeter. For myself, my conscience is clear. There is no crime in detecting in wartime the spy and the informer. They have destroyed without trial. I have paid them back in their own coin.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That afternoon, British security forces opened fire into the crowd during a [[Gaelic football]] match at [[Croke Park]], killing 14 and wounding 68 players and spectators.

The hostilities ended in 1921 with the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which guaranteed the independence of the [[Irish Free State]].

; '''Irish Civil War'''
[[File:Prisoner (6417469255).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Irish Army soldiers escorting a captured IRA member.]]
After independence, Irish nationalist movement divided over the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which granted a partitioned Ireland [[Dominion]] status within the [[British Empire]]. Furthermore, all officials of the new Irish State were required to take an [[oath of allegiance]] to King [[George V of the United Kingdom]].

As a result, the [[Irish Civil War]] was fought between those Irish nationalists who accepted the Treaty and those who considered it treasonous. Although fought between men who had recently served together against the British, the fighting was often without quarter and brutal atrocities were committed by both sides.

In IRA communications, the Irish State was referred to as, "The Imperial Gang," the "Murder Government," and as, "a British-imposed Dáil." Therefore, Irish men and women who supported the Free State were regarded as traitors. At the orders of IRA Chief of Staff [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] began raising money for their cause via [[armed robbery]] of banks and post offices. On 30 November 1922, Liam Lynch issues what were dubbed the "orders of frightfulness", in which he ordered IRA members to assassinate members of the Irish Parliament, or Dáil Éireann, and Senators whenever possible. This General Order sanctioned the assassination of certain judges and newspaper editors. The IRA also launched a concerted [[arson]] campaign against the homes of members of the Dáil, or TDs. Among these attacks were the burning of the house of TD [[James McGarry]], resulting in the death of his seven-year-old son and the murder of Free state minister [[Kevin O'Higgins]] elderly father and burning of his family home at [[Stradbally]] in early 1923.

After TD [[Sean Hales]] was assassinated, the Dáil began to treat the civil war as a [[state of emergency]]. They voted to retaliate by [[summary execution|summarily executing]] four captured members of IRA Executive -- [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]], [[Liam Mellows]], [[Richard Barrett (Irish republican)|Richard Barrett]] and [[Joe McKelvey]]. After the motion passed, all four men were executed by [[firing squad]] on December 8, 1922. During the conflict, at least 73 other captured IRA men were treated in the same fashion—some following [[court martial]], others without trial. There are no conclusive figures for the number of unofficial executions of captured IRA insurgents, but Republican officer [[Todd Andrews]] estimated 153.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Andrews, Dublin Made Me, p269&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Executions during the Irish Civil War]]).

At the beginning of the Civil War, the Irish State formed a special [[counter-terrorism]] police, which was called the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Ireland)|Criminal Investigation Department]]. Based in Dublin's Oriel House, the CID were despised by the [[Anti-Treaty IRA]], which referred to them as, "The Murder Gang." During the [[Battle of Dublin]], the CID is known to have shot 25 Anti-Treaty militants, officially while, "resisting arrest." Ultimately, the Irish State disbanded CID upon the cessation of hostilities in 1923.

Despite the best efforts of the Anti-Treaty forces, both the [[Irish Army]] and the CID proved highly effective in both combat and intelligence work. One tactic involved placing IRA message couriers under surveillance, which routinely led the Irish security forces to senior members of the insurgency.

According to historian [[Tom Mahon]], the Irish Civil War, "effectively ended," on 10 April 1923, when the Irish Army tracked down and mortally wounded Liam Lynch during a skirmish in the [[Knockmealdown Mountains]] of [[County Tipperary]]. Twenty days later, Lynch's successor, [[Frank Aiken]], gave the order to, "Surrender and dump arms."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mahon &amp; James J. Gillogly, ''Decoding the IRA'', [[Mercier Press]], 2008. Page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====

During [[the troubles]] in Northern Ireland accusations of collusion between the British state and [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] terror groups have been longstanding, with several army units implicated in accusations of collusion. The '''[[Military Reaction Force]]''' (MRF) was a covert intelligence-gathering unit of the British Army active in Northern Ireland during [[the Troubles]], a former member described it as a "legalised death squad".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24987465&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, MRF teams carried out a number of drive-by shootings in Catholic and Irish nationalist areas of Belfast and have been linked with providing information to help loyalist paramilitaries to carry out attacks. Attacks on Catholic civilians attributed to the unit include the [[Military Reaction Force#McGurk's Bar bombing|McGurk's Bar bombing]], the [[Military Reaction Force#Whiterock Road shooting|Whiterock Road shooting]], the [[Military Reaction Force#Andersonstown shootings|Andersonstown shootings]], the [[Military Reaction Force#Killing of Jean Smith|killing of Jean Smith]], the [[Military Reaction Force#Glen Road shooting|Glen Road shooting]], the [[Military Reaction Force#St James's Crescent shooting|St. James's Crescent shooting]] and the drive-by shooting of the [[Military Reaction Force#New Lodge Six|New Lodge Six]].

The '''[[Special Reconnaissance Unit]]''', also known 14 Intelligence Company, was a part of the [[British Army]] [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]]. The unit was accused of acting in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries by former intelligence personnel [[Fred Holroyd]] and [[Colin Wallace]] in regards to the death of senior [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] member [[John Francis Green]], the [[Miami Showband killings]] and the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.republican-news.org/archive/2000/January06/06john.html |title=The killing of John Francis Green |first=Laura |last=Friel |newspaper=[[An Phoblacht]] |date=6 January 2000 |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2006/jul13_sanctions_threatened_1976_arrests.php |title=Revealed — how British threatened harsh sanctions over SAS arrests |first=Barry |last=McCaffrey |newspaper=[[Irish News]] |date=13 July 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |house=House of Commons |title=Northern Ireland Act 1974 | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1987/jul/07/northern-ireland-act-1974 |date=7 July 1987 |column_start=231 |column_end=237 |speaker=[[Ken Livingstone]] |position=Member for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ |title=Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern, Dundalk |work=[[Houses of the Oireachtas]]: Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights |date=July 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Fred |last=Holroyd |title=War Without Honour |location=Hull |publisher=Medium |year=1989 |isbn=9781872398006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spain ====
Prior to World War II, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union fought a war by proxy during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. There were death squads used by both the [[Falangist]]s and Republicans during this conflict. Prominent victims of the era's death squad violence include the poet [[Federico García Lorca]], [[José Robles]], and journalist [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos]]. (see also [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War]]).

The Republican death squads were heavily staffed by members of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[OGPU]] and targeted members of the Catholic clergy and the [[Spanish nobility]] for assassination (see [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red Terror]]).

According to author [[Donald Rayfield]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stalin, [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]], and [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]] distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]], journalists like [[Mikhail Koltsov|Koltsov]] were open to infection by the heresies, especially [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s, prevalent among the Republic's supporters. [[NKVD]] agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and [[International Brigade]] commanders than on fighting [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin's eyes, was caused not by the NKVD's diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Rayfield, ''Stalin and his Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him'', [[Random House]], 2004. Pages 362–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Dos Passos]] later wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have come to think, especially since my trip to Spain, that civil liberties must be protected at every stage. In Spain I am sure that the introduction of [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] methods by the Communists did as much harm as their tank men, pilots and experienced military men did good. The trouble with an all powerful secret police in the hands of fanatics, or of anybody, is that once it gets started there's no stopping it until it has corrupted the whole body politic.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Patrick Diggins|Diggins, John Patrick]], "'Organization is Death': John Dos Passos," and "Visions of Order: Dos Passos," in ''Up From Communism'', 1975, [[Columbia University Press]], then Harper &amp; Row, pp. 74-117, and pp. 233-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ranks of the Republican assassination squads included [[Erich Mielke]], the future head of the East German [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security]]. Walter Janka, a veteran of the Republican forces who remembers him described Mielke's career as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;While I was fighting at the front, shooting at the Fascists, Mielke served in the rear, shooting [[Trotskyites]] and Anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;John Koehler, "The Stasi", page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the modern era, [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación]] (GAL) terrorist group were death squads illegally set up by officials within the Spanish government to fight [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. They were active from 1983 until 1987, under the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s cabinets.

===Russia===

====Russian Empire====
[[Image:0NevrevNV Oprichniki BISH.jpg|thumb|350px|''Oprichniki'', painting by [[Nikolai Nevrev]].]]
The first organized use of death squad violence in Russia dates from the 16th century reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]], the first Russian monarch to claim the title of [[Tsar]]. Named the [[Oprichniki]], they wore [[quiver]]s which contained brooms, symbolizing their mission to ferret the enemies of the Tsar. They dressed in black garb, which was similar to a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[monastic habit]], and bore the insignia of a severed dog's head (to sniff out [[treason]] and the enemies of the Tsar) and a broom (to sweep them away). The dog's head was also symbolic of their "nipping at the heels of the Tsar's enemies." They were sometimes called the "Tsar's Dogs" on account of their loyalty to him. They also rode black horses in order to inspire a greater level of terror.

Their oath of allegiance was:
''I swear to be true to the Lord, Grand Prince, and his realm, to the young Grand Princes, and to the Grand Princess, and not to maintain silence about any evil that I may know or have heard or may hear which is being contemplated against the Tsar, his realms, the young princes or the Tsaritsa. I swear also not to eat or drink with the zemshchina, and not to have anything in common with them. On this I kiss the cross.''&lt;ref&gt;Isabel de Madariaga, Ivan the Terrible, page 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by [[Malyuta Skuratov]], the Oprichniki routinely tortured and executed whomever the Tsar suspected of treason, including [[boyar]]s, merchants, clergymen, commoners, and even entire cities. The memoirs of [[Heinrich von Staden (author)|Heinrich von Staden]], provide a detailed description of both the Tsar's motivations and the inner workings of the Oprichniki.

The most famous victims of the Oprichniki remains Kyr [[Philip II, Metropolitan of Moscow|Philip Kolychev]], the [[Metropolitan bishop]] of [[Moscow]]. The Metropolitan gave a sermon in the Tsar's presence in which he rebuked Ivan for terrorizing and murdering large numbers of innocent people and their families. Enraged, Tsar Ivan convened a Church council which declared Metropolitan Philip [[defrocked]] and imprisoned in a monastery for delinquent clergy. Years later, Tsar Ivan sent an emissary demanding Metropolitan Philip's blessing on his plans for the [[Novgorod massacre]]. Metropolitan Philip said, "Only the good are blessed."

Enraged, Tsar Ivan sent Skuratov to personally strangle the Metropolitan in his monastic cell. Metropolitan Philip was subsequently glorified as a Saint by the Russian Orthodox Church.

In later centuries, Russian Tsars would declare a [[state of emergency]] and use death squad tactics in order to suppress domestic uprisings like [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. During the latter, Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] ordered the [[Imperial Russian Army]] to ally itself with the [[Black Hundreds]], an [[ultra-nationalist]] paramilitary group. Those captured in arms against the Tsar's forces were tried by military tribunals before being hanged or shot. According to [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], being caught wearing similar clothing to Anti-Tsarist militias was often enough for court martial followed by execution. These tactics were continued by the [[anti-communist]] [[White Movement]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917-1920).

Opponents of the [[House of Romanov]] also carried out targeted killings of those deemed as enemies of Socialism, which was referred to as [[individual terror]]. Among them were the [[People's Will]], the [[Bolshevik]] Battle Squad, and the Combat Brigade of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. Among the victims of Marxist death squads were Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], the [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]], and the [[Georgian language]] poet and publisher [[Ilia Chavchavadze]]. These tactics were drastically accelerated following the [[October Revolution]].

==== Soviet Union ====
Following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the former Russian Empire spent 73 years as a one party state ruled by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Especially between 1917 and 1953, the CPSU routinely ordered the abduction, torture, and execution of massive numbers of real and suspected anti-communists. Those with upper class origins were routinely targeted in this way during the early years of the Soviet Union.

Most of the repression was committed by the regular forces of the state, like the army and the police, but there were also many cases of clandestine and covert operations.

During the interwar period, the [[NKVD]] routinely targeted anti-Stalinists in the West for abduction or murder. Among them were the CPSU's former Commissar of War, [[Leon Trotsky]], who was assassinated in [[Mexico City]] on 21 August 1940 by NKVD officer [[Ramon Mercador]]. Furthermore, former [[White Army]] Generals [[Alexander Kutepov]] and [[Evgeny Miller]] were abducted in Paris by the [[NKVD]]. Kutepov is alleged to have had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] before he could be smuggled back to Moscow, and shot. General Miller was not so fortunate and died in Moscow's [[Lubyanka Building|Lubianka Prison]]. [[Yevhen Konovalets]], the founder of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]], was blown to bits by NKVD officer [[Pavel Sudoplatov]] in [[Rotterdam]] on 23 May 1938.

In the post-war period, the Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the Soviet State in a campaign to eliminate [[Eastern Rite Catholicism]] in the newly annexed regions of Soviet-ruled Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Christopher Zugger, ''Finding a Hidden Church'', Eastern Christian Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Priests and laity who refused to convert to Orthodoxy were either assassinated or deported to the [[GULAG]]s in [[Karaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;''Finding a Hidden Church'', pages 33–212.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October 1947, the NKVD staged a car accident in order to assassinate the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek-Catholic]] Bishop [[Theodore Romzha]] of [[Mukachevo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Finding a Hidden Church'', pages 78–82.&lt;/ref&gt; When the "accident" failed to kill the Bishop, the NKVD poisoned him in his hospital bed on 1 November 1947.&lt;ref&gt;''Finding a Hidden Church'', page 82-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the post-Stalin era, the Soviet secret police continued to assassinate [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] in the West. Two of the most notable victims were [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalists]] who were assassinated by the [[KGB]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]]. Both deaths were believed to be accidental until 1961, when their murderer, [[Bohdan Stashynsky]], defected to the West with his wife and voluntarily surrendered to West German authorities.

==== Russian Federation ====

The Russian military has been accused of using death squads against [[Caucasian Front (Chechen War)|Chechen insurgents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20031013/bivins |title=13 October 2003 |work=The Nation |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defecting to the United States in October, 2000, [[Sergei Tretyakov (intelligence officer)|Sergei Tretyakov]], an [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] agent, accused the Government of the [[Russian Federation]] of following Soviet-era practices by routinely assassinating its critics abroad.

=== Middle East ===

==== Egypt ====
The [[Iron Guard of Egypt]] was a pro-palace political movement or a secret palace organization which assassinated [[Farouk of Egypt]]'s enemies or a secret unit with a licence to kill, which was believed to personally take orders from Farouk. It was involved in several deadly incidents.

==== Iran ====

{{Further|Chain Murders of Iran}}
Under the reign of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (1941–1979) the [[SAVAK]] (Security and Intelligence Service) was founded. During the 1960s and 70s, it was accused of using death squads.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} After the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] overthrew the Shah, [[Amnesty International]] continued to complain of human rights abuses in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'',  (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Suspected foes of the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], were imprisoned, tortured, tried by [[kangaroo court]]s, and executed. The most famous victim of the era's death squad violence remains [[Amir-Abbas Hoveida]], a Prime Minister of Iran under the Shah. However, the same treatment was also meted out to senior officers in the Iranian military. Other cases exist of Iranians opposed to the Islamic Republic who have been tracked down and murdered abroad. One of the most notorious examples of this remains the 1992 [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations]] in [[Berlin, Germany]].

The Iranian government's victims include civilians who have been killed by "death squads" that operate under the control of government agents but these killing operations have been denied by the Iranian government. This was particularly the case during the 1990s when more than 80 writers, translators, poets, political activists, and ordinary citizens who had been critical of the government in some way, [[Chain Murders of Iran|disappeared or were found murdered]].&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Sciolino, Persian Mirrors: the Elusive Face of Iran, Free Press, 2000, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) gave one of the leaders of Iran [[Khomeini]] information on Communist [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was almost certainly used. Later, The Iranian regime occasionally used death squads throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. However, by the 2000s, it seems to have almost if not entirely ceased its operations. This partial [[Westernization]] of the country can be seen as paralleling similar events in [[Lebanon]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Northern Iraq]] beginning in the late 1990s.

==== Iraq ====
Iraq was formed by the British from three provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following the empire's breakup after World War I. Its population is overwhelmingly Muslim but is divided into Shiites and Sunnis, with a Kurdish minority in the north. The new state leadership in the capital of [[Baghdad]] was formerly composed of, for the most part, the old [[Sunni]] [[Arab]] elite.

After [[Saddam Hussein]] was overthrown by the UK–US invasion in 2003 the secular socialist [[Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia and Kurds. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]].

During the course of the [[Iraq War]] the country has increasingly become divided into three zones: a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] ethnic zone to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia]] ethnic zone to the south.

While all three groups have operated death squads,&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=24 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now Shia police department and army formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long tolerated death squads.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police | first=Peter | last=Beaumont | date=11 September 2006 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly have links to the Interior Ministry and are popularly known as the 'black crows'. These groups operated either by night or by day. They usually arrested people, then either tortured&lt;ref name="Iraq's Death Squads"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120300881.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Iraq's Death Squads | date=4 December 2005 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or killed them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. Women and children have also been arrested or killed.&lt;ref name="'25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq"&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC  |date=19 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of ''[[The New York Times]]'' accused the U.S. military of modelling the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads that were used in the 1980s to crush the [[Marxist]] insurgency in El Salvador.&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html |work=The New York Times |date=1 May 2005 | first=Peter | last=Maass | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the US dispatched [[James Steele (US Colonel)|James Steele]] as an envoy and special training adviser to the Iraqi [[Special Police Commandos]] who were later accused of torture and death squad activities. Steele had served in El Salvador in the 1980s, where he helped train government units involved in human rights violations death squads in their war against the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLNF]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |title=From El Salvador to Iraq: Washington's man behind brutal police squads|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/06/el-salvador-iraq-police-squads-washington |publisher=The Guardian |date=6 March 2013 |location=London |first1=Mona |last1=Mahmood |first2=Maggie |last2=O'Kane |first3=Chavala |last3=Madlena |first4=Teresa |last4=Smith |first5=Ben |last5=Ferguson |first6=Patrick |last6=Farrelly |first7=Guy |last7=Grandjean |first8=Josh |last8=Strauss |first9=Irene |last9=Baque| displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lebanon ====
Death squads were active during the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] from 1975 to 1990. The number of people who disappeared during the conflict is put around 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2000/04/13/lebano491.htm |title="Disappearances" in Lebanon |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=12 April 2000 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/1999/11/09/lebano1962.htm |title=Syria: Account for the "Disappeared" |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=8 November 1999 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Equal Pay Act of 1963''' is a [[United States labor law]] amending the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]], aimed at abolishing [[wage]] disparity based on sex (see [[Gender pay gap]]). It was signed into law on June 10, 1963, by [[John F. Kennedy]] as part of his [[New Frontier]] Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eeoc.gov/epa/anniversary/epa-40.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626131413/http://archive.eeoc.gov/epa/anniversary/epa-40.html |title=The Equal Pay Act Turns 40 |archivedate=June 26, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In passing the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] stated that [[sex discrimination]]:&lt;ref name=EEOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/thelaw/epa.html|title=Equal Pay Act of 1963|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* depresses wages and [[living standard]]s for [[employee]]s necessary for their health and efficiency;
* prevents the maximum utilization of the available [[Labor force|labor resource]]s;
* tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing [[commerce]];
* burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and
* constitutes an unfair method of competition.

The law provides (in part) that:

:''No [[employer]] having employees subject to any provisions of this section [section 206 of title 29 of the United States Code] shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs[,] the performance of which requires equal [[skill]], effort, and [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a [[seniority|seniority system]]; (ii) a [[merit system]]; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex'' [...] &lt;ref name=EEOC/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:American Association of University Women members with President John F. Kennedy as he signs the Equal Pay Act into law.jpg|thumb|[[American Association of University Women]] members with President John F. Kennedy as he signs the Equal Pay Act into law]]
In 1942, Republican congresswoman [[Winifred C. Stanley]] from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], N.Y. introduced H.R. 5056, Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex, which did not pass at the time.&lt;ref name="National Archives"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://research.archives.gov/description/4397822 | title=H.R. 5056 Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex, HR 78A-B1, 06/19/1944, Records of the U.S. House of Representatives (ARC 4397822) | accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue languished until 10 June 1963, when Congress passed the Equal Pay Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/equal_pay_act_of_1963_epa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8_206_d|title=Federal Employment And Labor Laws / Equal Pay Act of 1963 – EPA – 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8 § 206(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("EPA" or the "Act")&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 88-38, 77 Stat. 56 (codified as amended at{{usc|29|206}}(d)).&lt;/ref&gt; as an amendment to the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|29|201, et seq}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages by employers."

Congress included within the text of the EPA a clear and concise policy statement and briefly described the problems it was intended to remedy. The clear statement of Congressional intent and policy guiding the EPA’s enactment indicate the Congressional desire to fashion a broad remedial framework to protect employees from wage discrimination on the basis of sex. The Supreme Court has expressly recognized the view that the EPA must be broadly construed to achieve Congress’ goal of remedying sexual discrimination.  Congress passed the EPA out of "concern for the weaker bargaining position of women" to provide a remedy to discriminatory wage structures that reflect "an ancient but outmoded belief that a man, because of his role in society, should be paid more than a woman."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corning Glass Works v. Brennan]]'', 417 U.S. 188, 208 (1974) ("The Equal Pay Act is broadly remedial, and it should be construed and applied so as to fulfill the underlying purposes which Congress sought to achieve.").&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA protects both men and women.  It also protects administrative, professional and executive employees who are exempt under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].

The EPA, [http://finduslaw.com/equal_pay_act_of_1963_epa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8_206_d Section 206(d)(1)], prohibits "employer[s] ... [from] discriminat[ing] … on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees [...] at a rate less than the rate [paid] to employees of the opposite sex [...] for equal work on jobs [requiring] equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions[.]"  To establish a prima facie case under the EPA, an employee must show that:
#different wages are paid to employees of the opposite sex;
#the employees perform substantially equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility; and
#the jobs are performed under similar working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Corning Glass Works v. Brennan'', 417 U.S. 188, 203 fn. 24 (stating that jobs need to be substantially equal fall within the EPA); ''[[Fallon v. State of Illinois]]'', 882 F.2d 1206, 1208 (7th Cir. 1989)(enumerating the elements of a prima facie case under the EPA).&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA provides that the employer may not pay lower wages to employees of one gender than it pays to employees of the other gender, employees within the same establishment for equal work at jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions.

It is important to note that the EPA does not contain any intent requirement within the statutory language.  Liability under the EPA is established by meeting the three elements of the [[prima facie]] case, regardless of the intention of the employer.  As such, the EPA imposes [[strict liability]] on employers who engage in wage discrimination on the basis of gender.

Once a plaintiff meets her or his heavy burden and establishes a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the EPA, then the defendant may avoid liability only by proving the existence of one of four statutory affirmative defenses.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Corning  Glass Works v. Brennan'', 417 U.S. 188, 196 (1974); ''[[Miranda v. B &amp; B Cash Grocery Store]]'', 975 F.2d 1518, 1526 (11th Cir. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA’s four affirmative defenses allow unequal pay for equal work when the wages are set "pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) ... any other factor other than sex[.]"

==Congressional intent==
Upon its initial enactment, the EPA was "the first step towards an adjustment of balance in pay for women.”&lt;ref&gt;109 Cong. Rec. 9193 (1963) (Rep. Frances P. Bolton).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a part of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]], the EPA was subject to the scope and exceptions of covered employees and employers contained within that act.&lt;ref&gt;See 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. (2006); 109 Cong. Rec. 9193 (1963) (Rep. St. George) ("All of the [FLSA] exemptions apply; and this is very noteworthy, agriculture, hotels, motels, restaurants, and laundry are excluded.  Also all professional, managerial, and administrative personnel[.]")&lt;/ref&gt;   On the floor of the House of Representatives, many Representatives voiced their concern that the EPA should act as the starting point for establishing pay parity for women. Subsequent to the enactment of the EPA, Congress undertook two actions which broadened the scope of federal protection against wage discrimination on the basis of sex.

First, the same 88th Congress enacted Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 88-352, §§701–718, 78 Stat. 241, 253–66 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§2000e to 2000e-17 (2006)).  Title VII prohibits employers from "discriminate[ing] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individuals…sex…." 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a).&lt;/ref&gt; By including sex as an element protected from discrimination, Title VII expanded the protection of women from employment discrimination, to include almost all employees working for employers with fifteen or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;See 42 U.S.C. §§2000e(b) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreseeing the potential conflict between the administration of two statutes with overlapping restrictions, Congress included the [[Bennett Amendment]] in [[Title VII]], which incorporates the EPA’s four affirmative defenses into Title VII.&lt;ref&gt;See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h) (2006) ("It shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of [the EPA].").  Senator Bennett proposed his amendment to ensure that in the event of conflicts between Title VII and the EPA, "the provisions of the [EPA] shall not be nullified." 110 Cong. Rec. 13647 (1964) (statement of Sen. Bennett).  The Supreme Court interpreted the Bennett Amendment as incorporating only the EPA’s four affirmative defenses into Title VII sex discrimination claims.  ''County of Washington v. Gunther'', 452 U.S. 161, 171 (1981).  It is important to note that the prima facie case of sex discrimination under Title VII is different from the EPA.  For example, Title VII requires intent to discriminate on the basis of sex, and does not require that a plaintiff prove job equality or identify a male comparator.  See ''Gunther'', 452 U.S. at 164, 178. For a discussion of the differences between Title VII and EPA claims, see Peter Avery, Comment, ''The Diluted Equal Pay Act'', 56 RUTGERS L. REV. 849, 852 (Spring 2004).  For a comprehensive list of specific differences between Title VII and the EPA, see Ana M. Perez-Arrieta, Comment, ''Defenses to Sex-Based Wage Discrimination Claims at Educational Institutions: Exploring "Equal Work" and “Any Other Factor Other Than Sex” in the Faculty Context'', 31 J.C. &amp; U.L. 393, 397 n. 36 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Congress expanded the EPA’s coverage to professionals and other white-collar employees.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Education Amendments of 1972]], Pub. L. No. 92-318, § 906(b)(1), 86 Stat. 235, 375 (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) (2006)) (removing operation of FLSA exemption of professional employees from EPA).&lt;/ref&gt; For the first nine years of the EPA, the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson. Therefore, the EPA exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work.  In 1972, Congress enacted the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], which amended the FLSA to expand the coverage of the EPA to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.

===Congress' consideration of economic consequences===
The Congress did not ignore the EPA’s economic consequences on the salaries and employment opportunities for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;"I am not so sure that the [EPA] in the long run is going to benefit the women employees[.]  It is highly probable that the employers may find it advantageous to employ men in positions now filled by women.  Certainly, they would feel inclined to do so in marginal instances where the labor market is plentiful.  In other words, it is highly probable that the passage of [the EPA] would result in less employment for women." 109 Cong. Rec. 9203 (1963) (Rep. Colmer); Id. at 9205 (Rep. Findley) ("I think we need to consider some of the possible side effects of [the EPA] and go into the whole proposal for [[equal pay for women]] with our eyes open, realizing it may possibly bar women from some job opportunities."); Id. at 9208 (Rep. Goodell) ("I think many women advocating this legislation recognize that in some instances the women are going to lose their jobs because an employer has to pay women the same price he [SIC] pays men.  In many other cases, women will just not be hired.").&lt;/ref&gt; First, as an amendment of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act|FLSA]], the EPA is part of the same legislative structure that houses the federal [[minimum wage]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;See 29 U.S.C. § 201, et seq.; 29 C.F.R. 1620.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA acts as a wage equalizer between men and women for equal jobs, and has the potential of acting as a [[price floor]] on the salaries of men or women for particular jobs.&lt;ref&gt;The act’s consequence as a price floor is only a potential under the EPA, because an employee must establish that a member of the opposite sex receives a higher salary for equal work.  Therefore, if an employer chooses to hire only men, or only women for a particular job, there is no potential for a pay disparity between genders for the performance of equal jobs.  In the case an employer chooses to hire only men to perform a specific job, a woman may have a cause of action for intentional gender discrimination under [[Title VII]].&lt;/ref&gt; Economists, such as [[Thomas Sowell]] have asserted the EPA causes unemployment, and additional discrimination against women by excluding them from the labor market.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[Thomas Sowell]], BASIC ECONOMICS 163–69 (2004) (explaining the effects of federal minimum wage laws including increased unemployment and the decreased cost of discrimination).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, several Representatives voiced their concerns that the negative impact of setting price floors on the wages paid to women would reduce the availability of jobs for women.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'',109 Cong. Rec. 9193 (1963) (Rep. Colmers).&lt;/ref&gt; With the possible side effects of the Act noted on the Congressional record, the Act passed with little opposition, and no indication that any of the four affirmative defenses were intended to remedy or limit its negative consequences.

==Impact==
[[File:Batman, ca. 1973.webm|thumb|1973 Public service announcement.]]
American women’s salaries have risen relative to men's since the EPA’s enactment, from 62.3% of men’s earnings in 1979 to 80.4% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] Report 985, ''Women in the Labor Force: A Databook 1'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA’s equal pay for equal work goals have not been completely achieved, as demonstrated by the BLS data and Congressional findings within the text of the proposed [[Paycheck Fairness Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Id.; Paycheck Fairness Act, S.841 109th Cong. § 2(2) (2005) ("Even today, women earn significantly lower pay than men for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are performed under similar working conditions.").&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA did not originally cover executives, administrators, outside salespeople, and professionals, but the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] amended the EPA so that it does.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. News and World Report'', Vol. 73, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00IrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22equal+pay+act%22+%22outside+salespeople%22+sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5ed2Eq5Uax&amp;sig=3IaiiuKUs1dcJYWk3bW2a6o1RfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtqxU5vHJ82NyATE_oKYDg&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22equal%20pay%20act%22%20%22outside%20salespeople%22%20sex&amp;f=false|title=Climbing the Academic Ladder: Doctoral Women Scientists in Academe : a Report to the Office of Science and Technology Policy from the Committee on the Education and Employment of Women in Science and Engineering, Commission on Human Resources, National Research Council|date=1979-01-01|publisher=National Academies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senator, [[Hillary Clinton]] first introduced the "Paycheck Fairness Act" on April 20, 2005, which, among other provisions, proposes to amend the EPA’s fourth affirmative defense to permit only bona fide factors other than sex that are job-related or serve a legitimate business interest.&lt;ref&gt;Paycheck Fairness Act, S. 841 109th Cong. (2005) (Sponsored by Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Rosa DeLauro]] first introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 1687 109th Cong. (2005) (Sponsored by Representative [[Rosa DeLauro]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 29, 2009, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]], which overturned the holding of a Supreme Court case, ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear]]'', regarding the applicable statute of limitations.  This bill, providing that each gender-unequal paycheck is a new violation of the law, was the first signing of the Obama Presidency and came almost forty-five years after the Equal Pay Act.

However, a 2007 study commissioned by the Department of Labor&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Francine and Lawrence Kahn. 2007. "The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone as Far as They Can?" ''Academy of Management Perspectives'' 21(1): 7-23. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/4166284 at jstor])&lt;/ref&gt; cautioned against overzealous application of the EPA without closer examination of possible reasons for pay discrepancies. This study notes, for example, that men as a group earn higher wages in part because men dominate [[blue collar]] jobs, which are more likely to require cash payments for overtime work; in contrast, women comprise over half of the salaried [[White-collar worker|white collar]] management workforce that is often exempted from overtime laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/Women_in_America.pdf Women in America: Indicators of Economic and Social Well-being] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310010542/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/Women_in_America.pdf |date=2011-03-10 }} at whitehouse.gov, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, the study stated:
"Although additional research in this area is clearly needed, this study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers."

[[File:Father John's Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Father John's Medicine]]

'''Father John's Medicine''' is a [[cough medicine]] that was first formulated in the United States in a [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] pharmacy in 1855 by Carleton and Hovey to give relief to ailing Father John O'Brien.  The tonic was a [[non-alcoholic]] mix made of [[cod liver oil]] and had a [[licorice]] taste.&lt;ref&gt;"THE TRUE STORY OF FATHER JOHN'S MEDICINE", http://library.uml.edu/clh/Fath/Fath2.Html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Carleton and Mr. Hovey, using Father John as the spokesman, began to manufacture and mass-produce the medicine in Lowell, until the company was sold and moved to [[Cody, Wyoming]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.uml.edu/clh/Father.Html&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, as sold, the [[active ingredient]] in Father John's Medicine is [[Dextromethorphan]] HBr.

Many of Father John's Medicine Company Records are housed at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]]'s Special Collections.

{{Monarchism |Concepts}}

An '''heir apparent''' or '''heiress apparent''' is a person who is first in a [[line of succession]] and cannot be displaced from inheriting by the birth of another person. An [[heir presumptive]], by contrast, is someone who is first in line to inherit a title but who can be displaced by the birth of a more eligible heir.

Today these terms most commonly describe heirs to [[hereditary title]]s (e.g. titles of nobility) or offices, especially when only inheritable by a single person. Most monarchies refer to the heir apparent of their thrones with the descriptive term of ''[[crown prince]]'' but these heirs may also be accorded with a more specific [[substantive title]], such as [[Prince of Orange]] in the Netherlands, [[Duke of Brabant]] in Belgium, [[Prince of Asturias]] in Spain, or [[Prince of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s. In France the title was ''[[Dauphin of France|le Dauphin]]'', in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] it was [[Tsesarevich]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[crown prince]] for more examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used metaphorically to indicate an "anointed" successor to any position of power, e.g. a political or corporate leader.

This article primarily describes the term ''heir apparent'' in a hereditary system regulated by laws of [[primogeniture]]—as opposed to cases where a monarch has a say in naming the heir.

== Heir apparent vs. heir presumptive ==
[[File:Crowd awaiting Crown Prince Tokyo Dec1916.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Throngs before the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] in Japan awaiting the appearance of the [[Crown Prince]] [[Hirohito]] for the recent proclamation of his official recognition as the heir apparent to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne|Japanese Imperial Throne]] &amp;ndash; ''New York Times'', 1916.]]

In a hereditary system governed by some form of [[primogeniture]], an heir apparent is easily identifiable as the person whose position as first in the [[line of succession]] to a title or office is secure, regardless of future births. An [[heir presumptive]], by contrast, can always be "bumped down" in the succession by the birth of somebody more closely related in a legal sense (according to that form of primogeniture) to the current title-holder.

The clearest example occurs in the case of a holder of a [[hereditary title]], one that can only be inherited by a single person, with no children. If at any time he were to produce children, they (the offspring of the title-holder) rank ahead of whatever more "distant" relative (the title-holder's sibling, perhaps, or a nephew or cousin) had been heir presumptive.

Many legal systems assume [[Illustrations of the rule against perpetuities#The fertile octogenarian|childbirth is always possible]] regardless of age or health. In such circumstances a person may be, in a practical sense, the heir apparent but still, legally speaking, heir presumptive. Indeed, when [[Queen Victoria]] succeeded her uncle [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the wording of the proclamation even gave as a [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]:

{{quote|...saving the rights of any issue of his late Majesty King William IV, which may be born of his late Majesty's consort.}}

This provided for the possibility that William's wife, [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], was pregnant at the moment of his death, since such a [[Posthumous birth|posthumous]] child, regardless of its sex, would have displaced Victoria from the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/brit-proclamations.htm#Introduction Proclamations of Accessions of British Sovereigns (1547-1952)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Adelaide was 44 at the time, so pregnancy was possible even if unlikely.

=== Daughters in male-preference primogeniture ===
Daughters (and their lines) may inherit titles that descend according to male-preference primogeniture, but only in default of sons (and their heirs).  That is, both female and male offspring have the right to a place somewhere in the order of succession, but when it comes to what that place is, a female will rank behind her brothers regardless of their ages or her age.

Thus, normally, even an only daughter will not be heir apparent, since at any time a brother might be born who, though younger, would assume that position. Hence, she is an heir presumptive. For example, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] was heir presumptive during the reign of her father, [[George VI|King George VI]], because at any stage up to his death, George could have fathered a legitimate son.

=== Women as heirs apparent ===
In a system of absolute primogeniture that disregards gender, female heirs apparent occur. As succession to titles, positions, or offices in the past most often favoured males than females, females considered to be an heir apparent were rare. Absolute primogeniture was not practised by any modern monarchy for succession to their thrones until the late twentieth century with Sweden being the first to adopt absolute primogeniture in 1980 and other Western European monarchies following suit.

Since the adoption of absolute primogeniture by contemporary Western European monarchies, examples of female heirs apparent include: [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Crown Princess Victoria]] of Sweden, [[Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange|Princess Catharina-Amalia]] of the Netherlands, and [[Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant|Princess Elisabeth]] of Belgium; these, respectively the oldest children of Kings [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]], and [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]]. [[Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway]] is heir apparent to her father (who is heir apparent to the Norwegian throne), and Victoria herself has a female heir apparent in her oldest child, [[Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland|Princess Estelle]]. Victoria was not heir apparent from birth (in 1977), but gained the status in 1980 following a change in the [[Swedish Act of Succession]]. Her younger brother [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|Carl Philip]] (born 1979) was thus heir apparent for a few months (and is a rare example of an heir apparent losing this status without a death occurring).

In 2015, pursuant to the 2011 [[Perth Agreement]], the [[Commonwealth realm]]s changed the rules of succession to the 16 thrones of [[Elizabeth II]] to absolute primogeniture, except for male heirs born before the Perth Agreement. The effects are not likely to be felt for many years; the first two heirs at the time of the agreement ([[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and his son [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]) were already eldest born children, and in 2013, William's first-born son [[Prince George of Cambridge]] became the next apparent successor.

But even in legal systems that apply male-preference primogeniture, female heirs apparent are by no means impossible: if a male heir apparent dies leaving no sons but at least one daughter, then the eldest daughter would replace her father as heir apparent to whatever throne or title is concerned, but only when it has become clear that the widow of the deceased is not pregnant. Then, as the representative of her father's line she would assume a place ahead of any more distant relatives. Such a situation has not to date occurred with the English or British throne; several times an heir apparent has died, but each example has either been childless or left a son or sons. However, there have been several female heirs apparent to British peerages (e.g. [[Frances Ward, 6th Baroness Dudley]], and [[Henrietta Wentworth, 6th Baroness Wentworth]]).

In one special case, however, England and Scotland had a female heir apparent. The [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution]] [[Bill of Rights 1689|settlement]] that established [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] as joint monarchs in 1689 only gave the power to continue the succession through issue to Mary II, eldest daughter of the previous king, [[James II of England|James II]].  William, by contrast, was to reign for life only, and his (hypothetical) children by a wife other than Mary would be placed in his original place (as Mary's first cousin) in the line of succession – after Mary's younger sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].  Thus, although after Mary's death William continued to reign, he had no power to beget direct heirs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=37644 "King James’ Parliament: The succession of William and Mary - begins 13/2/1689"] ''The History and Proceedings of the House of Commons: volume 2: 1680-1695 (1742)'', pp. 255-77.  Accessed: 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and Anne became the heir apparent for the remainder of William's reign. She eventually succeeded him as Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland.

== Displacement of heirs apparent ==
The position of an heir apparent is normally unshakable: it can be assumed they will inherit.  Sometimes, however, extraordinary events&amp;mdash;such as the death or the deposition of the parent&amp;mdash;intervene.

=== People who lost heir apparent status ===
* Parliament deposed [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the infant son of King [[James II of England|James II &amp; VII]] (of England and Scotland respectively) whom James II was raising as a Catholic, as the King's legal heir apparent&amp;mdash;declaring that James had, de facto, [[abdicate]]d&amp;mdash; and [[Invitation to William|offered the throne]] to James II's oldest daughter, the young prince's much older [[Protestant]] half-sister, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] (along with her husband, Prince [[William III of England|William of Orange]]).  When the exiled King James died in 1701, his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters proclaimed the exiled Prince James Francis Edward as King James III of England and James VIII of Scotland; but neither he nor his descendants were ever successful in their bids for the throne.
* Crown Prince [[Gustav, Prince of Vasa|Gustav]] (later known as Gustav, Prince of Vasa), son of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]], lost his place when his father was deposed and replaced by Gustav IV Adolf's aged uncle, the Duke Carl, who became [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] in 1809.  The aged King Charles XIII did not have surviving sons, and Prince Gustav was the only living male of the whole dynasty (besides his deposed father), but the prince was never regarded as heir of Charles XIII, although there were factions in the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] and elsewhere in Sweden who desired to preserve him, and, in the subsequent constitutional elections, supported his election as his grand-uncle's successor.  Instead, the government proceeded to have a new crown prince elected (which was the proper constitutional action, if no male heir was left in the dynasty), and the Riksdag elected first [[August, Prince of Augustenborg]], and then, after August's death, the Prince of [[Ponte Corvo]] (Marshal [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], who acceeded as Charles XIV John in 1818). The two lines united later, when Charles XIV John's great-grandson Crown Prince [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf]] (who acceeded as Gustaf V in 1907) married Gustav IV Adolf's great-granddaughter [[Victoria of Baden]], who became Crown Princess of Sweden. Thus, from [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustav VI Adolf]] onwards, the kings of Sweden are direct descendants of both Gustav IV Adolf and his son's replacement as crown prince, Charles XIV John.
* Prince [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|Carl Philip of Sweden]], at his birth in 1979, was heir apparent to the throne of Sweden.  Less than eight months later, a change in that country's succession laws instituted absolute [[primogeniture]], and Carl Philip was supplanted as heir apparent by his elder sister [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Victoria]].
* [[Muqrin bin Abdulaziz]] became Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in January 2015 upon the death of his half-brother [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] and the accession of another half-brother, [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], to the Saudi throne. In April of that year, Salman removed Muqrin as Crown Prince, replacing him with their nephew [[Muhammad bin Nayef]]. Muhammad bin Nayef himself was later replaced as Crown Prince by the king's son [[Mohammad bin Salman]].

=== Breaching legal qualification of heirs apparent ===
In some jurisdictions, an heir apparent can automatically lose that status by breaching certain constitutional rules. Today, for example:

* A British heir apparent would lose this status if he became a Catholic. This is the only religion-based restriction on the heir-apparent. Previously, marrying a Catholic also equated to losing this status, however, in October 2011, the governments of the 16 Commonwealth realms —of which Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is monarch— agreed to [[Perth Agreement|remove the restriction on marriage to a Catholic]]. All of the Commonwealth realms subsequently passed [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|legislation to implement the change]], which fully took effect in March 2015.
* Swedish Crown Princes and Crown Princesses would lose heir apparent status, according to the [[Swedish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], if they married without approval of the monarch and the [[Government of Sweden|Government]], abandoned the "[[Church of Sweden|pure Evangelical faith]]", or accepted another throne without the approval of the [[Riksdag]].
* Dutch Princes and Princesses of Orange would lose status as heir to the throne if they married without the approval of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]], or simply renounced the right.
* Spanish Princes and Princesses of Asturias would lose status if they married against the express prohibition of the monarch or the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]].
* Belgian Dukes and Duchesses of Brabant would lose heir apparent status if they married without the consent of the monarch, or became monarch of another country.
* Danish Crown Princes and Princesses would lose status if they married without the permission of the monarch. When the monarch grants permission for a dynast to enter marriage, he may set conditions that must be met for the dynasts and/or their children to gain or maintain a place in the line of succession; this also applies for Crown Princes and Princesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18832">'''[[Necrophilia]]''' is a pathological fascination with dead bodies, which often takes the form of a desire to engage with them in sexual activities, such as intercourse. Although prohibited by the laws of many countries, there have been many reported cases of necrophilia throughout history.

==History==

Incidents of necrophilia are noted to have occurred throughout history.  Greek author [[Herodotus]] (c.484–425 BC) stated in his ''Histories'' that in [[Ancient Egypt]], bodies of exceptionally beautiful women were not embalmed immediately after their deaths, but only after several days had passed, in order to prevent a recurrence of a case where it was discovered that an embalmer had sex with the body of a recently dead woman.&lt;ref name=Psychology&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology and Criminal Justice: International Review of Theory and Practice|author1=János Boros|author2=Iván Münnich|author3=Márton Szegedi|page=242|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggrawal|first1=Anil|title=Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects|date=2010|publisher=CRC PRess|isbn=978-1420089127|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (3rd–5th centuries AD), [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] of Judea (73/74 BC – 4 BC) desired a certain maiden and, after she killed herself to avoid marrying him, preserved her body in [[Mellified man|honey]] for seven years.

The '''Insurance Act, 1938''' is a law originally passed in 1938 in [[British India]] to regulate the [[insurance]] sector. It provides the broad legal framework within which the industry operates.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=M Y Khan|title=Indian Financial System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyTZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA16-PA1|accessdate=22 August 2015|year=2013|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-09798-0|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Prior to the law, only the Marine Insurance Act, 1906 of [[England]] existed in British India but it only applied to marine [[insurance]]. For other insurance, the British [[common law]] was applied. This law passed in 1938 borrowed heavily from the British law and covered all sorts of insurance. In 1963, a new Marine Insurance Act for independent India was passed. This also borrowed heavily from the English Marine Insurance Act, 1906.&lt;ref name="Pathak"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akhileshwar Pathak|title=Legal Aspects of Business, 6e|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brycBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT557|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-93-392-0541-6|page=557}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Insurance Act had resulted in the formation of Controller of Insurance, a regulatory. But following the nationalisation of major insurance companies in India, under  Life Insurance of India Corporation Act, 1956 and General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, its importance diminished. However, as India began allowing private companies again in the insurance sector, [[Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India]] was formed in 1999.&lt;ref name="Gulati2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neelam C.

==Summary==
The Insurance Act has 120 sections and 8 schedules. Under it, only an Indian company, as defined and registered under [[Companies Act, 1956]], is allowed to operate in India. Its foreign entity-owned equity should not exceed 49% as of 2015.

The '''Joint Declaration of Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill''', also known as the '''Havana Declaration''', was issued following the first meeting in February 2016 between [[Pope Francis]], who as the Bishop of Rome is the pontiff of the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']], Patriarch of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC), the largest of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches. This was the first time leaders of the Roman Church and the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Moscow Patriarchate]] had met. While the meeting was also seen as a symbolic moment in the history of relations between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox churches as a community, which had split in the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism of 1054]], centuries before the Moscow Patriarchate was constituted, it was not expected to lead to any immediate rapprochement between them.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|date=13 February 2016|title=Unity call as Pope Francis holds historic talks with Russian Orthodox Patriarch|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-35565085|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212224729/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-35565085|archivedate=12 February 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 30-point declaration contains a joint call by the two church primates for an end to the [[persecution of Christians in the Middle East]] and to wars in the region, expressing their hope that the meeting might contribute to the re-establishment of Christian unity between the two churches. A range of other issues are mentioned in the declaration, including [[atheism]], [[secularism]], [[consumerism]], migrants and refugees, the importance of marriage and the family, and concerns relating to abortion and [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration" /&gt;

According to the ROC leadership′s public statements made prior and after the Havana meeting, while the document stresses that both churches share the [[Sacred tradition|Tradition]] of the [[1st millennium|first millennium]] of Christianity, the discussion during the meeting did not attempt to mend any of the persisting [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences|doctrinal]] and [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences|ecclesiastical]] differences between the two churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/4381527.html Интервью Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла по итогам визита в страны Латинской Америки] ″мы не обсуждали ни одного богословского вопроса.

К сожалению, христиане не смогли сохранить это единство, христиане Востока и Запада разделены и не участвуют совместно в евхаристии. Но речь сейчас идет не о преодолении этого разделения, а о том, чтобы научиться жить и действовать в этом мире не как соперники, а как братья, чтобы вместе защищать те ценности, которые являются для нас общими, чтобы совместно проповедовать Евангелие, открывать людям Божию правду.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration however includes statements about [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in line with the [[Balamand declaration]]&lt;ref name="Alfeevafter"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Alfeyev|first=Hilarion|interviewer=Olga Lipich|script-title=Митрополит Иларион: все должны встать на путь примирения|trans-title=Metropolitan Hilarion: all must rise to the path of reconciliation|language=ru|title=Mitropolit Ilarion: vse dolzhny vstat na put primireniya|date=17 February 2016|location=Moscow, RF|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|url=http://ria.ru/religion/20160217/1375977438.html|access-date=2016-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217232616/http://ria.ru/religion/20160217/1375977438.html|archive-date=2016-02-17|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|conflict]] in Ukraine.

==Background==
{{Main|East–West Schism}}
[[Image:Paulus VI and Patriarch Athenagoras 1964 Paraguay stamp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Postage stamps and postal history of Paraguay|Paraguayan postage stamp]] commemorating the meeting between Ecumenical Patriarch [[Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Athenagoras]] and Pope [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] in 1964]]

The Great Schism of 1054 split Christianity between [[Greek East and Latin West]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Attempts were made over the subsequent centuries to heal the rift, such as the 1274 [[Second Council of Lyon]] and the 1439 [[Council of Florence]], but these failed. More recent attempts to foster closer relations between the churches included the [[Catholic–Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965]] following the 1964 meeting between [[Pope Paul VI]] and the Ecumenical Patriarch [[Athenagoras I of Constantinople]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Scammell"/&gt; Following that meeting and declaration, a number of meetings, visits and symbolic events had taken place involving Catholic and Orthodox leaders (including [[Pope John Paul II's relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church|visits by Pope John Paul II]], and especially between several popes and [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]]), but never a meeting between a Pope and a leader of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="Scammell"/&gt; The first time a Pope visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country was in 1999 when [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 May 1999|title=Pope's Orthodox mass bridges divide|website=bbc.co.uk|location=London|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/339222.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315192139/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/339222.stm|archivedate=15 March 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, regular plenary sessions of the [[Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church]], the latter being led by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Church of Constantinople]], had been held.

Within the [[Orthodox Church organization|communion]] of the [[autocephalous]] (administratively independent) local (national) churches of Orthodoxy, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] – based in what is now [[Turkey]]'s [[Istanbul]] – is recognized as the bishop who enjoys [[primus inter pares]] status, albeit having no direct administrative powers over the other Orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Scammell"/&gt; The Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) which became autocephalous near the end of the 16th century is considered the largest denomination of the local Orthodox churches; it has close ties with the Russian state, thus according a geopolitical significance to a meeting of its Patriarch with a pope. The decentralised nature of Orthodoxy meant that such meeting could not have direct significance for pan-Orthodox issues. Two weeks earlier, the leaders of the Orthodox churches, including Kirill, met in [[Pregny-Chambésy|Chambésy]], Switzerland, to make final preparations for a historic [[Pan–Orthodox Council|Great and Holy Council of the Orthodox Church]], re-scheduled for June 2016.&lt;ref name="Vatican Radio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchen|first=Philippa|date=28 January 2016|title=Orthodox leaders conclude Geneva meeting in preparation for 'Great Council'{{thinsp}}|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/01/28/orthodox_leaders_end_geneva_meeting_ahead_of_great_council/1204412|newspaper=Vatican Radio|access-date=2016-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129102201/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/01/28/orthodox_leaders_end_geneva_meeting_ahead_of_great_council/1204412|archivedate=29 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}, it began bilateral dialogue with the Catholic Church in 1967 and the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} began theological dialogue with the Catholic Church in 1979.&lt;ref name="ROC2008"/&gt;
Attempts had previously been made to arrange a meeting between a pope and a Russian patriarch, but these attempts had failed. Tensions had risen between the churches after the fall of Communism as the Churches "moved to pick up the pieces".&lt;ref name="Rozanski"&gt;{{cite web

The first section of the declaration gives thanks for this meeting "the first in history" and refers to the leaders as "brothers in the Christian faith".&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt; Sections 2 and 3 refers to their meeting place of Cuba as "the crossroads of North and South, East and West", and expressed joy at the growth of Christianity in Latin America.&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt; Sections 4–6 expresses their views on their shared spiritual tradition ("the first millennium of Christianity") and their hopes that their meeting "may contribute to the re–establishment of this unity willed by God".&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt;

Sections 7–21 refer to "the challenges of the contemporary world".&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt; Issues raised include the [[persecution of Christians]] in the Middle East and North Africa; the impact of civil war, chaos and terrorist violence; the exodus of Christians from Syria and Iraq; and the suffering experienced by the faithful of other religious traditions.&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt; The declaration refers to the renewal of the Christian faith in Russia and Eastern Europe and the "breaking of the chains of militant [[atheism]]", the rise of [[secularism]], [[consumerism]], inequality, migrants and refugees, and the place of Christianity in the process of European integration.&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt; Further sections emphasise the importance of the family, of marriage between one man and one woman, and their concerns relating to abortion, [[euthanasia]], and "biomedical reproduction technology".&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt;

The issues of the schism within the [[All-Ukraine Council of Churches|Orthodox community]] in Ukraine, the conflict between Ukraine′s Catholics and the Orthodox, and the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|political situation in Ukraine]] are raised in sections 25–27.

The closing sections call on Catholics and Orthodox to "work together fraternally in proclaiming the Good News of salvation" and to "give shared witness to the Spirit of truth in these difficult times".&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt;

The declaration concludes with a prayer to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is invoked by the names of the "Blessed Virgin Mary" as well as "[[Theotokos|Holy Mother of God]]".&lt;ref name="JointDeclaration"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that the meeting was motivated by internal Orthodox politics was expressed by George Demacopoulos, Greek-Orthodox chairman of Orthodox Christian studies at Fordham University in New York: "This isn't benevolence. It's not a newfound desire for Christian unity [...] It is almost entirely about (Kirill) posturing and trying to present himself as the leader of Orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

Similar views are expressed by [[Borys Gudziak]] ([[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saint Vladimir the Great of Paris|Ukrainian Catholic Eparchial Bishop of Paris]]), who states that "the two protagonists in this drama come to it bearing different legacies. Francis is the leader of a billion Catholics and is the single most respected moral authority in the world. Kirill is the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, which is still limping from a century of persecution and still looking for its moral voice in post-Soviet Russian society."&lt;ref name="Gudziak"&gt;{{cite web

Pray."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the meeting was a diplomatic victory for Russia's government: "The [pope's] meeting with his Russian counterpart drew Francis deep into geopolitics, and led him to condone Russia's foreign policy and critique the West's in ways that infuriated some of the Catholic church's supporters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did the pope just kiss Putin's ring?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21693071-russia-wants-its-people-believe-western-publics-are-not-hostile-their-leaders-pope|accessdate=16 February 2016|website=economist.com|location=London|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=15 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216053550/http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21693071-russia-wants-its-people-believe-western-publics-are-not-hostile-their-leaders-pope|archivedate=16 February 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Archbishop [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]], of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], says he was disappointed and his church members felt "betrayed by the Vatican" over the declaration's stance regarding Ukraine.&lt;ref name="hurrbetrayed" /&gt; Nonetheless, Shevchuk asks, "all not to rush in judging {{interp|Francis|orig=him}}, not to remain on the reality level of those who expect only politics from this meeting and want to exploit a humble pope for their human plans at all costs.

According to {{Interlanguage link multi|Sergei Chapnin|ru|3=Чапнин, Сергей Валерьевич}}, Kirill "has no obvious enemies in the episcopate" but some "marginal figures" in the clergy are enemies.&lt;ref name="Chapnin2016-03-01"/&gt;
Some {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} priests have criticized Kirill and called his acts heretical.&lt;ref name="predat" /&gt;{{discuss|section=Accusations against Kirill reported on newsru.com}} For example, Archpriest Vladislav Emelyanov said that the Francis–Kirill meeting "evokes a feeling of betrayal" and that Kirill was destroying [[conciliarity]] in the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} by first replacing local synod bishops and then not consulting fellow bishops in such a serious matter. This was, in Emelyanov opinion, "clear [[Papism]]." The {{Interlanguage link multi|Eparchy of Irkutsk|ru|3=Иркутская епархия}} has called Emelyanov's statement "harmful and unreasonable."&lt;ref name="predat" /&gt; Priest Alexei Morozov said that the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} was on the verge of a split and he encouraged {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} members to dissent in two ways: by attending "temples, where priests strictly adhere to the tenets of Christianity and do not accept heresy papacy and ecumenism" and by asking the Moscow Patriarchate to convene the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]] to condemn what Morozov believes are heresies.&lt;ref name="predat"/&gt;

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J.

For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M.

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110908">An '''enacting clause''', or '''enacting formula''', is a short phrase that introduces the main provisions of a [[law]] [[Coming into force|enacted]] by a [[legislature]]. It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.

The simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in [[Australia]] since 1990 is "The Parliament of Australia enacts".&lt;ref name="aust"/&gt; Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of [[popular sovereignty]], has the following enacting clause: "The People of the State of California do enact as follows."{{ref|US-CA}}

===Belgium===

In Belgium the enacting formula appears in the official journal (Belgisch Staatsbald/Moniteur belgue) when the law is promulgated and published, but is usually thereafter not included when the law is printed in compilations, or stored in internet databases, even official ones. The enacting clause is as follows.

{{quote|N. (e.g. PHILIPPE), King of the Belgians: To all, present and to come, greeting. The Chambers have adopted and We sanction the following: (the articles of the law then follow. After the last article of the law the enacting formula continues). We promulgate the present law, order it to be sealed with the State Seal and published in the Moniteur belge/Belgisch Staatsbald}}
{{quote|{{lang-fr|N. (PHILIPPE), Roi des Belges, A tous, présents et à venir, Salut. Les Chambres ont adopté et Nous sanctionnons ce qui suit (...) Promulguons la présente loi, ordonnons qu’elle soit revêtue du sceau de l’Etat et publiée par le Moniteur belge.}}}}
{{quote|{{lang-nl|N. (FILIP), Koning der Belgen, Aan allen die nu zijn en hierna wezen zullen, Onze Groet. De Kamers hebben aangenomen en Wij bekrachtigen hetgeen volgt (...)

===Brazil===
'''[[National Congress of Brazil]]''':

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu sanciono a seguinte Lei:"'}}}}

In Brazil the presidential assent to a bill is called "sanction". After passing both Houses of Congress (the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate), the final version of the bill, duly signed by the presiding officers of both Houses, is sent to the President of the Republic. The document is still called a "proposed law", with a bill number, and with the header "''The National Congress decrees:''" (In Portuguese: ''"O Congresso Nacional decreta:"''). If the President approves the bill, a different copy of the act is prepared by the Presidency of the Republic, with the official number of the Law and the date of enactment of the law, and also with the replacement of the clause "The National Congress decrees:" with the above mentioned formula "''THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:''". The signatures of the presiding officers of Congress are therefore not present in this version of the act. This is the version of the statute that is published in the Official Journal and that is included in the statute books. When granting his approval to a bill, the President signs both the bill sent to him by Congress and the final version of the statute with the presidential enacting formula. The signed Bill is returned to Congress by means of a presidential message; the signed statute with the presidential enacting formula is printed in the Official Journal, and the original is thereafter sent to the National Archive.
Thus, in Brazil, the President is always seen signing two different documents at bill signing ceremony (the two documents are called the "autographs"): one is the text of the proposed law, the other is the final text of the statute. Technically, the first signature (on the Bill) is the "sanction to the proposed law", that is, the approval of the bill, that transforms it in a Law, and the second signature (on the statute with the presidential enacting formula) is the promulgation, the announcement to the people that the Law has been adopted. While the signature of the President on the bill includes the addition of the formula "I sanction it" (in Portuguese: "Sanciono") above the signature, this is not seen in the final "promulgation" version of the statute. On the other hand, the promulgated statute contains not only the signature of the president, but also the countersignatures of his ministers principally charged with applying the law.

When the president vetoes a bill, and the veto is overridden, the Bill is returned by Congress to the President not for sanction (approval), but merely for promulgation. In that case, the president is expected to promulgate the bill in 48 hours. In that situation, the enacting formula that appears in the final text of the adopted statute is as follows:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress maintained and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional manteve e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Tacit sanction (i.e. implicit approval) is deemed to take place if the president fails to sign or veto a bill within the constitutionally mandated timeframe of fifteen working days from receiving the bill. Once the bill is considered implicitlly sanctioned, the president is expected to promulgate the new law and the same 48-hour timeframe applies. The formula in this case is:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Should the president refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after his veto has been overridden by Congress, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"The President of the FEDERAL SENATE promulgates, in accordance with art. 66 §7, of the Federal Constitution, the following Law, that results from bill vetoed by the President of the Republic and maintained by the National Congress:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O Presidente do SENADO FEDERAL promulga, nos termos do art. 66, § 7, da Constituição Federal, a seguinte Lei, resultante de Projeto vetado pelo Presidente da República e mantido pelo Congresso Nacional:"}}}}

Should the president of the Republic refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after the bill has been implicitly sanctioned due to his failure to sign or veto it within the constitutionally mandated timeframe, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"I make it known that the NATIONAL CONGRESS enacted, the President of the Republic, in accordance with the provisions of §3 of the art. 66 of the Constitution, sanctioned, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, in accordance with the §7 of the same article, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o CONGRESSO NACIONAL aprovou, o Presidente da República, nos termos do § 3o do art. 66 da Constituição, sancionou, e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, nos termos do § 7o do mesmo artigo promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Whenever the president adopts a provisional measure and the provisional measure is approved by Congress with changes, a normal bill is sent to the president for approval or veto, and the same formulas used for other bills are employed; once enacted, the new statute replaces the provisional measure. However, if the provisional measure adopted by the president is approved by Congress without changes, the bill does not need to be presented for approval or veto; in that case, the law that both corresponds fully to the provisional measure and replaces it is promulgated directly by the President of the Senate, with the following words:

{{quote|"I make it known that the President of the Republic adopted the Provisional Measure number NNN of YYYY, that the National Congress approved, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, for the effects of the provision of the sole paragraph of art. 62 of the Federal Constitution, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o Presidente da República adotou a Medida Provisória no NN, de YYYY, que o Congresso Nacional aprovou e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, para os efeitos do disposto no parágrafo único do art. 62 da Constituição Federal, promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

'''General Assembly of the Empire of Brazil''' (1822-1889)

Whenever the General Assembly of the Empire (made up of a Senate and of a Chamber of Deputies) passed a bill, a decree of the General Assembly containing the articles of the approved bill was sent to the Emperor for sanction or veto. The Decree of the General Assembly began with the following formula (that did not appear in the final version of the statute, after the imperial sanction): "''The General Assembly decrees:''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral decreta:''"). The decree was still only a proposed law, that would become an actual law if sanctioned by the Emperor. The General Assembly sent its decree to the Emperor for sanction or veto by means of a message with the words following: "''The General Assembly sends to the Emperor the enclosed decree, that it considers advantageous, and useful to the Empire, and it asks that His Imperial Majesty may be pleased to grant it His sanction''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral dirige ao Imperador o decreto incluso, que julga vantajoso e útil ao Império, e pede a Sua Majestade Imperial, se digne dar a Sua sanção"''). If the Emperor decided to sanction the decree, then he sent the message of the General Assembly back to the Legislature, adding after the text of the Decree of the General Assembly the following words, together with the date and his signature: ""''The Emperor consents''" (in Portuguese: "''O Imperador consente''"). Then, the Executive branch prepared a formal document to promulgate the new law, and this document was known in the imperial period as a ''Charter of Law'' (in Portuguese: ''Carta de Lei''). It was the chartered version of the law that was included in the statute books and that was printed and published for the knowledge of the people. Thus, the Charter of Law was the final version of the statute as adopted. It was signed by the Emperor and countersigned by his responsible Ministers, and contained an enacting formula as follows:

{{quote|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PETER THE SECOND"), by the grace of God and unanimous acclamation of the peoples, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil: We make it known to all Our subjects that the General Assembly has decreed and We will the following law: 
(the provisions of the Law then followed, and after the last article of the Law the text of the statute finished with a continuation of the enacting formula, as follows). 
We command, therefore, all the authorities whom the knowledge and execution of this present Law may concern, that they comply with it and that they make it be complied with and kept, as faithfully and as fully as provided herein. The Secretary of State of the Affairs of... (title of the responsible Minister of the Crown who countersigns the Act with the Emperor and who heads the Department principally charged with applying the Law) is to make this Law be printed, published and circulated. Given at the Palace of... on (day) of (month) of (year), in the (year) of the Independence and of the Empire.}}

{{quote|{{lang-pt|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PEDRO SEGUNDO"), por graça de Deus e unânime aclamação dos povos, Imperador Constitucional e Defensor Perpétuo do Brasil: Fazemos saber a todos os Nossos súditos que a Assembleia Geral decretou e Nós queremos a seguinte lei:
(the provisions of the Law then followed, and after the last article of the Law the text of the statute finished with a continuation of the enacting formula, as follows)

Dada no palácio... no (day) de (month) de (year), no (year) da Independência e do Império.}}}}

When the powers of the Emperor were discharged by Regents on behalf of the monarch the formula was as follows:

{{quote|The Regency (or "The Regent"; or "The Princess Imperial Regent"), in the Name of His Majesty the Emperor, the Lord (name of the Emperor preceded by the title "Dom", e.g., "Dom Pedro II"), makes it known to all the subjects of the Empire that the General Assembly has decreed and it (or "He" or "She") sanctioned the following law: 
(the provisions of the Law then followed, and after the last article of the Law the text of the statute finished with a continuation of the enacting formula, as follows). 
(He, She, It) commands, therefore, all the authorities whom the knowledge and execution of this present Law may concern, that they comply with it and that they make it be complied with and kept, as faithfully and as fully as provided herein. The Secretary of State of the Affairs of... (title of the responsible Minister of the Crown who countersigns the Act with the Regent and who heads the Department principally charged with applying the Law) is to make this Law be printed, published and circulated. Given at the Palace of... on (day) of (month) of (year), in the (year) of the Independence and of the Empire.}}

{{quote|{{lang-pt|A Regência (or "O Regente; or "A Princesa Imperial Regente), em Nome de Sua Majestade o Imperador, o Senhor (name of the Emperor preceded by the title "Dom", e.g., "Dom Pedro II"), faz saber a todos os súditos do Império que a Assembleia Geral decretou e ela (or ele) sancionou a seguinte lei:

===Canada===
'''[[Parliament of Canada]]''':

{{quote|"Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:"}}

The enacting clause for [[money bills]] differs. For example, in the ''Appropriation Act No. 4, 2015–16'', it reads as follows:

{{quote|text=MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,&lt;br/&gt;

'''Maine Question 3''', formally '''An Act to Require Background Checks for Gun Sales''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/citizensguide2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was a citizen-initiated referendum question that appeared on the Maine November 8, 2016 statewide ballot. It sought to require a background check for virtually all gun transfers in [[Maine]], with some exceptions.  As the Maine Legislature and Governor Paul LePage declined to enact the proposal as written, it appeared on the ballot along with elections for [[United States presidential election in Maine, 2016|President of the United States]], [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maine, 2016|Maine's two United States House seats]], the Maine Legislature, other statewide ballot questions, and various local elections.

The question was defeated, with 51.8% of voters opposed.

==Background==
Efforts to expand background checks of gun buyers have not succeeded at the [[Maine State House]].  In 2013, an effort to create a civil penalty of someone not conducting a background check on a buyer later found to not be allowed to possess a gun passed the [[Maine Legislature]], but was vetoed by [[Governor of Maine|Governor]] [[Paul LePage]], a strong [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] supporter. An outright requirement to conduct background checks on gun buyers in private sales failed to pass the Legislature that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/06/19/politics/maine-senate-passes-bill-that-promotes-background-checks-for-private-gun-sales/?ref=relatedBox|title=Maine Legislature passes bill that promotes background checks for private gun sales|work=The Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/05/30/politics/state-house/maine-senate-rejects-gun-show-background-check-bill/?ref=relatedBox|title=Maine Senate rejects gun show background check bill|work=The Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2015, the group Maine [[Moms Demand Action]] (MMDA) filed paperwork with the [[Maine Secretary of State]]'s office to launch a petition drive to require virtually all gun sales to have a background check of the buyer conducted by a licensed gun dealer.  The proposal includes exceptions for transfers between family members, temporary loans of firearms while hunting or sport shooting, an emergency need for self-defense, and other limited exceptions.&lt;ref name=ballot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/02/18/politics/gun-purchase-background-check-mandate-question-qualifies-for-maine-ballot/|title=Gun purchase background check mandate question qualifies for Maine ballot|work=The Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=funding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/08/24/politics/group-aims-for-2016-maine-vote-on-gun-sales-background-checks/?ref=relatedBox|title=Group aims for 2016 Maine vote on gun sales background checks|work=The Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MMDA submitted the 84,600 signatures they gathered on January 19, 2016.&lt;ref name=ballot /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetippingpoint.bangordailynews.com/2016/01/19/state-politics/maine-gun-background-check-referendum-supporters-to-submit-signatures-today/|title=Maine gun background check referendum supporters to submit signatures today|work=Mike Tipping}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Secretary of State's office announced on February 18 that 65,821 signatures were validated, well over the 61,123 required to place a question on the ballot.&lt;ref name=ballot /&gt; The question will appear on the ballot as "Do you want to require background checks prior to the sale or transfer of firearms between individuals not licensed as firearms dealers, with failure to do so punishable by law, and with some exceptions for family members, hunting, self-defense, lawful competitions, and shooting range activity?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2016/06/23/maine-secretary-of-state-revises-wording-of-all-five-november-ballot-questions/|title=Maine secretary of state revises wording of all five November ballot questions|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
Gun rights supporters criticized the proposal.  The Sportsman's Alliance of Maine's executive director, [[David Trahan]], stated that while background checks sound good in theory, they are difficult to implement and enforce, which is why there has been no national universal background check system.  He also criticized the potential involvement of [[Michael Bloomberg]] and other out-of-state gun control groups spending large amounts of money in Maine.&lt;ref name=funding /&gt;  State Senator [[Eric Brakey]] criticized the effort as a back-door attempt to establish a gun registry.&lt;ref name=funding /&gt;

Supporters officially launched their campaign on May 14, 2016, calling themselves Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership. The group includes law enforcement officials, gun violence survivors, sportsmen, gun owners and gun violence prevention advocates.  They state that background checks will close a loophole in existing gun laws which allow criminals, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill to obtain guns without a background check by not going to a licensed dealer. They also claim that states with expansive background checks experience lower rates of women being shot to death by their intimate partners, as well as lower rates of police officers being killed by handguns.&lt;ref name=funding /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/05/14/news/bangor/campaign-to-close-gun-background-check-loophole-launched/|title=Campaign to close gun background check loophole launched|work=The Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of Maine|Governor]] [[Paul LePage]], in expressing opposition to the referendum, called it unconstitutional.  Referendum supporters cite a 2007 decision written by [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] stating that background checks are constitutional.&lt;ref name=lepage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpbn.net/post/gun-control-battle-rages-lepage-aims-shoot-down-maine-ballot-measure#stream/0|title=As Gun Control Battle Rages, LePage Aims to Shoot Down Maine Ballot Measure|work=[[MPBN]]|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maine Warden Service]], while not officially opposing the referendum, expressed concern that its passage "could make criminals out of responsible firearm owners" and that it would be difficult to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/10/11/wardens-express-concern-about-gun-background-check-measure/|title=Wardens express concern about gun background check measure|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California''''', 528 U.S. 152 (2000), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court decided an appellant who was the defendant in a criminal case cannot refuse the assistance of counsel on direct appeals.  This case is in contrast to ''[[Faretta v. California]]'', 422 U.S. 806 (1975), which grants criminal defendants the right to refuse counsel for trial purposes.

== Background ==
Salvador Martinez worked as an office assistant for a law firm, and in the service of that firm he was given $6,000 by the girlfriend of a client for bail.  This bail was not posted, and he was accused of embezzlement and theft, and further was convicted and acquitted respectively on these charges.  He filed an appeal, a waiver of counsel, and a motion to represent himself (a "[[pro se]]" motion).  When the Court of Appeals of California rejected the ''pro se'' motion, he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the argument.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1999/1999_98_7809/&lt;/ref&gt;

The counsel for the appellant, Ronald Maines, argued that [[due process]] coupled with the decision in ''Faretta'' required the extension of a constitutional right for criminal defendants to refuse to have a court-appointed lawyer argue the appeal, thus requiring the right to extend further to allow criminal defendants to argue their own appeals.  This would require any appellant who was a criminal defendant to be allowed, given that the court opted for oral arguments, to be allowed to argue their own case as a constitutional right.

The argument of the counsel for the appellee, Robert Foster, held that there were substantial differences between initial trials and appeals courts, therefore the extension of ''Faretta'' to the current question was overreaching.  Mr. Maines contended that there must be more than simple "differentiation" between the two situations, but there must be a difference consequential to the holding in ''Faretta'' to distinguish the trial and appellate situations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1999/1999_98_7809/argument&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
Justice Stevens states in the opinion that "Our conclusion in ''Faretta'' extended only to a defendant’s “constitutional right to conduct his own defense.”"  Stevens affirms the decision of the lower court that "There is no constitutional right to self-representation on the initial appeal as of right."  This rejects the claim that the right to forgo representation of separate counsel at the appellate level was granted by due process and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  The court also rejected the notion that court-appointed lawyers would be disloyal to their clients, thus preventing a fair appellate proceeding.  Further, since the court rejects this application of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] to appellate proceedings, then that cannot be held as a claim for the conclusion that a person has the right to represent themselves upon direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/528/152.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063627/http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/528/152.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }} Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal. Fourth Appellate Dist. 528 U.S. 152-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the opinion of Justice Stevens dismissed not just the Due process claims and the precedent claims of the ''Faretta'' decision, but also the potential future claims under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Justice Scalia, in a concurrence, suggests that the decision in ''Faretta'' does not apply strictly to the question before the court since in the case ''[[McKane v. Durston]]'', 153 U.S. 684-688 (1894), the court decided that "there was no constitutional right to an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/528/152.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063627/http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/528/152.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }} Martinez v.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
{{Hegelianism}}
[[File:Haitian Revolution.jpg|320px|thumb|Hegel was influenced by articles about the [[Haitian Revolution]] in [[Minerva (German journal)|''Minerva'']]]]
The '''master–slave dialectic''' is the common name for a famous passage of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', though the original German phrase, ''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'', is more properly translated as '''Lordship and Bondage'''.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Duquette, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/hegelsoc/ "Hegel’s Social and Political Thought"],  ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Accessed 9 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's [[philosophy|philosophical]] system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers.

The passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, [[Self-awareness|self-conscious]] beings. The essence of the [[dialectic]] is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a "struggle to the death" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it.

== Context ==
"Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage" is the first of two titled subsections in the "Self-Consciousness" chapter of ''Phenomenology''. It is preceded in the chapter by a discussion of "Life" and "Desire", among other things, and is followed by "Free Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness".

Hegel wrote this story or myth in order to explain his idea of how self-consciousness dialectically [[Aufheben|sublates]] into what he variously refers to as Absolute Knowledge, Spirit, and Science. As a work, the ''Phenomenology'' may be considered both as an independent work, apparently considered by Hegel to be an ''[[A_priori_and_a_posteriori|a priori]]'' for understanding the ''[[Science of Logic]]'', and as a part of the ''Science of Logic'', where Hegel discusses [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]].

== Recognition ==
Crucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge, or Spirit, cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness.  Such an issue in the history of philosophy had only ever been explored by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and its treatment marks a watershed in [[European philosophy]].

== Hegel's myth ==
In order to explain how this works, Hegel uses a story that is in essence an abstracted, idealized history about how two people meet.  However, Hegel's idea of the development of self-consciousness from consciousness, and its sublation into a higher unity in absolute knowledge, is not the contoured brain of natural science and evolutionary biology, but a [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|phenomenological]] construct with a history; one that must have passed through a struggle for freedom before realising itself.

The abstract language used by Hegel never allows one to interpret this story in a straightforward fashion.  It can be read as self-consciousness coming to itself through a child's or adult's development, or self-consciousness coming to be in the beginning of human history (see [[wikt:Hominization|hominization]]) or as that of a society or nation realising freedom.

That the master–slave dialectic can be interpreted as an internal process occurring in one person or as an external process between two or more people is a result, in part, of the fact that Hegel asserts an "end to the antithesis of [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]". What occurs in the human mind also occurs outside of it. The objective and subjective, according to Hegel, [[Aufheben|sublate]] one another until they are unified, and the "story" takes this process through its various "moments" when the lifting up of two contradictory moments results in a higher unity.

First, the two abstract consciousnesses meet and are astounded at the realisation of the self as a foreign object. Each can choose to ignore the other, in which case no self-consciousness forms and each views the other merely as an animated object rather than an equivalent subject. Or, they become mesmerized by the mirror-like other and attempt, as they previously had done in controlling their own body, to assert their will.

According to Hegel,
:"On approaching the other it has lost its own self, since it finds itself as another being; secondly, it has thereby sublated that other, for this primitive consciousness does not regard the other as essentially real but sees its own self in the other."&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977); Paragraph 179, Pg. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction ===
When initially confronted with another person, the self cannot be immediately recognized :'Appearing thus immediately on the scene, they are for one another like ordinary objects, independent shapes, individuals submerged in the being [or immediacy] of Life'.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Death struggle ===
A struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self-consciousness fails.  Hegel refers to this failure as "abstract negation" not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery. In this struggle the Master emerges as Master because he does not fear death since he does not see his identity dependent on life, while the slave out of this fear consents to the slavery.  This experience of fear on the part of the slave is crucial, however, in a later moment of the dialectic, where it becomes the prerequisite experience for the slave's further development.

=== Enslavement and mastery ===
Truth of oneself as self-conscious is achieved only if both live; the recognition of the other gives each of them the objective truth and self-certainty required for self-consciousness. Thus, the two enter into the relation of master/slave and preserve the recognition of each other.

=== Contradiction and Resolution ===
However, this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full self-consciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The master's self-consciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature: the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master.  As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own [[creativity]], he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created, he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands, thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves self-consciousness, while
the master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave; thus the master is enslaved by the [[labor economics|labour]] of his slave.

== Conclusions ==
One interpretation of this dialectic is that neither a slave nor a master can be considered as fully self-conscious. A person who has already achieved self-consciousness could be enslaved, so self-consciousness must be considered not as an individual achievement, or an achievement of natural and genetic evolution, but as a social phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Moran, ''Hegel and the Fundamental Problems of Philosophy'', Holland: Grüner, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

As philosopher [[Robert Brandom]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hegel's discussion of the dialectic of the Master and Slave is an attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act with&amp;mdash;to make it possible for us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted. This is one of his most important and certainly one of his deepest ideas, though it's not so easy to see just how the argument works."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brandom, Interview, Summer 2008. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdIPuERVjk0 Transcript: http://www.filosofia.it/images/download/multimedia/08_Brandom%20Interview_transcription.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexandre Kojève]]'s unique interpretation differs from this. For Kojève, people are born and history began with the first struggle, which ended with the first masters and slaves. A person is always either master or slave; and there are no real humans where there are no masters and slaves. History comes to an end when the difference between master and slave ends, when the master ceases to be master because there are no more slaves and the slave ceases to be a slave because there are no more masters. A synthesis takes place between master and slave: the integral [[citizen]] of the universal and homogenous [[State (polity)|state]] created by [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'', France: Gallimard, 1947. Translated as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'', New York: Basic Books, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The master and slave relationship influenced numerous discussions and ideas in the 20th century, especially because of its supposed connection to [[Karl Marx]]'s conception of [[class struggle]] as the motive force of social development.{{fact|date=February 2015}}.

Hegel's master–slave dialectic has been influential in the [[social sciences]], [[philosophy]], [[literary studies]], [[critical theory]], [[postcolonial studies]] and in [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Borossa and Caroline Rooney, "Suffering, Transience and Immortal Longings: Salomé Between Nietzsche and Freud," ''Journal of European Studies'' 33(3/4): 287-304 London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hegel's master–slave trope, and particularly the emphasis on recognition, has been of crucial influence on [[Martin Buber]]'s relational schema in ''[[I and Thou]]'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s account of the history and dynamics of gender relations in ''[[The Second Sex]]''&lt;ref&gt; A "five-stage model" of the master-slave dialectic, inflected through de Beauvoir's classic work [http://www.rgwinther.com/CoursesTaught/HegelsMasterSlaveDialecticPhasesandFAQ.pdf can be found here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frantz Fanon]]'s description of the colonial relation in ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz Fanon, ''Black Skin, White Masks,'' New York: Grove Press, 1967: 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Buck-Morss]]'s article ''Hegel and Haiti'' argues that the [[Haitian revolution]] influenced Hegel's writing of his slave-master dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buck-Morss |first=Susan |authorlink= Susan Buck-Morss |date= Summer 2000 |title=Hegel and Haiti  |journal=Critical Inquiry |publisher= The University of Chicago Press |volume=26  |issue=4 |pages=821–865 |jstor=1344332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education''''', [[Case citation|529]] [[F. Supp.]] 1255 (E.D. Ark. 1982), was a 1981 [[legal case]] in the US state of [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=McLean&gt;{{cite court |litigants=McLean v. Arkansas |vol=529 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1255 |pinpoint= |court=E.D Ark. |date=1982 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/529/1255/2354824/ |accessdate=2017-12-16 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lawsuit]] was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas]] by various parents, religious groups and organizations, biologists, and others who argued that the Arkansas [[state law]] known as the '''Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act''' ('''Act 590'''), which mandated the teaching of "[[creation science]]" in Arkansas [[Education in the United States|public schools]], was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] because it violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] handed down a decision on January 5, 1982, giving a clear, specific definition of science as a basis for ruling that creation science is [[religion]] and is simply not science.&lt;ref name=McLean/&gt; The ruling was not binding on schools outside the Eastern District of Arkansas but had considerable influence on subsequent rulings on the teaching of [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement: Its True Nature and Goals.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519124655/http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf |date=2011-05-19 }} (pdf) A Position Paper from the Center for Inquiry, Office of Public Policy Barbara Forrest.

Arkansas did not appeal the decision and it was not until the 1987 case of ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Edwards v. Aguillard|link=|volume=482|page=578 |pin=|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with a similar law passed by the [[Louisiana|State of Louisiana]], that teaching "creation science" was ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], making that determination applicable nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm Creationism/ID, A Short Legal History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |date=2014-08-23 }} By Lenny Flank, Talk Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

Act 590 had been put forward by a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] on the basis of a request from the Greater Little Rock Evangelical Fellowship for the introduction of legislation based on a "model act" prepared using material from the [[Institute for Creation Research]]. It was opposed by many religious organizations and other groups.

==Parties==
The [[plaintiff]]s in the suit, who opposed the "balanced treatment" [[statute]], were led by the Reverend William McLean, a [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Eugenie|authorlink=Eugenie Scott|title=Evolution vs. Creationism|publisher=Greenwood Press|date=30 June 2004|pages=1590–1628 Kindle ed.|isbn=978-0-313-32122-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Physical Anthropology: An Encyclopedia (Garland Reference Library of Social Science)|editor=Frank Spencer|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8153-0490-6|edition=illustrated|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pulaski County Special School District]] and its directors and [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] were named in the original complaint but were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs at the pre-trial conference on October 1, 1981.

==Background==
Various state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution had been introduced in the 1920s. They were challenged in 1968 at ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' which ruled that "The law's effort was confined to an attempt to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the [[Creation according to Genesis|Biblical account]], literally read. Plainly, the law is contrary to the mandate of the First, and in violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Epperson v. Arkansas|link=|volume=393|page=97|pin=|year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The creationist movement turned to promoting teaching creationism in school science classes as equal to evolutionary theory.

==Arkansas Act 590==
Arkansas Act 590 of 1981, entitled the "Balanced Treatment for Creation Science and Evolution Science Act," mandated that "creation science" be given equal time in public schools with evolution.

Creation science was defined as follows:
"Creation science means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:
:#Sudden creation of the universe, energy and life [[Ex nihilo|from nothing]];
:#The insufficiency of [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] in bringing about [[Common descent|development of all living kinds from a single organism]];
:#Changes only with fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals;
:#Separate ancestry for man and apes;
:#Explanation of the earth's geology by catastrophism, including the occurrence of [[Flood myth|worldwide flood]];
:#A [[Young Earth creationism|relatively recent inception]] of the earth and living.

Evolution science was defined as follows:
"Evolution-science" means the scientific evidences for evolution and inferences from those scientific evidences. Evolution-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:
:#Emergence by [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] processes of the universe from disordered matter and [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life from nonlife]];
:#The sufficiency of [[mutation]] and natural selection in bringing about development of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds;
:#Emergency [sic] by mutation and natural selection of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds;
:#Emergence of man from a [[common descent|common ancestor]] with apes;
:#Explanation of the earth's [[geology]] and the [[phylogenetics|evolutionary sequence]] by [[uniformitarianism]]; and
:#An inception several billion years ago of the earth and somewhat later of life.

The Act was signed into law by Governor [[Frank D. White]] on March 19, 1981.

==''McLean v. Arkansas'' ruling==
Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]]'s ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that "creation-science" as defined in Arkansas Act 590 "is simply not science". The judgment defined the essential characteristics of science as being:
:#It is guided by [[natural law]];
:#It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;
:#It is testable against the empirical world;
:#Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and
:#It is [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]].

Overton found that "creation science" failed to meet these essential characteristics for these reasons:
:#Sudden creation "from nothing" is not science because it depends upon a supernatural intervention which is not guided by natural law, is not explanatory by reference to natural law, is not testable and is not falsifiable;
:#"insufficiency of mutation and natural selection" is an incomplete negative generalization;
:#"changes only within fixed limits of originally created kinds" fails as there is no scientific definition of "kinds", the assertion appears to be an effort to establish outer limits of changes within species but there is no scientific explanation for these limits which is guided by natural law and the limitations, whatever they are, cannot be explained by natural law;
:#"separate ancestry of man and apes" is a bald assertion which explains nothing and refers to no scientific fact or theory;
:#Catastrophism and any kind of Genesis Flood depend upon supernatural intervention, and cannot be explained by natural law;
:#"Relatively recent inception" has no scientific meaning, is not the product of natural law; not explainable by natural law; nor is it tentative;
:#No recognized [[scientific journal]] has published an article espousing the creation science theory as described in the Act, and though some witnesses suggested that the scientific community was "close-minded" and so had not accepted the arguments, no witness produced a scientific article for which publication has been refused, and suggestions of censorship were not credible;
:#A scientific theory must be tentative and always subject to revision or abandonment in light of facts that are inconsistent with, or falsify, the theory. A theory that is by its own terms dogmatic, absolutist, and never subject to revision is not a scientific theory;
:#While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the [[methodology]] as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.

The creationists' methods do not take data, weigh it against the opposing scientific data, and thereafter reach the conclusions stated in [the Act] Instead, they take the literal wording of the Book of Genesis and attempt to find scientific support for it. The Act took a two-model approach to teaching identical to the approach put forward by the [[Institute for Creation Research]], which assumes only two explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Creationists take this to mean that all scientific evidence which fails to support the theory of evolution is necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism. The judgment found this to be simply a contrived dualism which has no scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose.

The judge concluded that "the Act was passed with the specific purpose by the General Assembly of advancing religion," and that it violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.

The test that Overton developed on the basis of [[Michael Ruse]]'s testimony was later criticized by the philosopher of science [[Larry Laudan]] who argued that rather than call Creation Science "non-science" it would have been more cogent to show that it was "bad science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laudan|first1=L.|title=Commentary: Science at the Bar-Causes for Concern|journal=Science, Technology and Human Values|volume=7|issue=41|pages=16–19|year=1982|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/688928}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] was the single scientist testifying for the defense of creationism.&lt;ref&gt;Phy-Olsen, Allene. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WkXbY6_X90YC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Wickramasinghe+intelligent+design&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-VnfRJlYD8&amp;sig=QCc8PVvnQhpKxWHHAVtLhVmSO24&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Wickramasinghe%20intelligent%20design&amp;f=false Evolution, Creationism, and Intelligent Design]''&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesized on [[panspermia]] and on "the possibility of high intelligence in the Universe and of many increasing levels of intelligence converging toward a [[God]] as an ideal limit." &lt;ref&gt;Fry, Iris.

The '''Nobel Charitable Trust''' ('''NCT''') is a [[charitable organization|charity]] set up by some members of the Swedish [[Nobel family]], i.e. descendants of [[Ludvig Nobel]]. Its founders are [[Michael Nobel]], [[Gustaf Nobel]], Philip Nobel, and Peter Nobel-Oleinikoff serves as a senior adviser. The trust has announced its intention to award its own prizes.

The Chairman of the Nobel Charitable Trust is Gustaf Nobel.

== Michael Nobel Energy Award ==

The [[Michael Nobel Energy Award]] is a proposed award, to be awarded to "scientists and/or institutions who have made important discoveries in the renewable energy field or whose discoveries could lead to reduction in pollution and global warming".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/peter-nobeloleinikoff-joins-the-nobel-charitable-trust-51223.php&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the first new Nobel prize to be established by the Nobel family since Alfred Nobel established his prizes in 1895 (they were first awarded six years later).

The plan was announced at nanoTX 07. The Nobel Foundation quickly reacted by threatening legal action for "clear misuse of the reputation and goodwill of the Nobel Prize and the associations of integrity and eminence that has been created over time and through the efforts of the Nobel Committees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = nanoPRwire| title = Michael Nobel Relieved of nanoTX'07 Activities After Protest from Nobel Foundation and Family Society| publisher = Nano Science and Technology Institute| date = 2007-09-24| url = http://www.nsti.org/press/PRshow.html?id=2335| accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director, Michael Sohlman, of the Nobel Foundation and the elected head of the Nobel family disapproved to the institution of the so-called 'Dr. Michael Nobel Award' as well as the Nobel Charitable Trust (NCT) and Nobel Family Benevolent society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Barnaby J.| last = Feder| title = The Nobel Prize That Wasn’t| publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 2007-10-18| url = http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/the-nobel-prize-that-wasnt/| accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''OBG Ltd v Allan''''' [2007] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/21.html UKHL 21] was a combined appeal with ''[[Douglas v Hello! Ltd]]'' and ''[[Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young]]'' and stands as the leading case on [[economic torts in English law]].

==Facts==
Lord Hoffmann in his judgment summarised the facts.

{{Cquote|In ''OBG Ltd v Allan'' [2005] QB 762 the defendants were receivers purportedly appointed under a [[floating charge]] which is admitted to have been invalid. Acting in good faith, they took control of the claimant company's assets and undertaking. The claimant says that this was not only a trespass to its land and a [[conversion (law)|conversion]] of its chattels but also the tort of unlawful interference with its contractual relations. It claims that the defendants are liable in damages for the value of the assets and undertaking, including the value of the contractual claims, as at the date of their appointment. Alternatively, it says the defendants are liable for the same damages in conversion.

In ''[[Douglas v Hello! Ltd]]'' [2006] QB 125 the magazine ''OK!'' contracted for the exclusive right to publish photographs of a celebrity wedding at which all other photography would be forbidden. The rival magazine Hello! published photographs which it knew to have been surreptitiously taken by an unauthorised photographer pretending to be a waiter or guest. OK! says that this was interference by unlawful means with its contractual or business relations or a breach of its equitable right to confidentiality in photographic images of the wedding.

In ''[[Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young]]'' [2005] IRLR 964 two employees of a property company, in breach of their contracts, diverted a development opportunity to a joint venture in which they were interested. The defendant, knowing of their duties but wrongly thinking that they would not be in breach, facilitated the acquisition by providing finance. The company says that he is liable for the tort of wrongfully inducing breach of contract.}}

==Judgment==

{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}

Elaborating on the general principle that an agent cannot be sued for interfering with contractual relationships between a principal and another contracting party, Lord Hoffmann held that invalidly appointed receivers were not liable to the company for wrongful interference with contractual relations. Such a receiver acting in good faith employs no unlawful means and intends to cause no loss. Intangible property cannot be the subject of a claim for conversion.

On the tort of inducing or procuring breach of contract, there are five requirements. (1) there must be a contract (2) the contract must be breached (3) the defendant's conduct must have procured or induced the breach (4) the defendant must have known about the breached term or turned a blind eye to it, and (5) the defendant must have actually realised that the conduct procuring the breach would have that result.&lt;ref&gt;[2008] 1 AC 1, per Lord Hoffmann at [39]-[44] and per Lord Nicholls at [191]-[193] and [202].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], '''open carry''' refers to the practice of "openly carrying a [[firearm]] in public", as distinguished from [[concealed carry]], where firearms cannot be seen by the casual observer. To "carry" in this context indicates that the firearm is kept readily accessible on the person, within a holster or attached to a sling. "Carrying" a firearm directly in the hands, particularly in a firing position or combat stance, is also known as "brandishing" and may constitute a serious crime, but that is not the mode of "carrying" discussed in this article.

The practice of open carry, where gun owners openly carry firearms while they go about their daily business, has seen an increase in the U.S. in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2010/feb/28/gun-supporters-cheer-starbucks-policy-ar-76042/ |agency=Associated Press |title=Gun supporters cheer Starbucks policy |quote= Even in some "open carry" states, businesses are allowed to ban guns in their stores.

Gun-control advocates have been pushing to quash the movement, including by petitioning the Starbucks coffee chain to ban guns on its premises. Anti-gun activists gathered at the original Starbucks in Seattle to push retailers like the coffee chain to ban customers from openly carrying guns, WSJ's Nick Wingfield reports.  Businesses have the final say on their property. But the ones that don't opt to ban guns – such as Starbucks – have become parade grounds of sorts for open-carry advocates. |accessdate=2010-03-11 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Vanessa | last1=O'Connell | first2=Julie | last2=Jargon | date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been marked by a number of organized events intended to increase the visibility of open carry and public awareness about the practice.&lt;ref name="urlGun-rightsSan Jose Mercury News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14524201 |title=Gun-rights activists to descend on downtown Palo Alto |publisher= San Jose Mercury News |quote = Today, a group of gun-rights advocates will exercise their Second Amendment rights by congregating in the plaza with unloaded firearms in plain view.

Don't expect any '60s-style confrontations with authorities, however. Palo Alto officials said Friday they will not attempt to enforce the city's ordinance, since it is superseded by state law allowing people to carry guns openly as long as they're not loaded.

;Open carry: The act of publicly carrying a firearm on one's person in plain sight.
;Plain sight: Broadly defined as not being hidden from common observation; varies somewhat from state to state. Some states specify that open carry occurs when the weapon is "partially visible," while other jurisdictions require the weapon to be "fully visible" to be considered carried openly.
;Loaded weapon:  Definition varies from state to state. Depending on state law, a weapon may be considered "loaded" under one of the following criteria:
*Only when a live round of ammunition is in the [[Chamber (firearms)|firing chamber]] of the weapon
*When a magazine with ammunition is inserted into the firearm, regardless of whether or not a round is in the chamber
*When a person has both the firearm and its ammunition in his or her possession (or readily accessible, in some instances), without regard as to whether a round is in the chamber or a magazine with ammunition is inserted into the firearm (most common legal definition in "gun-control" states)
;Preemption: In the context of open carry: the act of a state legislature passing laws which limit or eliminate the ability of local governments to regulate the possession or carrying of firearms.
;Prohibited persons: This refers to people who are prohibited by law from carrying a firearm. Typical examples are [[felony|felons]], those convicted of a [[misdemeanor]] of [[domestic violence]], those found to be [[Substance dependence|addicted to alcohol or drugs]], those who have been involuntarily committed to a [[mental institution]], and those who have been [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] from the [[United States Armed Forces]].

===Categories of law===
Today in the United States, the laws vary from state to state regarding open carry of firearms. The categories are defined as follows:
[[File:JACK HILLIARD, DEER HUNTER, WEARS HIS HANDGUN WHILE PLAYING POKER AT THE HUNTERS' CAMP. HE USES IT TO KILL... - NARA - 546136.tif|thumb|right|A hunter carrying a revolver in a visible rear holster.]]
;Permissive open carry states: a state has passed full preemption of all firearms laws, with few exceptions. They do not prohibit open carry for all nonprohibited citizens and do not require a permit or license to open carry. Open carry is lawful on foot and in a [[motor vehicle]].
;Permissive open carry with local restriction states: a state that generally allows open carry without a license, but additional restrictions may exist on non-license holders such as local restrictions or additional restricted locations or modes of carry. Some states exempt license holders from local restrictions while others don't.
;Licensed open carry states: a state has passed full preemption of all firearms laws, with few exceptions. They permit open carry of a handgun to all nonprohibited citizens once they have been issued a permit or license. Open carry of a handgun is lawful on foot and in a motor vehicle. In practice however, some of these states that have ''May-Issue'' licensing laws can be regarded as ''Non-Permissive'' for open carry, as issuing authorities rarely or never grant licenses to ordinary citizens.
;Anomalous open carry states: open carry is generally prohibited except in unincorporated areas of counties in which population densities are below statutorily-defined thresholds, and local authorities have enacted legislation to allow open carry with a permit in such jurisdictions (California). Thus, some local jurisdictions may permit open carry, and others may impose varying degrees of restrictions or prohibit open carry entirely.
;Nonpermissive open carry states: open carry of a handgun is not lawful or is lawful only under such a limited set of circumstances that public carry is effectively prohibited. They may include when one is hunting or traveling to/from hunting locations, on property controlled by the person carrying, or for lawful self-defense. Additionally, some states with ''May-Issue'' licensing laws are nonpermissive when issuing authorities are highly restrictive in the issuance of licenses allowing open carry.

As such, the state's courts have generally ruled that issuing authorities must grant pistol permits to qualified individuals who have passed a criminal and mental health background check and completed the required firearms safety training.

The AG responds, "the carrying of an exposed handgun is not illegal, except as provided in LSA R.S. 14:95.1." And citing City of Shreveport V. Curry and City of Shreveport V. Bukhett, 357 S.2d 1078, (LA. 1978), the AG states: "It is the opinion of this office that the state statutes aforementioned have the purpose of establishing a general scheme to control weapons (handguns) and that a fair reading of those statutes show this would constitute an area in which the state has pre-empted [sic] the legislative control and has implicitly authorized the carrying of unconcealed weapons. Therefore, an ordinance enacted by a Parish and/or Municipality requlating [sic] the carrying of exposed handguns would be without effect as being in conflict with State Law."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laopencarry.org/print/AG_Opinion_78_795.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Constitutional implications==
Open carry has never been authoritatively addressed by the United States Supreme Court. The most obvious predicate for a federal "right" to do so would arise under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
 
In 2018, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in ''[[Young v. Hawaii]]'', published a decision that the open carry of firearms by Americans is a constitutional right.  
 
In the majority opinion in the case of ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote concerning the entirety of the elements of the Second Amendment; "We find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation." However, Scalia continued, "Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited."

It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."&lt;ref name="scalia_opinion"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf | title = District of Columbia, et al., v. Dick Anthony Heller. 554 U.S. ____ (2008) | accessdate = 2010-02-19 | date = 2008-06-26 | publisher = United States Supreme Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty five [[U.S. state|states']] constitutions recognize and secure the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to keep and bear arms]] in some form, and none of those prohibit the open carrying of firearms. Five state constitutions provide that the state legislature may regulate the manner of keeping or bearing arms, and advocates argue that none rule out open carry specifically. Nine states' constitutions indicate that the ''concealed'' carrying of firearms may be regulated and/or prohibited by the state legislature.&lt;ref name="volokh_article"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v11n1/Volokh.pdf | title = State constitutional rights to keep and bear arms | accessdate = 2014-02-08 | date = 2006-12-22 | publisher = The Texas Review of Law &amp; Politics | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020145426/http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v11n1/Volokh.pdf | archivedate = 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open carry advocates argue that, by exclusion, open carrying of arms may ''not'' be legislatively controlled in these states. But this is not settled law.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Section 1.7&lt;ref&gt;Seventh: The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the General Assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons.&lt;/ref&gt; of Kentucky's state constitution only empowers the state to enact laws prohibiting "concealed carry".

In 2015, former Florida congressman [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] opined, regarding the 2015 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', "Using the same 'due process clause' argument as the Supreme Court just applied to gay marriage, my concealed carry permit must now be recognized as valid in all 50 states and the District of Columbia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allenbwest.com/2015/06/yeehaw-this-side-effect-of-the-gay-marriage-ruling-will-make-liberals-explode/|title=YEEhaw!

The most obvious example is the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. One day, this Court will have to explain how sweeping restrictions on every aspect of firearms ownership and use can be upheld yet traditional and long-standing regulations on marriage cannot be tolerated in any form or in any jurisdiction.}} Greendorfer's argument was subsequently expanded in his paper, "After Obergefell: Dignity for the Second Amendment", 35 Miss.

* The legality of open carry of certain firearms in Virginia was reaffirmed after several 2004 incidents in which citizens openly carrying firearms were confronted by local law enforcement.

* In 2008, Clachelle and Kevin Jensen, of Utah, were photographed together openly carrying handguns in the [[Salt Lake City International Airport]] near a "no weapons" sign.

* In 2008, Zachary Mead was detained in [[Richmond County, Georgia]] by law enforcement for openly carrying a firearm. The weapon was seized.

* In 2008, Brad Krause of [[West Allis, Wisconsin]] was arrested by police for alleged disorderly conduct while openly carrying a firearm while planting a tree on his property.

* On April 20, 2009, Wisconsin Attorney General [[J.B. Van Hollen]] issued a memorandum to district attorneys stating that open carry was legal and in and of itself does not warrant a charge of disorderly conduct. Milwaukee police chief Ed Flynn instructed his officers to take down anyone with a firearm, take the gun away, and then determine if the individual could legally carry it until they could make sure the situation is safe.&lt;ref name="urlWISN Milwaukee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisn.com/cnn-news/19235901/detail.html |title=Police Stop Man For Carrying Gun Out In Open |quote=He said many departments are asking questions about how to deal with people openly carrying firearms. He said it may end up being a community-by-community, case-by-case issue fraught with the potential for danger. "Now, with open carry, which is legal, there may be no training. I could hand you my handgun, you could walk down the street carrying it with no training whatsoever. To me, there is a lot more danger now with people thinking, 'I have the right to carry it so I'm going to carry it, and not have the training,'" Banaszynski said. Guns are still prohibited in schools and any private property owner, including businesses, can ban firearms from their property. |accessdate=2010-03-10 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On February 5, 2017, two self admitted open carry political activists, James Craig Baker and Brandon Vreeland, walked into a [[Dearborn, Michigan]] police station in order to protest what they felt was unfair profiling from an earlier traffic stop which had resulted from a 911 call after Baker had been seen near local businesses armed and dressed in tactical gear. When Baker entered the police station he was carrying an assault rifle at the "low ready" position, meaning it could be raised and fired at a moment's notice, with a fully loaded and inserted magazine. Baker was also wearing tactical gear and a [[ski mask]]. Vreeland was not armed, but was wearing body armor and carrying a camera on a tripod. The police on duty in the station immediately sounded an alarm that there was a possible [[active shooter]] in the lobby and the two activist were approached from all sides by police with guns drawn. Baker was ordered to set down his rifle and get on the floor, which he did so after a few minor protests. Vreeland, however, angrily confronted the police, stating he was not armed and only had a camera. He refused to comply with officer instructions and was tackled after several warnings to which he replied "fuck you". The two men were arrested and initially charged with misdemeanor crimes, including brandishing a weapon and disturbing the peace. These charges were later upgraded to felonies in court, partially due to a post investigation which revealed e-mails and text messages between the two men in which they discussed deliberately provoking police, staging incidents to incite lethal force situations, as well as discussing how to elude capture should police attempt to arrest them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/misdemeanors-dismissed-felony-charges-issued-for-men-in-open-carry-case-at-dearborn-police-station "Dearborn police station open carry case: Men now face felony charges"] (24 Feb 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Vreeland was eventually convicted on one count of carrying a concealed weapon, one count of felony resisting and opposing an officer, and one count of disturbing the peace. Baker was convicted on a single count of carrying a concealed weapon. Vreeland received a prison sentence of nine months to five years, and began serving his sentence at the [[Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center]] in the fall of 2017. Baker received time in county jail and three years probation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2017/08/18/open-carry-advocates-sentenced/ "Open-Carry Advocates Who Entered Dearborn PD With Guns, Camera Sentenced"] (18 Aug 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/men-who-walked-into-dearborn-police-station-armed-with-guns-tactical-vests-sentenced "Men who walked into Dearborn police station armed with guns, tactical vests sentenced"] (18 Aug 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wxyz.com/news/open-carry-activists-who-walked-into-dearborn-pd-armed-to-be-sentenced "Open carry activists who walked into Dearborn PD armed to be sentenced"] (18 Aug 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity in state laws==
{{As of|2018}}, 45 states allowed open carry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.opencarry.org/maps/map-open-carry-of-a-properly-holstered-loaded-handgun/|title=Open Carry|date=2012-09-24|work=OpenCarry.org|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/nov/18/marion-hammer/there-are-45-states-allow-open-carry-handguns-form/|title=How many states allow open carry for firearms?|work=@politifact|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the details vary widely.

Four states, the Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the [[District of Columbia]] fully prohibit the open carry of handguns. On the other extreme, twenty-five states permit open carry of a handgun without requiring the citizen to apply for any permit or license. Fifteen states require some form of permit (often the same permit as allows a person to carry [[concealed carry|concealed]]), and the remaining five states, though not prohibiting the practice in general, do not preempt local laws or law enforcement policies, and/or have significant restrictions on the practice, such as prohibiting it within the boundaries of an incorporated urban area. Illinois allows open carry on private property only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K24-1.6|title=Illinois Compiled Statutes|publisher=Ilga.gov|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2011, California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed into law that it would be a "misdemeanor to openly carry an exposed and unloaded handgun in public or in a vehicle." This does not apply to the open carry of rifles or long guns or persons in rural areas where permitted by ordinance.

On November 1, 2011, Wisconsin explicitly acknowledged the legality of open carry by amending its disorderly conduct statute (Wis. Stat. 947.01). A new subsection 2 states "Unless other facts and circumstances that indicate a criminal or malicious intent on the part of the person apply, a person is not in violation of, and may not be charged with a violation of, this section for loading, carrying, or going armed with a firearm, without regard to whether the firearm is loaded or is concealed or openly carried."

On May 15, 2012, Oklahoma Governor [[Mary Fallin]] signed Senate Bill 1733, an amendment to the Oklahoma Self Defense Act, which will allow people with Oklahoma concealed weapons permits to open carry if they so choose. The law took effect November 1, 2012. "Under the measure, businesses may continue to prohibit firearms to be carried on their premises. SB 1733 prohibits carrying firearms on properties owned or leased by the city, state or federal government, at corrections facilities, in schools or college campuses, liquor stores and at sports arenas during sporting events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/3675750|title=Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signs open-carry gun bill into law|date=15 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Gun Free School Zones Act==
The Federal [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990]] limits where a person may legally carry a firearm by generally prohibiting carry within 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft of the property line of any K-12 school in the nation, with private property excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handgunlaw.us/documents/batf_school_zone.pdf |title=BATFE letter threatening prosecution of CCW permit holders. |format=PDF|publisher=Handgunlaw.us |date= |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state-issued permit to carry may exempt a person from the restriction depending on the laws of the state, and most issuing states qualify for the exception. However, according to the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the exception in federal law is inapplicable to permit holders outside the state that physically issued their permit, and it does not exempt people with out-of-state permits even if the permit is recognized by state reciprocity agreements. [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Batfe2002letter_gfsza1995_ccw.pdf BATFE letter explaining reciprocity of CCW permit holders and how it applies to Gun-Free School Zones.]

In a 1995 Supreme Court case, the Act was declared unconstitutional: "The Court today properly concludes that the Commerce Clause does not grant Congress the authority to prohibit gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school, as it attempted to do in the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4844." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18310045251039502778&amp;scilh=0 |title=United States v.

The law was reenacted in the slightly different form, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunlaws.com/Gun_Free_School_Zones_Act.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gun Free School Zones Act – as reenacted|publisher=Gunlaws.com|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5870">[[File:Outer Temple 20130414 063.jpg|thumb|The Outer Temple, Fleet Street]]

The '''Outer Temple''' is a building next to [[Temple, London|the Temple]] in London, just outside the [[City of London]]. It has been suggested that it was once an [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]]; its historical existence was first posited by [[A. W. B. Simpson]] and confirmed by [[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] in 2008. Little is known of it, other than that it lacked a hall; Baker suggests that this is the reason that it did not survive long enough to appear in many records. Other writers have insisted that it was never an inn: [[George Buck|Sir George Buck]] wrote in 1612 "the Utter Temple neither is nor was ever any college or society of students."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Bellot (1902), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is believed that the Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the [[Inns of Court]]. During the 12th and 13th century the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened which destroyed this form of legal education – firstly a [[papal bull]] in 1218 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the law, and secondly decrees by [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London&lt;ref name=watt5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the system of legal education fell apart, and the lawyers instead settled immediately outside the City of London as close as possible to [[Westminster Hall]], where the [[Magna Carta]] provided for a permanent court. This was the small village of [[Holborn]], where they inhabited "hostels" or "inns", which later took their name from the landlord of the Inn in question.&lt;ref name=watt5&gt;Watt (1928) P.5&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Temple, London|Temple]] was confiscated from the [[Knights Templar]] in 1312, [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] divided it between the Inner Temple and Outer Temple, being the parts of the Temple within and without the boundaries of the City of London. (The Inner Temple was in turn divided in two in 1337, the eastern part continuing to be called Inner Temple and the western part becoming known as Middle Temple. They were each leased to lawyers in 1346.)&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
While [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]] wrote of ten Inns of Chancery, each one attached to an [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]] "like Maids of Honour to a Princess",&lt;ref name=watt9&gt;Watt (1928) P.9&lt;/ref&gt; only nine were well known.&lt;ref&gt;Loftie (1895) p.252&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the tenth as Outer Temple was first suggested by [[A. W. B. Simpson]], who discovered a reference to a [[barrister]] named William Halle in the year books of the [[Serjeant-at-Law|Serjeants-at-Law]] who was said to have come from the Outer Temple. At the time, Simpson debated whether it was a reference to a historical institution or simply a geographical address. In 2008 [[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] argued that it was most likely an institution with a discovery in the [[plea rolls]] of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] of a barrister who claimed to be a "fellow of the [Outer] Temple".&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2008) p.386&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 John Baker discovered another member of the Outer Temple, Richard Palmer, who was sued in the Court of Common Pleas in 1523 and described as of the Exterior or Outer Temple, London.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2013), Postscript to “The Inn of the Outer Temple”, in Collected Papers&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this theory overlooks the existence of St George's Inn, a tenth inn of chancery which existed until the late 15th century, when it was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 24-25; 238&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Outer Temple was ever anything more than a barristers' chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patent analysis''' is a family of techniques and tools for studying the information present within and attached to [[patents]], a major form of [[intellectual property]]. 
Although this has traditionally been done using spreadsheet-based [[data analysis]] methods, the field of intellectual property has witnessed a surge in the availability of software-based patent analysis tools.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The cost structure of most patent analysis tools varies from [[freemium]] business models to annual [[subscriptions]].

[[Image:Pets Place Nijmegen.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A typical pet store in [[Nijmegen]], [[Netherlands]].]]
A '''pet store''' or '''pet shop''' is a retail business which sells different kinds of animals to the public. A variety of animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops. The products sold include: food, treats, toys, collars, leashes, cat litter, cages and aquariums. Some pet stores provide engraving services for pet tags, which have the owner’s contact information in case the pet gets lost.

In the United States and Canada, pet shops often offer both hygienic care (such as pet cleaning) and esthetic services (such as cat and [[dog grooming]]). [[Personal grooming|Grooming]] is the process by which a dog or cat's physical appearance is enhanced and kept according to breed standards for competitive [[breed]] showing, for other types of competition, like creative grooming or pet tuning contests, or just to their owners taste. Some pet stores also provide tips on training and behaviour, as well as advice on pet nutrition.

There are many large pet stores located in the US and Canada, including: [[Petland]], Pet Valu, and [[PetSmart]]. In the United States, [[Petco]] is also a popular pet store. In addition, there are many smaller pet shops that aren't part of big chains, such as Big Al’s and [[Pet Food Express]], which have a smaller number of locations.

Pet stores are extremely popular in today’s society. In 2004, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, in the pet industry, live animal sales reached approximately $1.6 billion. Moreover, in a 2003 survey in the US, merely 38% of U.S. pet shops claimed that they did not sell any live animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Fast Facts about Pet Shops|url=http://www.bornfreeusa.org/facts.php?more=1&amp;p=447|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{undue|date=September 2015}}
A major concern with pet stores and the reason why puppies and kittens may not be sold in certain stores anymore is largely due to puppy mills. [[Puppy mill]]s are commercial dog breeding businesses that breed dogs primarily for profit, often with little regard for animal welfare. According to the Puppy Mill Project "more than 2.5 million puppies are born in puppy mills each year" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Puppy Mills|url=http://www.petsmart.com/learn-the-truth-about-puppy-mills/|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitten mills are not as widely known as puppy mills, but they still do exist. The animals in these mills are kept in tiny, unsanitary cages, receive little to no nourishment, and often receive no veterinary care. Some cities in Canada, such as Toronto, have altogether banned the sale of cats and dogs in pet stores in order to put an end to this animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Criger|first=Erin|title=Toronto bans the sale of cats and dogs in pet stores|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2011/09/21/toronto-bans-the-sale-of-cats-and-dogs-in-pet-stores/|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada and the US, another area of concern regarding pet stores is the laws that guide pet stores. In the US, there are no federal laws in place that protect animals in retail pet stores. There are state laws to protect animals, however they all vary and some are not sufficient. In twenty states plus D.C., a license is required before being able to manage a pet store. The welfare of animals in pet shops also relies heavily on the veterinary care available to them. In the United States, there are only 16 states that enforce veterinary care laws in pet stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Ashley|title=Brief Overview of Retail Pet Stores|url=http://www.animallaw.info/articles/qvusretailpetstores.htm|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ontario, Canada the Provincial Animal Welfare Act states that the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has the authorization to examine places where animals are kept for sale, including pet shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario's Animal Protection Law Strongest In Canada|url=http://news.ontario.ca/mcscs/en/2009/03/ontarios-animal-protection-law-strongest-in-canada.html|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer science==
In [[computer science]], a "pet store program" is an example of how to use a particular [[software framework]] or set of [[library (computing)|libraries]] to build a real program. Its concept is similar to the [[Hello world program]]. It has been made popular by [[Sun Microsystems]] for illustrating [[Java EE]], and many other vendors  followed.

The '''Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions''' (Commission proposal COM(2002) 92),&lt;ref name= "COM(2002)92"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52002PC0092:EN:NOT Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]&lt;/ref&gt; procedure number 2002/0047 (COD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=172020 PreLex – Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]&lt;/ref&gt; was a proposal for a [[European Union]] (EU) [[European Union directive|directive]] aimed to harmonise national patent laws and practices concerning the granting of [[software patent|patents for computer-implemented inventions]], provided they meet certain criteria.

The proposal became a major focus for conflict between those who regarded the proposed directive as a way to codify the case law of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office]] (unrelated to the EU institutions) in the sphere of computing, and those who asserted that the directive is an extension of the [[patentability]] sphere, not just a harmonisation, that ideas are not patentable and that the expression of those ideas is already adequately protected by the law of [[copyright]].

Following several years of debate and numerous conflicting amendments to the proposal, the proposal was rejected on 6 July 2005 by the [[European Parliament]] by an overwhelming majority of 648 to 14 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5884 Patents Directive killed by European Parliament], OUT-LAW News, 06/07/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Original draft===
On 20 February 2002, the [[European Commission]] initiated a proposal&lt;ref name= "COM(2002)92"/&gt; for a [[European Union directive|directive]] to codify and "harmonise" the different EU national patent laws and cement the practice of the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] of granting patents for computer-implemented inventions provided they meet certain criteria (cf. [[software patents under the European Patent Convention]]). The directive also took on the role of excluding "business methods" from patentability (in contrast with the [[Software patents under United States patent law|situation under United States law]]), because business methods as such are not patentable under the different European national patent laws or under the [[European Patent Convention]].

Opponents of the original directive claimed that it was a thinly disguised attempt to make all software patentable. Supporters, however, argued that this was not the case since the proposal&lt;ref name= "COM(2002)92"/&gt; explained in several locations (pages 11, 14, 24, 25) that there should be no extension to the existing scope of patentability for computer programs and that pure business methods implemented in software would not be patentable. Only computer programs which provided a "technical contribution" would be patentable.

This reliance on the word "technical" was an important weakness in the directive, since it is not a word that has a well-defined meaning, and a "technical contribution" was only defined as being "a contribution to the state of the art in a technical field which is not obvious to a person skilled in the art." (See Article 2 of the proposal).&lt;ref name= "COM(2002)92"/&gt; Nevertheless, the term has been used as a benchmark for what is and is not patentable by the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] and by individual national Patent Offices and courts in Europe (particularly the [[Software patents under United Kingdom patent law|United Kingdom]] and Germany) since the early 1980s. A general understanding of its meaning can be gleaned from studying the resulting case law, summarised in [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention]]. The subsequent failure of the European Parliament to develop an acceptable definition of what was meant by the word technical illustrates the difficulty inherent in attempting to do so.

=== Transformation by the European Parliament ===
On 24 September 2003, the [[European Parliament]] passed the directive in a heavily amended form,&lt;ref&gt;[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/index.en.html Europarl 2003-09-24: Amended Software Patent Directive], ''Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure'', accessed 7 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which placed significant limits on the patentability of software. The most significant changes included:
* a definition of the "technicity" requirement for patentability which distinguishes between abstract information-processing processes and specific kinds of physical processes (only the latter are "technical");
* a blanket rule that patents cannot be used to prevent [[interoperability]] between computer systems.

[[Patent attorney]] Axel H. Horns, however, voiced concern that Parliament's wording might extend the ban on software patents to inventions potentially implementable in software, such as signal processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://216.92.57.242/patentepi/data/040901SoftPat-10-FINAL.pdf "The Protection of Software and the Crisis of the Patent System"], Axel H. Horns, p8,15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, these amendments were supported almost unanimously by small parties on both the right and left, while the larger groupings ([[Party of European Socialists|socialists]], [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|liberals]] and [[European People's Party|conservatives]]) were all split, with the balance of socialists leaning in favour of amendment and the balance of conservatives leaning against.

Parliament's amendments were a major defeat for the directive's original proponents. Rather than confirming the practice of granting patents for computer programs which provide a technical contribution, the revised directive placed substantial limits on patentability.

=== Reversion by the Council of Ministers ===
Under the [[codecision procedure]], both the European Parliament and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] (representing national Governments) must approve a text in identical terms in order for a proposal to become law. On 18 May 2004, the Council agreed in an advisory vote to resubmit to Parliament what was described as a "[[compromise]] version" of the proposal. The agreed version permitted patenting of computer-implemented inventions (providing the inventions have a "technical character") and overturned most of Parliament's amendments. Critics of the Directive argued that the "technical character" requirement was open to too much interpretation and could lead to almost unlimited patentability of software. Proponents, also, felt that the amended version contained too many ambiguities to be capable of meeting the original purpose of the Directive, which was to harmonise the law across Europe. Nevertheless, the Council formally approved this resolution on 7 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4325215.stm "EU ministers endorse patent law"], ''BBC News''.&lt;/ref&gt; The revised proposal was resubmitted to Parliament.

=== Developments between first Parliament decision and Council decision ===
Subsequently, in an unprecedented move, the Dutch national parliament passed a motion requesting that the nation's ministerial representative on the Council, [[Laurens Jan Brinkhorst]], change his vote on the Council's version of the directive, from "in favour" to abstention. Brinkhorst stated that he would not do this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=16984 "Dutch Parliament causes EU software patents crisis"], ''The Inquirer'', accessed 7 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's confirmation (or otherwise) of its President's "compromise" had also been delayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/3378 "EU software patents directive delayed"], ''iDABC eGovernment News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poland|Polish]] government announced on 16 November 2004, that it could not "support the text that was agreed upon by Council on 18 May 2004".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/Article?tcmuri=tcm:29-132419-16&amp;type=News "Software patents law up in the air after Poland pull out"], ''EuroActiv.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; A joint press release by the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]], the [[Internet Society]] Poland, and NoSoftwarePatents.com, supported the concerns of opponents of the Council directive, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;at a meeting hosted by the Polish government on the 5th of this month, everyone including representatives of the Polish Patent Office, SUN, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, as well as various patent lawyers, confirmed that the present proposal of the EU Council does make all software potentially patentable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swpat.ffii.org/news/04/cons1117/index.en.html "Poland Does Not Support Current Proposal for EU Software Patent Directive"], Joint Press Release Foundation a Free Information Infrastructure, Internet Society Poland, Nosoftwarepatents.com. Released December 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 7 December 2004, the Belgian Minister of Economic Affairs, [[Marc Verwilghen]], stated that no Council decision would be taken until 2005 "for the reason that the [[Qualified Majority Voting|qualified majority]] does not exist anymore". However, amid rumours of a change in the Polish position, the 13–15 December meeting of the Council's [[COREPER|Committee of Permanent Representatives]] determined that a qualified majority appeared to exist, and that the Council's revised version of the directive would be scheduled for formal adoption by the Council, without further debate, probably at the Agricultures and Fisheries Council meeting on the 21 and 22 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/04/st15/st15967.en04.pdf 2077th meeting of the permanent representatives committee (Part 1)]. Meeting minutes: held Monday 13 (11.00) and Wednesday 15 (10.15) December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements expressing reservations were attached to this Common Position by [[Belgium]] (which abstained), France (which hoped for further changes to the directive), the [[Netherlands]] (where the parliament requested their representative vote against), Poland (which was opposed until recent diplomatic pressure), [[Hungary]] and [[Latvia]]. Germany was ambivalent, saying that the text of the directive could benefit from improvements.

Due to the expressed reservations and especially to opposition from Poland, whose Minister of Science and Information Technology made a special journey to Brussels to demand that the directive be dropped from the agenda, the Council's vote was postponed "indefinitely".

Meanwhile, a group of 61 MEPs from 13 countries tabled a "motion for a resolution" to restart the entire legislative process. On 2 February 2005, JURI, the Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, voted 19–1 in favour of asking the Commission to withdraw the directive and restart the process.

The next day, [[Nicolas Schmit]], deputy foreign minister of [[Luxembourg]] (which at that time chaired the Council), said that he would instead ask the Council to formally adopt the draft directive at a meeting on 17 February. Although [[Poland]] stated it would only oppose this if other countries raised an objection, reports of opposition from [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and Spain ensured that the common position was not on the agenda for that meeting of the Commission.

On 17 February, Parliament's Conference of Presidents (the President of the Parliament and the leaders of the political groups) approved JURI's request to restart the process, and agreed to pass the request to the European Commission. On 24 February, a plenary session of the European Parliament reinforced this message, inviting the Commission to reconsider, but on 28 February the Commission refused the parliament's request.

The "common position" reappeared on the agenda of the Council's 7 March meeting as an "A-item" for adoption without discussion. At the Competitiveness meeting of the Council, Denmark requested that this be removed. The President of the Council, seemingly in breach of the Council's procedures, opposed this, "for administrative reasons" and because it would defeat the logic of the directive. The Danish representative accepted this at face value, declined to object formally, and entered Denmark's objections into the record. The common position was thus adopted without debate, and referred to the European Parliament for a second reading, with dissenting statements and caveats from a number of countries. In the event, only Spain had actually voted against: [[Austria]], Belgium and Italy abstained (which has the same effect as voting against, given the way [[Qualified Majority Voting]] works).

=== Second reading in Parliament ===
In June 2005, the legal affairs committee of the European Parliament discussed the directive and rejected plans for a complete overhaul of the directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+NR-20050621-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN Europarl News Report (21-06-2005): Latest on computerised inventions]&lt;/ref&gt; The vote by the committee took place on 21 June 2005, and narrowly decided not to substantially amend the Council version of the directive. According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', this "vote marks a turning point in the protracted battle over the law, which has split the software industry and sparked severe recriminations."&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Buck, [http://news.ft.com/cms/s/329cb864-e1bb-11d9-9460-00000e2511c8.html "IT groups win EU ruling on patents"], ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|European Parliament rejects computer-implemented inventions directive}}
On 5 July 2005, the committee's report passed to a plenary session of Parliament for debate by all MEPs. On 6 July 2005, Parliament rejected the proposal by a very large majority (648 in favour of rejection, 14 against and 18 registered abstentions out of 729 total MEPS) without considering any of the other 175 proposed amendments. Under the [[codecision procedure]], the legislative process ended with this rejection and the proposed directive did not become law in any form. This was the first and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} the only time a directive was ever rejected by Parliament at second reading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2005/07/06/afx2124971.html "EU parliament votes against software patents bill – EU commission"], ''Forbes.com''; [http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&amp;sid=a.QckuA8V3H8&amp;refer=home "European Parliament Rejects Law on Software Patents (Update1)"], ''Bloomberg.com''; Jan Sliva, [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8B5RKT80.htm?campaign_id=apn_tech_down "Europe Parliament nixes software patent law"], ''BusinessWeek Online''; [http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=internetNews&amp;storyID=2005-07-06T185910Z_01_KNE576495_RTRIDST_0_OUKIN-TECH-EU-PATENTING.XML "EU assembly throws out bill to harmonise patents"], ''Reuters''; "[[n:European Parliament rejects software patents|European Parliament rejects software patents]]", ''WikiNews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote was the result of a compromise between the different parties: those in favour of software patents feared a text that would heavily limit its scope, while those against rejected the whole principle. Heavy defeat was the "least worst option" to both sides. In addition, some saw the defeat as an expression of Parliament's indignation about the handling of the proposal by the [[Council of the European Union]] and the European Commission as well as its concerns about the content of the proposal itself.

=== Consequences of the rejection ===
Parliament's decision to strike down the final draft has the effect that national laws will not be harmonised. National legislatures may continue to enact laws allowing patents on computer-implemented inventions, should they wish to do so, and national courts may enforce such laws. The [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]], which is not legally bound by any EU directive but generally adapts its regulations to new EU law, has no reason or incentive to adapt its practice of granting patents on computer-implemented inventions under certain conditions, according to its interpretation of the [[European Patent Convention]] and its Implementing Regulations.

== Reactions ==
=== Supporters of the proposal ===
Supporters of the proposed directive included [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and the European Patent Office.

The [[European Information and Communication Technology Association]] (EICTA) stated that the directive "is extremely important for the future of innovation in Europe as it concerns two-thirds of all inventions in the European hi-tech industry".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,1351216,00.html Europe patent row 'threatens jobs and invention' | Business | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This position was characterised by opponents of software patents as "dominated by patent lawyers from the patent arms of large corporate members",&lt;ref&gt;[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/eicta/index.en.html EICTA and Software Patents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "most of which qualifying as non-European companies"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060222105108/http://wiki.ael.be/index.php/AgoriaRepresentativity AEL (Association Electronique Libre) WikiWiki – Agoria Representativity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and "with a patent policy (...) tailored to the special interests of a few large corporations (...)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/politics/organizations.html No Software Patents!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the heavily modified draft directive was finally rejected, EICTA's Director General said, "This is a wise decision that has helped industry to avoid legislation that could have narrowed the scope of patent legislation in Europe. ... Parliament has today voted for the status quo, which preserves the current system that has served well the interests of our 10,000 member companies, both large and small."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5884 Patents Directive killed by European Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opponents of the proposal ===
The proposal provoked public disagreement by diverse opponents of [[software patent]]s, who argued that software patents were neither economically desirable nor mandated by [[TRIPS|international law]]. The [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]] and the [[EuroLinux]] Alliance played key roles in co-ordinating this campaign, which drew support from some [[free software]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] programmers, some academics, some small business groups, and some [[proprietary software]] developers. Many of these organisations expressed concern over what they saw as abuses of the software patent system in the USA, and argued that although some software patents might be beneficial, the net effect of the Commission's proposals would be to suppress innovation and dampen legitimate competition. The opponent's campaign in its turn was characterised by supporters of the directive as "a small but highly organised and vocal lobby",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-4814 Software patents in Europe: debunking the myths | OUT-LAW.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-4835 Software patents in Europe: response to an attorney | OUT-LAW.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with EICTA stating that "Those who depict the draft directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as some sort of 'software patent law' are at best misinformed and at worst dishonest, malicious and disrespectful of the European democratic process".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5051 Support for Europe's software patent Directive], OUT-LAW News, 09/11/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures who have supported the campaign against software patents in Europe include [[Tim Berners-Lee]], developer of the [[World Wide Web]]; [[Florian Müller (author)|Florian Müller]], a [[free software]] [[lobbyist]]; and [[Linus Torvalds]], creator of the [[Linux]] kernel. Politicians opposed to the directive included [[Michel Rocard]].

==Aftermath==
{{main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}
As the directive was rejected, pre-existing law has remained in place, and computer-implemented inventions are currently governed by Article 52 of [[European Patent Convention]]. Article 52 prohibits certain patents, including patents on ''programs for computers'', but only ''as such''. It is often interpreted by [[European Patent Office]] as well as by courts in EU countries, that invention should have ''technical character''. For example, while a mathematical method is not patentable, an electrical filter designed according to this method would not usually be excluded from patentability by Article 52(2) and (3).

Final interpretation of the law in this area thus continues to be the responsibility of national courts, following national case-law (except when a European patent application is refused or when a European patent is revoked in opposition proceedings before the EPO, in which case the EPO has the final say regarding the interpretation of the EPC).

The '''Public Service of Canada''' (known as the '''Civil Service of Canada''' prior to 1967) is the [[civil service]] of the [[Government of Canada]]. Its function is to serve as the staff of the Canadian [[The Crown|Crown]].  The [[Clerk of the Privy Council (Canada)|Clerk of the Privy Council]], as Canada's senior serving civil servant, is head of the Public Service of Canada.

The Public Service is divided into various subsidiary administrative units such as departments, agencies, commissions, [[Crown corporations]], and other federal organizations. Over 40% of the Public Service of Canada is located in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]], although there are employees working at approximately 1,600 locations across Canada. The Public Service of Canada is the country's single largest employer.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Public Service of Canada, as the non-political staff of the "executive branch" of government, is the day to day administration of the state and to the effective implementation of government policy and regulation in accordance with Canadian law. The civil service is responsible to the Crown (state) itself and not the ruling government or political party,

In addition to the fundamental role of carrying out decisions taken by the ruling government, the public service also has a planning role, and may develop proposals and recommendations to Cabinet. It will also provide continued feedback and advice to government in all aspects of governmental affairs.

==Structure==
In 2007, there were approximately 200 departments (e.g., [[Health Canada]]), agencies (e.g., [[Parks Canada]]), commissions (e.g., [[Canadian Grain Commission]]), boards (e.g., [[Veterans Review and Appeal Board]]), councils (e.g., [[Canadian Judicial Council]]) and [[crown corporation]]s (e.g., [[Royal Canadian Mint]]).

In a typical department, it is the [[Minister (government)|minister]] who holds the respective portfolio who has overall responsibility for the management and direction of the department (i.e. the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] holds the Defence Portfolio, which includes many different organisations, one of which being the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]]). The deputy minister is the head of the department and is its senior serving civil servant, and therefore has responsibility for all of the department's day-to-day operations. However, it is always the respective minister who is held [[accountability|accountable]] to [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] for its operations.

A variety of associate and assistant deputy ministers head the various sections of responsibility within a department (i.e. policy, finance and corporate services, environment and infrastructure, etc.). Within the jurisdiction of each Assistant Deputy Minister, is usually one to two Associate Deputy Ministers and beneath them two to five Directors-General who oversee more functional areas of each broad element of the department. Under Directors-General are Directors, who oversee various directorates, which are the core of any department. These directorates constitute the ground level in each department, and are the members of the civil service who implement state decisions, carry out research, and help to formulate proposals.

===Personnel===

====Hiring====
Hiring (or selection) of civil service employees is typically done through a selection process that is either open to employees of the Public Service only (internal) or open to the general public (external). External processes are typically done to recruit a greater number of applicants. Conversely, internal processes may be held for positions where there is considered to be an adequate internal candidates and/or to provide opportunities for advancement within the civil service.

The area of selection varies greatly depending on whether it is conducted as an internal or external process. The latter are open to Canadian citizens nationally, and sometimes internationally.

Since the 2005 coming into force of the 2003 [[Public Service Modernization Act]], selection processes focus less on a rules-based concept of ''best-qualified'', and more on a values-based approach that enables managers to hire qualified and competent individuals whose experience, skills and knowledge are the right fit given the position's current and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada [http://www.psagency-agencefp.gc.ca/arc/hrmm-mgrh/psma-lmfp/centre/topics-sujets/psma-lmfp_e.asp Public Service Modernization Act (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal civil service employees in Canada are employed by the state, but because of Canada's history and formal structure as a monarchy, they are often described as being employed by the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]], who personifies the state and "enjoys a general capacity to contract in accordance with the rule of ordinary law."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David E.; The Invisible Crown; University of Toronto Press; 1995; p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Public Service Modernization Act came into force in 2003, individuals had to take an [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] before they could assume their post.  However, as of December 31, 2005, this is no longer a requirement, with civil servants taking an Oath of Office instead.  

Hiring in the core public administration is governed by the Public Service Employment Act, while other organizations hire independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jobs-emplois.gc.ca/centres/org-eng.htm#nonpsea|title=Other governmental organizations|publisher=[[Public Service Commission of Canada]]|accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September, 2006, there were approximately 260,000 employees within the civil service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppforum.ca/common/assets/publications/en/public_service_21st_century_en.pdf|title=Canada's Public Service in the 21st Century (discussion paper)|pages=6|publisher=[[Public Policy Forum]]|date=April 2007|accessdate=2007-07-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070731110230/http://www.ppforum.ca/common/assets/publications/en/public_service_21st_century_en.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided as follows:

* Federal departments: 180,000
* Federal agencies: 60,000
* Parliamentary officers and administrators: 20,000
Additionally, although not part of the Public Service of Canada, the following 194,000 members were employed by the federal government:

* [[Canadian Armed Forces]] and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP): 106,000
* Federal business enterprises (including crown corporations): 88,000

There are approximately 80 distinct job classifications in the core civil service; most work in policy, operations or administrative functions. About 15% are scientists and professionals, 10% work in technical operations and 2.5% are executives.&lt;ref name="PPForumPG07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppforum.ca/common/assets/publications/en/public_service_21st_century_en.pdf|title=Canada's Public Service in the 21st Century (discussion paper)|pages=7|publisher=Public Policy Forum|date=April 2007|accessdate=2007-07-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070731110230/http://www.ppforum.ca/common/assets/publications/en/public_service_21st_century_en.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 42% of Canadian civil servants work in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] (NCR) (Ottawa-Hull), 24% work elsewhere in [[Ontario]] or [[Quebec]], 21% in [[Western Canada]], and 11% in [[Atlantic Canada]]. Since the headquarters of most agencies are located in the NCR, about 72% of executives work in this area.&lt;ref name="PPForumPG07"/&gt;

Canadian civil servants are also located in more than 180 countries (in the form of foreign service officers) and provide service in 1,600 locations in Canada.

Approximately 80% of federal civil service employees are represented by a bargaining agent (union).  The greatest number of civil servants are members of the [[Public Service Alliance of Canada]]. They negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for blue collar workers, and most administrative staff.

====Gender and ethnicity====
The Canadian Public Service has made significant efforts to reflect the gender balance, [[Language#Linguistic diversity|linguistic]], and [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="PPForumPG08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppforum.ca/common/assets/publications/en/public_service_21st_century_en.pdf|title=Canada's Public Service in the 21st Century (discussion paper)|pages=8|publisher=Public Policy Forum|date=April 2007|accessdate=2007-07-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070731110230/http://www.ppforum.ca/common/assets/publications/en/public_service_21st_century_en.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical timeline==
* Before [[responsible government]], Canada had no real civil service; government officials were appointed by either [[the Crown]] or the colonial administration. These officials usually served for an unspecified period ("during the pleasure of the Crown") for as long as they were deemed fit for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Civilservice-CanadianHistory.htm|title=Civil Service in Canada|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Marionopolis College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1849 - when responsible government began in 1849, there was a recognition that the roles of the political and non-political government officials needed to be defined and distinguished from one another.
* 1868 - the Canada Civil Service Act was enacted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm|title=A Timeline of the Public Service Commission of Canada|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Public Service Commission of Canada |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703131234/http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The "Civil Service Act" of 1882 created a process for examining candidates for the civil service, with a Board of Civil Service Examiners
* 1908 - the Civil Service Amendment Act created the Civil Service Commission, to oversee appointments to government positions (the "inside service").
* The [[Civil Service Act 1918]] brought the outside service under the domain of the Commission, along with greater oversight with regards to appointments and promotions for members of the "inside service".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]]. ''So-Called Experts: How American Consultants Remade the Canadian Civil Service, 1918-1921''.  Institute of Public Administration of Canada, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1920s - the Commission created of a competitive system of examinations for appointment and [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] (a merit system) as a viable alternative to the [[patronage]] system.
* 1921 - formal restrictions were placed against the employment of married women. Women already holding permanent positions who married had to resign. These restrictions were not removed until 1955.
* 1924 - The [[Civil Service Superannuation Act]] was intended to promote and protect a career civil service.
* 1932 - staff control regulations are established and Treasury Board is given authority over the Civil Service Commission's staffing responsibilities.
* 1935-1957 - top-level civil servants wielded enormous influence, typified by [[Oscar D. Skelton]], [[Loring Christie]], and [[Lester B. Pearson]] in external affairs, along with Michael Sharp in finance and [[Gordon Towers]] at the Bank of Canada. &lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein, ''The Ottawa Men: The Civil Service Mandarins 1935-1957'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1949 - the number of [[World War II]] veterans assigned to positions in the civil service under the statutory veterans preference rises to 55,000.
* 1951 - The [[Financial Administration Act of 1951]] provided final authority to the Treasury Board for management (administration and organization) of the public service.
* 1957 - The CSC establishes the Pay Research Bureau to provide objective information on rates of pay and conditions of employment in government and industry, and to recommend salary rates for civil servants.
* 1961 - The new [[Civil Service Act of 1961]] gave civil servants the right of appeal against not only promotions, but also transfers, demotions, suspensions and dismissals.
* 1962 - The Government adopted recommendations by the [[Royal Commission on Government Organization]] (Glassco Commission) on the management of the Public Service, including delegating authority to departments to manage their own personnel and to be held accountable for efficient performance.
* 1966 - [[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] becomes an element of merit in the national capital area.
* 1967 - Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) and Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA) come into effect. The PSEA gave the renamed Public Service Commission the responsibility for all the elements of the staffing process. The PSSRA created a [[collective bargaining]] regime in the civil service.
* Early 1970s - rapid expansion of the public service.
* Late 1970s - significant reduction of public service.

* 1984 - the Commission on Equality in Employment issued its report, which recommended that targets and not quotas are the most effective means of achieving equity in the employment of members of under-represented groups.
* 1986 - further employment layoff programs again reduce the public service.
* 1992 - Public Service Reform Act amends both the PSEA and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. This provides more flexibility for managers to respond quickly to changing operational needs or to allow employees to acquire new skills. The Act also enabled the PSC to prescribe standards of competence to measure merit.
* 1995 - a restraint-focused federal budget leads to further reductions (45,000) in the size of the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/abt-aps/tpsc-hcfp/index-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R. v. Gowan''''' is a March 1998 case tried by the [[Ontario Court of Justice]] which ruled that, while being topless as form of protest and free speech is legal, being topless while one engages in a commercial purpose such as prostitution is illegal.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;R v. Gowan [3 March 1998] Doc. Ottawa 97-20544 (Ontario Court of Justice, Provincial Division).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the case==
On June 3, 1997, 31-year-old [[prostitute]] J. Gowan took her shirt off and bared her breasts on Montreal Road in the [[Ontario]] [[city]] of [[Vanier, Ontario|Vanier]].&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; Afterwards, Gowan held her breasts, pulled her nipples, and asked nearby car drivers several times if they "want to fuck" her.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; On two occasions, Gowan did this while she was leaning into other people's cars during a red light.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; Considering Gowan's behavior—rather than her toplessness itself—to be indecent,  Cecile Couture reported Gowan to the authorities.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

==Ruling==
In her ruling, Judge Jennifer Blishen stated that the evidence indicates that the purpose of Gowan's toplessness and provocative behavior was to engage in [[prostitution]] and that thus, unlike the actions of Ontario woman Gwen Jacob several years earlier, Gowan's toplessness was commercial in nature.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; In addition, Blishen stated that she "cannot find that the community would tolerate the use of a woman's bare breasts in public in order to sell any form of service or product" since "[s]uch conduct would appear to promote the objectification of women and the accompanying social harm."&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; Elaborating on this, Blishen wrote that Gowan's actions "portray women in a humiliating manner as sex objects, with the resulting loss of dignity."&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; Thus,  Blishen found that Gowan's actions constituted an indecent act in a public place contrary to section 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code" and that thus Gowan is "guilty as charged."&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; As a result of her conviction for indecent behavior, Gowan was fined $250.

==Criticism==
In her 2009 book ''Law's Dream of a Common Knowledge'', Mariana Valverde criticized this ruling by arguing that it ensured that "the women who have the best 'lawful excuse,' as law puts it, to go around topless are expressly forbidden from doing so."&lt;ref name="valverde"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P082sl-tM4sC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Law's Dream of a Common Knowledge |first= Mariana|last=Valverde |year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1400825563|page=40|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborating on this, Valverde states that a "new line has been drawn, between the speaking, rational, political woman, who can now bare her breasts even in the presence of unsuspecting children, and the whore of old, who must be covered while outdoors."&lt;ref name="valverde"/&gt;

'''Rees v Sinclair''' [1974] 1 NZLR 180  is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding liability for negligence against lawyers.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It effectively reinforced the English case of [[Rondel v Worsley]] into New Zealand case law.

==Background==
Ree had Sinclair represent him in a court case. Rather ironically, Ree was a retired lawyer himself. Anyway, Ree believed Sinclair was negligent in handling his case, and sued him for professional negligence.

Sinclair defended the matter by claiming barristerial immunity.

'''Retroactive overtime''' ('''ROT''') is an additional amount of money that is awarded when an employee has a combination of [[overtime]] and an additional amount of money, such as a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] or a [[performance-related pay|bonus]] that is guaranteed based upon work requirements. Overtime is required to qualify for retroactive overtime. So, if a salesperson receives a commission, but does not receive overtime, then the employee does not qualify for retroactive overtime.

==Computation==

Retroactive overtime is computed by using the number of hours of overtime worked for the specified [[payroll]] period to look up the coefficient percentages from the coefficient table (Form WH-134).&lt;ref&gt;Coefficient Table for Computing Extra [[Half-time|Half-Time]] for Overtime, Form WH-134
[http://www.osha.gov/pls/epub/wageindex.download?p_file=F26273/WH134.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This coefficient percentage is then multiplied by the commission and/or bonus to determine the ROT amount that will be awarded to the employee in addition to the already existing overtime and commission.

The additional amount on money beyond the overtime, the commission or bonus, must be a guaranteed payment to the employee based upon specified work criteria. Here are some examples of some bonuses that qualify and do not qualify.

== Qualifying bonuses ==
If an employee is awarded a known amount of money for working a certain shift or for working a number of consecutive weeks, that additional amount of money that is paid beyond the regular base pay and overtime will qualify for retroactive overtime [[if and only if]] there are also overtime hours paid during the same pay period of the qualifying bonus. You could also consider this to have an OT value of zero and add an additional look-up table value of all zeros for the [[percentages]] to use to determine the ROT amount.

== Non-qualifying bonuses ==
If an employee is awarded a discretionary bonus that is not guaranteed based upon specific work criteria, this bonus does not qualify for retroactive overtime. A good example of this is a [[Christmas]] bonus that may be awarded to employees. This is not a guaranteed bonus that the employee will receive for meeting a specified goal but is rather a bonus that is awarded to the employee on the discretion of the company.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Rule in ''Dearle v Hall''}}
The '''rule in ''Dearle v Hall''''' (1828) 3 Russ 1 is an English common law rule to determine priority between competing [[Equity (law)|equitable claims]] to the same asset.  The rule broadly provides that where the equitable owner of an asset purports to dispose of his equitable interest on two or more occasions, and the equities are equal between claimants, the claimant who first notifies the [[trustee]] or legal owner of the asset shall have a first priority claim.

Although the original decisions related to interests under a [[trust law|trust]], most modern applications of the rule relate to the [[factoring (finance)|factoring]] of [[Notes receivable|receivable]]s&lt;ref&gt;A common scenario is where a company grants a floating charge over all its assets, including its book debts, to a bank, and then the company also purports to factor the book debts to an independent factor.  As between the bank and the factor, the person who will have a priority claim to the receivables will generally be the person who first notifies the legal title holder (ie. the debtor) of their claim.&lt;/ref&gt; or multiple grants of equitable [[security interest]]s.

The rule has been subject to some scathing criticism,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Legal Aspects Receivable Financing'' (2000), [[Fidelis Oditah]]; and ''Commercial Law'' (2nd ed), [[Roy Goode]], in which the author indicates: "It is high time that the rule in ''Dearle v Hall'' was abolished" at page 705.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been abrogated in a number of [[common law]] countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

==History==

The rule in ''Dearle v Hall'' has been controversial almost since its inception. In 1893, [[Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten]] said "I am inclined to think that the rule in ''Dearle v Hall'' has on the whole produced at least as much injustice as it has prevented."&lt;ref&gt;''Ward v Duncombe'' [1893] AC 369&lt;/ref&gt;  But this has not stopped it from being extended from a rule regulating the priority of interests in trusts to the regulation of the priority of proprietary interests in debts and other similar intangibles, such as rights under contracts, which is considerably more important in terms of modern commerce.

The actual decision in ''Dearle v Hall'', on its facts, is relatively uncontroversial.  The [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficial owner]] of a trust fund [[assignment (law)|assigned]] it first by way of security to A, and then outright to B, in each case for valuable [[consideration]].   A had not given notice of his assignment to the trustees of the fund and, accordingly, when B made enquiries of them, he did not discover the existence of the assignment to A because the trustees were not aware of it.  B did give notice of the assignment to the trustees, and then A subsequently also gave notice to them.  [[Thomas Plumer|Plumer MR]] and, on appeal, [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|Lord Lyndhurst LC]] each decided that B took priority over A.

Judgment was given in favour of B for two reasons.  The first was based on the general proposition, that, as between two equitable interests, the first in time will only take priority "if the equities are equal".  In this case, by failing to give notice to the trustees, A had allowed the beneficiary of the trust to be able to hold himself out as being the unencumbered owner of the beneficial interest and had therefore enabled the beneficiary to hoodwink B into thinking he had not encumbered it.  This is a perfectly straightforward application of the principle that the first in time will only prevail if the equities are equal and is not considered controversial.

The second ground for the decision was that A's failure to give notice had left the beneficiary of the trust in apparent possession of the trust fund, and A could not, therefore, rely on this assignment in a dispute with B.  This latter ground has been criticised as it appears to be based on the concept of reputed ownership in [[bankruptcy]] law, which had never previously been employed in determining priority between competing equitable claims.  Nevertheless, on the facts of the case most commentators feel that justice was done; A had allowed the beneficiary to commit a fraud on B, and therefore A should rank behind B.

==Development==

However, it was in subsequent developments  that the rule was turned from an example of the principle that the first in time rule will not apply if the equities are not equal into an absolute rule that the first to give notice will take priority unless the later assignee was a volunteer&lt;ref&gt;''Re General Horticultural Company'' (1886) 32 Ch D 512&lt;/ref&gt; or was aware of the earlier assignment at the time he obtained his assignment.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Holmes'' (1885) 29 Ch D 786&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule applies even if the later assignee made no enquiries of the trustees&lt;ref&gt;''Foster v Cockerell'' (1835) 3 Cl &amp; Fin 456&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the first assignee was not negligent in failing to give notice, for instance because he was not aware of it&lt;ref&gt;''Re Lake'' [1903] 1 KB 151&lt;/ref&gt; or because there was no one to whom notice could be given.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Dallas'' [1904] 2 Ch 385&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Ward v Duncombe'' [1893] AC 369, the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] decided that the rule that notice determines priority of dealings applied regardless of the conduct of the competing assignees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calnan|first1=Richard|journal=Journal of International Banking &amp; Financial Law|date=2006|volume=21|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

In spite of the criticisms of the way in which the rule in ''Dearle v Hall'' has developed, there is much to be said for the concept that the priority of assignments or charges over debts should, as a general rule, depend on the date notice is given to the person who owes the debt.  Not least, this is because the person who owes the debt will get a good discharge by paying the [[creditor]] unless he has been notified of the assignment or charge.  Once a debt has been paid, it ceases to exist, and the priority rule recognises this fact. That is not to say that, in appropriate cases, it would not be possible for one creditor to trace the proceeds of the debt into the hands of another. But a simple rule that both priority and discharge depend on notice has much to recommend it.

Most of the academic criticism of the rule is to the effect that it has been carried too far.  Whilst it is generally accepted for a subsequent assignee for value to take priority over an earlier assignee by giving notice before he becomes aware of the earlier assignment, it seems harsh for the earlier assignee to lose priority where the notice is given by the subsequent assignee after he is aware of the earlier assignment.  The net result is the priority depends upon the subsequent speed of response of the parties once one or both of them becomes aware of the problem.

==Reform==

The [[Law Commission]] of [[England and Wales]], as part of a wider view of priority rules relating to [[security interest]]s has recommended the abolition of the rule in ''Dearle v Hall'' in relation to security interests and assignments of receivables only, and its replacement with a system of registration.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission Consultation Paper No.164&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, such recommendations have not been implemented.

'''START II''' ('''Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty''') was a [[bilateral treaty]] between the [[United States|United States of America]] and [[Russia]] on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed by [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Russia]]n [[President of the Russian Federation|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] on 3 January 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/start2/ |title=START II |work=fas.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; banning the use of [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRVs) on [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Hence, it is often cited as the '''De-MIRV-ing Agreement'''. It never entered into effect. It was ratified by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87-4.  Russia ratified START II on 14 April 2000, but on 14 June 2002, withdrew from the treaty in response to U.S. withdrawal from the [[ABM Treaty]].

Instead, [[SORT]] came into effect, reducing strategic warheads count per country to 1,700 - 2,200.

==Impact of MIRV==
[[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRVed]] land-based [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on [[first strike|striking first]]. A MIRVed missile is able to carry 3-12 [[warhead]]s and deliver them to separate targets. Thereby, if it is used in a first strike, it possibly destroys many of the enemy's missile sites.

Hypothetically, if one were to assume that each side had 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and further that each side had a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo, then the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads and keeping the remaining 60 missiles in reserve. Thus the destruction capability is greatly multiplied by MIRV, when the number of enemy silos does not significantly increase.

Both Soviet [[R-36 (missile)|R-36M]] and the US [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missiles were capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs (the latter not currently operational).

==Negotiations==
The historic agreement started on 17 June 1992 with the signing of a 'Joint Understanding' by the presidents.  The official signing of the treaty by the presidents took place on 3 January 1993. It was ratified by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87-4.  However, Russian ratification was stalled in the [[State Duma|Duma]] for many years.  It was postponed a number of times to protest [[Kosovo War|American military actions in Kosovo]], as well as to oppose the [[Enlargement of NATO|expansion of NATO]].

As the years passed, the treaty became less relevant and both sides started to lose interest in it.  For the Americans, the main issue became the [[ABM Treaty]], which forbade the deployment of a [[national missile defense|nationwide missile defense system]]. The United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty in June 2002, a move which Russia fiercely opposed.

START II did not enter into force. On 14 April 2000 the Duma did finally ratify the treaty, in a largely symbolic move since the ratification was made contingent on preserving the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM Treaty) and thereby preserving the long-standing principle of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD). To be specific, Russian ratification was made contingent on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] ratifying a September 1997 [[addendum]] to START II which included agreed statements on demarcation of [[anti-ballistic missile|strategic versus tactical missile defences]]. Neither of these occurred because of  U.S. Senate opposition, where a faction objected to any action supportive of the existing ABM Treaty.

==SORT replacing START II==
{{main|Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty}}
However, in 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] set a plan in motion to reduce the country’s missile forces from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200.

Thus the START II treaty was officially bypassed by the [[SORT]] treaty, agreed to by Presidents George W. Bush and [[Vladimir Putin]] at their summit meeting in November 2001, and signed at Moscow Summit on 24 May 2002.  Both sides agreed to reduce operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700 from 2,200 by 2012.

On 13 June 2002, the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty, and on the following day Russia announced that it would no longer consider itself to be bound by START II provisions. Both countries continued to pursue their objectives: Russia to this day retains 54 MIRV-capable RS-20/R-36M ([[R-36 (missile)|SS-18 Satan]]) with 10 warheads each, 40 MIRV-capable RS-18/UR-100N ([[UR-100N|SS-19 Stiletto]]) with 6 warheads each and 24 MIRV-capable [[RS-24 Yars]] with 3 warheads each.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter Five: Russia and Eurasia", The Military Balance 114, Nr. 1 (1. Januar 2014): 180f.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States developed  [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD) system to protect from small-scale ICBM attack.

In October 2002 United States began unilateral withdrawal of MIRV (including complete deactivation of [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper missiles]]) and completed it by 19 September 2005. The [[Minuteman III]] is, as of 2011, the only United States land-based operational ICBM. It can potentially carry up to only 3 RVs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">The '''Second Ballot Act 1908''' was an electoral system in place from 1908 to 1913 in New Zealand. It applied to elections to the [[House of Representatives of New Zealand|House of Representatives]]. It was used in the [[New Zealand general election, 1908|1908]] and [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911 general election]]s, and a number of by-elections.&lt;ref name=teara&gt;{{cite book |last=Foster |first=Bernard John|title=Second Ballot System (1908–13)|year=1966 |publisher=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] |location=Wellington |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/government-parliamentary-elections/page-9 |editor=A. H. McLintock |accessdate=7 August 2013 |date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] under [[Joseph Ward]], who feared that the emergence of the [[Independent Political Labour League]] (IPLL) would split the vote on the political left and thus be beneficial to the conservative opposition, who in 1909 formed the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]]. Ward expected that this electoral mechanism would result in all second ballots to be between Liberal and conservative (Reform) candidates. In the {{NZ electorate link|Wellington East}} electorate, however, two Liberal candidates received similar votes and both were eliminated in the first ballot. This left the Labour candidate, [[David McLaren (politician)|David McLaren]], face a conservative candidate and with many liberal voters transferring their allegiance to McLaren, he became the only candidate of the IPLL who was ever elected to the [[House of Representatives of New Zealand|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref = harv |first = Barry |last = Gustafson |authorlink = Barry Gustafson |title = Labour's path to political independence: The Origins and Establishment of the New Zealand Labour Party, 1900–19 |place = [[Auckland]], New Zealand |publisher = [[Auckland University Press]] |year = 1980 |page =19 |isbn = 0-19-647986-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
In the law of [[evidence]], '''similar fact evidence''' (or the '''similar fact principle''') establishes the conditions under which factual evidence of past misconduct of accused can be admitted at trial for the purpose of inferring that the accused committed the misconduct at issue.

==By jurisdiction==
===Canada===
In Canada, the rule is established in ''[[R. v. Handy]]'', [[Case citation|164 CCC (3d) 481, 2 SCR 908]] (2002):

Evidence of prior bad acts by the accused will be admissible if the prosecution satisfies the judge on a balance of probabilities that, in the context of the particular case, the probative value of the evidence in relation to a specific issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its reception.

Questions arise as to how the Court will measure the elements of this rule:

i) What constitutes a prior act of misconduct? 
* Any past misdeed, does not have to proven as a conviction.

ii) Why does the Court speak of evidence in relation to a 'specific issue'? 
* Good measure of probity, what other issue beyond disposition or propensity evidence.

iii) How is probative value determined? 
* Nature of similarity between details, distinctive features and circumstances of past act and current offence 
* Proximity in time between past act and current offense 
* Number of occurrences of the similar acts 
* Any intervening event 
* Any other factor tending to support or rebut the unity of past act and conduct in question (i.e. appearance of collusion)

===England and Wales===
The 2001 trial of [[Roy Whiting]] may have influenced the decision to change the law in England and Wales (R v Handy continues to govern the law in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/1706334.stm|title=Law on previous convictions may change|publisher=BBC|date=2001-12-12|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were brought into force by the 'Bad Character' provisions of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] (sections 98 to 113).
Although preceding these changes, [[Rosemary West]]'s 1995 trial has also been cited as an example where similar fact evidence was crucial to the prosecution case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-obituaries/6006003/Richard-Ferguson-QC.html|title=Obituary:Richard Ferguson, QC|date=2009-08-11|accessdate=2009-08-11|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar fact evidence can be used even if the original "misconduct" could not be prosecuted due to duress or the offender's youth. In a case of a Devon family imprisoned in 1998, one of the defendants appealed his conviction for raping his sister at the age of 16, suggesting it was unlikely that she would not complain or seek help.  It was held that the evidence that his father had coerced him into sexual acts with his other sisters as a child was similar fact evidence and, in addition to the systematic long-term sexual activity and abuse within the family, sufficient to explain why he felt that he could get away with abusing her and knew she could not rely on her family for protection; his appeal failed. [R v TM, 2000, 2 Cr App 266]

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the rules regarding similar fact evidence are codified by section 43 of the [[Evidence Act 2006]].

===Scotland===
Under [[Scots law]], this is covered by the well-established use of the [[Moorov v HMA|Moorov Doctrine]].

===United States===
Under Rule 404 of the United States Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of a person's character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.  Additionally, evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.  This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

[[Image:SmithBrothers 02.gif|thumb|Smith Brothers menthol introduced in 1922]]

The '''Smith Brothers''' were makers of the first [[cough drops]] produced and advertised in the United States, becoming one of the most famous brands in the country in its day.

==History==


'''William Wallace Smith I''' (1830–1913) and '''Andrew Smith''' (1836–1895) were the sons of James Smith (c1800-1866) of [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]]. James' family had emigrated from [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], to Canada in 1831, and James from St. Armand, [[Quebec]], to the U.S. in 1847.

In New York, James opened an [[ice cream shop]] called "James Smith and Son." James Smith bought a cough drop recipe from a journeyman peddler named Sly Hawkins and in 1852 made his first batch of "Smith Brothers Cough Drops".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title= |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=September 24, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William and Andrew took over the business after their father died in 1866.

Originally the drops were sold from glass jars on countertops. To prevent [[drug stores]] from selling generic versions the company began packaging drops in branded boxes in 1872. To distinguish their drops from imitators, the bearded brothers created a logo featuring their portraits and stamped it on their boxes. When trademarked in 1877 the word "Trade" appeared under the picture of William and the word "Mark" under Andrew's. It followed the brothers became known as Trade and Mark, nicknames that stick to this day.

Of the brothers, William Smith was the dominant, community-minded and a prohibitionist. He was known for such quirks as keeping financial records on the backs of used envelopes. He ran for public office several times and was a generous local philanthropist who assessed his brother Andrew for half of all charitable donations whether he knew of them or not.

Andrew, on the other hand, was known as the more amiable brother and not a tee-totaller.

The company's staunch defense of its trademark made the Smiths' faces among the most famous in America, the subject of editorials, comics, and cultural references.&lt;ref name="americanheritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/beards-made-rough-keepsie-famous?page=2|title=The Beards That Made Rough-keepsie Famous &amp;#124; American History Lives at American Heritage|publisher=americanheritage.com|accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Smith died in 1895, and William continued as company president until he died in 1913. William was succeeded by his son, Arthur G. Smith (c1875-1936), who expanded the company by adding [[menthol]] drops in 1922, [[cough syrup]] in 1926, and  [[Prunus serotina|wild cherry]] drops in 1948{{dubious|reason=If he died in 1936, he can't have done much in 1948|date=April 2013}}. Arthur G. Smith had two sons: William Wallace Smith II (1888–1955) and Robert Lansing Smith (1891–1962).  William Wallace Smith II was born in Poughkeepsie N.Y.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Died |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807122,00.html |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=March 14, 1955 |accessdate=2011-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Being the History of the United States as Illustrated in the Lives of the Founders, Builders, and Defenders of the Republic, and of the Men and Women who are Doing the Work and Moulding the Thought of the Present Time, Volume 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales==
In 1963 the brand was purchased by [[Warner-Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=The Brothers Move On |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870852,00.html |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=February 21, 1964 |accessdate=2011-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was bought by F &amp; F Foods  of [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1972 and production left Poughkeepsie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Morris Fox, Pharmacist, 102 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/01/obituaries/morris-fox-pharmacist-102.html |work=[[Associated Press]] in the [[New York Times]] |date=October 1, 1989 |accessdate=2011-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic Smith Brothers logo was diminished in favor of the F&amp;F Foods logo{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and the brothers' name recognition declined, though they would continue to make appearances in pop culture references such as the season 1, 1986 of ''[[The Golden Girls|Golden Girls]]'' episode, "[[The Flu]]” Rose politely declines a Sucrets cough drop from her date, and tells him that she’s “sucking on a Smith Brothers” And later on  the 2009 ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode, "[[O Brother, Where Bart Thou?]]"  The expression, "When the Smith Brothers shave..." was used in popular culture to mean something that was never expected to happen. In the 1906 [[Victor Herbert]] [[operetta]] "The Red Mill", two heavily bearded men appear on stage, while one of the Vaudevillians yells, "Pipe, the Smith Brothers!"

In 2011, the brand was sold to GemCap, a private equity fund in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fffoods.com/products/historysb.html |title=Sweet {{sic|nolink=y|Acquisitions|expected=Acquisitions}} |accessdate=2011-11-16 |publisher=[[F &amp; F Foods]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221224708/http://www.fffoods.com/products/historysb.html |archivedate=2010-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the brand was purchased by [[hedge fund]] York Capital Management, who once again attempted to revive the brand which had largely disappeared from store shelves.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Stuart (November 24, 2-14)[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/media/smith-brothers-cough-drops-works-to-revive-brand.html Hey Brothers, can you spare a cough drop?] ''New York Times''. Retrieved May 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016, the Smith brothers cough drop brand folded due to declining sales. However, Smith Brothers cough drops remained available on retail shelves and online due to unexpired back stock.

==Comeback==
In May 2016, the Smith Brothers brand was acquired by Lanes Brands in Bedford, New Hampshire, the United States subsidiary of Lanes Health in Gloucester, United Kingdom. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jakemans-inc-changes-name-to-lanes-brands-acquires-smith-bros-300289892.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Lane Brands website, the Smith Brothers brand of cough drops will be back in the American and worldwide markets later in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesmithbrothers.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way''''' is the fourth book by British writer [[Peter Hitchens]], published in May 2009. Polemical and partly autobiographical, the book contends that the British [[political right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] no longer hold firm, adversarial beliefs, but vie for position in the [[center (politics)|centre]], while at the same time overseeing a general decline in [[British society]].

Hitchens depicts the right in particular as a confused and spent political force that has been subsumed by the [[centre-left]], itself a product of [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] [[social democracy]]. As a result of these factors, "there is no longer any debate between the political parties about issues that have divided thinkers down the ages, and divide the population even now".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-168"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens concludes that, since the compass is broken, the time has come in British politics for the re-establishment of a proper [[adversarial system]] and for principles to be rediscovered.

In the media, ''The Broken Compass'' received mostly negative reviews from left-leaning newspapers, and was largely ignored by the conservative press. It was reissued as '''''The Cameron Delusion''''' in March 2010, two months before [[David Cameron]] became the British Prime Minister.

==Background==
Hitchens sets out his stall in the preface "The Lost Frontier", stating: "conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. By the time it has become conventional, it has ceased to be wisdom and become cant. Its smug cousin, received opinion, is just as bad. The aim of this book is to defy these two enemies of thought and reason", and "conventional wisdom's biggest single mistake is its thought-free, obsolete idea of Left and Right".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-vii"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column written before the book's publication, Hitchens also explored themes contained in ''The Broken Compass'', and wrote "The cold, miserable truth is that both our major political parties are corpses, their original purposes long forgotten, their loyal members driven away or sidelined, and their traditional voters taken for granted".&lt;ref name=" political parties are corpses"&gt;{{cite news

==Synopsis==

===Part I: The New Permanent Government of Britain===
[[File:GordonBrown2004.JPG|thumb|upright|In ''The Broken Compass'' Hitchens criticises the media's portrayal of [[Gordon Brown]].]]
In Chapter 1, "Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry", Hitchens claims that opinion polls are a device for influencing [[public opinion]] and not measuring it, and that political parties and newspapers are responsible for this [[Misuse of statistics|manipulation]], whose purpose is to "bring about the thing it claims is already happening".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-5"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author cites contemporary examples of the media attacking [[Gordon Brown]] and the expected win of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref name="Hitchens-8"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens begins Chapter 2, "The Power of Lunch", by asserting, based on his time as a reporter at Westminster, that political journalists are uninterested in serious political debate; propagate received centre-left standpoints on issues; and consult with each other and politicians about media stories. Chapter 3, "Time for a Change", describes how a [[Media bias|media reporting bias]] is attempting to facilitate a Tory general election win. Hitchens states one of his motivations in writing the book was to frustrate this exercise.&lt;ref name="Hitchens-29"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens claims in Chapter 4, "Fear of Finding Something Worse", that Labour has reached "the most significant moment in its history – the complete acceptance of its programme by the Conservatives".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-31"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author invokes the closing image of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' to illustrate how close the two parties have become.&lt;ref&gt;i.e., in reference to the line "The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from man to pig again; but already it was impossible to say which was which". Hitchens also quotes this line at the beginning of the book's preface&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 5, "The Great Landslide", discusses how a number of left-wing writers and newspapers have begun describing the Conservatives in favourable terms, and how this no longer constituted "a form of treason".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-49"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: The Left Escapes to the West===
Chapter 6, "Riding the Prague Tram", describes Hitchens's experience of travelling in [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]] countries before the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and how this, combined with the behaviour of certain left-wing organisations in the UK, led to his becoming disillusioned with the British Left. He also carries out a lengthy critique of the Western Left's [[Apologetics|apologist]] stance towards Soviet Communism, including views held by [[Fabian Society]] members [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]]; the attempt to exonerate and romanticise [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]];&lt;ref name="Hitchens-60-61"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intellectual resistance to the works of [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Robert Conquest]]. In Chapter 7, "A Fire Burning Under Water", Hitchens describes the final stage in his becoming disenchanted with the British Left – the [[Trades Union Congress|British Trades Union Congress]]'s (TUC) failure to support the [[History of Solidarity|Gdańsk shipyard workers challenging]] their communist government.

===Part III: Britain Through the Looking Glass===
Chapter 8, "Racism, Sexism and Homophobia", examines how the modern ideology of race and the term racist differ from the previous concept of "racialism", and how the [[sexual revolution]] represents "seeking the existing order's permission to [[Hedonism|pursue pleasure at all costs]]",&lt;ref name="Hitchens-102"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which undermines Christian principles of marriage, and has its roots in [[Protests of 1968|events in 1968]].&lt;ref name="Hitchens-104"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 9, "Sexism is Rational", Hitchens states that the Left's taking up feminist causes since the 1960s has led to the damage and exploitation of women,&lt;ref name="Hitchens-111"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a decline in marriage. Hitchens says this process is part of revolutionaries' seeking to "destroy and expunge the restraints placed on human selfishness by the Christian religion. The permanent married family is the greatest single obstacle to this".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-112"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens concludes that in Britain there is an emerging citizenry "prepared for [[Slavery|enslavement]], ignorant of its origins, past, rights, traditions, and duties"&lt;ref name="Hitchens-114"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "only in a wholly broken political system could there be such a need for reform, and no reformers ready to address it".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-114"/&gt;

In Chapter 10, "Equality or Tolerance", Hitchens examines how the Left have since the 1960s taken up the cause of [[Gender equality|equal rights for homosexuals]]. Hitchens says supporters of [[Leo Abse]]'s 1967 law reform on homosexuality are now accused of intolerance if they do not support homosexual [[civil partnership]]s or [[Homophobia|discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality]]. Hitchens concludes by stating, "the [[atrophy]] of religion and patriotism in the Labour party, like the atrophy of the same things in the Tory Party, is the deep problem beneath all others".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-123"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chapter 11, "The Fall of the Meritocracy", examines falling standards in British education. Hitchens cites the abolition of [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] as one of the main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in [[social mobility]]. Hitchens claims [[Egalitarianism|egalitarians]] deny these consequences and that [[comprehensive education]] has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111028112306-BetrayedGenerations.pdf|title= The Betrayed Generations – Standards in British Schools 1950–2000|publisher=[[Centre for Policy Studies]]|date= November 2000|author= Marks, John|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserted that "the general lowering of standards and [[rigour]] since the end of [[Selective school|selection]] is one of the main reasons behind the current drive to devalue examinations".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-161"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens asks why, "the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend that educational standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that they have put equality before education".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-162"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 12, "'The age of the train'", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the "Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-172"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass [[car ownership]], saying that "roads destroy and distort established ways of living", while "the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-169"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2010| p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 13, "A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus", Hitchens explores how since the [[September 11 attacks|2001 September 11 attacks]] and the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], certain commentators on the left realigned with an American [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] position, which, "delivers him [the leftist commentator] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion",&lt;ref name="Hitchens-180"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows "political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-195"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion: The Broken Compass===
Hitchens asserts that political mismanagement, facilitated by an abandonment of the [[adversarial system]], has resulted in an overall [[Decadence|decline]] in British society. He identifies the end of the [[Cold War]] (which "made many of the old political positions meaningless overnight"&lt;ref name="Hitchens-198"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as one cause of this, as well as the implementation of the ideas of [[Fabian Society|Fabian social democracy]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|ideology of the 1960s]].

==Reception==
On publication the book was reviewed in ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'' and the ''[[New Statesman]]'', was the occasion of two interviews with Hitchens with Hannah Pool in ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref name=" Being called a sexist "&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a discussion with the author on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name="BBC_start"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00k89pp| title=Start the Week|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009| work=[[BBC Radio 4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviews in the left-wing press were generally unfavourable; [[Peter Wilby]]'s review in ''The Observer'' was dismissive towards much of the book's contents. Wilby wrote "As Hitchens sees it, 'the broken compass' is chiefly the Conservatives' fault. Even under Thatcher, they accepted too many of Labour's social democratic and liberal reforms. So we have a permanent government of the centre and one of Labour's main aims is to stop a genuinely Conservative party emerging that may attract working-class votes on such issues as "immigration and disorder" and getting Britain out of Europe. 'It was greatly in Labour's interest, once the Tory party had accepted so much of Labour's programme as unalterable, that the Tory party should be preserved against the danger of dissolution,' Hitchens writes. There is a grain of truth in all this, but on the left most would reverse the argument. The postwar consensus was destroyed in the Thatcher years and Labour failed to restore it, accepting, at least until the credit crunch, unrestrained neoliberal capitalism. New Labour's appeal to business and the City was that it closed off, perhaps forever, the possibility of a genuinely socialist alternative".&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Wilby"&gt;{{cite news

Writing in the ''New Statesman'', [[Anthony Howard (journalist)|Anthony Howard]] saw the book as "a hotchpotch of separate essays" and that, though Hitchens mounts a spirited defence of his beliefs, he nevertheless resembles "some faintly out-of-date figure searching the kitchen for any pot or pan he can hurl against the spirit of the age".&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Howard "&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Steven Poole]] described Hitchens as being "in general exhilaratingly good when attacking the hypocrisies and stupidities of specific individuals",&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Poole "&gt;{{cite news
| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/30/peter-hitchens-broken-compass

| title = The Broken Compass
| authorlink = Steven Poole|last=Poole|first= Steven

| accessdate =28 November 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the "best parts" of the book describe "scenes of foreign reporting, such as an alarming visit to [[Vilnius]] in 1991, where Soviet forces massacred Lithuanian nationalists".&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Poole "/&gt; However, Poole also added that the book resorted too much to cultural generalisation.
[[File:The Cameron Delusion.jpg|thumb|upright|Revised edition, published as ''The Cameron Delusion'']]
Conservative newspapers and magazines, which had consistently reviewed Hitchens's previous books, largely ignored ''The Broken Compass''. The author bemoaned this in one of his columns,&lt;ref name=" Iain Dale's Diary "&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/09/iain-dales-diary.html

| title = Iain Dale's Diary
| author = Hitchens, Peter
| work = [[The Mail on Sunday]]
| accessdate =16 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explored the possible reasons behind it in an article in [[Standpoint (magazine)|''Standpoint'']] magazine.&lt;ref name=" Only Defeat "&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/2165/full
| date = October 2009
| title = Only Defeat Can Save Conservatism
| author = Hitchens, Peter
| work = [[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]
| accessdate =15 January 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this trend was the Shadow Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] referring at length to the book in his column in ''[[The Times]]'', where he wrote that it "has some passages of quite brilliant writing and it is at its best when Peter reflects on his own life and his disillusionment with the left-wing ideology of his youth" and that the book "makes some telling points, which are discomfiting reading for conservatives who value grace and civility in our national life".&lt;ref name="Gove The Times"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release details==
The book was first published in the UK on 11 May 2009 by Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., and in the US on 20 June 2009 by Continuum, with the altered subtitle ''How Left and Right Lost Their Meaning''. In anticipation of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], a revised paperback edition with the new title ''The Cameron Delusion'' was released in the UK on 17 March 2010.

==Index==
Poole in his ''Guardian'' review wrote that "Hitchens should at least be applauded for taking the trouble to provide an amusing index, a duty shirked by too many authors." The index was the subject of a full-page parody by [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'Peter Hitchens: the index', 'as told to Craig. Brown', ''Private Eye'', no. 1236, 15–28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1696">'''''Tournier v [[National Provincial Bank|National Provincial and Union Bank of England]]''''' [1924] 1 KB 461 was a landmark legal case in the [[United Kingdom]].  The lead decision was given by [[John Eldon Bankes|Bankes LJ]].  

It established the conditions under which banks owed confidentiality to their clients, allowing four circumstances wherein banks were not required to guard privacy: where compelled by (1) law, (2) public duty, (3) the interest of the bank, or (4) where the client had consented, even implicitly, to disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Mary Michelle | last = Gallant | title = Money Laundering and the Proceeds of Crime: Economic Crime and Civil Remedies | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2005 | isbn = 1843769514 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ijkMxfmZg8C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Tournier+v+National+Provincial+and+Union+Bank+of+England&amp;client=firefox-a | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case the bank disclosed to its customer's employer the fact that one of the customer's unpaid cheques was drawn in favour of a bookmaker's account. As a result, the customer's employer did not renew his contract with the customer. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that confidentiality was an implied term in the customer's contract and that any breach could give rise to liability in damages if loss results.
