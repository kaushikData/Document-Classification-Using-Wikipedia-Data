[http://aims.fao.org/ '''Agricultural Information Management Standards'''], abbreviated to '''AIMS''' is a space for accessing and discussing agricultural information management standards, tools and methodologies connecting information workers worldwide to build a global community of practice. Information management standards, tools and good practices can be found on AIMS:

* to support the implementation of structured and linked information and knowledge to enable institutions and individuals from different technical backgrounds to build open and interoperable information systems;
* to provide advice on how to best manage, disseminate, share and exchange agricultural scientific information;
* to promote good practices widely applicable and easy to implement, and;
* to foster communities of practices centered on interoperability, reusability and cooperation.

== Users ==

AIMS is primarily intended for information workers—librarians, information managers, software developers—but is also of interest to those who are simply passionate about knowledge and information sharing. The success of AIMS depends upon its communities reaching a critical mass to show that the investment in interoperability standards has a return.

== Community ==

AIMS holds [http://aims.fao.org/communities-aims 9 communities of practice]. They are intended to discuss and share information about the different ongoing initiatives under the AIMS umbrella. AIMS supports collaboration through forums and blogs amongst institutions and individuals that wish to share expertise on how to use tools, standards and methodologies. Moreover, news and events are published on AIMS as part of its ‘one-stop” access to interoperability and reusability of information resources. The AIMS communities are aimed at the global agricultural community, including information providers, from research institutes, academic institutions, educational and extension institutions and also the private sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1469">'''Aleksandr Pavlovich Filippov''' (born 1891) was a Russian philosopher. 

Filippov completed his training for the law at the [[University of Kharkov]] in 1913. He then devoted four years to the study of natural sciences at that university. He held a research fellowship in European culture at the university and worked as a scientific fellow of the [[Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]]. 

In 1942 Filippov was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kharkov. A year later he became Professor of Sociology at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]]. From 1945 to 1952 he lived in Munich. There, in addition to working as a consultant for the [[Harvard University Refugee Interview Project]] he was chairman of the editorial committee of the [[Institute for the Study of the History and Institutions of the USSR]]. 

Filippov published extensively on psychology, philosophy and Bolshevik theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;All the information in this article is based on the biographical summary in Philipov, A., ''Logic and Dialectic in the Soviet Union'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anil K. Gupta''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ʊ|p|t|ə}}; born 1949) is an [[Indian-American]] [[philosopher]] who works primarily in [[logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]]. Gupta is the Alan Ross Anderson Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He is also a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist.pdf List of the Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Gupta earned his B.Sc. with first class honours from the [[University of London]]  in 1969. He then attended the University of Pittsburgh where he received his M.A. (1973) and Ph.D. (1977).
Gupta has taught at several universities: [[McGill University]]  (1975-1982), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]  (1982-1989), [[Indiana University]]  (1989-2000).&lt;ref&gt;Biographical information from [http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/cv/Anil%20Gupta%20CV%20May%202015.pdf Gupta's CV (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Gupta joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh where he served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and, since 2013, as Alan Ross Anderson Chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/person/anil-gupta Gupta's profile at the University of Pittsburgh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision theory==
{{main|Revision theory}}

Gupta developed an early version of the revision theory of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Later he generalized this to a theory of circular and interdependent definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; This work was further developed, resulting  in the book, ''The Revision Theory of Truth'', co-written with [[Nuel Belnap]].

The revision theory is a semantic theory of truth that combines an unrestricted truth predicate with classical logic.&lt;ref&gt;See Gupta and Belnap (1993) for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
Revision theory takes truth to be a circular concept, defined by the [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski biconditionals]],
:'A' is true [[if and only if]] A,
and interprets it in a new way. Rather than interpret the truth predicate via a single extension, as is done with non-circular predicates, revision theory interprets it via a revision process. The revision process is a collection of revision sequences that result when arbitrary hypotheses concerning the interpretation of truth are revised using a rule provided by the Tarski biconditionals. In the revision process, problematic sentences such as the Liar (“this very sentence is not true”) do not settle on a definite truth value. Remarkably, however, ordinary unproblematic sentences do receive a definite truth value. If problematic types of cross-reference are eliminated from the language, then the revision process converges to a fixed point.

Gupta has applied revision theory to rational choice in game theory, building on the work of André Chapuis.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 4 of Gupta (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gupta has recently applied the informal ideas of revision theory to problems arising in the [[philosophy of perception]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gupta (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience and Reformed Empiricism==

In ''Empiricism and Experience'', Gupta proposes a novel [[empiricist]] account of the logical relation between perceptual experience and [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Gupta (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpr.2009.79.issue-2/issuetoc#group2 Book Symposium on ''Empiricism and Experience'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25224-empiricism-and-experience/ Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews entry on ''Empiricism and Experience'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem Gupta addresses is that of explaining the role of experience in making our views and, in particular, perceptual judgments rational. Gupta’s proposal is that the given in experience is hypothetical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sberker/files/berker-gupta-gambit.pdf?m=1410898507 Berker (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than providing perceptual judgments with categorical [[rationality]], experience confers on these judgments a conditional rationality. A perceptual experience, according to Gupta, makes a subject’s judgment rational if the subject’s antecedent view is rational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/gupta/pdf/PPRReplies.pdf Gupta (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; An antecedent view is the collection of [[beliefs]], conceptions, and concepts that the subject of an experience brings to bear on the experience.

Gupta uses the notion of the hypothetical given to build a reformed empiricism. He argues that this empiricism has significant advantages over the traditional versions of the view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sberker/files/berker-gupta-gambit.pdf?m=1410898507 Berker (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other features, Gupta’s empiricism does not require the acceptance of an [[anti-realism]] about commonsense and theoretical objects, and it does not rely on the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]] to do any substantive work. Finally, Gupta argues that his reformed empiricism incorporates plausible components of both [[foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gupta (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10 Tango Tree generated from the reference tree P after the last warm-up search for element 20, Nodes in pink are roots of Auxiliary trees.jpg|thumb|Arboresence is defined by vertical hierarchy rather than horizontal connections]]

'''Arborescent''' ({{lang-fr|arborescent}}) is a term used by the French thinkers [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] to characterize thinking marked by insistence on [[Universality (philosophy)|totalizing]] principles, [[binarism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. The term, first used in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) where it was opposed to the [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizome]], comes from the way [[genealogy tree]]s are drawn: unidirectional [[progress (history)|progress]], with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts (thus enforcing a dualist metaphysical conception, criticized by Deleuze). Rhizomes, on the contrary, mark a horizontal and non-hierarchical conception, where anything may be linked to anything else, with no respect whatsoever for specific [[species]]: rhizomes are [[heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] links between things that have nothing to do between themselves (for example, Deleuze and Guattari linked together desire and [[machine]]s to create the - most surprising - concept of [[desiring-production|desiring machine]]s). [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is also an example of rhizomes, opposed to the arborescent [[evolutionism]] theory. Deleuze also criticizes the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of [[formal languages]], which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory.&lt;ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari | Guattari, Félix]]. 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">'''Avary William Holmes Forbes''' (1853&amp;ndash;1938) was a religious philosopher, teacher, and writer.

Forbes received his MA from [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095827553|title=Avary William Holmes Forbes  (b. 1853)|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then studied law at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in London. He joined the Council of the interdenominational All Nations Missionary Union, founded by [[F. B. Meyer]] along with the [[All Nations Bible College]]. Forbes lectured on church history and theological topics. 

He came into conflict over one of the articles in the "Doctrinal Basis" all teachers were required to sign: "We believe in the eternal punishment of those who have ignored or rejected the offer of salvation". In 1936, the same year one of his pamphlets, "The Last Enemy" appeared, he resigned; in "The Last Enemy", he denounced the "eternal torment" doctrine, saying it was "derogatory to God’s character" because it posited "infinite torture for finite sin". His interpretation had been reviewed by theologians including [[Samuel H. Wilkinson]]; Wilkinson said Forbes's arguments were "in harmony with the 'Supreme Authority'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Froom|first=Leroy Edwin|authorlink=Le Roy Froom|title=The Conditionalist Faith of Our Fathers|volume=2|year=1965|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association|location=Washington, D.

He is the author of ''The Science of Beauty: An Analytical Inquiry Into the Laws of Æsthetics'' (1881), summarized thus: "A revival of physiognomy as evolutionary utilitarianism; Forbes lays it down as a law that ugliness consists of subjective disgust and an objective 'suggestion of inutility'(157)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pop|first1=Andrei|last2=Widrich|first2=Mechtild|title=Ugliness: The Non-beautiful in Art and Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAtgAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT300|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780766454|page=300|chapter=Annotated Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bogusław Wolniewicz''' (born September 22, 1927, [[Toruń]], died August 4, 2017, [[Warsaw]]) – Polish [[philosopher]], [[logic]]ian, professor of [[humanities]], creator of situational [[ontology]], translator and commentator of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], publicist mostly affiliated with the [[Radio Maryja]] community, known for his anti-semitic views.

== Biography ==

=== Education and career ===
He started his education in 1934 in a Polish primary school. The war didn’t interrupt his education, as no later than November 1939 he was already a student at a German primary school for [[Poles]] with a significantly lowered level of education. In 1941 he started working at Hermann Klechowitz's construction company while also attending a Berufsschule (trade school) affiliated with that company. From 1945 he studied at Queen Jadwiga High School, passing his final exams in 1947.

In the years 1947–1951 he studied at the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń|Nicolaus Copernicus University]]. Among his teachers were [[Tadeusz Czeżowski]], Henryk Elzenberg, Tadeusz Szczurkiewicz and Kazimierz Sośnicki. In 1951 he got his master's degree in philosophy, his thesis ''Criticism of subjective idealism in [[Vladimir Lenin|W. I. Lenin’s]] “Materialism and Empirio-criticism”'' supervised by Czeżowski. Then he worked as a deputy assistant, and later as an assistant at the Department of Logic at the Nicolaus Copernicus University. In 1953  (the height of [[Stalinism]]), due to having his freedom of doing philosophical research limited, he quit his academic career, getting a job at the W-8 department of the Labor Union Association (Poznań), the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (Gdańsk), the Voivodeship Council of Trade Unions and at one of the [[State Agricultural Farm]]s.

In 1956 he started working at the Department of Philosophy at the Pedagogical University in Gdansk. In 1962 he became a doctor of humanities, his dissertation ''Semantics of plain language in Wittgenstein’s new philosophy''written under supervision of prof. Czeżowski and reviewed by Izydora Dąmbska and Henryk Elzenberg.

In 1963, on the initiative of [[Adam Schaff]], he was transferred to the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Warsaw]]. In 1967 he became a [[docent]] of humanities with specialization in philosophy, his dissertation ''Study of Wittgenstein’s philosophy'', reviewed by [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], Adam Schaff, Roman Suszko and [[Peter Geach]]. From 1968, he worked as a full-time docent at the Department of Philosophy at the University of Warsaw. From 1969, he was a supervisor of the Subdivision of Philosophy, quitting two years later.

Since late 1960s, he started becoming famous abroad. In 1967, at the [[University of Chicago]] (as a ''visiting associate professor'') he gave a trimester lecture on ontology of objects and facts. The same year, he gave a talk at the [[Boston University|University of Boston]] and [[Cornell University]]. In 1968 he was one of the four lecturer at the Colloquium of the International Wittgenstein Congress in Vienna. In 1970 he gave a talk at the [[Moscow State University|University of Moscow]]. In 1972 at the [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia, as a visiting professor, he gave a semester lecture on social philosophy and a seminar on Wittgenstein's philosophy. In 1975 he gave talks at the University of Cambridge and the University of Leeds on language and codes as well as the Hume's law, at the invitation of the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Cambridge]].

In 1989 he switched from the Institute of Philosophy to the Institute of Religious Philosophy, where he became a supervisor two years later. He became a [[professor]] in 1990. He ran the Institute of Religious Philosophy until 1998.

In 1997 he retired, but he continued giving lectures – however, in 1998 The Scientific Council of the Department of Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Warsaw didn’t extend his job contract. Prof. Wolniewicz cited the reason behind it to be a disapproval of a decision to lower teaching standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ANTelewizja|title=Profesor Bogusław Wolniewicz o studiach|date=2011-05-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBPp8TwASo&amp;feature=related|accessdate=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He devoted himself to scientific research ever since. During the first semester of the 2008/2009 academic year he returned to the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Warsaw and gave a guest monograph lecture, as a former professor of the university.

=== Publicist activity ===
In 1955 he applied for membership at the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], to which he was accepted in 1956. He held the position of the 1st secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party's Higher Education Committee at the Pedagogical University in Gdansk. He remained a member of the Polish United Workers' Party (despite his aversion to [[Edward Gierek|Gierek's]] government) until 1981. Until 1998, he would give lectures at the Department of Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Warsaw.

In the late 1990s he got involved with communities affiliated with [[Radio Maryja]], where he would have his commentaries broadcast on public, cultural and political events. He also guest-starred on Telewizja Trwam. His writings were also published by „[[Nasz Dziennik]]”, „[[Najwyższy Czas!]]” and „Moja Rodzina”.

In 2004 he criticized the conditions of accepting [[Poland]] into [[European Union]]. During the 2005 parliamentary election he unsuccessfully stood as a candidate to Sejm under [[Janusz Korwin-Mikke Platform]] in an electoral district outside of Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wybory2005.pkw.gov.pl/SJM/PL/WYN/W8/20.htm|title=Wybory 2005|website=www.wybory2005.pkw.gov.pl|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, together with Mieczysław Krąpiec and Czesław Bartnik, he initiated the Independent Civil Group for the Ethics of Media, the goal of which was to „honestly educate the public opinion in the country and around the world on all the doings in media and around it that pose threat to either common decency or freedom of public discussion”.

Later into 2007 he got involved in an event initiated by [[Jerzy Robert Nowak]], a professor at the University of Social and Medial Culture against the book ''[[Fear: Anti-Semitism in Poland after Auschwitz]]'' by [[Jan T. Gross|Jan Tomasz Gross]] that describes the Polish-Jewish relations during the World War Two. Wolniewicz participated in several meetings where he heavily criticized Gross’ book.

In 2009 he entered The Committee for Defense of the Good Name of Poland and Poles initiated by Jerzy Robert Nowak. Since 2014 he's been preparing lectures on things like [[Islam]], ethics and philosophy for the ''Rational Voice'' channel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwGPMSS59XTFYf984VSKXfw|title=głos racjonalny|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; on YouTube.

== Thought ==
He specialized in [[philosophy of religion]] and [[modern philosophy]]. He distanced himself from the main philosophical trends of the 20th century and accepted theses by „great thinkers”, like: [[Aristotle]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and especially [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]. Critical towards [[Sigmund Freud|Freudianism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Postmodern philosophy|post-modernism]] and [[Fundamentalism|religious fundamentalism]], and since 1990s also [[Marxism]], he represented an analytical and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] approach. The main assumptions of his beliefs were axiological absolutism in the rationalist version and metaphysical pessimism in looking at man and society.

=== Metaphilosophical views ===
He believed that philosophy was not [[science]], but it wasn’t cognitively idle either and did have characteristics of knowledge – that's because not every type of [[knowledge]] is of scientific nature, just like history or a [[legal case]] are not science either. Philosophy is an attempt  to rationally capture those issues where the knowledge of scientific type does not apply. It fills the gaps in knowledge for the branches that science hadn’t covered in a particular period of history, but also due to the changes to conditions of social life its goals will never become exhausted. Quite the opposite, the role of philosophy keeps growing in the commotion of modern social life.

Philosophy has a nature of commonsense cognition: it articulates the theses that every person could get to using common sense while also pondering deep enough in the process. Therefore, there is nothing exploratory about it, there are only obvious things, but they’re also subjected to a logical order. Logic brings philosophy closer to science, but it's not just about providing philosophy with formal tools, but about providing philosophy with tools for creating clear thoughts, which in turn makes it possible to tell truth from lie in the entire cognition of non-scientific nature.

Although the need for philosophy keeps rising in today's world, the modern state of philosophical culture is bad. There's a characteristic contract between the opulence of philosophical literature and scarcity of ideas – Wolniewicz referred to this philosophical literature that is devoid of substantial ideas as „philosophical wastepaper”. He put it apart from „philosophical literature”, which included „antiquarian philosophy”, which examines the evolution of ideas and relations between them, combined with lack of interest in the actual value of the discussed views, and the „substantive philosophy”, which attempts to cast light upon actual problems of the era in its aim for the truth. However, the academic philosophy isn’t the only possible „substantive philosophy”, the essayistic and literary creativity is equally important here, as it helps overcome the antiquarism that dominates the academic philosophy.

The substantive philosophy also divides here into two opposing trends: [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutical philosophy]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytical philosophy]]. According to the hermeneutical philosophy, the goal of philosophy is to reveal the purpose of existence and of all things, the mean of which is the ability to deeply immerse oneself in the old time philosophy and eloquence that makes it possible to bring out the same feelings in people – Wolniewicz was critical towards the „hermeneutic philosophy”, considering it to be a type of new [[gnosis]], a form of extreme [[Irrationality|irrationalism]]. In opposition to the hermeneutic philosophy stands [[Analytic philosophy|analytical philosophy]], which recognized existence of objective truth and the ability of human mind to discover it. The division between rationalism (today represented by the analytical philosophy) and irrationalism (today represented by the hermeneutic philosophy) was crossed by Wolniewicz with the division of philosophy into naturalism, which sees a part of nature in the man, and the whole of existence in the nature, and antinaturalism (transcendentalism), which proposes existence of supernatural reality. One example of rationalistic naturalism could be [[positivism]], of antinaturalistic rationalism the early Wittgenstein's philosophy, of the naturalist rationalism the [[New Age]] and [[Sigmund Freud|freudism]], antinaturalist irrationalism – [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]]. Wolniewicz himself considered himself to be a rationalist and antinaturalist.

=== Theology ===
The theological ideas in Wolniewicz's thinking are mostly contained in his article ''Criticism of theodicy in Bayle (Philosophy and values II)''. This article contains dissent with Pierre Bayle's views on the topic of [[theodicy]]. The classical theodicy said that God's goodness and omnipotence are possible to coexist, since evil is not God's invention but man's – the man on the other hand, in order to do good, has to be free, and since he's free, he has to be able to do evil as well. Bayle reasoned against the classic theodicy by saying that although freedom implies the [[Modal logic|ability]] to do evil, it doesn’t imply its [[Modal logic|necessity]], therefore evil can be avoided even when assuming human freedom.

When searching for arguments that could refute the legitimacy of Bayle's argumentation, Wolniewicz referred himself to non-standard [[Modal logic|modal]] concepts borrowed from Megarian logic. Its representative, [[Diodorus Cronus]] presented prospective understanding of abilities, defining what's possible as what is or will be. Such understanding of ability is still not enough to oppose Bayle's argumentation against theodicy in line with theology, as it accepts the concept that those who are saved will sin in future, too – therefore Wolniewicz constructed a slightly different definition of ability that he calls „pseudo-Diodoric”. According to that definition, because something can happen it means that something similar has already happened or will happen in the future. With such definition of ability, the classic theodicy is logically sound and not subject to the criticism submitted by Bayle.

=== Axiology ===
In the field of [[axiology]], Wolniewicz continued the work of Henryk Elzenberg, yet despite absorbing many of his fundamental ideas, he transformed them and rephrased them. He tried to transform Elzenberg's axiology in the spirit of objectivism and rationalism. Like Elzenberg, he divided the entire axiology into the formal and substantive one, covering the former using the concept apparatus of semantics of possible worlds and situational ontology. Formal axiology formulates hypothetical judgments regarding values. It answers the questions of what values are (logic and metaphysics of values), how to recognize them (epistemology of values) and what impact they have on people (anthropology of values). Substantive axiology uses categoric judgments  in which it assigns specific values to specific objects.

While aiming for a simplicity of the system, Wolniewicz assigned one ontic category to all values – out of the most often highlighted ontic categories of objects (thing, thing's state, process, event, trait, relation) values are (possible) states of things.

=== Philosophy of culture and views on Christianity ===
Bogusław Wolniewicz believed that there is no [[Divine providence|Providence]] and that people are left on their own. He didn’t believe in [[Afterlife|life after death]], either. He didn’t deny existence of „supreme intelligence”, though. In many matters he disagreed with the [[Christian Church|Church]], but he respected it and believed it (and [[Christianity]] as a whole) to be one of the foundations of the western civilization [7] .

=== Philosophy of law ===
His philosophy of law is mostly a reflection, related to the philosophy of culture, on the place of law in the European civilization, the result of which are his views on [[capital punishment]]. According to Wolniewcz, the [[Roman law]] is the third foundation of the European civilization, after the scientific view of the world and the Christian religion. The foundation of the Roman law, on the other hand, is the principle of [[justice]] formulated by [[Cicero]] and [[Ulpian]] ''cuique suum tribuere'' („may all get their due”). In this rule, justice isn’t formulated in a utilitarian way, which is as a group of benefits that can be achieved by following some rules, but in an objective one, as it refers to the internal moral order. A crime is a violation of such order, whereas punishment is a restoration of it. Due to objectivity of the moral order of the world, a just punishment can only depend on the severity of guilt: it cannot depend on any external benefits that could alternatively be referred to from increasing or lowering the punishment in a way that is inadequate to the guilt. Therefore, punishment is not some form of vengeance that society imposes on the criminal, as revenge only magnifies the harm that was done – on the other hand, it's a rightful retaliation, that evens out said harm, but independently of particular benefits and losses that someone could potentially experience out of that.

In his view, concepts of punishment different from the one based on the Roman principle of justice appeared in (particularly harshly criticized by him) the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] culture. He distinguishes two such concepts here (similar to his own, defined as a retribution concept): preventive, which says that punishment is mostly a measure to prevent crimes and corrective, which says that the purpose of punishment is to upbring and rehabilitate. Both those concepts contradict the Roman principle of justice, as they assign utilitarian functions to punishment and reject the principle of strict adequacy between the guilt and the punishment that only depends on it. Therefore, the preventive and corrective concepts favor abolition of death penalty (''abolitionism''), the retribution concept, on the other hand, favors upholding it (''rigorism''). For abolitionists, the greatest value is human life, therefore it has to be protected at all costs, for a rigorist on the other hand, the greatest value is humanity, therefore actions that cross the borders of it have to be punished with death as only thing adequate to the guilt.

Wolniewicz believed that the objection to death penalty that is present so often these days is a result of a crisis of the European culture as a whole. The essence of law is a positive faith in correctness of the rules – the „living law” that beacons the society. The atrophy of this faith and the adversity to protecting the social order make law dead, a paper record devoid of actual meaning to people. The atrophy of awareness of law in society leads to atrophy of the will to fight evil, a doubt in the moral order and consequently, to the triumph of evil. He says that the most likely consequence of such state of affairs will be a birth of new [[totalitarianism]].

== Influence ==
Among Wolniewicz's direct students are his doctoral candidates – Zbigniew Musiał, [[Ulrich Schrade]] (died in 2009), Beata Witkowska-Maksimczuk; his graduate students – Agnieszka Maria Nogal, Paweł Okołowski, Klaudiusz Suczyński; participants of Wolniewicz's seminars of many years – Jan Zubelewicz, Jędrzej Stanisławek. These people continue and develop Wolniewicz's work and his style of doing philosophy.

Left under a significant influence of Wolniewicz were not only his closest students, but also plenty of key Polish philosophers and logicians. Among them was especially Roman Suszko, whose papers on logic were made under a significant influence of the philosophical interpretation of Wittgenstein made by Wolniewicz, especially included in the paper ''Things and facts''. The fruit of that inspiration is non-Frege logic, one of the key achievements of the post-war Polish logic. One student of Suszka and colleague of Wolniewicz was logician Mieczysław Omyła, who continued both logical and ontological work of Suszka and referenced Wolniewicz's situational ontology more than once. Situational ontology also inspires mathematical papers on [[Lattice (order)|conditionally distributive lattices]] by Jan Zygmunt and Jacek Hawranek. Wolniewicz's papers were also met with interest from philosophers and logicians abroad, as evidenced by multiple reviews of his English papers in „[[Mathematical Reviews|Mathematical Review]]”.

He also made many appearances in daily newspapers, on radio and TV. That way he leaves impact both with his views on theoretical philosophy, including reception of Wittgenstein in the Polish culture, as well as on the practical philosophy, including issues related to the current social and cultural matters.

Criticism of Wolniewicz mostly revolves around his social, political and cultural beliefs. It mostly comes from proponents of political and cultural liberalism, as well as extreme-left groups. Also faced with criticism in a public discourse was Wolniewicz's expressive manner of speaking (like using such terms as „half-brain”, „neo-cannibalism” or „mengelism” when referring to his world-view opponents). Among philosophers, criticism of Wolniewicz, not just in specialized magazines but even daily press, came from, among others, Jacek Jadacki, Jacek Hołówka and [[Andrzej Bogusławski]].

== Medals ==
By a decision of president [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] on November 11, 1997, „for outstanding contribution to the Polish science”, he was awarded with an [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Officer's Cross of Polonia Restituta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WMP19980060110|title=Postanowienie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 11 listopada 1997 r. o nadaniu orderów.|website=prawo.sejm.gov.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He didn’t, however, deny existence of an intelligence supreme to the man.

He died on August 4, 2017, few weeks prior to his 90th birthday. On August 9, at the St. [[Andrew Bobola|Andrzej Bobola]] church in Warsaw, a funeral service took place in honor of the professor, led by father Andrzej Spławski.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1812497,Warszawa-pozegnala-prof-Boguslawa-Wolniewicza-Staral-sie-sluzyc-madrosci|title=Warszawa pożegnała prof.

== Controversies ==
After Bogusław Wolniewicz's appearance on January 31, 2009 on Radio Maryja, the Council of Media Ethics declared that his comments, contained [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] views and violated „the basic ethical norms and Polish law”. He was reported to the prosecutor's office by the Open Poland association, citing encouraging hatred against other nationalities as the reason. No investigation was opened as there were no indications of committing a forbidden act. The explanation included a remark that the spoken words were of xenophobic nature, but they didn’t constitute encouraging hatred against other nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://otwarta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Raport09-Interwencje-prawne-lekki.pdf|title=Interwencje prawne i obywatelskie 2008–2009, Otwarta Rzeczpospolita.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2532">'''Boncompagno da Signa''' (also ''Boncompagnus'' or ''Boncompagni''; c. 1165/1175 &amp;ndash; after 1240) was an Italian scholar, grammarian, historian, and philosopher.

Born in [[Signa]], near [[Florence]], between 1165 and 1175, he was a professor of [[rhetoric]] (''ars dictaminis'') at the [[University of Bologna]] and then the [[University of Padua]].

In the early thirteenth century, he was one of the first Western European authors to write in the vernacular, in his case [[Italian language|Italian]]. He spent his career travelling between [[Ancona]], [[Venice]], and Bologna and died at Florence. He wrote a history of the [[Siege of Ancona]], his only work of that kind, and works on [[chess]]. His love of elaborate practical jokes is described by Helen Waddell in ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1927).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3146">The '''Collection of Swiss Law Sources''' (''Sammlung Schweizerischer Rechtsquellen'' in German; ''Collection des sources du droit suisse'' in French; ''Collana Fonti del diritto svizzero'' in Italian) is a collection of [[critical edition]]s of historical legal documents (regarded as [[sources of law]]) created on [[Switzerland|Swiss territory]] from the early [[Middle Ages]] up to 1798.

It is edited by the Law Sources Foundation of the Swiss Lawyers
Society.  The Law Sources Foundation was established in 1894 (then
called Law Sources Commission) for this purpose.

Since then, over 100 volumes (60,000+ pages) of source material (e.g.,
statutes, decrees, or regulations, but also administrative documents
and court transcripts) from the early Middle Ages until early modern
times have been published in the form of source editions.

The primary sources are manuscripts written in various regional
historical forms of [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romansh language|Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and [[Latin]], which were transcribed (using [[diplomatics|diplomatic transcription]], annotated, and commented by the
editors.  The [[critical apparatus|apparatuses]] are in modern German, French, or Italian.
The goal of the Collection is to make the sources available to
[[legal history|historians of law]], law researchers, [[historian]]s in general, as well as
to researchers from other fields and interested laypeople.  Most of
the older volumes only have a single [[general index]], containing
persons, places, and general terms; newer volumes usually have a separate
index of persons and places.

The Collection is organized by modern [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], with further
subdivisions by historical areas of jurisdiction, such as towns or [[bailiwick]]s.

At the moment, the Collection of Swiss Law Sources covers 17 of the 26
Swiss cantons to different extents.  The edition of the Collection is
an ongoing project and further volumes are in preparation.  The Foundation receives funding from the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]], the Friedrich-Emil-Welti-Fonds, individual cantons, and other sources (e.g., municipalities).

{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evidence of common descent''' of living [[organism]]s has been discovered by scientists researching in a variety of disciplines over many decades, demonstrating that [[common descent|all life on Earth comes from a single ancestor]]. This forms an important part of the [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] on which evolutionary theory rests, demonstrates that [[evolution]] does occur, and illustrates the processes that created Earth's [[biodiversity]]. It supports the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]]—the current [[scientific theory]] that explains how and why life changes over time. Evolutionary biologists document evidence of common descent, all the way back to the [[last universal common ancestor]], by developing testable predictions, testing hypotheses, and constructing theories that illustrate and describe its causes.

Comparison of the [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA genetic sequence]]s of organisms has revealed that organisms that are [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] close have a higher degree of DNA sequence similarity than organisms that are phylogenetically distant. Genetic fragments such as [[pseudogene]]s, regions of [[DNA]] that are [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologous]] to a gene in a related [[organism]], but are no longer active and appear to be undergoing a steady process of degeneration from cumulative mutations support common descent alongside the universal biochemical organization and molecular variance patterns found in all organisms. Additional genetic information conclusively supports the relatedness of life and has allowed scientists (since the discovery of DNA) to develop phylogenetic trees: a construction of organisms evolutionary relatedness. It has also led to the development of [[molecular clock]] techniques to date taxon divergence times and to calibrate these with the fossil record.

[[Fossils]] are important for estimating when various lineages developed in [[geologic time]]. As fossilization is an uncommon occurrence, usually requiring hard body parts and death near a site where [[sediment]]s are being deposited, the fossil record only provides sparse and intermittent information about the evolution of life. Evidence of organisms prior to the development of hard body parts such as shells, bones and teeth is especially scarce, but exists in the form of ancient [[microfossil]]s, as well as impressions of various soft-bodied organisms. The comparative study of the [[anatomy]] of groups of animals shows structural features that are fundamentally similar (homologous), demonstrating phylogenetic and ancestral relationships with other organisms, most especially when compared with fossils of ancient [[Extinction|extinct]] organisms. [[Vestigiality|Vestigial structures]] and comparisons in [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] are largely a contributing factor in anatomical resemblance in concordance with common descent. Since [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes do not leave fossils, research into the evolution of the basic cellular processes is done largely by comparison of existing organisms' [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]]. Many lineages diverged at different stages of development, so it is possible to determine when certain metabolic processes appeared by comparing the traits of the descendants of a common ancestor.

Evidence from [[animal coloration]] was gathered by some of Darwin's contemporaries; [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]], and [[aposematism|warning coloration]] are all readily explained by natural selection. Special cases like the seasonal changes in the plumage of the [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], camouflaging it [[snow camouflage|against snow]] in winter and [[disruptive coloration|against brown moorland]] in summer provide compelling evidence that selection is at work. Further evidence comes from the field of [[biogeography]] because evolution with common descent provides the best and most thorough explanation for a variety of facts concerning the geographical distribution of plants and animals across the world. This is especially obvious in the field of [[insular biogeography]]. Combined with the well-established geological theory of [[plate tectonics]], common descent provides a way to combine facts about the current distribution of species with evidence from the fossil record to provide a logically consistent explanation of how the distribution of living organisms has changed over time.

The development and spread of [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] bacteria provides evidence that evolution due to [[natural selection]] is an ongoing process in the natural world. Natural selection is ubiquitous in all research pertaining to evolution, taking note of the fact that all of the following examples in each section of the article document the process. Alongside this are observed instances of the separation of populations of species into sets of new species ([[speciation]]). Speciation has been [[Laboratory experiments of speciation|observed in the lab]] and in nature. Multiple forms of such have been described and documented as examples for individual modes of speciation. Furthermore, evidence of common descent extends from direct laboratory experimentation with the [[selective breeding]] of organisms—historically and currently—and other controlled experiments involving many of the topics in the article. This article summarizes the varying disciplines that provide the evidence for evolution and the common descent of all life on Earth, accompanied by numerous and specialized examples, indicating a compelling [[Consilience|consilience of evidence]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Evidence from comparative physiology and biochemistry==
{{See also|Archaeogenetics|Common descent|Last universal ancestor|Most recent common ancestor|Universal Code (Biology)}}

===Genetics===
One of the strongest evidences for common descent comes from gene sequences. [[Sequence alignment|Comparative sequence analysis]] examines the relationship between the DNA sequences of different species,&lt;ref name=mount&gt;{{cite book| last=Mount | first=D.M. | year=2004 | title=Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis |edition=2nd | publisher= Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, NY. |isbn=978-0-87969-608-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing several lines of evidence that confirm Darwin's original hypothesis of common descent. If the hypothesis of common descent is true, then species that share a common ancestor inherited that ancestor's DNA sequence, as well as mutations unique to that ancestor. More closely related species have a greater fraction of identical sequence and shared substitutions compared to more distantly related species.

The simplest and most powerful evidence is provided by [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetic reconstruction]]. Such reconstructions, especially when done using slowly evolving protein sequences, are often quite robust and can be used to reconstruct a great deal of the evolutionary history of modern organisms (and even in some instances of the evolutionary history of extinct organisms, such as the recovered gene sequences of [[mammoth]]s or [[Neanderthal]]s). These reconstructed phylogenies recapitulate the relationships established through morphological and biochemical studies.&lt;ref name="PennyFoulds1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=David |last2=Foulds |first2=L.

Phylogenetic relationships extend to a wide variety of nonfunctional sequence elements, including repeats, [[transposon]]s, [[pseudogene]]s, and [[silent mutation|mutations in protein-coding sequences that do not change the amino-acid sequence]]. While a minority of these elements might later be found to harbor function, in aggregate they demonstrate that identity must be the product of common descent rather than common function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max, Edward |date=5 May 2003 |title=Plagiarized Errors and Molecular Genetics |website=The Talk Origins Archive |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universal biochemical organisation and molecular variance patterns====
All known [[extant taxon|extant]] (surviving) organisms are based on the same biochemical processes: genetic information encoded as nucleic acid ([[DNA]], or [[RNA]] for many viruses), transcribed into [[RNA]], then translated into [[protein]]s (that is, polymers of [[amino acid]]s) by highly conserved [[ribosome]]s. Perhaps most tellingly, the [[Genetic Code]] (the "translation table" between DNA and amino acids) is the same for almost every organism, meaning that a piece of [[DNA]] in a [[bacteria|bacterium]] codes for the same amino acid as in a human [[cell (biology)|cell]]. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used as energy currency by all extant life. A deeper understanding of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|developmental biology]] shows that common morphology is, in fact, the product of shared genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Evolutionary Biology| edition=3rd| first=Douglas J. | last=Futuyma  |authorlink=Douglas Futuyma | year=1998| pages=108–110| publisher=Sinauer Associates | isbn=978-0-87893-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although camera-like eyes are believed to have evolved independently on many separate occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-19-854980-2|author=Haszprunar |year=1995 |editor=Taylor |chapter=The mollusca: Coelomate turbellarians or mesenchymate annelids?|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |title=Origin and evolutionary radiation of the Mollusca : centenary symposium of the Malacological Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; they share a common set of light-sensing proteins ([[opsin]]s), suggesting a common point of origin for all sighted creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.imls.uzh.ch/research/noll/publ/Dev_Cell_2003_5_773_785.pdf |pmid=14602077 |year=2003 |last1=Kozmik |first1=Z. |last2=Daube |first2=M. |last3=Frei |first3=E. |last4=Norman |first4=B. |last5=Kos |first5=L. |last6=Dishaw |first6=L.J. |last7=Noll |first7=M. |last8=Piatigorsky |first8=J. |title=Role of Pax genes in eye evolution: A cnidarian PaxB gene uniting Pax2 and Pax6 functions |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=773–785 |journal=Developmental Cell |doi=10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00325-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Land, M.F. and Nilsson, D.-E., ''Animal Eyes'', Oxford University Press, Oxford (2002) {{ISBN|0-19-850968-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the familiar vertebrate body plan, whose structure is controlled by the [[Hox gene|homeobox (Hox) family of genes]].

====DNA sequencing====

Comparison of DNA sequences allows organisms to be grouped by sequence similarity, and the resulting [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] trees are typically congruent with traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and are often used to strengthen or correct taxonomic classifications. Sequence comparison is considered a measure robust enough to correct erroneous assumptions in the phylogenetic tree in instances where other evidence is scarce. For example, neutral human DNA sequences are approximately 1.2% divergent (based on substitutions) from those of their nearest genetic relative, the [[chimpanzee]], 1.6% from [[gorilla]]s, and 6.6% from [[baboon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen | first1=F.C. | last2=Li | first2=W.H. |title=Genomic Divergences between Humans and Other Hominoids and the Effective Population Size of the Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimpanzees |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=444–56 |year=2001 |pmc=1235277 |doi=10.1086/318206 |pmid=11170892 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Also, while the term originally referred to fossil evidence, this too is a trace from the past corresponding to some living beings that, when alive, physically embodied this link.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' report ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/science/07evolve.html Still Evolving, Human Genes Tell New Story]'', based on ''[http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072 A Map of Recent Positive Selection in the Human Genome]'', states the [[International HapMap Project]] is "providing the strongest evidence yet that humans are still evolving" and details some of that evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of the [[16S ribosomal RNA]] gene, a vital gene encoding a part of the [[ribosome]], was used to find the broad phylogenetic relationships between all extant life. The analysis by [[Carl Woese]] resulted in the [[three-domain system]], arguing for two major splits in the early evolution of life. The first split led to modern [[Bacteria]] and the subsequent split led to modern [[Archaea]] and [[Eukaryotes]].

Some DNA sequences are shared by very different organisms. It has been predicted by the theory of evolution that the differences in such DNA sequences between two organisms should roughly resemble both the biological difference between them according to their [[anatomy]] and the time that had passed since these two organisms have separated in the course of evolution, as seen in [[fossil]] evidence. The rate of accumulating such changes should be low for some sequences, namely those that code for critical [[RNA]] or [[protein]]s, and high for others that code for less critical RNA or proteins; but for every specific sequence, the rate of change should be roughly constant over time. These results have been experimentally confirmed. Two examples are DNA sequences coding for [[rRNA]], which is highly conserved, and DNA sequences coding for [[fibrinopeptide]]s ([[amino acid]] chains that are discarded during the formation of [[fibrin]]), which are highly non-conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Bruce | last1=Alberts | author1-link=Bruce Alberts |first2=Alexander | last2=Johnson |first3=Julian | last3=Lewis |first4=Martin | last4=Raff |first5=Keith | last5=Roberts |first6=Peter | last6=Walter | author6-link=Peter Walter |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |publisher=Routledge |date=March 2002 |isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proteins====

[[Proteome|Proteomic]] evidence also supports the universal ancestry of life. Vital [[protein]]s, such as the [[ribosome]], [[DNA polymerase]], and [[RNA polymerase]], are found in everything from the most primitive bacteria to the most complex mammals. The core part of the protein is conserved across all lineages of life, serving similar functions. Higher organisms have evolved additional [[protein subunit]]s, largely affecting the regulation and [[protein-protein interaction]] of the core. Other overarching similarities between all lineages of extant organisms, such as [[DNA]], [[RNA]], amino acids, and the [[lipid bilayer]], give support to the theory of common descent. Phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences from various organisms produce similar trees of relationship between all organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phylointelligence.org/combined.html "Converging Evidence for Evolution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201081747/http://www.phylointelligence.org/combined.html |date=2010-12-01 }} Phylointelligence: Evolution for Everyone. 26 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] of DNA, RNA, and amino acids is conserved across all known life. As there is no functional advantage to right- or left-handed molecular chirality, the simplest hypothesis is that the choice was made randomly by early organisms and passed on to all extant life through common descent. Further evidence for reconstructing ancestral lineages comes from [[junk DNA]] such as [[pseudogene]]s, "dead" genes that steadily accumulate mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Petrov, D.A.; Hartl, D.L. |title=Pseudogene evolution and natural selection for a compact genome |journal=The Journal of Heredity |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10833048 |doi=10.1093/jhered/91.3.221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pseudogenes====

Pseudogenes, also known as [[noncoding DNA]], are extra DNA in a genome that do not get transcribed into RNA to synthesize proteins. Some of this noncoding DNA has known functions, but much of it has no known function and is called "Junk DNA".&lt;ref name="Xiao-Jie 17–24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao-Jie|first=Lu|last2=Ai-Mei|first2=Gao|last3=Li-Juan|first3=Ji|last4=Jiang|first4=Xu|date=2015-01-01|title=Pseudogene in cancer: real functions and promising signature|url=http://jmg.bmj.com/content/52/1/17|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=17–24|doi=10.1136/jmedgenet-2014-102785|issn=0022-2593|pmid=25391452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vanin|first=E F|date=1985|title=Processed Pseudogenes: Characteristics and Evolution|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=253–272|doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.19.120185.001345|pmid=3909943|issn=0066-4197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.gersteinlab.org/papers/e-print/encodepgenes/preprint.pdf|title=Pseudogenes in the ENCODE Regions: Consensus Annotation, Analysis of Transcription and Evolution|last=Gerstein|first=Mark|date=2006|website=Gerstein Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/what-is-junk-dna.aspx|title=What is Junk DNA?|date=2010-05-07|work=News-Medical.net|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of a vestige since replicating these genes uses energy, making it a waste in many cases. A pseudogene can be produced when a coding gene accumulates mutations that prevent it from being transcribed, making it non-functional.&lt;ref name="Xiao-Jie 17–24"/&gt; But since it is not transcribed, it may disappear without affecting fitness, unless it has provided some beneficial function as non-coding DNA. Non-functional pseudogenes may be passed on to later species, thereby labeling the later species as descended from the earlier species.

====Other mechanisms====

A large body of molecular evidence supports a variety of mechanisms for large evolutionary changes, including: [[genome]] and [[gene duplication]], which facilitates rapid evolution by providing substantial quantities of genetic material under weak or no selective constraints; [[horizontal gene transfer]], the process of transferring genetic material to another cell that is not an organism's offspring, allowing for species to acquire beneficial genes from each other; and [[genetic recombination|recombination]], capable of reassorting large numbers of different [[allele]]s and of establishing [[reproductive isolation]]. The [[endosymbiotic theory]] explains the origin of [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s (including [[chloroplast]]s), which are [[organelle]]s of eukaryotic cells, as the incorporation of an ancient [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cell into ancient [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell. Rather than evolving [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s slowly, this theory offers a mechanism for a sudden evolutionary leap by incorporating the genetic material and biochemical composition of a separate species. Evidence supporting this mechanism has been found in the [[protist]] ''[[Hatena arenicola|Hatena]]'': as a [[predator]] it engulfs a [[green alga]]l cell, which subsequently behaves as an [[endosymbiont]], nourishing ''Hatena'', which in turn loses its feeding apparatus and behaves as an [[autotroph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Okamoto | first1=N. | last2=Inouye | first2=I. |year=2005 | title=A secondary symbiosis in progress |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5746 |page=287 |doi=10.1126/science.1116125 |pmid=16224014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Okamoto | first1=N. | last2=Inouye | first2=I. | title=Hatena arenicola gen. et sp. nov., a katablepharid undergoing probable plastid acquisition |journal=Protist |volume=157 |issue=4 |pages=401–19 |year=2006 |pmid=16891155 |doi=10.1016/j.protis.2006.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes do not leave fossils, research into the evolution of the basic cellular processes is done largely by comparison of existing organisms. Many lineages diverged when new metabolic processes appeared, and it is theoretically possible to determine when certain metabolic processes appeared by comparing the traits of the descendants of a common ancestor or by detecting their physical manifestations. As an example, the appearance of [[oxygen]] in the [[earth's atmosphere]] is linked to the evolution of [[photosynthesis]].

===Specific examples from comparative physiology and biochemistry===

====Chromosome 2 in humans====
{{Main|Chromosome 2 (human)}}
{{further|Chimpanzee Genome Project#Genes of the Chromosome 2 fusion site}}
[[File:Chromosome 2 merge en.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1b: '''Fusion of ancestral chromosomes left distinctive remnants of telomeres, and a vestigial centromere]]

Evidence for the evolution of ''Homo sapiens'' from a common ancestor with chimpanzees is found in the number of chromosomes in humans as compared to all other members of [[Hominidae]]. All hominidae have 24 pairs of chromosomes, except humans, who have only 23 pairs. Human chromosome 2 is a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral chromosomes.&lt;ref name="fusion"&gt;MacAndrew, Alec. [http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes]. Accessed 18 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-WAHpC0Ah0 Evidence of Common Ancestry: Human Chromosome 2] (video) 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for this includes:

* The correspondence of chromosome 2 to two ape chromosomes. The closest human relative, the [[common chimpanzee]], has near-identical DNA sequences to human chromosome 2, but they are found in two separate chromosomes. The same is true of the more distant [[gorilla]] and [[orangutan]].&lt;ref name="compare"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yunis | first1=J.J. | title=The origin of man: a chromosomal pictorial legacy | journal=Science | year=1982 | pages=1525–1530 | volume=215 | pmid=7063861 | doi=10.1126/science.7063861 | last2=Prakash | first2=O. | issue=4539|bibcode=1982Sci...215.1525Y | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="similarities"&gt;[http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html Human and Ape Chromosomes] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/615A9juxT?url=http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html |date=2011-08-20 }}; accessed 8 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The presence of a [[Vestigial structure|vestigial]] [[centromere]]. Normally a chromosome has just one centromere, but in chromosome 2 there are remnants of a second centromere.&lt;ref name="centromeres"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for an ancestral alphoid domain on the long arm of human chromosome 2 | journal=Human Genetics | year=1992 | pages=247–9 | volume=89 | pmid=1587535 | doi=10.1007/BF00217134 | last2=Pedicini | first2=A | last3=Caiulo | first3=A | last4=Zuffardi | first4=O | last5=Fraccaro | first5=M | issue=2 |last1=Avarello |first1=Rosamaria |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The presence of vestigial [[telomere]]s. These are normally found only at the ends of a chromosome, but in chromosome 2 there are additional telomere sequences in the middle.&lt;ref name="telomeres"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year=1991 | pages=9051–5 | volume=88 | pmid=1924367 | doi=10.1073/pnas.88.20.9051 | last2=Baldini | first2=A | last3=Ward | first3=DC | last4=Reeders | first4=ST | last5=Wells | first5=RA | issue=20 | pmc=52649 |last1=Ijdo |first1=J. W.|bibcode=1991PNAS...88.9051I |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosome 2 thus presents strong evidence in favour of the common descent of humans and other [[ape]]s. According to J. W. Ijdo, "We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2."&lt;ref name="telomeres"/&gt;

====Cytochrome c and b====
{{Main|Cytochrome c}}

A classic example of biochemical evidence for evolution is the variance of the ubiquitous (i.e. all living organisms have it, because it performs very basic life functions) [[protein]] [[Cytochrome c]] in living cells. The variance of cytochrome c of different organisms is measured in the number of differing amino acids, each differing amino acid being a result of a [[base pair]] substitution, a [[mutation]]. If each differing amino acid is assumed the result of one base pair substitution, it can be calculated how long ago the two species diverged by multiplying the number of base pair substitutions by the estimated time it takes for a substituted base pair of the cytochrome c gene to be successfully passed on. For example, if the average time it takes for a base pair of the cytochrome c gene to mutate is N years, the number of amino acids making up the cytochrome c protein in monkeys differ by one from that of humans, this leads to the conclusion that the two species diverged N years ago.

The primary structure of cytochrome c consists of a chain of about 100 [[amino acid]]s. Many higher order organisms possess a chain of 104 amino acids.&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/lessons/molb.ws.pdf Amino acid sequences in cytochrome c proteins from different species], adapted from Strahler, Arthur; Science and Earth History, 1997. page 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cytochrome c molecule has been extensively studied for the glimpse it gives into evolutionary biology. Both [[chicken]] and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s have identical sequence homology (amino acid for amino acid), as do [[pig]]s, [[cow]]s and [[sheep]]. Both [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s share the identical molecule, while [[rhesus monkey]]s share all but one of the amino acids:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lurquin | first1=P.F. | last2=Stone | first2=L. | title=Genes, Culture, and Human Evolution: A Synthesis |publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Incorporated |year=2006 |page=79 |isbn=978-1-4051-5089-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zdeWdF_NQhEC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=chimpanzee+rhesus+cytochrome+c}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 66th amino acid is [[isoleucine]] in the former and [[threonine]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="indiana"/&gt;

What makes these homologous similarities particularly suggestive of common ancestry in the case of cytochrome c, in addition to the fact that the phylogenies derived from them match other phylogenies very well, is the high degree of functional redundancy of the cytochrome c molecule. The different existing configurations of amino acids do not significantly affect the functionality of the protein, which indicates that the base pair substitutions are not part of a directed design, but the result of random mutations that aren't subject to selection.&lt;ref name="29+ evidences"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section4.html#protein_redundancy |title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution; Protein functional redundancy] |first=Douglas |last=Theobald |date=2004 |website=The Talk Origins Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Cytochrome b is commonly used as a region of [[mitochondrial DNA]] to determine [[phylogenetic]] relationships between organisms due to its sequence variability. It is considered most useful in determining relationships within [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[Genus|genera]]. Comparative studies involving cytochrome b have resulted in new classification schemes and have been used to assign newly described species to a genus, as well as deepen the understanding of evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="2001Castresana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Castresana | first1=J. | title=Cytochrome ''b'' Phylogeny and the Taxonomy of Great Apes and Mammals | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=18 | pages=465–471 | year=2001 | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/4/465 | pmid=11264397 | issue=4 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endogenous retroviruses====
[[Endogenous retrovirus]]es (or ERVs) are remnant sequences in the genome left from ancient viral infections in an organism. The retroviruses (or virogenes) are always [[heredity|passed on]] to the next generation of that organism that received the infection. This leaves the virogene left in the genome. Because this event is rare and random, finding identical chromosomal positions of a virogene in two different species suggests common ancestry.&lt;ref name="29+ evidences"/&gt; Cats ([[Felidae]]) present a notable instance of virogene sequences demonstrating common descent. The standard phylogenetic tree for Felidae have smaller cats (''[[Felis chaus]]'', ''[[Felis silvestris]]'', ''[[Felis nigripes]]'', and ''[[Felis catus]]'') diverging from larger cats such as the subfamily [[Pantherinae]] and other [[Carnivora|carnivores]]. The fact that small cats have an ERV where the larger cats do not suggests that the gene was inserted into the ancestor of the small cats after the larger cats had diverged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Discovery of a New Endogenous Type C Retrovirus (FcEV) in Cats: Evidence for RD-114 Being an FcEVGag-Pol/Baboon Endogenous Virus BaEVEnv Recombinant| journal=Journal of Virology| year=1999| volume=73| pmid=10482547| issue=10 | last1=Van Der Kuyl | first1=A.C. | last2=Dekker | first2=J.T. | last3=Goudsmit | first3= J. | pages= 7994–8002 | pmc= 112814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is with humans and chimps.

Mathematical models of evolution, pioneered by the likes of [[Sewall Wright]], [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and extended via [[diffusion equation|diffusion theory]] by [[Motoo Kimura]], allow predictions about the genetic structure of evolving populations. Direct examination of the genetic structure of modern populations via DNA sequencing has allowed verification of many of these predictions. For example, the [[Recent single-origin hypothesis|Out of Africa]] theory of human origins, which states that modern humans developed in Africa and a small sub-population migrated out (undergoing a [[population bottleneck]]), implies that modern populations should show the signatures of this migration pattern. Specifically, post-bottleneck populations (Europeans and Asians) should show lower overall genetic diversity and a more uniform distribution of allele frequencies compared to the African population. Both of these predictions are borne out by actual data from a number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pallen | first=Mark | title=Rough Guide to Evolution|publisher=Rough Guides|year=2009 |pages=200–206|isbn=978-1-85828-946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence from comparative anatomy==
[[Comparative anatomy|Comparative study of the anatomy]] of groups of animals or plants reveals that certain structural features are basically similar. For example, the basic structure of all [[flower]]s consists of [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, [[Gynoecium|stigma, style and ovary]]; yet the size, [[colour]], [[number]] of parts and specific structure are different for each individual species. The neural anatomy of fossilized remains may also be compared using advanced imaging techniques.&lt;ref name="journal nature"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tanaka, G.; Hou, X.; Ma, X.; Edgecombe, G.D.; Strausfeld, N.J. |title=Chelicerate neural ground pattern in a Cambrian great appendage arthropod |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7471 |pages=364–367 |date=October 2013 |pmid=24132294 |doi=10.1038/nature12520 |bibcode=2013Natur.502..364T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental biology and embryonic development===
{{Main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}
{{See also|Embryogenesis}}
Evolutionary developmental biology is the biological field that compares the developmental process of different organisms to determine ancestral relationships between species. A large variety of organism's genomes contain a [[Evolutionary developmental biology#The developmental-genetic toolkit|small fraction of genes]] that control the organisms development. [[Hox genes]] are an example of these types of nearly universal genes in organisms pointing to an origin of common ancestry. Embryological evidence comes from the development of organisms at the embryological level with the comparison of different organisms embryos similarity. Remains of ancestral traits often appear and disappear in different stages of the embryological development process.

Some examples include:
* Hair growth and loss ([[lanugo]]) during human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11692-010-9085-4 |title=The Evo-Devo Puzzle of Human Hair Patterning |year=2010 |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |journal=Evolutionary Biology |volume=37 |issue=2–3 |pages=113–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development and degeneration of a [[yolk sac]].
* Terrestrial frogs and [[salamander]]s passing through the larval stage within the egg—with features of typically aquatic larvae—but hatch ready for life on land;&lt;ref name="Douglas J. Futuyma 1998 122"&gt;{{cite book | title=Evolutionary Biology| edition=3rd| first=Douglas J. | last=Futuyma | year=1998| page=122| publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc.| isbn=978-0-87893-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The appearance of gill-like structures ([[pharyngeal arch]]) in vertebrate embryo development. Note that in fish, the arches continue to develop as [[branchial arch]]es while in humans, for example, they give rise to a [[Pharyngeal arch#Specific arches|variety of structures]] within the head and neck.

===Homologous structures and divergent (adaptive) evolution===
If widely separated groups of organisms are originated from a common ancestry, they are expected to have certain basic features in common. The degree of resemblance between two organisms should indicate how closely related they are in evolution:
* Groups with little in common are assumed to have diverged from a [[common ancestor]] much earlier in geological history than groups with a lot in common;
* In deciding how closely related two animals are, a comparative anatomist looks for [[structure]]s that are fundamentally similar, even though they may serve different functions in the [[adult]]. Such structures are described as [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] and suggest a common origin.
* In cases where the similar structures serve different functions in adults, it may be necessary to trace their origin and [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. A similar developmental origin suggests they are the same structure, and thus likely derived from a common ancestor.

When a group of organisms share a homologous structure that is specialized to perform a variety of functions to adapt different environmental conditions and modes of life, it is called [[adaptive radiation]]. The gradual spreading of organisms with adaptive radiation is known as [[divergent evolution]].

===Nested hierarchies and classification===
[[Biological classification|Taxonomy]] is based on the fact that all organisms are related to each other in nested hierarchies based on shared characteristics. Most existing species can be organized rather easily in a nested hierarchical classification. This is evident from the Linnaean classification scheme. Based on shared derived characters, closely related organisms can be placed in one group (such as a genus), several genera can be grouped together into one family, several families can be grouped together into an order, etc.&lt;ref name="talkorigins.org"&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#nested_hierarchy 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: Part 1]. Talkorigins.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of these nested hierarchies was recognized by many biologists before Darwin, but he showed that his theory of evolution with its branching pattern of common descent could explain them.&lt;ref name="talkorigins.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |title=Why Evolution is True|publisher=Viking|year=2009 |pages=8–11|isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin described how common descent could provide a logical basis for classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= On the Origin of Species | authorlink=Charles Darwin | first=Charles | last=Darwin | year=1859| page=420| publisher= John Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,&amp;nbsp;... |30px|30px|[[Charles Darwin]]|''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', page 577}}

====Evolutionary trees====
An [[evolutionary tree]] (of Amniota, for example, the last common ancestor of mammals and reptiles, and all its descendants) illustrates the initial conditions causing evolutionary patterns of similarity (e.g., all Amniotes produce an egg that possesses the [[Amnios (biology)|amnios]]) and the patterns of divergence amongst lineages (e.g., mammals and reptiles branching from the common ancestry in Amniota). Evolutionary trees provide conceptual models of evolving systems once thought limited in the domain of making predictions out of the theory.&lt;ref name="Tuomi81" &gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tuomi | first1=J. | title=Structure and dynamics of Darwinian evolutionary theory | journal=Syst. Zool. | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=22–31 | url=http://www.vordenker.de/downloads/tuomi_structure-dynamics-Darwinian-evolutionary-theory.pdf | doi=10.2307/2992299 | year=1981| jstor=2992299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the method of [[phylogenetic bracketing]] is used to infer predictions with far greater probability than raw speculation. For example, paleontologists use this technique to make predictions about nonpreservable traits in fossil organisms, such as feathered dinosaurs, and molecular biologists use the technique to posit predictions about RNA metabolism and protein functions.&lt;ref name="Aravind03"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aravind, L.; Iyer, L.M.; Anantharaman, V. |title=The two faces of Alba: the evolutionary connection between proteins participating in chromatin structure and RNA metabolism |journal=Genome Biology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=R64 |year=2003 |pmid=14519199 |pmc=328453 |doi=10.1186/gb-2003-4-10-r64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Brochu | first1=C.

Evolutionary biologists test evolutionary theory using phylogenetic systematic methods that measure how much the hypothesis (a particular branching pattern in an evolutionary tree) increases the likelihood of the evidence (the distribution of characters among lineages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bock | first1=W.

===Vestigial structures===
{{Main|Vestigiality}}
{{See also|Human vestigiality}}
Evidence for common descent comes from the existence of vestigial structures.&lt;ref name=Slifkin258_9&gt;{{cite book | first=Natan | last=Slifkin |title=The Challenge of Creation… |publisher=Zoo Torah |year=2006 |pages=258–9 |isbn=978-1-933143-15-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rudimentary structures are often homologous to structures that correspond in related or ancestral species. A wide range of structures exist such as mutated and non-functioning genes, parts of a flower, muscles, organs, and even behaviors. This variety can be found across many different groups of species. In many cases they are degenerated or underdeveloped. The existence of vestigial organs can be explained in terms of changes in the environment or modes of life of the species. Those organs are typically functional in the ancestral species but are now either semi-functional, nonfunctional, or re-purposed.

Scientific literature concerning vestigial structures abounds. One study complied 64 examples of vestigial structures found in the literature across a wide range of disciplines within the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Vestigial Biological Structures: A Classroom-Applicable Test of Creationist Hypotheses| author=Senter, Phil | journal=The American Biology Teacher| year=2015| volume=77| issue=2| pages=99–106| doi=10.1525/abt.2015.77.2.4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following non-exhaustive list summarizes Senter et al. alongside various other examples:

====Insect mouthparts and appendages====
Many different species of insects have mouthparts derived from the same embryonic structures, indicating that the mouthparts are modifications of a common ancestor's original features. These include a [[Insect mouthparts#Labrum|labrum]] (upper lip), a pair of [[mandible (insect)|mandible]]s, a [[hypopharynx]] (floor of mouth), a pair of [[Maxilla (arthropod mouthpart)#Hexapoda|maxillae]], and a [[labium (insect)|labium]]. (Fig. 2c) Evolution has caused enlargement and modification of these structures in some species, while it has caused the reduction and loss of them in other species. The modifications enable the insects to exploit a variety of food materials.

Insect mouthparts and antennae are considered homologues of insect legs. Parallel developments are seen in some [[arachnid]]s: The anterior pair of legs may be modified as analogues of antennae, particularly in [[uropygid|whip scorpions]], which walk on six legs. These developments provide support for the theory that complex modifications often arise by duplication of components, with the duplicates modified in different directions.

====Pelvic structure of dinosaurs====
{{See also|Evolution of dinosaurs|Evolution of birds}}
Similar to the pentadactyl limb in mammals, the earliest [[dinosaurs]] split into two distinct orders—the ''[[saurischia]]'' and ''[[ornithischia]]''. They are classified as one or the other in accordance with what the fossils demonstrate. Figure 2d, shows that early ''saurischians'' resembled early ''ornithischians''. The pattern of the [[pelvis]] in all species of dinosaurs is an example of homologous structures. Each order of dinosaur has slightly differing pelvis bones providing evidence of common descent. Additionally, modern [[birds]] show a similarity to ancient ''saurischian'' pelvic structures indicating the [[evolution of birds]] from dinosaurs. This can also be seen in Figure 5c as the [[Aves]] branch off the [[Theropoda]] suborder.

====Pentadactyl limb====
{{further|Evolution of mammals}}
The pattern of limb bones called [[pentadactyl limb]] is an example of homologous structures (Fig. 2e). It is found in all classes of [[tetrapod]]s (''i.e.'' from [[amphibian]]s to [[mammal]]s). It can even be traced back to the [[Fish fin|fins]] of certain [[fossil fish]]es from which the first amphibians evolved such as [[tiktaalik]]. The limb has a single proximal bone ([[humerus]]), two distal bones ([[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]]), a series of [[carpal]]s ([[wrist]] bones), followed by five series of metacarpals ([[hand|palm]] bones) and [[Phalanx bone|phalanges]] (digits). Throughout the tetrapods, the fundamental structures of pentadactyl limbs are the same, indicating that they originated from a common ancestor. But in the course of evolution, these fundamental structures have been modified. They have become superficially different and unrelated structures to serve different functions in adaptation to different environments and modes of life. This phenomenon is shown in the forelimbs of mammals. For example:
* In [[monkey]]s, the forelimbs are much elongated, forming a grasping hand used for climbing and swinging among trees.
* [[Pig]]s have lost their first digit, while the second and fifth digits are reduced. The remaining two digits are longer and stouter than the rest and bear a hoof for supporting the body.
* In horses, the forelimbs are highly adapted for strength and support. Fast and long-distance running is possible due to the extensive elongation of the third digit that bears a hoof.
* The [[mole (animal)|mole]] has a pair of short, spade-like forelimbs for [[burrowing]].
* [[Anteater]]s use their enlarged third digit for tearing into [[ant]] and [[termite]] nests.
* In cetaceans, the forelimbs become [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s for steering and maintaining equilibrium during swimming.
* In [[bat]]s, the forelimbs have become highly modified and evolved into functioning [[wing]]s. Four digits have become elongated, while the hook-like first digit remains free and is used to hang upside down.

====Recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffes====
The [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is a fourth branch of the [[vagus nerve]], which is a [[cranial nerve]]. In mammals, its path is unusually long. As a part of the vagus nerve, it comes from the brain, passes through the neck down to heart, rounds the [[dorsal aorta]] and returns up to the [[larynx]], again through the neck. (Fig. 2f)

This path is suboptimal even for humans, but for [[giraffes]] it becomes even more suboptimal. Due to the lengths of their necks, the recurrent laryngeal nerve may be up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, despite its optimal route being a distance of just several inches.

The indirect route of this nerve is the result of evolution of mammals from fish, which had no neck and had a relatively short nerve that innervated one gill slit and passed near the gill arch. Since then, the gill it innervated has become the larynx and the gill arch has become the dorsal aorta in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mark | last=Ridley |edition=3rd |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |page=282 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b-HGB9PqXCUC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA281|isbn=978-1-4051-0345-9 |title=Evolution |authorlink=Mark Ridley (zoologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2009 364–365"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution | authorlink=Richard Dawkins | last=Dawkins | first=Richard |year= 2009| pages=364–365| publisher=Bantam Press | isbn= 978-1-4165-9478-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Route of the vas deferens====
Similar to the laryngeal nerve in giraffes, the [[vas deferens]] is part of the [[male reproductive system|male anatomy]] of many [[vertebrates]]; it transports sperm from the [[epididymis]] in anticipation of [[ejaculation]]. In humans, the vas deferens routes up from the [[testicle]], looping over the [[ureter]], and back down to the [[urethra]] and [[penis]]. It has been suggested that this is due to the descent of the testicles during the course of human evolution—likely associated with temperature. As the testicles descended, the vas deferens lengthened to accommodate the accidental "hook" over the ureter.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2009 364–365"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural selection: domains, levels, and challenges | last=Williams | first=G.C.| year=1992| publisher=Oxford Press | isbn=978-0-19-506932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When organisms die, they often [[decomposition|decompose]] rapidly or are consumed by [[scavenger]]s, leaving no permanent evidences of their existence. However, occasionally, some organisms are preserved. The remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms from a past [[geologic time scale|geologic age]] embedded in [[rock (geology)|rocks]] by natural processes are called [[fossil]]s. They are extremely important for understanding the [[timeline of evolution|evolutionary history of life]] on Earth, as they provide direct evidence of evolution and detailed information on the ancestry of organisms. [[Paleontology]] is the study of past life based on fossil records and their relations to different geologic time periods.

For fossilization to take place, the traces and remains of organisms must be quickly buried so that [[weathering]] and decomposition do not occur. Skeletal structures or other hard parts of the organisms are the most commonly occurring form of fossilized remains. There are also some trace "fossils" showing [[molding (process)|moulds]], cast or imprints of some previous organisms.

As an animal dies, the organic materials gradually decay, such that the [[bone]]s become porous. If the animal is subsequently buried in [[mud]], [[mineral]] salts infiltrate into the bones and gradually fill up the pores. The bones harden into stones and are preserved as fossils. This process is known as [[petrifaction|petrification]]. If dead animals are covered by wind-blown [[sand]], and if the sand is subsequently turned into mud by heavy [[rain]] or [[flood]]s, the same process of mineral infiltration may occur. Apart from petrification, the dead bodies of organisms may be well preserved in [[ice]], in hardened [[resin]] of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees (figure 3a), in tar, or in anaerobic, [[acid]]ic [[peat]]. Fossilization can sometimes be a trace, an impression of a form. Examples include leaves and footprints, the fossils of which are made in layers that then harden.

===Fossil record===
It is possible to decipher how a particular group of organisms evolved by arranging its fossil record in a chronological sequence. Such a sequence can be determined because fossils are mainly found in [[sedimentary rock]]. Sedimentary rock is formed by layers of [[silt]] or mud on top of each other; thus, the resulting rock contains a series of horizontal layers, or [[stratum|strata]]. Each layer contains fossils typical for a specific [[period (geology)|time period]] when they formed. The lowest strata contain the oldest rock and the earliest fossils, while the highest strata contain the youngest rock and more recent fossils.

A succession of animals and plants can also be seen from fossil discoveries. By studying the number and complexity of different fossils at different [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] levels, it has been shown that older fossil-bearing rocks contain fewer types of fossilized organisms, and they all have a simpler structure, whereas younger rocks contain a greater variety of fossils, often with increasingly complex structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |title=Why Evolution is True|publisher=Viking|year=2009 |pages=26–28|isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, geologists could only roughly estimate the ages of various strata and the fossils found. They did so, for instance, by estimating the time for the formation of sedimentary rock layer by layer. Today, by measuring the proportions of [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] and stable [[chemical element|elements]] in a given rock, the ages of fossils can be more precisely dated by scientists. This technique is known as [[radiometric dating]].

Throughout the fossil record, many species that appear at an early stratigraphic level disappear at a later level. This is interpreted in evolutionary terms as indicating the times when species originated and became extinct. Geographical regions and climatic conditions have varied throughout [[History of Earth|Earth's history]]. Since organisms are adapted to particular environments, the constantly changing conditions favoured species that adapted to new environments through the mechanism of [[natural selection]].

====Extent of the fossil record====
{{See also|Transitional fossil|List of transitional fossils}}
Despite the relative rarity of suitable conditions for fossilization, an estimated 250,000 fossil species have been named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Bringing Fossils to Life: An Introduction to Paleobiology | edition=3rd | author=Donald R. Prothero | date=2013 | pages=21 | publisher=Columbia University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of individual fossils this represents varies greatly from species to species, but many millions of fossils have been recovered: for instance, more than three million fossils from the last [[ice age]] have been recovered from the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tarpits.org/info/faq/faqfossil.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2011-02-21 |publisher=The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311233346/http://www.tarpits.org/info/faq/faqfossil.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more fossils are still in the ground, in various geological formations known to contain a high fossil density, allowing estimates of the total fossil content of the formation to be made. An example of this occurs in South Africa's [[Beaufort Formation]] (part of the [[Karoo Supergroup]], which covers most of South Africa), which is rich in vertebrate fossils, including [[therapsid]]s (reptile-mammal [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Karoo: Ecological Patterns and Processes| first1=William Richard John | last1=Dean | first2=Suzanne Jane | last2=Milton| year=1999| page=31| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-55450-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that this formation contains 800 billion vertebrate fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Six "Flood" Arguments Creationists Can't Answer| first=Robert J. | last=Schadewald| journal=Creation Evolution Journal| year=1982| volume=3| pages=12–17| url=http://ncseprojects.org/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palentologists have documented numerous transitional forms and have constructed "an astonishingly comprehensive record of the key transitions in animal evolution".&lt;ref name="DRProthero"&gt;{{Citation | title=What missing link?| author=Donald R.

===Limitations===
The fossil record is an important source for scientists when tracing the evolutionary history of organisms. However, because of limitations inherent in the record, there are not fine scales of intermediate forms between related groups of species. This lack of continuous fossils in the record is a major limitation in tracing the descent of biological groups. When [[transitional fossil]]s are found that show intermediate forms in what had previously been a gap in knowledge, they are often popularly referred to as "missing links".

There is a gap of about 100 million years between the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] period and the end of the [[Ordovician]] period. The early Cambrian period was the period from which numerous fossils of [[sponge]]s, [[cnidaria]]ns (''e.g.'', [[jellyfish]]), [[echinoderm]]s (''e.g.'', [[eocrinoid]]s), [[mollusca|molluscs]] (''e.g.'', [[snail]]s) and [[arthropod]]s (''e.g.'', [[trilobite]]s) are found. The first animal that possessed the typical features of [[vertebrate]]s, the ''[[Arandaspis]]'', was dated to have existed in the later Ordovician period. Thus few, if any, fossils of an intermediate type between [[invertebrate]]s and vertebrates have been found, although likely candidates include the [[Burgess Shale]] animal, ''[[Pikaia gracilens]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Obviously vertebrates must have had ancestors living in the Cambrian, but they were assumed to be invertebrate forerunners of the true vertebrates — protochordates. Pikaia has been heavily promoted as the oldest fossil protochordate."

Some of the reasons for the incompleteness of fossil records are:
* In general, the probability that an organism becomes fossilized is very low;
* Some species or groups are less likely to become fossils because they are soft-bodied;
* Some species or groups are less likely to become fossils because they live (and die) in conditions that are not favourable for fossilization;
* Many fossils have been destroyed through erosion and tectonic movements;
* Most fossils are fragmentary;
* Some evolutionary change occurs in populations at the limits of a species' ecological range, and as these populations are likely small, the probability of fossilization is lower (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]);
* Similarly, when environmental conditions change, the population of a species is likely to be greatly reduced, such that any evolutionary change induced by these new conditions is less likely to be fossilized;
* Most fossils convey information about external form, but little about how the organism functioned;
* Using present-day [[biodiversity]] as a guide, this suggests that the fossils unearthed represent only a small fraction of the large number of species of organisms that lived in the past.

====Evolution of the horse====
[[File:Horseevolution.png|325px|thumb|left|'''Figure 3e:''' [[Evolution of the horse]] showing reconstruction of the fossil species obtained from successive rock strata. The foot diagrams are all front views of the left forefoot. The third [[Metacarpus|metacarpal]] is shaded throughout. The teeth are shown in longitudinal section. The linear sequence is just one of many paths in the equine phylogenetic tree&lt;!-- and does not imply a direction to evolution--&gt;.]]

{{Main|Evolution of the horse}}
Due to an almost-complete fossil record found in North American sedimentary deposits from the early [[Eocene]] to the present, the [[horse]] provides one of the best examples of evolutionary history ([[phylogeny]]).

This evolutionary sequence starts with a small animal called ''[[Hyracotherium]]'' (commonly referred to as ''Eohippus''), which lived in North America about 54 million years ago then spread across to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. Fossil remains of ''Hyracotherium'' show it to have differed from the modern horse in three important respects: it was a small animal (the size of a [[fox]]), lightly built and adapted for running; the limbs were short and slender, and the feet elongated so that the digits were almost vertical, with four digits in the [[forelimb]]s and three digits in the [[hindlimb]]s; and the [[incisor]]s were small, the [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s having low crowns with rounded [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s covered in [[Tooth enamel|enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legendre|first=Serge|title=Les communautés de mammifères du Paléogène (Eocène supérieur et Oligocène) d'Europe occidentale : structures, milieux et évolution|year=1989|publisher=F. Pfeil|location=München|isbn=978-3-923871-35-3|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probable course of development of horses from ''Hyracotherium'' to ''Equus'' (the modern horse) involved at least 12 [[genus|genera]] and several hundred [[species]]. The major trends seen in the development of the horse to changing environmental conditions may be summarized as follows:
* Increase in size (from 0.4&amp;nbsp;m to 1.5&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;— from 15&amp;nbsp;in to 60&amp;nbsp;in);
* Lengthening of limbs and feet;
* Reduction of lateral digits;
* Increase in length and thickness of the third digit;
* Increase in width of [[incisor]]s;
* Replacement of [[premolar]]s by [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s; and
* Increases in tooth length, crown height of molars.

Fossilized plants found in different strata show that the [[marsh]]y, wooded country in which ''Hyracotherium'' lived became gradually drier. Survival now depended on the head being in an elevated position for gaining a good view of the surrounding countryside, and on a high turn of speed for escape from [[predation|predators]], hence the increase in size and the replacement of the splayed-out foot by the hoofed foot. The drier, harder ground would make the original splayed-out foot unnecessary for support. The changes in the teeth can be explained by assuming that the diet changed from soft [[vegetation]] to [[grass]]. A dominant genus from each geological period has been selected (see figure 3e) to show the slow alteration of the horse lineage from its ancestral to its modern form.&lt;ref name=Leidy&gt;[http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/paleo/equus.php Academy of Natural Sciences - Joseph Leidy - American Horses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305215318/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/paleo/equus.php |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition from fish to amphibians====
Prior to 2004, paleontologists had found fossils of amphibians with necks, ears, and four legs, in rock no older than 365 million years old. In rocks more than 385 million years old they could only find fish, without these amphibian characteristics. Evolutionary theory predicted that since amphibians evolved from fish, an intermediate form should be found in rock dated between 365 and 385 million years ago. Such an intermediate form should have many fish-like characteristics, conserved from 385 million years ago or more, but also have many amphibian characteristics as well. In 2004, an expedition to islands in the Canadian arctic searching specifically for this fossil form in rocks that were 375 million years old discovered fossils of [[Tiktaalik]].&lt;ref name=Shubin&gt;"{{cite book | last=Shubin | first=Neil |title=Your Inner Fish |publisher=Pantheon |location= |year= 2008|pages= |isbn=978-0-375-42447-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later, however, scientists in [[Poland]] found evidence of fossilised [[tetrapod]] tracks predating ''Tiktaalik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Niedzwiedzki | first1=G. | last2=Szrek | first2=P. | last3=Narkiewicz | first3=K. | last4=Narkiewicz | first4=M. | last5=Ahlberg | first5=P. | year=2010 | title=Tetrapod trackways from the early Middle Devonian period of Poland | url=| journal=Nature | volume=463 | issue=7227| pages=43–48 | bibcode=2010Natur.463...43N | doi=10.1038/nature08623 | ref=harv | pmid=20054388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence from biogeography==
Data about the presence or absence of species on various [[continent]]s and [[island]]s ([[biogeography]]) can provide evidence of common descent and shed light on patterns of [[speciation]].

===Continental distribution===
All organisms are adapted to their environment to a greater or lesser extent. If the abiotic and biotic factors within a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] are capable of supporting a particular species in one geographic area, then one might assume that the same species would be found in a similar habitat in a similar geographic area, e.g. in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. This is not the case. Plant and animal species are discontinuously distributed throughout the world:
* Africa has [[Old World monkey]]s, [[ape]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[giraffe]]s, and [[hornbill]]s.
* South America has [[New World monkey]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[sloth]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[toucan]]s.
* Deserts in North and South America have native [[cacti]], but deserts in Africa, Asia, and Australia have [[succulent]] (apart from ''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]'')&lt;ref name=CotaBomf10&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cota-Sánchez |first=J. Hugo |last2=Bomfim-Patrício |first2=Márcia C. |year=2010 |title=Seed morphology, polyploidy and the evolutionary history of the epiphytic cactus ''Rhipsalis baccifera'' (Cactaceae) |journal=Polibotanica |volume=29 |pages=107–129 |url=http://www.herbarium.usask.ca/research/articles/Cota-Sanchez_Bomfim-Patricio_Polibotanica_2010.pdf |accessdate=2013-02-28 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are native [[euphorbiaceae|euphorbs]] that resemble cacti but are very different.

Even greater differences can be found if [[Australia]] is taken into consideration, though it occupies the same [[latitude]] as much of South America and Africa. [[Marsupial]]s like [[kangaroo]]s, [[bandicoots]], and [[quoll]]s make up about half of Australia's indigenous mammal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Menkhorst |first1=Peter |last2=Knight |first2=Frank |title=A Field Guide to the Mammals of Australia |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-19-550870-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, marsupials are today totally absent from Africa and form a smaller portion of the mammalian fauna of South America, where [[opossum]]s, [[shrew opossum]]s, and the [[monito del monte]] occur. The only living representatives of primitive egg-laying mammals ([[monotreme]]s) are the [[echidna]]s and the [[platypus]]. The short-beaked echidna (''[[Tachyglossus aculeatus]]'') and its subspecies populate Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Kangaroo Island]] while the long-beaked echidna (''[[Zaglossus bruijni]]'') lives only in New Guinea. The platypus lives in the waters of eastern Australia. They have been introduced to Tasmania, [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]], and Kangaroo Island. These Monotremes are totally absent in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Echidna: Extraordinary egg-laying mammal| first1= Michael | last1=Augee | first2=Brett | last2=Gooden | first3=Anne | last3=Musser| year=2006| publisher=CSIRO Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UQH-YrWwCYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn= 9780643092044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Australia is missing many groups of [[placental]] mammals that are common on other continents ([[carnivora]]ns, [[artiodactyl]]s, [[shrew]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[lagomorph]]s), although it does have indigenous [[bat]]s and [[Murinae|murine]] rodents; many other placentals, such as [[rabbit]]s and [[fox]]es, have been introduced there by humans.

Other animal distribution examples include [[bear]]s, located on all continents excluding Africa, Australia and Antarctica, and the polar bear solely in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/polar-bear/habitat-&amp;-distribution.htm |title=Polar Bears/Habitat &amp; Distribution |accessdate=2011-02-21 |publisher=SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penguins]] are found only around the South Pole despite similar weather conditions at the North Pole. Families of [[sirenians]] are distributed around the earth's waters, where [[manatees]] are located in western Africa waters, northern South American waters, and West Indian waters only while the related family, the [[dugong]]s, are located only in [[Oceania|Oceanic]] waters north of Australia, and the coasts surrounding the [[Indian Ocean]]. The now extinct [[Steller's sea cow]] resided in the [[Bering Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.savethemanatee.org/sirenian.htm |title= Sirenians of the World |accessdate=2011-02-21 |publisher=Save the Manatee Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same kinds of fossils are found from areas known to be adjacent to one another in the past but that, through the process of [[continental drift]], are now in widely divergent geographic locations. For example, fossils of the same types of ancient amphibians, arthropods and ferns are found in South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica, which can be dated to the [[Paleozoic]] Era, when these regions were united as a single landmass called [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio303/contdrift.htm Continental Drift and Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211134652/http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio303/contdrift.htm |date=2006-02-11 }}. Biology.clc.uc.edu (2001-03-25). Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the descendants of these organisms can be identified and show unmistakable similarity to each other, even though they now inhabit very different regions and climates.

===Island biogeography===
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|'''Figure 4a:''' Four of the [[Darwin's finches|13 finch species]] found on the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos Archipelago]], have evolved by an adaptive radiation that diversified their [[beak]] shapes to adapt them to different food sources.]]

====Types of species found on islands====
Evidence from [[island biogeography]] has played an important and historic role in the development of [[evolutionary biology]]. For purposes of [[biogeography]], islands are divided into two classes. Continental islands are islands like [[Great Britain]], and [[Japan]] that have at one time or another been part of a continent. Oceanic islands, like the [[Hawaiian islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[St. Helena]], on the other hand are islands that have formed in the ocean and never been part of any continent. Oceanic islands have distributions of native plants and animals that are unbalanced in ways that make them distinct from the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]s found on continents or continental islands. Oceanic islands do not have native terrestrial mammals (they do sometimes have bats and seals), amphibians, or fresh water fish. In some cases they have terrestrial reptiles (such as the iguanas and giant tortoises of the Galápagos Islands) but often (such as in Hawaii) they do not. This is despite the fact that when species such as rats, goats, pigs, cats, mice, and [[cane toad]]s, are introduced to such islands by humans they often thrive. Starting with [[Charles Darwin]], many scientists have conducted experiments and made observations that have shown that the types of animals and plants found, and not found, on such islands are consistent with the theory that these islands were colonized accidentally by plants and animals that were able to reach them. Such accidental colonization could occur by air, such as plant seeds carried by migratory birds, or bats and insects being blown out over the sea by the wind, or by floating from a continent or other island by sea (for example, by some kinds of plant seeds like coconuts that can survive immersion in salt water), and reptiles that can survive for extended periods on rafts of vegetation carried to sea by storms.&lt;ref name=Coyne99-110/&gt;

====Endemism====
Many of the species found on remote islands are [[endemic]] to a particular island or group of islands, meaning they are found nowhere else on earth. Examples of species endemic to islands include many flightless birds of [[New Zealand]], [[lemurs]] of [[Madagascar]], the [[Komodo dragon]] of [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]],&lt;ref name="komo"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Murphy | editor1-first=James B. | editor2-first=Claudio | editor2-last=Ciofi | editor3-first=Colomba | editor3-last=de la Panouse | editor4-first=Trooper | editor4-last=Walsh | title=Komodo Dragons: Biology and Conservation (Zoo and Aquarium Biology and Conservation Series) |publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58834-073-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dragon's blood tree of [[Socotra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/travel/tmagazine/03well.socotra.t.html |title= The Wonder Land of Socotra, Yemen |accessdate=2010-07-08 |publisher= ALAN BURDICK | first=Alan | last=Burdick | date=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuatara]] of New Zealand,&lt;ref name="TerraNature"&gt;{{cite web| publisher =TerraNature Trust| title=Tuatara| website =New Zealand Ecology: Living Fossils| year=2004| url=http://www.terranature.org/tuatara.htm | accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoC"&gt;{{cite web | title=Facts about tuatara | website=Conservation: Native Species | publisher=Threatened Species Unit, Department of Conservation, Government of New Zealand | url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=33163 | accessdate=2007-02-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182910/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=33163 | archive-date=30 September 2007 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. However, many such endemic species are related to species found on other nearby islands or continents; the relationship of the animals found on the Galápagos Islands to those found in South America is a well-known example.&lt;ref name=Coyne99-110/&gt; All of these facts, the types of plants and animals found on oceanic islands, the large number of endemic species found on oceanic islands, and the relationship of such species to those living on the nearest continents, are most easily explained if the islands were colonized by species from nearby continents that evolved into the endemic species now found there.&lt;ref name="Coyne99-110"&gt;{{cite book| last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |title=Why Evolution is True|publisher=Viking|year=2009 |pages=99–110|isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of endemism do not have to include, in the strict sense, islands. Islands can mean isolated lakes or remote and isolated areas. Examples of these would include the highlands of [[Ethiopia]], [[Lake Baikal]], [[fynbos]] of [[South Africa]], forests of [[New Caledonia]], and others. Examples of endemic organisms living in isolated areas include the [[kagu]] of New Caledonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/features/2006/05/new_caledonia.html|title=New Caledonia's most wanted |accessdate=2010-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cloud rat]]s of the [[Luzon tropical pine forests]] of the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/giant-bushy-tailed-cloud-rat/crateromys-schadenbergi/info.html |title=Giant bushy-tailed cloud rat (Crateromys schadenbergi) |accessdate= 2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Guide to Philippine Flora and Fauna | last=Rabor | first=D.S. | year=1986| publisher= Natural Resources Management Centre, Ministry of Natural Resources and University of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; the boojum tree (''[[Fouquieria columnaris]]'') of the [[Baja California peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Robert R. |title=The Boojum and its Home |year=1974 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=978-0816504367}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Baikal seal]]&lt;ref name=Schofield2001&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/07/27/106.html| title=Lake Baikal's Vanishing Nerpa Seal| last=Schofield| first=James| publisher=''[[The Moscow Times]]''| date=27 July 2001| accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[omul]] of Lake Baikal.

====Adaptive radiations====
Oceanic islands are frequently inhabited by clusters of closely related species that fill a variety of [[ecological niches]], often niches that are filled by very different species on continents. Such clusters, like the finches of the Galápagos, [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s, members of the sunflower family on the [[Juan Fernandez Archipelago]] and wood weevils on St. Helena are called [[adaptive radiations]] because they are best explained by a single species colonizing an island (or group of islands) and then diversifying to fill available ecological niches. Such radiations can be spectacular; 800 species of the fruit fly family ''[[Drosophila]]'', nearly half the world's total, are endemic to the Hawaiian islands. Another illustrative example from Hawaii is the [[silversword alliance]], which is a group of thirty species found only on those islands. Members range from the [[Argyroxiphium|silversword]]s that flower spectacularly on high volcanic slopes to trees, shrubs, vines and mats that occur at various elevations from mountain top to sea level, and in Hawaiian habitats that vary from deserts to rainforests. Their closest relatives outside Hawaii, based on molecular studies, are [[tarweed]]s found on the west coast of North America. These tarweeds have sticky seeds that facilitate distribution by migrant birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Baldwin | first1=B. G. | first2=R.

===Ring species===

[[File:Ring Species (gene flow around a barrier).png|thumb|300px|In a [[ring species]], gene flow occurs between neighboring populations, but at the ends of the "ring", the populations cannot interbreed.]]

They illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge, specifically because they represent, in living populations, what normally happens over time between long deceased ancestor populations and living populations, in which the intermediates have become [[extinct]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] says that ring species "are only showing us in the spatial dimension something that must always happen in the time dimension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins | title=The Ancestor's Tale| year=2004 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=978-0-618-00583-3 |page=303|title-link=The Ancestor's Tale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distribution of ''Glossopteris''====
The combination of continental drift and evolution can sometimes be used to predict what will be found in the fossil record. ''[[Glossopteris]]'' is an extinct species of [[seed fern]] plants from the [[Permian]]. ''Glossopteris'' appears in the fossil record around the beginning of the Permian on the ancient continent of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Paul and Kenrick, Paul. 2004. Fossil Plants. Smithsonian Books (in association with the Natural History Museum of London), Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|1-58834-156-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental drift explains the current biogeography of the tree. Present day ''Glossopteris'' fossils are found in Permian strata in southeast South America, southeast Africa, all of Madagascar, northern India, all of Australia, all of New Zealand, and scattered on the southern and northern edges of Antarctica. During the Permian, these continents were connected as Gondwana (see figure 4c) in agreement with magnetic striping, other fossil distributions, and glacial scratches pointing away from the temperate climate of the South Pole during the Permian.&lt;ref name="Coyne103"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A.

====Metatherian distribution====
The history of [[metatheria]]ns (the clade containing [[marsupials]] and their extinct, primitive ancestors) provides an example of how evolutionary theory and the movement of continents can be combined to make predictions concerning fossil stratigraphy and distribution. The [[Sinodelphys|oldest metatherian fossils]] are found in present-day [[China]].&lt;ref name="Luoetal2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Zhe-Xi| last2=Ji | first2=Qiang | last3=Wible | first3=John R. | last4=Yuan | first4=Chong-Xi | title=An early Cretaceous tribosphenic mammal and metatherian evolution|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=302|issue=5652|pages=1934–1940|date=2003-12-12|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5652/1934.abstract|doi=10.1126/science.1090718|pmid=14671295|accessdate=2010-12-27|ref=harv|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1934L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metatherians spread westward into modern North America (still attached to Eurasia) and then to South America, which was connected to North America until around 65 mya. Marsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya, shortly after Australia had split off suggesting a single dispersion event of just one species.&lt;ref name="Nilsson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=M.

Geologic evidence suggests that between 30 and 40 million years ago South America and Australia were still part of the Southern Hemisphere super continent of [[Gondwana]] and that they were connected by land that is now part of Antarctica. Therefore, when combining the models, scientists could predict that marsupials migrated from what is now South America, through Antarctica, and then to present-day Australia between 40 and 30 million years ago. A first [[marsupial]] fossil of the extinct family [[Polydolopidae]] was found on [[Seymour Island]] on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woodburne |first=Michael O. | last2=Zinsmeister | first2=William J. |date=Oct 1982 |title=Fossil Land Mammal from Antarctica |journal=Science |volume=218 |issue=4569 |pages=284–286 |id= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/218/4569/284 |accessdate=2009-01-17 |doi=10.1126/science.218.4569.284 |pmid=17838631 |ref=harv |bibcode=1982Sci...218..284W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further fossils have subsequently been found, including members of the marsupial orders [[Didelphimorphia]] (opossum) and [[Microbiotheria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goin |first=Francisco J. |date=Dec 1999 |title=New Discoveries of "Opposum-Like" Marsupials from Antarctica (Seymour Island, Medial Eocene) |journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=335–365 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h5r16469kqr06560/ |accessdate=2009-01-17 |doi=10.1023/A:1027357927460 |ref=harv |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[ungulate]]s and a member of the enigmatic extinct order [[Gondwanatheria]], possibly ''[[Sudamerica ameghinoi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reguero |first=Marcelo A. | first2=Sergio A. | last2=Marenssi | first3=Sergio N. | last3=Santillana |date=May 2002 |title=Antarctic Peninsula and South America (Patagonia) Paleogene terrestrial faunas and environments: biogeographic relationships |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=179 |issue=3–4 |pages=189–210 |id= |url= |doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(01)00417-5 |ref=harv |bibcode=2002PPP...179..189R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polar"&gt;Mills, William James.

====Migration, isolation, and distribution of the camel====
The history of the [[camel]] provides an example of how fossil evidence can be used to reconstruct migration and subsequent evolution. The fossil record indicates that the evolution of [[camelid]]s started in North America (see figure 4e), from which, six million years ago, they migrated across the Bering Strait into Asia and then to Africa, and 3.5 million years ago through the Isthmus of Panama into South America. Once isolated, they evolved along their own lines, giving rise to the [[Bactrian camel]] and [[dromedary]] in Asia and Africa and the [[Lama (genus)|llama and its relatives]] in South America. Camelids then became extinct in North America at the end of the last [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Prothero | first1=Donald R. | last2=Schoch | first2=Robert M. | title=Horns, tusks, and flippers: the evolution of hoofed mammals|publisher=JHU press|year=2002|page=45|isbn=978-0-8018-7135-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence from selection==
Examples for the evidence for evolution often stem from direct observation of [[natural selection]] in the field and the laboratory. This section is unique in that it provides a narrower context concerning the process of selection. All of the examples provided prior to this have described the evidence that evolution has occurred, but has not provided the major underlying mechanism: natural selection. This section explicitly provides evidence that natural selection occurs, has been replicated artificially, and can be replicated in laboratory experiments.

Scientists have observed and documented a multitude of events where natural selection is in action. The most well known examples are antibiotic resistance in the medical field along with better-known laboratory experiments documenting evolution's occurrence. Natural selection is tantamount to common descent in that long-term occurrence and selection pressures can lead to the diversity of life on earth as found today. All adaptations—documented and undocumented changes concerned—are caused by natural selection (and a few other minor processes). It is well established that, "...natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation...",&lt;ref name=JMSobel2009&gt;{{Citation | title=The Biology of Speciation|author1=James M. Sobel | journal=Evolution| year=2009| volume=64| issue=2| pages=295–315| doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00877.x|pmid=19891628 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary driver of speciation;&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation| edition=|author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr | date=2004| pages=5| publisher=Sinauer Associates| isbn=978-0-87893-089-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, the following examples of natural selection ''and'' speciation will often interdepend or correspond with one another. The examples below are only a small fraction of the actual experiments and observations.

===Artificial selection and experimental evolution===
[[File:Big and little dog 1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|'''Figure 5a:''' The [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and [[Great Dane]] illustrate the range of sizes among dog breeds.]]
[[Artificial selection]] demonstrates the diversity that can exist among organisms that share a relatively recent common ancestor. In artificial selection, one species is bred selectively at each generation, allowing only those organisms that exhibit desired characteristics to reproduce. These characteristics become increasingly well developed in successive generations. Artificial selection was successful long before science discovered the genetic basis. Examples of artificial selection include [[dog breeding]], [[genetically modified food]], flower breeding, and the cultivation of foods such as [[Brassica oleracea|wild cabbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raven|first=Peter H.|authorlink=Peter H. Raven|title=Biology of Plants|edition=7th rev.|year=2005|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-6284-3|oclc=183148564}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

[[Experimental evolution]] uses controlled experiments to test hypotheses and theories of evolution. In one early example, [[William Dallinger]] set up an experiment shortly before 1880, subjecting microbes to heat with the aim of forcing adaptive changes. His experiment ran for around seven years, and his published results were acclaimed, but he did not resume the experiment after the apparatus failed.&lt;ref name="urlThe Rev"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2000/PSCF6-00Haas.html |title=The Rev.

A large-scale example of experimental evolution is [[Richard Lenski]]'s [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|multi-generation experiment with ''Escherichia coli'']]. Lenski observed that some strains of ''[[E. coli]]'' evolved a complex new ability, the ability to metabolize [[citrate]], after tens of thousands of generations.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Le Page|first=Michael|title=NS:bacteria make major evolutionary shift in the lab|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.htm |date=16 April 2008 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blount Z.D.; Borland C.Z.; Lenski, R.E. |title=Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=23 |pages=7899–906 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18524956 |pmc=2430337 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0803151105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.7899B |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne commented as a critique of creationism, saying, "the thing I like most is it says you can get these [[complex traits]] evolving by a combination of unlikely events. That's just what creationists say can't happen."&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt; In addition to the metabolic changes, the different bacterial populations were found to have diverged in respect to both morphology (the overall size of the cell) and fitness (of which was measured in competition with the ancestors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dynamics of adaptation and diversification: A 10,000-generation experiment with bacterial populations |author1=Lenski, Richard E. |author2=Travisano, Michael | journal=PNAS | year=1994| volume=91|issue=15 | pages=6808–6814| doi=10.1073/pnas.91.15.6808| pmid=8041701| pmc=44287|bibcode=1994PNAS...91.6808L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment that began in 1988 is still in progress, and has shown adaptations including the evolution of a strain of ''E. coli'' that was able to grow on citric acid in the growth media—a trait absent in all other known forms of ''E. coli'', including the initial strain.

===Invertebrates===

====Historical lead tolerance in ''Daphnia''====

A study of species of ''[[Daphnia]]'' and lead pollution in the 20th century predicted that an increase in lead pollution would lead to strong selection of lead tolerance. Researchers were able to use "resurrection ecology", hatching decades-old ''Daphnia'' eggs from the time when lakes were heavily polluted with lead. The hatchlings in the study were compared to current-day ''Daphnia'', and demonstrated "dramatic fitness differences between old and modern phenotypes when confronted with a widespread historical environmental stressor". Essentially, the modern-day ''Daphnia'' were unable to resist or tolerate high levels of lead (this is due to the huge reduction of lead pollution in 21st century lakes). The old hatchlings, however, were able to tolerate high lead pollution. The authors concluded that "by employing the techniques of resurrection ecology, we were able to show clear phenotypic change over decades...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Rapid Evolutionary Loss of Metal Resistance Revealed by Hatching Decades-Old Eggs|author1=Turko, Patrick | journal=Evolution| year=2016| volume=70| issue=2| pages=398–407| doi=10.1111/evo.12859 |display-authors=etal| pmid=26768308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peppered moths====
{{main|Peppered moth evolution}}

A classic example was the phenotypic change, light-to-dark color adaptation, in the [[Peppered moth evolution|peppered moth]], due to pollution from the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England.

===Microbes===

====Antimicrobial resistance====
{{Main|Antimicrobial resistance}}

The development and spread of [[antibiotic]]-resistant [[bacteria]] is evidence for the process of evolution of species. Thus the appearance of [[vancomycin]]-resistant ''[[Golden staph|Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and the danger it poses to hospital patients, is a direct result of evolution through natural selection. The rise of ''[[Shigella]]'' strains resistant to the synthetic antibiotic class of [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] also demonstrates the generation of new information as an evolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tanaka | first1=T. | last2=Hashimoto | first2=H. | year =1989| title=Drug-resistance and its transferability of Shigella strains isolated in 1986 in Japan| journal =Kansenshogaku Zasshi | volume =63 | issue =1 | pages =15–26| pmid=2501419| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the appearance of [[DDT]] resistance in various forms of ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes, and the appearance of [[myxomatosis]] resistance in breeding rabbit populations in Australia, are both evidence of the existence of evolution in situations of evolutionary [[selection pressure]] in species in which generations occur rapidly.

All classes of microbes develop resistance: including fungi ([[antifungal]] resistance), [[virus]]es ([[antiviral]] resistance), [[protozoa]] ([[antiprotozoal]] resistance), and [[bacteria]] ([[antibiotic]] resistance). This is to be expected when considering that all life exhibits universal genetic code and is therefore subject to the process of evolution through its various mechanisms.

====Nylon-eating bacteria====
Another example of organisms adapting to human-caused conditions are [[Nylon-eating bacteria]]: a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' that are capable of digesting certain byproducts of [[nylon 6]] manufacturing. There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. This is seen as a good example of evolution through mutation and natural selection that has been observed as it occurs and could not have come about until the production of nylon by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thwaites | first=W.M. |title=New Proteins Without God's Help |journal=Creation Evolution Journal |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=1–3 |date=Summer 1985 |url=http://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug].

===Plants and fungi===

====Monkeyflower radiation====
Both subspecies ''Mimulus aurantiacus puniceus'' (red-flowered) and ''Mimulus aurantiacus australis'' (yellow-flowered) of monkeyflowers are isolated due to the preferences of their hummingbird and hawkmoth pollinators. The radiation of ''M. aurantiacus'' subspecies are mostly yellow colored; however, both ''M. a.'' ssp. ''puniceus'' and ''M. a.'' ssp. ''flemingii'' are red. Phylogenetic analysis suggests two independent origins of red-colored flowers that arose due to ''cis''-regulatory mutations in the gene ''MaMyb2'' that is present in all ''M. aurantiacus'' subspecies. Further research suggested that two independent mutations did not take place, but one ''MaMyb2'' allele was transferred via introgressive hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Introgressive hybridization facilitates adaptive divergence in a recent radiation of monkeyflowers |author1=Sean Stankowski |author2=Matthew A.

Gene isolation and ''cis''-regulatory functions; phylogenetic analysis; geographic location and pollinator preference; and species hybridization and speciation are just some of the areas in which data can be obtained to document the occurrence of evolution.

====Radiotrophic fungi====
Like the codfish, human-caused pollution can come in different forms. [[Radiotrophic fungi]] is a perfect example of natural selection taking place after a chemical accident. Radiotrophic fungi appears to use the pigment [[melanin]] to convert [[Gamma rays|gamma radiation]] into chemical energy for growth&lt;ref name="sciencenews.org"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070526/fob5.asp Science News, Dark Power: Pigment seems to put radiation to good use], Week of 26 May 2007; Vol. 171, No. 21, p. 325 by Davide Castelvecchi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ionizing Radiation Changes the Electronic Properties of Melanin and Enhances the Growth of Melanized Fungi | last1=Dadachova | first1=E. | last2=Bryan | first2=R.A. | last3=Huang | first3=X. | last4=Moadel | first4=T. | last5=Schweitzer | first5=A.D. | last6=Aisen | first6=P. | last7=Nosanchuk | first7=J.D. | last8=Casadevall | first8=A. |year=2007 |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=2 |pages=e457 |pmid=17520016 |doi =10.1371/journal.pone.0000457 |issue=5 |pmc=1866175 |editor1-last=Rutherford |editor1-first=Julian|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..457D |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were first discovered in 2007 as black [[molds]] growing inside and around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name="sciencenews.org"/&gt; Research at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] showed that three melanin-containing fungi, ''[[Cladosporium sphaerospermum]]'', ''[[Wangiella dermatitidis]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', increased in [[biomass]] and accumulated [[acetate]] faster in an environment in which the [[radiation]] level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment.

===Vertebrates===

====Guppies====
While studying [[Guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticulata'') in [[Trinidad]], biologist John Endler detected selection at work on the fish populations. To rule out alternative possibilities, Endler set up a highly controlled experiment to mimic the natural habitat by constructing ten ponds within a laboratory greenhouse at [[Princeton University]]. Each pond contained gravel to exactly match that of the natural ponds. After capturing a random sample of guppies from ponds in [[Trinidad]], he raised and mixed them to create similar genetically diverse populations and measured each fish (spot length, spot height, spot area, relative spot length, relative spot height, total patch area, and standard body lengths). For the experiment he added ''[[Crenicichla]] alta'' (''P. reticulata'''s main predator) in four of the ponds, ''[[Rivulus]] hartii'' (a non-predator fish) in four of the ponds, and left the remaining two ponds empty with only the guppies. After 10 generations, comparisons were made between each pond's guppy populations and measurements were taken again. Endler found that the populations had evolved dramatically different color patterns in the control and non-predator pools and drab color patterns in the predator pool. Predation pressure had caused a selection against standing out from background gravel.&lt;ref name="Endler - P. reticulata"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Natural Selection on Color Patterns in Poecilia reticulata| author=John A. Endler| journal=Evolution| year=1980| volume=34| issue=1| pages=76–91| doi=10.2307/2408316| pmid=28563214| jstor=2408316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guppy CS pair 4 20130113.jpg|thumb|left|225px|'''Figure 5b''': Endler's Trinadadian guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'')]]
In parallel, during this experiment, Endler conducted a field experiment in Trinidad where he caught guppies from ponds where they had predators and relocated them to ponds upstream where the predators did not live. After 15 generations, Endler found that the relocated guppies had evolved dramatic and colorful patterns. Essentially, both experiments showed convergence due to similar selection pressures (i.e. predator selection against contrasting color patterns and sexual selection for contrasting color patterns).&lt;ref name="Endler - P. reticulata"/&gt;

In a later study by David Reznick, the field population was examined 11 years later after Endler relocated the guppies to high streams. The study found that the populations has evolved in a number of different ways: bright color patterns, late maturation, larger sizes, smaller litter sizes, and larger offspring within litters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Evaluation of the Rate of Evolution in Natural Populations of Guppies (''Poecilia reticulata'')|author1=David N.

Natural selection is observed in contemporary human populations, with recent findings demonstrating that the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. Scientists postulate one of the reasons for the rapid selection of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is the lethality of the disease in non-immune persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Medical Research Council (UK)| title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' Evolves in Papua New Guinea Community; Could Offer Insights Into CJD| newspaper=Science Daily (online)| location=Science News| date=21 November 2009| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm| accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0809716| pmid=19923577| year=2009| last1=Mead | first1=S.| last2=Whitfield | first2=J.| last3=Poulter | first3=M.| last4=Shah | first4=P.| last5=Uphill | first5=J.| last6=Campbell | first6=T.| last7=Al-Dujaily | first7=H.| last8=Hummerich | first8=H.| last9=Beck | first9=J.| last10=Mein | first10=C.

A well known example of selection occurring in human populations is lactose tolerance. [[Lactose intolerance]] is the inability to [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[lactose]], because of a lack of the required enzyme [[lactase]] in the digestive system. The normal mammalian condition is for the young of a species to experience reduced lactase production at the end of the [[weaning]] period (a species-specific length of time). In humans, in non-dairy consuming societies, lactase production usually drops about 90% during the first four years of life, although the exact drop over time varies widely.&lt;ref name=soy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071215230655/http://www.soynutrition.com/SoyHealth/SoyLactoseIntolerance.aspx Soy and Lactose Intolerance] Wayback: Soy Nutrition&lt;/ref&gt; Lactase activity persistence in adults is associated with two [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s: C/T 13910 and G/A 22018 located in the ''MCM6'' gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enattah, N.S.; Sahi, T.; Savilahti, E.; Terwilliger, J.D.; Peltonen, L.; Järvelä, I. | title=Identification of a variant associated with adult-type hypolactasia | journal=Nature Genetics | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=233–7 | year=2002 | pmid=11788828 | doi=10.1038/ng826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gene difference eliminates the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for members of these populations to continue consumption of raw milk and other fresh and fermented dairy products throughout their lives without difficulty.

====Italian wall lizards====
In 1971, ten adult specimens of ''[[Podarcis sicula]]'' (the Italian wall lizard) were transported from the [[Croatia]]n island of Pod Kopište to the island Pod Mrčaru (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km to the east). Both islands lie in the [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Lastovo]], where the lizards founded a new [[Population bottleneck|bottlenecked]] population.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Herrel, A.; Huyghe, K.; Vanhooydonck, B. |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proc.

In the 1990s, scientists returned to Pod Mrčaru and found that the lizards there differed greatly from those on Kopište. While [[mitochondrial DNA]] analyses have verified that ''P. sicula'' currently on Mrčaru are genetically very similar to the Kopište source population,&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; the new Mrčaru population of ''P. sicula'' had a larger average size, shorter hind limbs, lower maximal sprint speed and altered response to simulated predatory attacks compared to the original Kopište population.&lt;ref name="Vervust et al."/&gt; These changes were attributed to "relaxed predation intensity" and greater protection from vegetation on Mrčaru.&lt;ref name="Vervust et al."/&gt;

In 2008, further analysis revealed that the Mrčaru population of ''P. sicula'' have significantly different head morphology (longer, wider, and taller heads) and increased bite force compared to the original Kopište population.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; This change in head shape corresponded with a shift in diet: Kopište ''P. sicula'' are primarily [[insectivorous]], but those on Mrčaru eat substantially more plant matter.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; The changes in foraging style may have contributed to a greater population density and decreased territorial behavior of the Mrčaru population.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt;

Another difference found between the two populations was the discovery, in the Mrčaru lizards, of [[Ileocecal valve|cecal valve]]s, which slow down food passage and provide fermenting chambers, allowing [[commensal]] microorganisms to convert [[cellulose]] to nutrients digestible by the lizards.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; Additionally, the researchers discovered that [[nematode]]s were common in the guts of Mrčaru lizards, but absent from Kopište ''P. sicula'', which do not have cecal valves.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; The cecal valves, which occur in less than 1 percent of all known species of scaled reptiles,&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; have been described as an "adaptive novelty, a brand new feature not present in the ancestral population and newly evolved in these lizards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Myers |first=PZ |title=Still just a lizard |publisher=ScienceBlogs |date=23 April 2008 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/23/still-just-a-lizard/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PAH resistance in killifish====
A similar study was also done regarding the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that pollute the waters of the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, Virginia. This chemical is a product of [[creosote]], a type of tar. The Atlantic killifish (''[[Fundulus]] heteroclitus'') has evolved a resistance to PAHs involving the AHR gene (the same gene involved in the tomcods). This particular study focused on the resistance to "acute toxicity and cardiac teratogenesis" caused by PAHs.

====PCB resistance in codfish====
An example involving the direct observation of gene modification due to selection pressures is the resistance to PCBs in codfish. After [[General Electric]] dumped [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) in the [[Hudson River]] from 1947 through 1976, [[Microgadus tomcod|tomcods]] (''Microgadus tomcod'') living in the river were found to have evolved an increased resistance to the compound's toxic effects.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;{{cite web| last=Welsh| first=Jennifer | title=Fish Evolved to Survive GE Toxins in Hudson River| publisher=[[LiveScience]]| date=17 February 2011 | url=http://www.livescience.com/12897-fish-evolved-survive-ge-toxins-hudson-110218.html | accessdate =2011-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance to the toxins is due to a change in the coding section of specific gene. Genetic samples were taken from the cods from 8 different rivers in the New England region: the St. Lawrence River, Miramichi River, Margaree River, Squamscott River, Niantic River, the Shinnecock Basic, the Hudson River, and the Hackensack River. Genetic analysis found that in the population of tomcods in the four southernmost rivers, the gene AHR2 ([[aryl hydrocarbon receptor]] 2) was present as an allele with a difference of two amino acid deletions.&lt;ref name="Isaac"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mechanistic Basis of Resistance to PCBs in Atlantic Tomcod from the Hudson River| author=Isaac Wirgin| journal=Science| year=2011| volume=331| issue=6022| pages=1322–1325| doi=10.1126/science.1197296 |display-authors=etal |bibcode=2011Sci...331.1322W| pmid=21330491| pmc=3246799}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deletion conferred a resistance to PCB in the fish species and was found in 99% of Hudson River tomcods, 92% in the Hackensack River, 6% in the Niantic River, and 5% in Shinnecock Bay.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt; This pattern along the sampled bodies of waters infers a direct correlation of selective pressures leading to the evolution of PCB resistance in Atlantic tomcod fish.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt;

====Urban wildlife====
[[Urban wildlife]] is a broad and easily observable case of human-caused selection pressure on [[wildlife]]. With the growth in human habitats, different animals have adapted to survive within these urban environments. These types of environments can exert selection pressures on organisms, often leading to new adaptations. For example, the weed [[Crepis|''Crepis sancta'']], found in France, has two types of seed, heavy and fluffy. The heavy ones land nearby to the parent plant, whereas fluffy seeds float further away on the wind. In urban environments, seeds that float far often land on infertile concrete. Within about 5–12 generations, the weed evolves to produce significantly heavier seeds than its rural relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0708446105 | title=Rapid evolution of seed dispersal in an urban environment in the weed Crepis sancta| last1=Cheptou | first1=P. | last2=Carrue | first2=O. | last3=Rouifed | first3=S. | last4=Cantarel | first4=A. | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| year=2008| volume=105 | issue=10| pages=3796–9| pmid=18316722 | pmc=2268839 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3796C | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/12/evolution-in-the-urban-jungle/ |title=Evolution in the urban jungle |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108105314/http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/12/evolution-in-the-urban-jungle/ |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of urban wildlife are [[rock pigeon]]s and species of crows adapting to city environments around the world; African penguins in [[Simon's Town]]; [[baboon]]s in [[South Africa]]; and a variety of insects living in human habitations.

''[[Holbrookia maculata]]'', ''[[Aspidoscelis inornatus]]'', and ''[[Sceloporus undulatus]]'' exhibit ecotonal populations that match both the dark soils and the white sands in the region. Research conducted on these species has found significant phenotypic and genotypic differences between the dark and light populations due to strong selection pressures. For example, ''H. maculata'' exhibits the strongest phenotypic difference (matches best with the substrate) of the light colored population coinciding with the least amount of gene flow between the populations and the highest genetic differences when compared to the other two lizard species.&lt;ref name=EBRosenblum /&gt;

[[White Sands National Monument|New Mexico's White Sands]] are a recent geologic formation (approximately 6000 years old&lt;ref name=JMRobertson /&gt; to possibly 2000 years old&lt;ref name=EBRosenblum /&gt;). This recent origin of these gypsum sand dunes suggests that species exhibiting lighter-colored variations have evolved in a relatively short time frame. The three lizard species previously mentioned have been found to display variable social signal coloration in coexistence with their ecotonal variants.&lt;ref name=JMRobertson /&gt; Not only have the three species convergently evolved their lighter variants due to the selection pressures from the environment, they've also evolved ecomorphological differences: morphology, behavior (in is case, escape behavior), and performance (in this case, sprint speed) collectively.&lt;ref name=SDRoches /&gt; Roches' work found surprising results in the escape behavior of ''H. maculata'' and ''S. undulatus''. When dark morphs were placed on white sands, their startle response was significantly diminished. This result could be due to varying factors relating to sand temperature or visual acuity; however, regardless of the cause, "…failure of mismatched lizards to sprint could be maladaptive when faced with a predator".&lt;ref name=SDRoches /&gt;

==Evidence from speciation==

Speciation is the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise. Biologists research species using different theoretical frameworks for what constitutes a species (see [[species problem]] and [[species complex]]) and there exists debate with regard to delineation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Understanding the Origin of Species| author=Schemske, Douglas W. | journal=Evolution| year=2000| volume=54| issue=3| pages=1069–1073| doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1069:utoos]2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, much of the current research suggests that, "...speciation is a process of emerging genealogical distinctness, rather than a discontinuity affecting all genes simultaneously"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=The Speciation Revolution| author=Mallet, James | authorlink=James Mallet | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| year=2001| volume=14| issue=6| pages=887–888| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in allopatry (the most common form of speciation), "reproductive isolation is a byproduct of evolutionary change in isolated populations, and thus can be considered an evolutionary accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation| edition=|author1=Coyne, Jerry A.  |author2=Orr, H. Allen | date=2004| pages=37| publisher=Sinauer Associates| isbn=978-0-87893-089-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speciation occurs as the result of the latter (allopatry); however, a variety of differing agents have been documented and are often defined and classified in various forms (e.g. peripatric, parapatric, sympatric, polyploidization, hybridization, etc.). Instances of speciation have been observed in both nature and the laboratory. A.-B Florin and A. Ödeen note that, "strong laboratory evidence for allopatric speciation is lacking..."; however, contrary to laboratory studies (focused specifically on models of allopatric speciation), "speciation most definitely occurs; [and] the vast amount of evidence from nature makes it unreasonable to argue otherwise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Laboratory environments are not conducive for allopatric speciation |author1=Florin, A.-B. |author2=A.

Research documenting speciation is abundant. Biologists have documented numerous examples of speciation in nature—with evolution having produced far more species than any observer would consider necessary. For example, there are well over 350,000 described species of beetles.&lt;ref&gt;Liebherr, James K.; McHugh, Joseph V. ''in'' Resh, V. H.; Cardé, R. T. (Editors) 2003. Encyclopedia of Insects. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of speciation come from the observations of island biogeography and the process of adaptive radiation, both explained previously. Evidence of common descent can also be found through paleontological studies of speciation within geologic strata. The examples described below represent different modes of speciation and provide strong evidence for common descent. It is important to acknowledge that not all speciation research directly observes divergence from "start-to-finish". This is by virtue of research delimitation and definition ambiguity, and occasionally leads research towards historical reconstructions. In light of this, examples abound, and the following are by no means exhaustive—comprising only a small fraction of the instances observed. Once again, take note of the established fact that, "...natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation...",&lt;ref name=JMSobel2009/&gt; and is the primary driver of speciation,&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt; so; hereinafter, examples of speciation will often interdepend and correspond with selection.

===Fossils===
Limitations exist within the fossil record when considering the concept of what constitutes a species. Paleontologists largely rely on a different framework: the morphological species concept.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; Due to the absence of information such as reproductive behavior or genetic material in fossils, paleontologists distinguish species by their phenotypic differences.&lt;ref name=PNBenton&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation in the Fossil Record|author1=Benton, Michael J. |author2=Pearson, Paul N. | journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution| year=2001| volume=16| issue=7| pages=405–411| doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02149-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive investigation of the fossil record has led to numerous theories concerning speciation (in the context of paleontology) with many of the studies suggesting that stasis, [[Punctuated equilibrium|punctuation]], and lineage branching are common. In 1995, D. H. Erwin, et al. published a major work—''New Approaches to Speciation in the Fossil Record''—which compiled 58 studies of fossil speciation (between 1972 and 1995) finding most of the examples suggesting stasis (involving [[anagenesis]] or punctuation) and 16 studies suggesting speciation.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; Despite stasis appearing to be the predominate conclusion at first glance, this particular meta-study investigated deeper, concluding that, "...no single pattern appears dominate..." with "...the preponderance of studies illustrating ''both'' stasis and gradualism in the history of a single lineage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=New Approaches to Speciation in the Fossil Record| edition=|author1=Erwin, D. H. |author2= Anstey, R. L. |last-author-amp=yes | date=1995| pages=22| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the studies conducted utilize seafloor sediments that can provide a significant amount of data concerning [[plankton]]ic microfossils.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; The succession of fossils in stratigraphy can be used to determine evolutionary trends among fossil organisms. In addition, incidences of speciation can be interpreted from the data and numerous studies have been conducted documenting both morphological evolution and speciation.

====''Globorotalia''====

Extensive research on the planktonic foraminifer ''[[Globorotalia]] truncatulinoides'' has provided insight into paleobiogeographical and paleoenvironmental studies alongside the relationship between the environment and evolution. In an extensive study of the paleobiogeography of ''G. truncatulinoides'', researchers found evidence that suggested the formation of a new species (via the sympatric speciation framework). Cores taken of the sediment containing the three species ''G. crassaformis'', ''G. tosaensis'', and ''G. truncatulinoides'' found that before 2.7 Ma, only ''G. crassaformis'' and ''G. tosaensis'' existed. A speciation event occurred at that time, whereby intermediate forms existed for quite some time. Eventually ''G. tosaensis'' disappears from the record (suggesting extinction) but exists as an intermediate between the extant ''G. crassaformis'' and ''G. truncatulinoides''. This record of the fossils also matched the already existing phylogeny constructed by morphological characters of the three species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Sympatric Speciation and Phyletic Change in ''Globorotalia truncatulinoides''|author1=Lazarus, David | journal=Paleobiology| year=1995| volume=21| issue=1| pages=28–51| doi=10.1017/s0094837300013063|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; See figure 6a.

====Radiolaria====
In a large study of five species of [[radiolarians]] (''[[Calocycletta caepa]]'', ''[[Pterocanium prismatium]]'', ''[[Pseudoculous vema]]'', ''[[Eucyrtidium calvertense]]'', and ''[[Eucyrtidium matuyamai]]''), the researchers documented considerable evolutionary change in each lineage. Alongside this, trends with the closely related species ''E. calvertense'' and ''E. matuyamai'' showed that about 1.9 Mya ''E. calvertense'' invaded a new region of the Pacific, becoming isolated from the main population. The stratigraphy of this species clearly shows that this isolated population evolved into ''E. Matuyamai''. It then reinvaded the region of the still-existing and static ''E. calvertense'' population whereby a sudden decrease in body size occurred. Eventually the invader ''E. matuyamai'' disappeared from the stratum (presumably due to extinction) coinciding with a desistance of size reduction of the ''E. calvertense'' population. From that point on, the change in size leveled to a constant. The authors suggest competition-induced [[character displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Microevolutionary Patterns in Late Cenozoic Radiolaria |author1=Kellogg, Davida E. |author2=Hays, James D. | journal=Paleobiology | year=1975| volume=1| issue=2| pages=150–160| doi=10.1017/s0094837300002347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Stratigraphy and Evolutionary Trends of Radiolaria in North Pacific Deep-Sea Sediments| author=Hays, James D. | journal=Geological Society of America Memoirs| year=1970| volume=126| issue=| pages=185–218| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Rhizosolenia''====
Researchers conducted measurements on 5,000 ''[[Rhizosolenia]]'' (a planktonic [[diatom]]) specimens from eight sedimentary cores in the Pacific Ocean. The core samples spanned two million years and were chronologized using sedimentary magnetic field reversal measurements. All the core samples yielded a similar pattern of divergence: with a single lineage (''R. bergonii'') occurring before 3.1 Mya and two morphologically distinct lineages (daughter species: ''R. praebergonii'') appearing after. The parameters used to measure the samples were consistent throughout each core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Cladogenetic and anagenetic changes in the morphology of ''Rhizosolenia praebergonii'' Mukhina|author1=Ulf Sörhannus | journal=Historical Biology| year=1998| volume=1| issue=3| pages=185–205| doi=10.1080/08912968809386474|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional study of the daughter species ''R. praebergonii'' found that, after the divergence, it invaded the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Iterative evolution in the diatom genus ''Rhizosolenia'' Ehrenberg |author1=Sörhannus, Ulf | journal=Lethaia| year=1991| volume=24| issue=1| pages=39–44| doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1991.tb01178.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Turborotalia''====
A recent study was conducted involving the planktonic [[Foraminifera|foraminifer]] [[Turborotalia]]. The authors extracted "51 stratigraphically ordered samples from a site within the oceanographically stable tropical [[North Pacific gyre]]". Two hundred individual species were examined using ten specific morphological traits (size, compression index, chamber aspect ratio, chamber inflation, aperture aspect ratio, test height, test expansion, umbilical angle, coiling direction, and the number of chambers in the final whorl). Utilizing multivariate statistical [[Cluster analysis|clustering methods]], the study found that the species continued to evolve non-directionally within the [[Eocene]] from 45 Ma to about 36 Ma. However, from 36 Ma to approximately 34 Ma, the stratigraphic layers showed two distinct clusters with significantly defining characteristics distinguishing one another from a single species. The authors concluded that speciation must have occurred and that the two new species were ancestral to the prior species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolution and speciation in the Eocene planktonic foraminifer Turborotalia |author1=Pearson, Paul N. |author2=Ezard, Thomas H.

====Vertebrates====
There exists evidence for vertebrate speciation despite limitations imposed by the fossil record. Studies have been conducted documenting similar patterns seen in marine invertebrates.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; For example, extensive research documenting rates of morphological change, evolutionary trends, and speciation patterns in small mammals&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Species in the Fossil Record: Concepts, Trends, and Transitions| author=Gingerich, P.

A study of four mammalian genera: ''[[Hyopsodus]]'', ''[[Pelycodus]]'', ''[[Haplomylus]]'' (three from the Eocene), and ''[[Plesiadapis]]'' (from the Paleocene) found that—through a large number of stratigraphic layers and specimen sampling—each group exhibited, "gradual phyletic evolution, overall size increase, iterative evolution of small species, and character divergence following the origin of each new lineage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Paleontology and Phylogeny: Patterns of Evolution at the Species Level in Early Tertiary Mammals| author=Gingerich, P.

====''Drosophila melanogaster''====
[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|right|225px|'''Figure 6b''': A common fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'')]]
William R. Rice and George W. Salt found experimental evidence of [[sympatric speciation]] in the [[Drosophila melanogaster|common fruit fly]]. They collected a population of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from [[Davis, California]] and placed the pupae into a habitat maze. Newborn flies had to investigate the maze to find food. The flies had three choices to take in finding food. Light and dark ([[phototaxis]]), up and down ([[geotaxis]]), and the scent of [[acetaldehyde]] and the scent of ethanol ([[chemotaxis]]) were the three options. This eventually divided the flies into 42 spatio-temporal habitats.

They then cultured two strains that chose opposite habitats. One of the strains emerged early, immediately flying upward in the dark attracted to the [[acetaldehyde]]. The other strain emerged late and immediately flew downward, attracted to light and ethanol. Pupae from the two strains were then placed together in the maze and allowed to mate at the food site. They then were collected. A selective penalty was imposed on the female flies that switched habitats. This entailed that none of their [[gametes]] would pass on to the next generation. After 25 generations of this mating test, it showed reproductive isolation between the two strains. They repeated the experiment again without creating the penalty against habitat switching and the result was the same; reproductive isolation was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Evolution of Reproductive Isolation as a Correlated Character Under Sympatric Conditions: Experimental Evidence| first1=William R. | last1=Rice | first2=George W. | last2=Salt | journal=Evolution, Society for the Study of Evolution| year=1990| volume=44 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513233154/http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/faculty/rice/publications/pdf/25.pdf|archivedate=2012-05-13|url= http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/faculty/rice/publications/pdf/25.pdf |title=The Evolution of Reproductive Isolation as a Correlated Character Under Sympatric Conditions: Experimental Evidence |accessdate=2010-05-23 |publisher= William R.

====Gall wasps====
A study of the [[Gall wasp|gall-forming wasp]] species ''Belonocnema treatae'' found that populations inhabiting different host plants (''[[Quercus geminata]]'' and ''[[Quercus virginiana|Q. Virginiana]]'') exhibited different body size and [[gall]] morphology alongside a strong expression of sexual isolation. The study hypothesized that ''B. treatae'' populations inhabiting different host plants would show evidence of [[divergent evolution|divergent selection]] promoting speciation. The researchers sampled gall wasp species and oak tree localities, measured body size (right hand [[tibia]] of each wasp), and counted gall chamber numbers. In addition to measurements, they conducted mating assays and statistical analyses. Genetic analysis was also conducted on two [[mtDNA]] sites (416 base pairs from cytochrome C and 593 base pairs from cytochrome oxidase ) to "control for the confounding effects of time since divergence among [[allopatric speciation|allopatric populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Divergent host-plant use promotes reproductive isolation among cynipid gall wasp populations| author=Scott P.

In an additional study, the researchers studied two gall wasp species ''B. treatae'' and ''Disholcaspis quercusvirens'' and found strong morphological and behavioral variation among host-associated populations. This study further confounded prerequisites to speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Parallel Patterns of Morphological and Behavioral Variation among Host-Associated Populations of Two Gall Wasp Species| author=Egan, Scott P. | journal=PLOS ONE| year=2013| volume=8| issue=1 | pages=e54690| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054690 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...854690E |display-authors=etal | pmid=23349952| pmc=3549985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawthorn fly====
One example of evolution at work is the case of the hawthorn fly, ''[[Rhagoletis pomonella]]'', also known as the apple maggot fly, which appears to be undergoing [[sympatric speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Feder | first1=J.L. | last2=Roethele | first2=J.B. | last3=Filchak | first3=K. | last4=Niedbalski | first4=J. | last5=Romero-Severson | first5=J. |title=Evidence for inversion polymorphism related to sympatric host race formation in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella |journal=Genetics |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=939–53 |date=1 March 2003|pmid=12663534 |pmc=1462491 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits. A distinct population emerged in North America in the 19th century some time after [[apple]]s, a non-native species, were introduced. This apple-feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of [[Crataegus|hawthorns]]. The current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples. Some evidence, such as the fact that six out of thirteen [[allozyme]] loci are different, that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies; and that there is little evidence of interbreeding (researchers have documented a 4–6% hybridization rate) suggests that speciation is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Berlocher | first1=S.H. | last2=Bush | first2=G.L. |title=An electrophoretic analysis of Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) phylogeny |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=31 |issue= 2|pages=136–55 |year=1982 |doi=10.2307/2413033 |jstor=2413033 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Berlocher | first1=S.H. | last2=Feder | first2=J.L. |title=Sympatric speciation in phytophagous insects: moving beyond controversy? |journal=Annu Rev Entomol |volume=47 |pages=773–815 |year=2002 |pmid=11729091 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145312 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bush | first=G.L. |title=Sympatric host race formation and speciation in frugivorous flies of the genus Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) |journal=Evolution |volume=23 |issue= 2|pages=237–51 |year=1969 |doi=10.2307/2406788 |jstor=2406788 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Prokopy | first1=R.J. | last2=Diehl | first2=S.R. | last3=Cooley | first3=S.S. |title=Behavioral evidence for host races in Rhagoletis pomonella flies|jstor=4218647 |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=138–47 |year=1988 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p1716r36n2164855/?p=d8018d5a59294c2984f253b7152445b7&amp;pi=20 |doi=10.1007/BF00379612 | pmid=28312391 |ref=harv|bibcode=1988Oecol..76..138P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Feder | first1=J.L. | last2=Roethele | first2=J.B. | last3=Wlazlo | first3=B. | last4=Berlocher | first4=S.H. |title=Selective maintenance of allozyme differences among sympatric host races of the apple maggot fly |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=94 |issue=21 |pages=11417–21 |year=1997 |pmid=11038585 |pmc=23485 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.21.11417|bibcode=1997PNAS...9411417F |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====London Underground mosquito====
The [[London Underground mosquito]] is a species of [[mosquito]] in the genus ''[[Culex]]'' found in the [[London Underground]]. It evolved from the overground species ''Culex pipiens''. This mosquito, although first discovered in the London Underground system, has been found in underground systems around the world. It is suggested that it may have adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground ''Culex pipiens'',&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; although more recent evidence suggests that it is a southern mosquito variety related to ''Culex pipiens'' that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"/&gt;

The two species have very different behaviours,&lt;ref name="Burdick"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_1_110/ai_70770157 |title=Insect From the Underground&amp;nbsp;— London, England Underground home to different species of mosquitos |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |year=2001 | first=Alan | last=Burdick}}&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely difficult to mate,&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gene.ch/gentech/1998/Jul-Sep/msg00188.html |publisher=The Times |date=1998-08-26 |title=London underground source of new insect forms}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with different allele frequency, consistent with genetic drift during a [[founder event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Byrne | first1=K. | last2=Nichols | first2=R.A. |title=Culex pipiens in London Underground tunnels: differentiation between surface and subterranean populations |journal=Heredity |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=7–15 |year=1999 |pmid=10200079 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6884120}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this mosquito, ''Culex pipiens molestus'', breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above ground species ''Culex pipiens'' that is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and bites only birds. When the two varieties were cross-bred the eggs were infertile suggesting reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdick"/&gt;

The genetic data indicates that the ''molestus'' form in the London Underground mosquito appears to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest aboveground population (i.e. the ''pipiens'' form). Byrne and Nichols' working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London only once. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest that the molestus form developed: a single mtDNA difference shared among the underground populations of ten Russian cities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Vinogradova | first1=E.B. | last2=Shaikevich | first2=E.V. |title=Morphometric, physiological and molecular characteristics of underground populations of the urban mosquito Culex pipiens Linnaeus f. molestus Forskål (Diptera: Culicidae) from several areas of Russia|url=http://e-m-b.org/sites/e-m-b.org/files/European_Mosquito_Bulletin_Publications811/EMB22/EMB22_04.pdf |journal=European Mosquito Bulletin |volume= 22 |year=2007 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a single fixed [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] difference in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the middle East and Atlantic islands.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Emerging vectors in the Culex pipiens complex |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5663 |pages=1535–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15001783 |doi=10.1126/science.1094247 |url=http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/files/pdfs/wr380.pdf |last1=Fonseca |first1=D.

[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]] between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct phenotype. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such, natural selection may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if reproductive isolation is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus [[hybrid speciation]] is considered a rare event. However, hybridization resulting in reproductive isolation is considered an important means of speciation in plants,&lt;ref name=MatthewJH&gt;{{Citation | title=Hybrid speciation in plants: new insights from molecular studies |author1=Hegarty, Matthew J. |author2=Hiscock, Simon J. | journal=New Phytologist| year=2004| volume=165|issue=2 | pages=411–423| doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01253.x| pmid=15720652}}&lt;/ref&gt; since polyploidy (having more than two copies of each chromosome) is tolerated in plants more readily than in animals.&lt;ref name=Wendel&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wendel |first=Jonathan F. |date=January 2000 |title=Genome evolution in polyploids |journal=Plant Molecular Biology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=225–249 |doi=10.1023/A:1006392424384 |issn=0167-4412 |pmid=10688139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Semon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sémon |first1=Marie |last2=Wolfe |first2=Kenneth H. |date=December 2007 |title=Consequences of genome duplication |journal=[[Current Opinion (Elsevier)|Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development]] |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=505–512 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.09.007 |issn=0959-437X |pmid=18006297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyploidy is a mechanism that has caused many rapid speciation events in sympatry because offspring of, for example, tetraploid x diploid matings often result in triploid sterile progeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramsey |first1=Justin |last2=Schemske |first2=Douglas W. |date=November 1998 |title=Pathways, Mechanisms, and Rates of Polyploid Formation in Flowering Plants |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=29 |pages=467–501 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.29.1.467 |issn=1545-2069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental plants, and gene flow may still occur for example through triploid hybrid x diploid matings that produce tetraploids, or matings between [[meiosis|meiotically unreduced]] gametes from diploids and gametes from tetraploids. It has been suggested that many of the existing plant and most animal species have undergone an event of polyploidization in their evolutionary history.&lt;ref name="Comai_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Comai |first=Luca |date=November 2005 |title=The advantages and disadvantages of being polyploid |journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]] |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=836–846 |doi=10.1038/nrg1711 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=16304599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Otto |first1=Sarah P. |authorlink1=Sarah Otto |last2=Whitton |first2=Jeannette |date=December 2000 |title=Polyploid Incidence and Evolution |journal=[[Annual Review of Genetics]] |volume=34 |pages=401–437 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.34.1.401 |issn=0066-4197 |pmid=11092833|citeseerx=10.1.1.323.1059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproduction of successful polyploid species is sometimes asexual, by [[parthenogenesis]] or [[apomixis]], as for unknown reasons many asexual organisms are polyploid. Rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result in prenatal death.

Botanists often consider the zoological classifications of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers as inadequate.&lt;ref name="EBaack"/&gt; The examples provided below give insight into the process of speciation.

====''Mimulus peregrinus''====
The creation of a new allopolyploid species of monkeyflower ([[Erythranthe peregrina|''Mimulus peregrinus'']]) was observed on the banks of the Shortcleuch Water—a river in Leadhills, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Parented from the cross of the two species [[Erythranthe guttata|''Mimulus guttatus'']] (containing 14 pairs of chromosomes) and [[Erythranthe lutea|''Mimulus luteus'']] (containing 30-31 pairs from a chromosome duplication), ''M. peregrinus'' has six copies of its chromosomes (caused by the duplication of the sterile hybrid triploid). Due to the nature of these species, they have the ability to self-fertilize. Because of its number of chromosomes it is not able to pair with ''M. guttatus'', ''M. luteus'', or their sterile triploid offspring. ''M. peregrinus'' will either die, producing no offspring, or reproduce with itself effectively leading to a new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mimulus peregrinus (Phrymaceae): A new British allopolyploid species| first=Mario | last=Vallejo-Marín| journal=PhytoKeys| year=2012| volume=14| issue=14 | pages=1–14| url=https://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/article/3305/mimulus-peregrinus-phrymaceae-a-new-british-allopolyploid-species| doi=10.3897/phytokeys.14.3305| pmid=23170069 | pmc=3492922 | accessdate =2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Speciation by genome duplication: Repeated origins and genomic composition of the recently formed allopolyploid species Mimulus peregrinus| first1=Mario | last1=Vallejo-Marín| first2=Richard J. | last2=Buggs | first3=Arielle M. | last3=Cooley | first4=Joshua R. | last4=Puzey | journal=Evolution| year=2015| doi=10.1111/evo.12678| volume=69 | issue=6 | pages=1487–1500 | pmid=25929999 | pmc=5033005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Raphanobrassica''====
''[[Raphanobrassica]]'' includes all intergeneric hybrids between the genera ''[[Raphanus]]'' (radish) and ''[[Brassica]]'' (cabbages, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Karpechenko | first1=G.D. | authorlink=Georgii Karpechenko | year=1927 | title=Polyploid hybrids of ''Raphanus sativus'' X ''Brassica oleracea'' L | url=| journal=Bull.

Plants of this parentage are now known as radicole. Two other fertile forms of ''Raphanobrassica'' are known. Raparadish, an allopolyploid hybrid between ''Raphanus sativus'' and ''Brassica rapa'' is grown as a fodder crop. "Raphanofortii" is the allopolyploid hybrid between ''[[Brassica tournefortii]]'' and ''[[Raphanus caudatus]]''. The ''Raphanobrassica'' is a fascinating plant, because (in spite of its hybrid nature), it is not sterile. This has led some botanists to propose that the accidental hybridization of a flower by pollen of another species in nature could be a mechanism of speciation common in higher plants.

====''Senecio'' (groundsel)====
The Welsh groundsel is an allopolyploid, a plant that contains sets of chromosomes originating from two different species. Its ancestor was ''Senecio × baxteri'', an infertile hybrid that can arise spontaneously when the closely related groundsel (''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'') and Oxford ragwort (''[[Senecio squalidus]]'') grow alongside each other. Sometime in the early 20th century, an accidental doubling of the number of chromosomes in an ''S. × baxteri'' plant led to the formation of a new fertile species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2446125 | title=Origins of the New Allopolyploid Species ''Senecio camrensis (asteracea)'' and its Relationship to the Canary Islands Endemic ''Senecio tenerifae''| first1=Andrew J. | last1=Lowe | first2=Richard J. | last2=Abbott | journal=American Journal of Botany| year=1996| volume=83| pages=1365–1372| issue=10 | jstor=2446125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Evolution is True| first=Jerry A. | last=Coyne |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |year=2009| pages=187–189| publisher=Penguin Group| isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[York groundsel]] (''Senecio eboracensis'') is a hybrid species of the [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]] ''[[Senecio squalidus]]'' (also known as Oxford ragwort) and the self-compatible ''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'' (also known as common groundsel). Like ''S. vulgaris'', ''S. eboracensis'' is self-compatible; however, it shows little or no natural crossing with its parent species, and is therefore reproductively isolated, indicating that strong breed barriers exist between this new hybrid and its parents. It resulted from a [[backcrossing]] of the [[F1 hybrid]] of its parents to ''S. vulgaris''. ''S. vulgaris'' is native to Britain, while ''S. squalidus'' was introduced from Sicily in the early 18th century; therefore, ''S. eboracensis'' has speciated from those two species within the last 300 years.

Other hybrids descended from the same two parents are known. Some are infertile, such as ''S.'' x ''baxteri''. Other fertile hybrids are also known, including [[Senecio vulgaris|''S. vulgaris'' var. ''hibernicus'']], now common in Britain, and the [[polyploidy|allohexaploid]] ''[[Senecio cambrensis|S. cambrensis]]'', which according to molecular evidence probably originated independently at least three times in different locations. Morphological and genetic evidence support the status of ''S. eboracensis'' as separate from other known hybrids.&lt;ref name='w3T'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mobot.mobot.org/cgi-bin/search_pick?name=Senecio+vulgaris | title=TROPICOS Web display ''Senecio vulgaris'' L | accessdate=2008-02-01 | author=Missouri Botanical Garden | authorlink=Missouri Botanical Garden | website=Nomenclatural and Specimen Data Base | publisher=Missouri State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thale cress====
[[File:Arabidopsis thaliana.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Figure 6c''': ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (colloquially known as thale cress, mouse-ear cress or arabidopsis)]]
[[Kirsten Bomblies]] et al. from the [[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]] discovered two genes in the thale cress plant, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. When both genes are inherited by an individual, it ignites a reaction in the hybrid plant that turns its own immune system against it. In the parents, the genes were not detrimental, but they evolved separately to react defectively when combined.&lt;ref name="Bomblies, Lempe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bomblies | year=2007 | title=Autoimmune Response as a Mechanism for a Dobzhansky-Muller-Type Incompatibility Syndrome in Plants | journal=PLoS Biol | volume=5 | issue=9| page=e236 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050236 | pmid=17803357 | pmc=1964774 | first1=Kirsten | last2=Lempe | first2=Janne | last3=Epple | first3=Petra | last4=Warthmann | first4=Norman | last5=Lanz | first5=Christa | last6=Dangl | first6=Jeffery L. | last7=Weigel | first7=Detlef }}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this, Bomblies crossed 280 genetically different strains of ''Arabidopsis'' in 861 distinct ways and found that 2 percent of the resulting hybrids were necrotic. Along with allocating the same indicators, the 20 plants also shared a comparable collection of genetic activity in a group of 1,080 genes. In almost all of the cases, Bomblies discovered that only two genes were required to cause the autoimmune response. Bomblies looked at one hybrid in detail and found that one of the two genes belonged to the [[Gene-for-gene relationship|NB-LRR class]], a common group of disease resistance genes involved in recognizing new infections. When Bomblies removed the problematic gene, the hybrids developed normally.&lt;ref name="Bomblies, Lempe 2007"/&gt; Over successive generations, these incompatibilities could create divisions between different plant strains, reducing their chances of successful mating and turning distinct strains into separate species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/08/new_plant_species_arise_from_conflicts_between_immune_system.php |title= New plant species arise from conflicts between immune system genes |accessdate= 2010-05-22 |publisher= Ed Yong |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100203103906/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/08/new_plant_species_arise_from_conflicts_between_immune_system.php |archivedate= 2010-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Tragopogon'' (salsify)====
[[File:Tragopogon porrifolius flower.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Figure 6d''': Purple salsify, ''[[Tragopogon porrifolius]]'']]
''[[Tragopogon]]'' is one example where hybrid speciation has been observed. In the early 20th century, humans introduced three species of salsify into North America. These species, the western salsify (''Tragopogon dubius''), the meadow salsify (''Tragopogon pratensis''), and the [[Tragopogon porrifolius|oyster plant]] (''Tragopogon porrifolius''), are now common weeds in urban wastelands. In the 1950s, botanists found two new species in the regions of [[Idaho]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where the three already known species overlapped. One new species, ''[[Tragopogon miscellus]]'', is a [[tetraploid]] hybrid of ''T. dubius'' and ''T. pratensis''. The other new species, ''[[Tragopogon mirus]]'', is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors were ''T. dubius'' and ''T. porrifolius''. These new species are usually referred to as "the Ownbey hybrids" after the botanist who first described them. The ''T. mirus'' population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, but additional episodes of hybridization continue to add to the ''T. mirus'' population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Life, the science of biology | edition=7| first1=William Kirkwood | last1=Purves | first2=David E. | last2=Sadava | first3=Gordon H. | last3=Orians | first4=H. Craig | last4=Heller | year=2006| page=487| publisher=Sinaur Associates, Inc.| isbn=978-0-7167-9856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''T. dubius'' and ''T. pratensis'' mated in Europe but were never able to hybridize. A study published in March 2011 found that when these two plants were introduced to North America in the 1920s, they mated and doubled the number of chromosomes in there hybrid ''Tragopogon miscellus'' allowing for a "reset" of its genes, which in turn, allows for greater genetic variation. Professor Doug Soltis of the [[University of Florida]] said, "We caught evolution in the act…New and diverse patterns of gene expression may allow the new species to rapidly adapt in new environments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/uof-urf031611.php| title=UF researcher: Flowering plant study 'catches evolution in the act'| first=Pam | last=Soltis | publisher=EurekAlert, American Association for the Advancement of Science| date=2011-03-17| accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Transcriptomic Shock Generates Evolutionary Novelty in a Newly Formed, Natural Allopolyploid Plant| journal=Current Biology| year=2011| volume=21| pages=551–6| doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.02.016| pmid=21419627 | issue=7 | last1=Buggs | first1=Richard J.A. | last2=Zhang | first2=Linjing | last3=Miles | first3=Nicholas | last4=Tate | first4=Jennifer A. | last5=Gao | first5=Lu | last6=Wei | first6=Wu | last7=Schnable | first7=Patrick S. | last8=Barbazuk | first8=W. Brad | last9=Soltis | first9=Pamela S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observable event of speciation through hybridization further advances the evidence for the common descent of organisms and the time frame in which the new species arose in its new environment. The hybridizations have been reproduced artificially in laboratories from 2004 to present day.

===Vertebrates===

====Blackcap====
The bird species, ''[[Blackcap|Sylvia atricapilla]]'', commonly referred to as blackcaps, lives in Germany and flies southwest to Spain while a smaller group flies northwest to Great Britain during the winter. Gregor Rolshausen from the [[University of Freiburg]] found that the genetic separation of the two populations is already in progress. The differences found have arisen in about 30 generations. With DNA sequencing, the individuals can be assigned to a correct group with an 85% accuracy. Stuart Bearhop from the [[University of Exeter]] reported that birds wintering in England tend to mate only among themselves, and not usually with those wintering in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2005 | title=Assortative mating as a mechanism for rapid evolution of a migratory divide | journal=Science | volume=310 | issue=5747| pages=502–504 | doi=10.1126/science.1115661 | pmid=16239479 | last1=Bearhop | first1=S. | last2=Fiedler | first2=W. | last3=Furness | first3=R.W. | last4=Votier | first4=S.C. | last5=Waldron | first5=S. | last6=Newton | first6=J. | last7=Bowen | first7=G.J. | last8=Berthold | first8=P. | last9=Farnsworth | first9=K. |bibcode=2005Sci...310..502B }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;310/5747/502/DC1 Supporting Online Material]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still inference to say that the populations will become two different species, but researchers expect it due to the continued genetic and geographic separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/03/british-birdfeeders-split-blackcaps-into-two-genetically-dis/ |title=British birdfeeders split blackcaps into two genetically distinct groups | first=Ed | last=Yong |date=3 December 2009 |publisher=ScienceBlogs |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mollies====
The shortfin molly (''[[Poecilia|Poecilia mexicana]]'') is a small fish that lives in the [[Lechuguilla Cave|Sulfur Caves]] of Mexico. Years of study on the species have found that two distinct populations of mollies—the dark interior fish and the bright surface water fish—are becoming more genetically divergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tobler | first1=Michael | year=2009 | title=Does a predatory insect contribute to the divergence between cave- and surface-adapted fish populations? | journal=Biology Letters | volume= 5| issue=4| pages= 506–509| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0272 | pmid=19443506 | pmc=2781934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The populations have no obvious barrier separating the two; however, it was found that the mollies are hunted by a large water bug (''[[Belostomatidae|Belostoma spp]]''). Tobler collected the bug and both types of mollies, placed them in large plastic bottles, and put them back in the cave. After a day, it was found that, in the light, the cave-adapted fish endured the most damage, with four out of every five stab-wounds from the water bugs sharp mouthparts. In the dark, the situation was the opposite. The mollies' senses can detect a predator's threat in their own habitats, but not in the other ones. Moving from one habitat to the other significantly increases the risk of dying. Tobler plans on further experiments, but believes that it is a good example of the rise of a new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/05/giant_insect_splits_cavefish_into_distinct_populations.php |title= Giant insect splits cavefish into distinct populations |accessdate= 2010-05-22 |publisher= [[Ed Yong]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201061035/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/05/giant_insect_splits_cavefish_into_distinct_populations.php |archivedate= 2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polar bears have acquired significant anatomical and physiological differences from the brown bear that allow it to comfortably survive in conditions that the brown bear likely could not. Notable examples include the ability to swim sixty miles or more at a time in freezing waters, fur that blends with the snow, and to stay warm in the arctic environment, an elongated neck that makes it easier to keep their heads above water while swimming, and oversized and heavy-matted webbed feet that act as paddles when swimming. It has also evolved small papillae and vacuole-like suction cups on the soles to make them less likely to slip on the ice, alongside smaller ears for a reduction of heat loss, eyelids that act like sunglasses, accommodations for their all-meat diet, a large stomach capacity to enable opportunistic feeding, and the ability to fast for up to nine months while recycling their urea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears/essentials/evolution |title=Evolution |accessdate=30 January 2014 |publisher=Polar Bears International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hansman | first =Jared | title=Adaptive Traits of the Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) | website=| publisher=Helium, Inc. | date =6 August 2008 | url=http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/ursus-maritimus-bears-kodiak-polar-bears-sea-bears-large-mammals-19025/ | format=| doi=| accessdate =30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example presents a macro-evolutionary change involving an amalgamation of several fields of evolutionary biology, e.g. adaptation through natural selection, geographic isolation, speciation, and hybridization.

[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.&lt;ref name=Tickell/&gt;]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early evidence for evolution by natural selection, at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as evidence of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]]. After the circumstantial evidence provided by Darwin in ''On the Origin of Species'', and given the absence of mechanisms for genetic variation or heredity at that time, naturalists including Darwin's contemporaries, [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]] sought evidence from what they could observe in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |authorlink=Edward J.

===Mimicry and aposematism===

Bates and Müller described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

===Camouflage===

In 1889, Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180 |year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W.

==Evidence from mathematical modeling==

[[Computer science]] allows the [[iteration]] of self-changing [[complex system]]s to be studied, allowing a mathematical understanding of the nature of the processes behind evolution; providing evidence for the hidden causes of known evolutionary events. The evolution of specific cellular mechanisms like [[spliceosome]]s that can turn the cell's genome into a vast workshop of billions of interchangeable parts that can create tools that create tools that create tools that create us can be studied for the first time in an exact way.

"It has taken more than five decades, but the electronic computer is now powerful enough to simulate evolution",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2003/052103/Simulated_evolution_gets_complex_052103.html Simulated Evolution Gets Complex]. Trnmag.com (2003-05-08). Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; assisting [[bioinformatics]] in its attempt to solve biological problems.

Computational evolutionary biology has enabled researchers to trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their DNA, rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone. It has compared entire genomes permitting the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as [[gene duplication]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], and the prediction of factors important in speciation. It has also helped build complex computational models of populations to predict the outcome of the system over time and track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms.

Future endeavors are to reconstruct a now more complex tree of life.

Christoph Adami, a professor at the [[Keck Graduate Institute]] made this point in ''Evolution of biological complexity'':
:To make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity in biological evolution, complexity must be both rigorously defined and measurable. A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural "[[Maxwell's Demon|Maxwell Demon]]", within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Adami | first1=C. | last2=Ofria | first2=C. | last3=Collier | first3=T.C. |title=Evolution of biological complexity |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=4463–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10781045 |pmc=18257 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.9.4463|arxiv=physics/0005074 |bibcode=2000PNAS...97.4463A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David J. Earl and Michael W. Deem—professors at [[Rice University]] made this point in ''Evolvability is a selectable trait'':
:Not only has life evolved, but life has evolved to evolve. That is, correlations within protein structure have evolved, and mechanisms to manipulate these correlations have evolved in tandem. The rates at which the various events within the hierarchy of evolutionary moves occur are not random or arbitrary but are selected by Darwinian evolution. Sensibly, rapid or extreme environmental change leads to selection for greater evolvability. This selection is not forbidden by causality and is strongest on the largest-scale moves within the mutational hierarchy. Many observations within evolutionary biology, heretofore considered evolutionary happenstance or accidents, are explained by selection for evolvability. For example, the vertebrate immune system shows that the variable environment of antigens has provided selective pressure for the use of adaptable codons and low-fidelity polymerases during [[somatic hypermutation]]. A similar driving force for biased codon usage as a result of productively high mutation rates is observed in the hemagglutinin protein of [[Influenzavirus A|influenza A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Earl | first1=D.J. | last2=Deem | first2=M.W. |title=Evolvability is a selectable trait |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=101 |issue=32 |pages=11531–6 |year=2004|pmid=15289608 |pmc=511006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404656101|arxiv=q-bio/0407012 |bibcode=2004PNAS..10111531E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Computer simulations of the evolution of linear sequences have demonstrated the importance of recombination of blocks of sequence rather than point mutagenesis alone. Repeated cycles of point mutagenesis, recombination, and selection should allow ''in vitro'' molecular evolution of complex sequences, such as proteins."&lt;ref name=Stemmer94&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stemmer | first=W.P. |title=DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: in vitro recombination for molecular evolution |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=91 |issue=22 |pages=10747–51 |year=1994 |pmid=7938023 |pmc=45099 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.22.10747|bibcode=1994PNAS...9110747S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary molecular engineering, also called directed evolution or ''in vitro'' molecular evolution involves the iterated cycle of mutation, multiplication with recombination, and selection of the fittest of individual molecules (proteins, DNA, and RNA).

'''Fazlur Rahman Malik''' ({{lang-ur|{{URDU|فضل الرحمان ملک}}}}) (September 21, 1919 – July 26, 1988), generally known as '''Fazlur Rahman''', was a [[Islamic Modernism|modernist]] scholar and [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]] of [[Islam]] from today's [[Pakistan]]. He is renowned as a prominent [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|liberal reformer]] of Islam, who devoted himself to educational reform and the revival of independent reasoning (''[[ijtihad]]'').&lt;ref name="Jo" /&gt; His works are subject of widespread interest in countries such as Pakistan, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="To" /&gt;

After teaching in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]], he was appointed head of the Central Institute of Islamic Research of Pakistan in 1963. Although his works were widely respected by other Islamic reformers, they were also heavily criticized by [[conservative]] scholars as being overtly [[liberalism|liberal]].&lt;ref name="Jo"&gt;Sonn, Tamara. (1995). "Rahman, Fazlur". In John L. Esposito. ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This was quickly exploited by opponents of his political paymaster, General [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]], and led to his eventual exile in the United States. He left Pakistan in 1968 for the [[United States]] where he taught at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and the [[University of Chicago]].

==Biography==
Rahman was born in the [[Hazara District]] of the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]] (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) of [[British India]] (now [[Pakistan]]). His father, Maulana Shihab al-Din, was a well-known scholar of the time who had studied at [[Deoband]] and had achieved the rank of [['alim|alim]], through his studies of [[fiqh|Islamic law]], [[hadith|prophetic narrations]], [[tafsir|Quran'ic commentaries]], [[mantiq|logic]], [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and other subjects.

Rahman studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], and went on to [[Oxford University]], where he wrote a dissertation on [[Ibn Sina]].  Afterwards, he began a teaching career, first at [[Durham University]], where he taught [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and Islamic philosophy, and then at [[McGill University]], where he taught Islamic studies until 1961.

In that year, he returned to Pakistan at the behest of President Ayub Khan to head up the Central Institute of Islamic Research in [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]] which was set up by the Pakistani government in order to implement Islam into the daily dealings of the nation.  However, due to the political situation in Pakistan, Rahman was hindered from making any progress in this endeavour. Orthodox [[Ulama|ulema]] opposed his modernist interpretations and after Ayub Khan's power weakened, they denounced Rahman as an apostate and called for his death as a [[Apostasy in Islam|wajib ul qatl]].&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:42,48"&gt;[[Fazlur Rahman Malik#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.42, 48&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the post in September 1968 and left for the [[United States]].

In the US he returned to teaching, and taught at [[UCLA]] as a visiting professor for a year. He moved to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1969 and established himself there becoming the Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Islamic Thought. At Chicago he was instrumental for building a strong [[Near East]]ern Studies program that continues to be among the best in the world. Rahman also became a proponent for a reform of the Islamic polity and was an advisor to the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. Rahman died in [[Chicago, Illinois]] July 26, 1988 at the [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] from complications of [[coronary bypass]] surgery. A resident of suburban [[Naperville, Illinois]] at his death, he is buried in Arlington Cemetery, [[Elmhurst, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Death Certificate #614834: Rahman, Fazlur |first= |title= |publisher=Cook County Clerk's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Rahman's death his writings have continued to be popular among scholars of Islam and the Near East.  His contributions to the University of Chicago are still evident in its excellent programs in these areas.  In his memory, the [[Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago]] named its common area after him, due to his many years of service at the Center  and at the University of Chicago at large.

He was a [[polyglot]] who, apart from mastering [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[English language|English]] quite early in his life, eventually also learned [[classical Greek]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] in order to be more efficient in his academic career.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Khalid Masud]], ''In Memorium: Dr. Fazlur Rahman (1919-1988)'', Islamic Studies, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Winter 1988), p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
He argued that the basis of [[Islamic revival]] was the return to the intellectual dynamism that was the hallmark of the Islamic scholarly tradition (these ideas are outlined in ''Revival and Reform in Islam: A Study of Islamic Fundamentalism'' and his magnum opus, ''Islam''). He sought to give philosophy free rein, and was keen on Muslims appreciating how the modern [[nation-state]] understood law, as opposed to ethics; his view being that the [[shari'ah]] was a mixture of both ethics and law. He was critical of historical Muslim theologies and philosophies for failing to create a [[moral]] and [[ethical]] worldview based on the values derived from the [[Qur'an]]: 'moral values', unlike [[socioeconomic]] values, 'are not exhausted at any point in history' but require constant interpretation.

He also believed that the modern conservatism of Islamic world is a defensive and temporary posture against the perceived political and economic setbacks of the Muslim world. Adding to this was stagnation in [[Islamic studies|Islamic education]] begun in the early Middle Ages, which led to the inadequate understanding of Qur'anic teachings.&lt;ref name="Jo" /&gt;

===Riba===
The issue of what is ''riba'' and whether it includes all interest on loans has been a major issue in Islam during the 20th century and early 21st. The [[Islamic revival|Islamic revival movement]] that grew in strength and influence during Rahman's lifetime, considered  all and any interest on loans ''riba'' and a "curse", and considered putting an end to it a top priority.    As an [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic Modernist]], Rahman  disagreed, believing that only high-interest loans were ''riba'', and in particularly that ''riba'' referred only to a particular type of interest charged in the time of Muhammad.  He cited the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|''Muwatta'']] of [[Malik ibn Anas|Imam Malik]] in arguing that ''riba'' should not be interpreted literally but must be understood in the context of pre-Islamic Arab moneylending customs. Feisal Khan describes his position as being that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The banned ''riba'' in the Quran referred to a particular custom, ''riba al-nasiah'' or ''riba al-jahaliyah'', where when the debt came due it was traditional to ask the borrower `will you pay or will you ''riba''?` If the borrower chose the latter, he would be granted an extension on the loan but the amount due would be doubled -- hense the ''riba''. ... If the borrower then defaulted on the doubled amount, his debt was redoubled and he was given another time extension: if unable to pay, he and all his possessions could be auctioned off to satisfy his creditors.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:54"&gt;[[Fazlur Rahman Malik#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rahman himself wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;the initial interest itself was not usurious and was, therefore, not considered riba. What made it riba was the increase ... that raised the principal several-fold by continued redoubling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|last2=Siddiqi|first2=M.

Rahman concluded that the Quran banned "extreme usury and so by extension injustice but not interest."&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:54"/&gt;

'''Frithjof Bergmann''' (born 24 December 1930) is a Professor Emeritus of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Michigan]], where he has taught courses on [[existentialism]] and [[Continental philosophy]].

==Life and work==
Frithjof Bergmann first came to the US as a student, where he has lived and worked ever since.  He entered the doctoral program in philosophy at [[Princeton University]] and studied under [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], receiving his Ph.D. in 1959 with a dissertation entitled "Harmony and Reason: an Introduction to the Philosophy of [[Hegel]]."  In addition, Professor Bergmann is a [[Nietzsche]] scholar; his publications include "Nietzsche's Critique of Morality" (published in ''Reading Nietzsche'', Oxford University Press, 1988). He spent most of his academic career at the [[University of Michigan]], where he was a professor and visible political activist.  He taught also at [[The University of California, Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]] and [[The University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Among his more notable PhD students at the University of Michigan were [[Robert C. Solomon]] and [[Anthony Weston]]. He is credited as one of the creators of the [[teach-in]], the first of which was held on the Michigan campus in March 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-20/news/1991020032_1_vietnam-war-war-protests-anti-war-movement Peace Movement Now]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frithjof Bergmann's interests include continental philosophy{{mdash}}especially Hegel, Nietzsche, [[Sartre]], and Existentialism generally{{mdash}}and also social and political philosophy, philosophical anthropology, and philosophy of culture. His article ''The Experience of Values'' (reprinted in ''Revisions: Changing Perspectives in Moral Philosophy'' by University of Notre Dame Press, 1983) is used in universities throughout the world. His book ''On Being Free'' (1977) was issued in a paperback edition in 1978. In this book, Bergmann argues against the standard views of freedom as the lack of external obstacles or as an irrational, unencumbered act that rejects all order. Both of these leave us with nothing substantial for a self at all{{mdash}}and thus, he suggests, constitute virtually a ''reductio ad absurdum'' of modern ideals of education, society, and the family. Instead, he argues that the primary prerequisite of freedom is a self possessed of something that wants to be acted out. An act is free, he argues, if the agent identifies with the elements from which it flows. The real problems of education, society, etc. are those of coming to a true understanding of one’s self and of building a society with which a self can identify.

In 1984, Bergmann founded an organisation called the [[Center for New Work]] (sometimes called just '''New Work''') in [[Flint, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/philosophy_detail/0,2874,19979%255Fpeople%255F43209936,00.html Department of Philosophy at the University of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with others he formulated a novel proposal that became known as the "6 months--6 months proposal."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5694">{{nihongo|'''Ganbaru'''|頑張る|lit., stand firm}}, also romanized as '''gambaru''',  is a ubiquitous Japanese word which roughly means to slog on tenaciously through tough times.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoff, Nicholas. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/26/world/shoichi-yokoi-82-is-dead-japan-soldier-hid-27-years.html?scp=2&amp;sq=ganbaru&amp;st=nyt  "Shoichi Yokoi, 82, Is Dead; Japan Soldier Hid 27 Years,"] ''New York Times'' (US). September 26, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Ganbaru'' is often translated to mean "doing one’s best", but in practice, it means doing more than one's best.&lt;ref&gt;Frühstück, Sabine. (1998). {{Google books|k_Cb7a6FQwwC|''The Culture of Japan as seen through its Leisure,'' p. 104.|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word emphasizes "working with perseverance"&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Kangmin. (1998). {{Google books|wRWFBwgCwhsC|''Dragon gate: Competitive Examinations and Their Consequences,'' p. 224.|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "toughing it out."&lt;ref&gt;Kristoff, Nicholas D. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/22/world/a-japanese-generation-haunted-by-its-past.html?scp=1&amp;sq=ganbaru&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=3  "A Japanese Generation Haunted by Its Past,:] ''New York Times'' (US). January 22, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ganbaru'' means "to commit oneself fully to a task and to bring that task to an end."&lt;ref&gt;Albach, Horst. (1994). {{Google books|Xn8OVNDC1_EC|''Culture and Technical Innovation: a Cross-Cultural Analysis and Policy Recommendations,'' p. 388.|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be translated to mean persistence, tenacity, doggedness and hard work.  The term has a unique importance in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Anne. (1994). {{Google books|6O_hLG3eQQUC|''Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club,'' p. 119.|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Times]] said of [[Shoichi Yokoi]], the [[Japanese holdout]] who surrendered in Guam in January 1972, that in Japan "even those embarrassed by his constant references to the Emperor felt a measure of admiration at his determination and ''ganbaru'' spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kristof | first = Nicholas D | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D81F3BF935A1575AC0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | title = Shoichi Yokoi, 82, Is Dead; Japan Soldier Hid 27 Years | newspaper = The New York Times | date = September 26, 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1995 Kobe earthquake]], the slogan "''Gambaro Kobe''" was used to encourage the people of the disaster region as they worked to rebuild their city and their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Roger J. ''et al.'' (2001). {{Google books|TW7lHYwXhS4C|''The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture,'' p. 84.|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], "''gambaru''" was one of the most commonly heard expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.11alive.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=183076&amp;provider=top  "U.S. donations not rushing to Japan,"] 11Alive News (US). March 17, 2011; excerpt, "Devin Stewart, a senior director at the Japan Society in New York City, said, "Suffering and persevering is a type of virtue in Japan ... the ability to persevere and remain calm under difficult situations. Among the most commonly heard expressions there, are gaman, to persevere or tough it out; gambaru, to do your best, to be strong; and shoganai, it cannot be helped, which expresses a sense of fatalism ...."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
''Gambaru'' focuses attention on the importance of finishing a task and never stopping until a goal is achieved.  The continuing effort to overcome obstacles (even if not successful) is an important concept in Japan.

Unlike the related, but passive [[Gaman (term)|gaman]], ''ganbaru'' is an active process.&lt;ref&gt;Haghirian, Parissa. [http://accjjournal.com/mastering-the-basics/2/ "Mastering The Basics,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709100904/http://accjjournal.com/mastering-the-basics/2/ |date=2011-07-09 }} [http://www.accj.or.jp/user/210/index/  American Chamber of Commerce in Japan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330112308/http://www.accj.or.jp/user/210/index/ |date=2011-03-30 }} (ACCJ), 15 February 2011; excerpt, "Where ''ganbaru'' is an active process and requires people to do something to achieve their goals, ''gaman'' is passive and focuses more on enduring and not complaining."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many near [[synonyms]] in Japanese, there are few [[antonyms]].&lt;ref&gt;Allison, {{Google books|6O_hLG3eQQUC|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gottlob Ernst Schulze''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊltsə|lang}}; 23 August 1761 – 14 January 1833) was a German philosopher, born in [[Heldrungen]] (modern-day [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]]). He was the grandfather of the pioneering biochemist [[Ernst Schulze (chemist)|Ernst Schulze]]. 

==Biography==
Schulze was a [[professor]] at [[University of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol. 7, New York: Macmillan, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; His most influential book was ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'' (1792), a [[skeptic]]al polemic against [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]]'s ''Philosophy of the Elements''.

In Göttingen, he advised his student [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] to concentrate on the philosophies of [[Plato]] and Kant. This advice had a strong influence on Schopenhauer's philosophy. In the winter [[semester]] of 1810 and 1811, Schopenhauer studied both [[psychology]] and [[metaphysics]] under Schulze.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 2, Berg, 1988, {{ISBN|0-85496-539-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulze died in [[Göttingen]].

==Quotes==
*"As determined by the ''Critique of Pure Reason'', the function of the principle of [[causality]] thus undercuts all philosophizing about the where or how of the origin of our cognitions. All assertions on the matter, and every conclusion drawn from them, become empty subtleties, for once we accept that determination of the principle as our rule of thought, we could never ask, "Does anything actually exist which is the ground and cause of our representations?". We can only ask, "How must the understanding join these representations together, in keeping with the pre-determined functions of its activity, in order to gather them as one experience?"&lt;ref&gt;Di Giovanni, George, and H. S. Harris (eds.), ''Between Kant and Hegel'', Indianapolis: Hackett, 2000, p. 131, {{ISBN|0-87220-504-5}} (original quote from: Gottlob Ernst Schulze, ''Aenesidemus'', 1792, pp. 176–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hamiltonian economic program''' was the set of measures that were proposed by [[American Founding Father]] and 1st [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] in four notable reports and implemented by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] during [[George Washington]]'s first administration. These reports outlined a coherent program of national mercantilism government-assisted economic development.

* [[First Report on the Public Credit|First Report on Public Credit]] – pertaining to the assumption of federal and state debts and finance of the United States government (1790)
* [[Second Report on Public Credit]] – pertaining to the establishment of a National Bank (1790)
* [[Report on Manufactures]] – pertaining to the policies to be followed to encourage manufacturing and industry within the United States (1791)
*[[Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit]] - pertaining to how to deal with the system of public credit after Hamilton's resignation, including complete extinguishment of the public debt (1795)

The son of a weaver, Feigl was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg (Liberec)]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] into a Jewish family&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=J-55FJ54afUC&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and matriculated at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1922.  He studied [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Moritz Schlick]], the founder of the [[Vienna Circle]], and received his doctorate in 1927 for the essay "Chance and Law: An Epistemological Analysis of the Roles of Probability and Induction in the Natural Sciences."  He published his first book, ''Theory and Experience in Physics'', in 1929.  During this time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feigl|first=Herbert|title=Inquiries and provocations : selected writings, 1929-1974|year=1981|publisher=D. Reidel Pub. Co.|isbn=90-277-1101-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an active member in the Vienna Circle. He was one of the few Circle members (along with Schlick and [[Friedrich Waismann]]) to have extensive conversations with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]].

In 1930, on an International [[Rockefeller Foundation]] scholarship at [[Harvard University]], Feigl met the physicist [[Percy Williams Bridgman]], the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and the psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]], all of whom he saw as kindred spirits.  In a 1931 paper with [[Albert Blumberg]], "[[Logical Positivism]]: A New European Movement," he argued for logical positivism to be renamed "logical empiricism" based upon certain [[Philosophical realism|realist]] differences between contemporary [[philosophy of science]] and the older [[positivist]] movement.

In 1931, Feigl married Maria Kaspar and emigrated with her to the United States, settling in [[Iowa]] to take up a position in the philosophy department at the [[University of Iowa]]. Their son, Eric Otto, was born in 1933. In 1940, Herbert Feigl accepted a position as professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he remained for 31 years.  His close professional and personal relationship with [[Wilfrid Sellars]] produced many different collaborative projects, including the textbook ''Readings in Philosophical Analysis'' and the journal ''Philosophical Studies'', which he and Sellars founded in 1949.  In 1953, with a grant from the Hill Foundation, he established the [[Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science]].  He was appointed Regents Professor of the University of Minnesota in 1967.

He believed that empiricism is the only adequate philosophy for experimental science. Though he became a philosopher instead of a chemist, he never lost the perspective, and the scientific commonsense, of a practical scientist. He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was, in the paradigmatic sense, a philosopher of science.
Feigl retired in 1971 and died of [[cancer]] on June 1, 1988 in [[Minneapolis]].

[[File:International Association for Philosophy and Literature 2012.jpg|thumb|International Association for Philosophy and Literature in 2012.]]
The '''International Association for Philosophy and Literature''' (IAPL), founded in 1976 by Hugh J. Silverman, brought together thinkers and scholars working in a wide range of disciplines concerned with the study of philosophical, historical, critical, and theoretical issues. The IAPL was dedicated to the exchange of ideas and to the enhancement of scholarly research in the arts and the humanities. The IAPL provided an opportunity to engage in discussion at the intersections of philosophical, literary, cultural, textual, visual, medial, art, and aesthetic theories. With its focus on interdisciplinary topics and commitments, the IAPL played a role in the articulation of vital and exciting recent developments in philosophy, literature, and the arts.

Since Hugh J. Silverman's death in 2013* [https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/port-jefferson-station-ny/hugh-silverman-5526500 Obituary], the IAPL has continued as an organization and has published volumes related to previous conferences but has, until 2018, refrained from organizing conferences. In 2018 the IAPL relaunched as '''The Association for Philosophy and Literature''' ([https://www.philosophyliterature.com/ APL]).

== Annual Conferences ==
[[File:International Association for Philosophy and Literature in Tallinn.jpg|thumb|International Association for Philosophy and Literature in [[Tallinn]] (2012).]]
Annual APL conferences provide opportunities for dialogue and strategic readings, the articulation of contemporary themes and ideas, the exploration of various expressive arts, and the production of new theoretical discourses.

The [https://www.philosophyliterature.com/2019-conference 1st annual conference as APL, on ''Truth Fiction Illusion - Worlds and Experience,''] will be held at [https://www.aau.at/en/ Alpen-Adria-Universität, Klagenfurt, Austria,] 29 May - 2 June, 2019.

Recent conference themes and locations include:
*(2013) ''Hospitalities: biopolitics / technologies / humanities'' (37th annual conference) [[National University of Singapore]]   
*(2009) ''Double Edges: rhetorics-rhizomes-regions'' (33rd annual conference) [[Brunel University]]
*(2008) ''Global Arts / Local Knowledge''  (32nd annual conference) [[RMIT University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[University of Melbourne]] (Australia)
*(2007) ''Layering: Spatial / Temporal / Textual / Visual'' (31st annual conference) [[University of Cyprus]], Nicosia (Cyprus)
*(2006) ''Between Three: Arts - Media - Politics'' (30th annual conference) [[University of Freiburg]] (Germany), [[University of Strasbourg]] (France), [[Beyeler Foundation]] (Basel, Switzerland)

==Membership==

Membership in the APL includes access to conference programs, special discounts on conference registration fees and at conference hotels, receipt of various APL brochures and publications, the Bibliography of Books Published by APL Members, the opportunity to submit a conference paper, and the support of an extensive range of useful information made available on the APL website. Membership also includes a free book from the ongoing ''Textures'' series consisting of uniquely focused volumes of essays derived from previous IAPL/APL
conferences.

==Publications==

The IAPL in concert with established publishers produces volumes resulting from its annual conferences.  These books are fully edited, shaped, and recast as in-depth studies of a given topic with some of the major contributors to a particular IAPL conference.
Essays are selected for their development of aspects of the volume theme and for lasting value. The '''''Textures: Philosophy / Literature / Culture''''' Series was edited by [[Hugh J. Silverman]], IAPL Executive Editor. The role of Executive Editor has been taken over by John W P Phillips since 2013. Each volume is edited typically by the conference host coordinator(s).  Members can select one of the current volumes as part of their membership benefits each year.

'''Jesus and the woman taken in adultery''' (or '''''Pericope Adulterae''''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|ə|p|i|_|ə|ˈ|d|ʌ|l|t|ər|i}},&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-la|peˈrikope aˈdulterai|classical}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Pericope de Adultera''''') is a passage ([[pericope]]) found in the [[Gospel of John]] 7:53–8:11, that has been the subject of much scholarly discussion.

In the passage, [[Jesus]] has sat down in the temple to teach some of the people, after he spent the previous night at the [[Mount of Olives]].  A group of scribes and [[Pharisees]] confront Jesus, interrupting his teaching session. They bring in a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she was caught in the very act. They ask Jesus whether the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:24|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus first ignores the interruption and writes on the ground as though he does not hear them. But when the woman's accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone. The accusers and congregants depart, leaving Jesus alone with the woman.  Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her. She answers that no one has condemned her. Jesus says that he, too, does not condemn her, and tells her to go and sin no more.

Although nothing in the story contradicts anything else in the [[Canonical Gospels|Gospels]], many analysts of the Greek text and manuscripts of the Gospel of John have argued that it was "certainly not part of the original text of St. John's Gospel."&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;'Pericope adulterae', in FL Cross (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jerusalem Bible]] claims "the author of this passage is not John".&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Bible, reference at John 7:53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo the Great]] (bishop of Rome, or Pope, from 440–[[461|61]]), cited the passage in his 62nd Sermon, mentioning that Jesus said "to the adulteress who was brought to him, ‘Neither will I condemn you; go and sin no more.'" In the early 400s, [[Saint Augustine]] used the passage extensively, and from his writings, it is also clear that his contemporary [[Faustus_of_Mileve|Faustus]] (considered by many{{who|date=November 2018}} to be a heretic) also used it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[Council of Trent]], held between 1545 and 1563, declared that the Latin [[Vulgate]] (the Gospels of which were produced by [[Jerome]] in 383, based on Greek manuscripts which Jerome considered ancient at that time, and which contains the passage) was authentic and authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Council of Trent Session 4, Dec. 1 | url = http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct04.html | accessdate = 2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of simple quantities, 1,495 Greek manuscripts include the pericope adulterae (or part of it, supporting the inclusion of the passage as a whole), and 267 do not include it. Among those 267, however, are some manuscripts which are exceptionally early and which most textual analysts consider the most important.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The subject of Jesus' writing on the ground was fairly common in art, especially from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, with examples by artists including those [[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|by Pieter Bruegel]] [[The Woman Taken in Adultery (Rembrandt)|and Rembrandt]]. There was a medieval tradition, originating in a comment attributed to [[Ambrose]], that the words written were ''terra terram accusat'' ("earth accuses earth"; a reference to the end of verse [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:19: [[Fall of Man|"for dust you are and to dust you will return"]]),&lt;ref&gt;This phrase ''terra terram accusat'' is also given in the ''Gospel Book of Hitda of Maschede'' and a ninth-century ''glossa'', Codex Sangelensis 292, and a sermon by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] attributes the use of these words to Ambrose and Augustine, and other phrases to the ''Glossa Ordinaria'' and John Chrysostom, who is usually considered as not referencing the Pericope. — see Knust, Jennifer; Wasserman, Tommy, [https://www.academia.edu/991221/_Earth_Accuses_Earth_Tracing_Jesus_Writing_on_the_Ground_ "Earth accuses earth: tracing what Jesus wrote on the ground"], ''Harvard Theological Review'', October 01, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which is shown in some depictions in art, for example, the ''[[Codex Egberti]]''. This is very probably a matter of guesswork based on [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 17:13. There have been other speculations about what Jesus wrote.

==The passage==
{{bibleref|John|7:53–8:11|131}} in the [[New Revised Standard Version]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; Then each of them went home, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; they said to him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?" &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus straightened up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; She said, "No one, sir." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpretation==
This episode, and its message of mercy and forgiveness balanced with a call to holy living, have endured in Christian thought. Both "let him who is without sin, cast the first stone"&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Britni Danielle, "[http://clutchmagonline.com/lifeculture/feature/cast-the-first-stone-why-are-we-so-judgmental/ Cast the First Stone: Why Are We So Judgmental?]", ''Clutch'', Feb 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and "go, and sin no more"&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Mudiga Affe, Gbenga Adeniji, and Etim Ekpimah, "[http://www.punchng.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art201102271115129 Go and sin no more, priest tells Bode George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302185320/http://www.punchng.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art201102271115129 |date=2011-03-02 }}", ''The Punch'', 27 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; have found their way into common usage. The English idiomatic phrase to "[[Wiktionary:cast the first stone|cast the first stone]]" is derived from this passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/385600.html|title=To cast the first stone|author=Phrase Finder is copyright Gary Martin, 1996–2015. All rights reserved.|work=phrases.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage has been taken as confirmation of Jesus' ability to write, otherwise only suggested by implication in the Gospels, but the word "εγραφεν" in John 8:8 could mean "draw" as well as "write".&lt;ref&gt;An uncommon usage, evidently not found in the [[LXX]], but supported in Liddell &amp; Scott's ''Greek-English Lexicon'' (8th ed., NY, 1897) s.v. γραμμα, page 317 col. 2, citing (among others) Herodotus (repeatedly) including 2:73 ("I have not seen one except in an illustration") &amp; 4:36 ("drawing a map"). See also, Chris Keith, ''The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus'' (2009, Leiden, Neth., Brill) page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaic Law==
{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22–24|NKJV}} states:

{{quote|If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die — the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so you shall put away the evil from Israel. If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a husband, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he humbled his neighbor's wife; so you shall put away the evil from among you.}}

In this passage and also in {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|NKJV}}, "death is fixed as the penalty of adultery", applicable to both the man and the woman concerned. However, "''stoning'' as the form of death is only specified when a betrothed virgin is violated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/8.htm Expositor's Greek Testament] on John 8, accessed 9 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification with Mary Magdalene==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

A common tradition and Christian theological belief held that the woman caught in adultery was Jesus's female disciple [[Mary Magdalene]]. Catholic houses for reformed prostitutes and women pregnant outside of marriage were often given the name [[Magdalene asylum]] or were specifically dedicated to the saint's care. 

Part of this belief stemmed from the fact that Mary Magdalene was reported to have financially supported Jesus, but was listed as neither widowed nor married nor a mother, unlike most of Jesus's other female followers, and the conclusion was that the only way an unmarried, unwidowed, childless woman in such a society could have access to such money was through prostitution. Such a woman would thus likely engage in prostitution with married men, and hence commit adultery. This gave the romantic notion that Jesus, in refusing to condemn Mary Magdalene to death, earns her loyalty and following. It is also stated in the gospels that Jesus dined with prostitutes and tax collectors in an attempt to reform them, and thus Mary Magdalene, the reformed prostitute, becomes the symbolic counterpart to [[St. Matthew]], the reformed tax collector. 

Another reason is that Mary Magdalene is a key witness to the resurrection in John's gospel, being the first human to actually witness the resurrected [[Jesus Christ]]. Theologically, being a prostitute redeemed by Jesus personally would give her greater standing to be the first witness, as it would emphasize redemption and forgiveness; otherwise, Jesus choosing Mary Magdalene to be his first witness seems arbitrary, as she exhibited neither greater faith nor greater redemption than the other disciples (such as Peter and John).

However, in current times the belief has come under scrutiny, as there is no direct linking of Mary Magdalene and the woman caught in adultery by the Biblical authors.

The [[pericope]] is not found in most of the early Greek Gospel manuscripts. It is not in [[Papyrus 66|P&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;]] or in [[Papyrus 75|P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;]], both of which have been assigned to the late 100s or early 200s, nor in two important manuscripts produced in the early/mid 300s, [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]]. The first surviving Greek manuscript to contain the pericope is the Latin/Greek diglot [[Codex Bezae]], produced in the 400s or 500s (but displaying a form of text which has affinities with "Western" readings used in the 100s and 200s). Codex Bezae is also the earliest surviving Latin manuscript to contain it. Out of 23 Old Latin manuscripts of John 7–8, seventeen contain at least part of the pericope, and represent at least three transmission-streams in which it was included.

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (in his ''Ecclesiastical History'', composed in the early 300s), Papias (circa AD 110) refers to a story of Jesus and a woman "accused of many sins" as being found in the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], which might refer to this passage or to one like it. In the Syriac [[Didascalia Apostolorum]], composed in the mid-200s, the author, in the course of instructing bishops to exercise a measure of clemency, states that a bishop who does not receive a repentant person would be doing wrong – "for you do not obey our Savior and our God, to do as He also did with her that had sinned, whom the elders set before Him, and leaving the judgment in His hands, departed.  But He, the searcher of hearts, asked her and said to her, 'Have the elders condemned thee, my daughter?' She said to Him, 'No, Lord.'  And He said unto her, 'Go your way; neither do I condemn thee.' In Him therefore, our Savior and King and God, be your pattern, O bishops."

The ''[[Apostolic Constitutions|Constitutions of the Holy Apostles]]'' Book II.24, composed c. 380, echoes the ''Didascalia Apostolorum'', alongside a utilization of Luke 7:47.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Church Fathers Volume 7 by Philip Schaff (public domain) pp. 388–390, 408&lt;/ref&gt; [[Codex Fuldensis]], which was produced in AD 546, and which, in the Gospels, features an unusual arrangement of the text that was found in an earlier document, contains the adulterae pericope, in the form in which it was written in the Vulgate.  More significantly, Codex Fuldensis also preserves the chapter-headings of its earlier source-document (thought by some researchers to echo the Diatessaron produced by Tatian in the 170's), and the title of chapter #120 refers specifically to the woman taken in adultery.

The important codices L and Delta do not contain the pericope adulterae, but between John 7:52 and 8:12, each contains a distinct blank space, as a sort of memorial left by the scribe to signify remembrance of the absent passage.

[[Pacian|Pacian of Barcelona]] (bishop from 365–391), in the course of making a rhetorical challenge, opposes cruelty as he sarcastically endorses it: "O Novatians, why do you delay to ask an eye for an eye? ... Kill the thief. Stone the petulant. Choose not to read in the Gospel that the Lord spared even the adulteress who confessed, when none had condemned her." Pacian was a contemporary of the scribes who made Codex Sinaiticus.

The writer known as [[Ambrosiaster]], c. 370/380, mentioned the occasion when Jesus "spared her who had been apprehended in adultery."  The unknown author of the composition "Apologia David" (thought by some analysts to be Ambrose, but more probably not) mentioned that people could be initially taken aback by the passage in which "we see an adulteress presented to Christ and sent away without condemnation."  Later in the same composition he referred to this episode as a "lection" in the Gospels, indicating that it was part of the annual cycle of readings used in the church-services.
 
Peter Chrysologus, writing in Ravenna c. 450, clearly cited the pericope adulterae in his Sermon 115.  Sedulius and Gelasius also clearly used the passage.  Prosper of Aquitaine, and Quodvultdeus of Carthage, in the mid-400s, utilized the passage.

A text called the Second Epistle of Pope Callistus section 6&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. and J., "The Comprehensive New Testament", Cornerstone Publications (2008), p. 571, {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a quote that may be from John 8:11 – "Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: "Go, and sin no more."" However this text also appears to quote from eighth-century writings and therefore is most likely spurious.&lt;ref&gt;The Early church Fathers Volume 8: The Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and Epistles, The Clementia, Apocrypha, Decretals, Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents, Remains of the First by Philip Schaff (public domain) pp. 607, 618&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, it was thought that no Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 1100s.  However, in 1941 a large collection of the writings of [[Didymus the Blind]] (c. 313–398) was discovered in Egypt, in which Didymus states that "We find in certain gospels" an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened "and said to those who were about to cast stones, ‘He who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it.  If anyone is conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.’  And no one dared," and so forth.  This is far from a direct quotation, but it may be a loose summary of the episode.  Barring the possibility that Didymus was referring to some other Gospel than the four-Gospel collection that was typically used in the churches in his time, this reference appears to establish that the passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 300s onwards.

In [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], which was produced in the early 300s, perhaps in Egypt (or in Caesarea, by copyists using exemplars from Egypt), the text is marked at the end of John chapter 7 with an "umlaut" in the margin, indicating that an alternative reading was known at this point. (However, the date of these umlauts, or distigmai, is a matter of some debate.) This codex also has an umlaut alongside blank space following the end of the Gospel of John, which may convey that whoever added the umlaut was aware of additional text following the end of John 21 – which is where the pericope adulterae is found in the f-1 group of manuscripts.

[[Jerome]], writing around 417, reports that the ''pericope adulterae'' was found in its usual place in "many Greek and Latin manuscripts" in Rome and the Latin West. This is confirmed by some Latin Fathers of the 300s and 400s, including [[Ambrose]] of Milan, and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. The latter claimed that the passage may have been improperly excluded from some manuscripts in order to avoid the impression that Christ had sanctioned adultery:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain persons of little faith, or rather enemies of the true faith, fearing, I suppose, lest their wives should be given impunity in sinning, removed from their manuscripts the Lord's act of forgiveness toward the adulteress, as if he who had said, Sin no more, had granted permission to sin.&lt;ref&gt;"Sed hoc videlicet infidelium sensus exhorret, ita ut nonnulli modicae fidei vel potius inimici verae fidei, credo, metuentes peccandi impunitatem dari mulieribus suis, illud, quod de adulterae indulgentia Dominus fecit, auferrent de codicibus suis, quasi permissionem peccandi tribuerit qui dixit: Iam deinceps noli peccare, aut ideo non debuerit mulier a medico Deo illius peccati remissione sanari, ne offenderentur insani." Augustine, ''De Adulterinis Conjugiis'' 2:6–7.

==History of textual criticism on John 7:53–8:11==
[[File:Codex Sangallensis 48 348.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Sangallensis 48]] with the blanked space for the pericope John 7:53–8:11]]
The first to systematically apply the critical marks of the Alexandrian critics was [[Origen]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc02.html|title=New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. II: Basilica – Chambers|work=ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | In the Septuagint column [Origen] used the system of diacritical marks which was in use with the Alexandrian critics of Homer, especially Aristarchus, marking with an [[obelus]] under different forms, as "./.", called lemniscus, and "/.", called a hypolemniscus, those passages of the Septuagint which had nothing to correspond to in Hebrew, and inserting, chiefly from Theodotion under an asterisk (*), those which were missing in the Septuagint; in both cases a metobelus (Y) marked the end of the notation.}}

Early textual critics familiar with the use and meaning of these marks in classical Greek works like [[Homer]], interpreted the signs to mean that the section (John 7:53–8:11) was an [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]] and not an original part of the Gospel.

During the 16th century, Western European scholars – both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] – sought to recover the most correct Greek text of the [[New Testament]], rather than relying on the [[Vulgate]] Latin translation. At this time, it was noticed that a number of early manuscripts containing John's Gospel lacked John 7:53–8:11 inclusive; and also that some manuscripts containing the verses marked them with critical signs, usually a [[Infinity symbol|lemniscus]] or [[asterisk]]. It was also noted that, in the lectionary of the Greek church, the Gospel-reading for Pentecost runs from John 7:37 to 8:12, but skips over the twelve verses of this pericope.

Beginning with Lachmann (in Germany, 1840), reservations about the pericope became more strongly argued in the modern period, and these opinions were carried into the English world by [[Samuel Davidson]] (1848–51), [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|Tregelles]] (1862),&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Tregelles, ''An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scripture'' (London 1856), pp. 465–468.&lt;/ref&gt; and others; the argument against the verses being given body and final expression in [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] (1886). Those opposing the authenticity of the verses as part of John are represented in the 20th century by men like Cadbury (1917), Colwell (1935), and [[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger]] (1971).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'', Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 2001, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 19th-century text critics [[Henry Alford]] and [[F. H. A. Scrivener]] the passage was added by John in a second edition of the Gospel along with 5:3.4 and the 21st chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=F.H.A. Scrivener|title=A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament (3rd edition, 1883, London) |page= 610 |url= https://archive.org/stream/aplainintroduct01scrigoog#page/n682/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a number of scholars have strongly defended the Johannine authorship of these verses. This group of critics is typified by such scholars as Nolan (1865), and [[John William Burgon|Burgon]] (1886), and Hoskier (1920).  More recently it has been defended by O.T. Fuller (1978), and is included in the Greek New Testaments compiled by Wilbur Pickering (1980/2014), Hodges &amp; Farstad (1982/1985), and Robinson &amp; Pierpont (2005).  Rather than endorsing Augustine's theory that some men had removed the passage due to a concern that it would be used by their wives as a pretense to commit adultery, Burgon proposed (but did not develop in detail) a theory that the passage had been lost due to a misunderstanding of a feature in the lection-system of the early church.

The theory that the passage was original, but was lost due to its treatment in an early lection-cycle, explains not only its absence from some manuscripts, but also its appearance in the f-1 (Caesarean) group of manuscripts at the end of John, and its appearance in the [[Family 13|f-13]] group after Luke 21:38.  The same mechanism accounts for the movement of the passage, in a smattering of manuscripts, to precede John 7:37, and (in a few others) to follow John 8:12.

One form of this theory is that at a very early date, an annual lection-cycle was developed for the major feast-days; in this lection-cycle, a specific segment of the Gospel of John was assigned to be read at Pentecost (which was celebrated by the Christian church from its beginning, having been adopted from Judaism):  John 7:37–52, plus 8:12 (in order to close the reading on a positive note).  This is still the form of the lection for Pentecost in the Byzantine lectionary-cycle, attested in hundreds of copies.  In an early copy used by a lector (the person designated to read Scripture in early church-services), marks were added to signify that the reader was to stop at the end of 7:52, and skip to the beginning of 8:12.  When a professional copyist, unfamiliar with the lection-cycle, used such a copy as his exemplar, he misunderstood the marks as if they meant that he, the copyist, should skip from the end of 7:52 to the beginning of 8:12, and thus the passage was dutifully skipped, and was lost, in a very influential transmission-line.

Another form of this theory is that a very early copyist, preparing a Gospels-codex for liturgical use, transplanted the section to the end of John as a practical step, so as to simplify the lector's task on Pentecost (so that the lector would not have to pause to find the final portion of the lection), and after the section was thus transplanted, it dropped out altogether from the Alexandrian transmission-line which is represented by the oldest manuscripts, and from related branches (including one which later yielded, or influenced, the Syriac Peshitta).

The transplantation of the passage, in a few manuscripts, to precede John 7:37, or to follow 8:12, is a scribal adaptation intended to simplify things for the lector by presenting the lection for Pentecost as one uninterrupted segment of text.  Likwise, in the f-13 group of manuscripts, the pericope adulterae has been transplanted out of the Gospel of John, and has been placed at the end of Luke 21, so as to conveniently arrange the reading for Saint Pelagia's feast-day (October 8) near Luke 21:12–19, the lection for Saints Sergius and Bacchus (October 7).  Inasmuch as all these movements of the passage are different effects of the lection-cycle, the complete absence of the passage, it is proposed, is just one more example of this phenomenon—albeit attested in manuscripts earlier than the earliest clear evidence of a lection-cycle in which this passage was read at Pentecost.

Defenders of the genuineness of the passage have also noted the following:

* In some of the early manuscripts in which the pericope adulterae does not appear after John 7:52 (such as P66 and P75 and Codex N), the final page of the Gospel of John has not survived, making it impossible to see whether or not the passage had been transplanted to the end of the book.
* Some medieval manuscripts in which the pericope adulterae does not appear after John 7:52 (such as Codex Lambda, and several minuscules) mention that the passage was found in ancient copies.
* In minuscule 565 and related copies, a note states that although the pericope adulterae was found following John 7:52, it was moved to the end of the Gospel of John. Several of these manuscripts also feature the "Jerusalem Colophon" which states that they were descended from, or proof-read with, ancient copies at Jerusalem.
Palestinian Aramaic evidence clearly shows that before it was made, the pericope adulterae had been transferred to the end of the Gospel of John.
* In many of the manuscripts in which asterisks or other marks appear in the margin alongside the passage, the marks do not accompany 7:52–8:2, but only 8:3–11, thus indicating where to find the lection for the Feast-day of St. Pelagia; the notion that the asterisks in these copies were intended to express scribal doubt is a misunderstanding of the lectionary apparatus.
* Without 7:53–8:11 in the text, John's narrative shifts abruptly from a scene in which the religious leaders are gathered in their own meeting (in 7:52), to a scene (in 8:12–20) in which Jesus is teaching in the temple-treasury.
* It is intrinsically unlikely that anyone would begin a "floating" anecdote with the sentence, "And everyone went to his own house."

Almost all modern critical translations include the pericope adulterae at John 7:53–8:11 (exceptions being the [[New English Bible]] and [[Revised English Bible]], which relocate it after the end of the Gospel); but most others enclose it in brackets, and/or add a footnote mentioning the absence of the passage in the oldest witnesses ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]], [[New Jerusalem Bible|NJB]], [[New International Version|NIV]], [[Good News Bible|GNT]], [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]).

==Authorship==
[[File:Papyrus66.jpg|thumb|[[Papyrus 66]] without text of John 7:53–8:12]]

===Arguments against Johannine authorship===
Bishop [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|J.B. Lightfoot]] wrote that absence of the passage from the earliest manuscripts, combined with the occurrence of stylistic characteristics atypical of John, together implied that the passage was an [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]]. Nevertheless, he considered the story to be authentic history.&lt;ref&gt;"The passages which touch Christian sentiment, or history, or morals, and which are affected by textual differences, though less rare than the former, are still very few.
Of these, the pericope of the woman taken in adultery holds the first place of importance.
In this case a deference to the most ancient authorities, as well as a consideration of internal evidence, might seem to involve immediate loss.

The best solution may be to place the passage in brackets, for the purpose of showing, not, indeed, that it contains an untrue narrative (for, whencesoever it comes, it seems to bear on its face the highest credentials of authentic history), but that evidence external and internal is against its being regarded as an integral portion of the original Gospel of St. John." J.B. Lightfoot, R.C. Trench, C.J. Ellicott, The Revision of the English Version of the NT, intro. P. Schaff, (Harper &amp; Bro. NY, 1873) Online at CCEL (Christian Classic Ethereal Library)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, based on [[Eusebius]]' mention that the writings of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] contained a story "about a woman falsely accused before the Lord of many sins" (H.E. 3.39), he argued that this section originally was part of Papias' ''Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord'', and included it in his collection of Papias' fragments. [[Bart D. Ehrman]] concurs in ''Misquoting Jesus'', adding that the passage contains many words and phrases otherwise alien to John's writing.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman in ''Misquoting Jesus'', (HarperCollins. NY, 2005), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Michael W. Holmes has pointed out that it is not certain "that Papias knew the story in precisely this form, inasmuch as it now appears that at least two independent stories about Jesus and a sinful woman circulated among Christians in the first two centuries of the church, so that the traditional form found in many New Testament manuscripts may well represent a conflation of two independent shorter, earlier versions of the incident."&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes in ''The Apostolic Fathers in English'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2006), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle R. Hughes has argued that one of these earlier versions is in fact very similar in style, form, and content to the Lukan special material (the so-called "L" source), suggesting that the core of this tradition is in fact rooted in very early Christian (though not Johannine) memory.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle R. Hughes, "The Lukan Special Material and the Tradition History of the Pericope Adulterae," Novum Testamentum 55.3 (2013): 232–251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for Johannine authorship===
There is clear reference to the pericope adulterae in the primitive Christian church in the Syriac [[Didascalia Apostolorum]]. (II,24,6; ed. Funk I, 93.)
[[Zane C. Hodges]] and Arthur L. Farstad argue for Johannine authorship of the pericope.&lt;ref&gt;"If it is not an original part of the Fourth Gospel, its writer would have to be viewed as a skilled Johannine imitator, and its placement in this context as the shrewdest piece of interpolation in literary history!" The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text with Apparatus: Second Edition, by Zane C. Hodges (Editor), Arthur L. Farstad (Editor) Publisher: Thomas Nelson; {{ISBN|0-8407-4963-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest there are points of similarity between the pericope's style and the style of the rest of the gospel. They claim that the details of the encounter fit very well into the context of the surrounding verses. They argue that the pericope's appearance in the majority of manuscripts, if not in the oldest ones, is evidence of its authenticity.

==Manuscript evidence==
[[File:Adulterae.JPG|right|thumb|John 7:52–8:12 in [[Codex Sinaiticus]]]]

Both ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA27) and the [[United Bible Societies]] (UBS4) provide critical text for the pericope, but mark this off with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;double brackets]], indicating that the pericope is regarded as a later addition to the text.&lt;ref&gt;
Describing its use of double brackets UBS4 states that they "enclose passages that are regarded as later additions to the text, but are of evident antiquity and importance."&lt;/ref&gt;
However, UBS4 rates its reconstruction of the ''wording'' of the pericope as { A }, meaning "virtually certain" to reflect the original text of the ''addition''.  (In NA28, however, a reading in Second Peter 2:18 that had been ranked "A" ("virtually certain") was rejected and replaced with a rival reading.)

In [[management]], '''Joy's law''' is the principle that "no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else,” attributed to [[Sun Microsystems]] co-founder [[Bill Joy]].&lt;ref name="Lakhani2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lakhani KR, Panetta JA |title=The Principles of Distributed Innovation |volume=2 |publisher=MIT Press |ssrn=1021034 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy was prompted to state this observation through his dislike of [[Bill Gates]]' view of "[[Microsoft]] as an IQ monopolist." He argued that, instead, "It's better to create an ecology that gets all the world’s smartest people toiling in your garden for your goals. If you rely solely on your own employees, you’ll never solve all your customers' needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlgaard|first1=Rich|title=How Fast Can You Learn|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/031.html|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core to this principle is the definition of smart within the context of the quotation. Smart "refers to capability but not willingness to work for someone." Furthermore, "the fact that you are smart for one company does not make you smart for another." ''Richard Pettinger, Director of Information Management for Business, UCL'' &lt;ref&gt;Richard Pettinger, Programme Director (BSc/MSci Information Management for Business), email, 17/10/2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The law highlights an essential problem that is faced by many modern businesses, "that in any given sphere of activity most of the pertinent knowledge will reside outside the boundaries of any one organization, and the central challenge [is] to find ways to access that knowledge."&lt;ref name=MITpressjournal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lakhani; Panetta|first1=Karim R; Jill A|title=The Principles of Distributed Innovation|journal=MIT Press Journal|date=2007|pages=97–112|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/itgg.2007.2.3.97|accessdate=23 October 2014|doi=10.1162/itgg.2007.2.3.97|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In computing, the same Bill Joy devised a simple mathematical function regarding the [[Joy's Law (computing)|increase in microprocessor speed over time]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alfred M. |last=Kriman |title=SBF Glossary: Jo. to J-2 |url=http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/J02.html#Joy-s-Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also referred to as Joy's Law.

==Underlying principles of knowledge for Joy’s law==
[[Friedrich Hayek]], an economist and philosopher known for his defense of [[classical liberalism]], observed that “knowledge is unevenly distributed.”&lt;ref name="Leading open innovation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=edited by Anne Sigismund|last2=Möslein,|first2=Kathrin M.|last3=Reichwald|first3=Ralf|title=Leading open innovation|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262018494|page=162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Znf93RQd1kC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=joys+law+open+innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qiCASzF6FD&amp;sig=nYldKWpMvIKIdUBArWxe-01ZLNs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MlhKVJ2OMMTQ7AaJhoCoCQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘knowledge’ that Hayek refers to is the knowledge that the ‘smartest people’ possess in Joy’s law.
Hayek states that the problem of a rational economic order is because knowledge that we wish to grasp never exists in a “concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hayek, Friedrich A.|title=The use of knowledge in society|publisher=American Economic Review|pages=519–30|edition=XXXV, No. 4|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is impossible to aggregate all the knowledge that exists. This explains that Joy is right in saying that “most of the smartest people work for someone else.”

[[Eric von Hippel]], a professor of technological innovation in the MIT Sloan School of Management, is known partly for his principle of knowledge being ‘sticky’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Hippel|first1=Eric|title=Eric von Hippel|url=http://evhippel.mit.edu/|website=WordPress|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the difficulty of transporting knowledge from one place to another. Stickiness is defined as the cost required to “transfer a unit of information to a specified locus in a form usable by a given information seeker. When this cost is low, information stickiness is low; when it is high, stickiness is high.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eric von Hippel|title="Sticky Information"" and the Locus of  Problem Solving: Implications for Innovation|journal=MIT Sloan School of Management Working Paper|date=April 1994|volume=no.4|pages=429–439|url=http://evhippel.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/stickyinfo.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=MIT Management Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; “When Joy says that most of the smart people work for someone else, it is not because companies are hiring dumb people. It is not because employees in any given firm are not smart. It is because of the nature of knowledge – getting hold of it is tough. It is unevenly distributed and sticky.”&lt;ref name="Leading open innovation"/&gt;

==Joy's law in open innovation==
One interpretation of Joy’s Law is that of Todd Park, former [[Chief Technology Officer of the United States]], through his summary of the challenge of [[open innovation]] in government: “Even if you get the best and the brightest to work for you, there will always be an infinite number of other, smarter people employed by others.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuutti|first1=Camille|title=Why Joy’s Law applies to open innovation|journal=FedScoop|date=May 3, 2013|url=http://fedscoop.com/why-joys-law-applies-to-open-innovation/|accessdate=24 October 2014|publisher=FedScoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Keisei sanshoku''''' ({{CJKV|j=谿声山色}}), rendered in English as '''''The Sounds of Valley Streams, the Forms of Mountains''''', is the 25th book of the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'' by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It was written in the spring of 1240 at Dōgen's monastery [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in [[Kyoto]]. The book appears in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', and it is ordered ninth in the later chronological 95 fascicle editions. The name ''keisei sanshoku'' is a quotation from the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese poet [[Su Shi]], wherein he experiences the sound of the valley stream as the preaching of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]] and the mountain as the [[Trikaya|body of the Buddha]]. Dogen also discusses this verse of Su Shi in the later Shōbōgenzō books of ''[[Sansui Kyō (Shōbōgenzō)|Sansui Kyō]]'' and ''[[Mujō Seppō (Shōbōgenzō)|Mujō Seppō]]''. About halfway through the essay, Dōgen switches from focusing on the title theme to a discussion of [[Śīla|Buddhist ethics]] before ultimately concluding that one must practice ethical behavior in order to see the dharma in the natural world as Su Shi does.&lt;ref name=bielefeldt&gt;{{citation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|title=Sound of the Stream, Form of the Mountain: Keisei Sanshoku|year=2013|journal=Dharma Eye|number=31|publisher=Sotoshu Shumucho|pages=21–29|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/dharma/pdf/31e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The name ''keisei sanshoku'' is a paraphase from the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese poet [[Su Shi]], wherein he experiences the sound of the valley stream as the preaching of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]] and the mountain as the [[Trikaya|body of the Buddha]].&lt;ref name=bielefeldt/&gt; The poem of Su Shi's being referenced is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt; The voices of the river valley are the [Buddha's] wide and long tongue,
The form of the mountains is nothing other than his pure body.
Through the night, eighty-four thousand verses.
On another day, how can I tell them to others?&lt;ref name=Gudo/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Although the title consists of only four [[Chinese characters]] (谿声山色), they have been translated into English in many different ways. While the third character (山) is always unambiguously translated as "mountain", the other three have more diverse interpretations. The second character (声) indicates either "sound" or "voice, while the final character can mean "form" or "color".&lt;ref name=Gudo/&gt; The many English translations of the title are listed below:&lt;ref name=bielefeldt/&gt;

Regardless of the particular translation, the title is ultimately [[metonymy]] for the natural world as a whole. As [[Gudō Wafu Nishijima|Gudō Nishijima]] explains: &lt;blockquote&gt;In Buddhism, this world is the truth itself, so nature is a face of the truth. Nature is the material side of the real world, so it is always speaking the truth, and manifesting the law of the universe every day. This is why it has been said since ancient times that sounds of rivers are the preaching of [[Gautama Buddha]] and forms of mountains are the body of Gautama Buddha. In this chapter, Master Dōgen preached to us the meaning of nature in Buddhism".&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=1|pages=109–110|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=1-4196-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On February 1, 2016, Driscoll opened The Trinity Church in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Early life ==

Driscoll was born in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and raised Roman Catholic in the Riverton Heights area of [[SeaTac, WA]],&lt;ref name="Worthen" /&gt; which he described as "a very rough neighborhood"{{sfn|Driscoll|Driscoll|2012|p = 5}} where serial killer Ted Bundy had picked up victims.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://crosscut.com/2014/07/inside-mars-hills-big-meltdown|page=single|title = Inside Mars Hill's massive meltdown: How narcissism, misogyny and Mark Driscoll's own troubled past led to the mega-church mass exodus his flock was too scared to talk about.|date = July 16, 2014|accessdate = July 18, 2014|website = [[Crosscut.com]]|publisher = |last = Solie|first = Stacey}} ''Citing'' {{harvnb|Driscoll|Driscoll|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the oldest of five children and the son of a union drywaller.&lt;ref name="Worthen" /&gt; He described a difficult family history of abuse and crime, writing: "The men on my father's side include uneducated alcoholics, mental patients, and women beaters.... One of the main reasons my parents moved from North Dakota to Seattle was to get away from some family members when I was a very young boy."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In high school, he met his future wife,&lt;ref name="Worthen" /&gt; Grace Martin,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; daughter of Gib Martin, an evangelical pastor. In 1989, he graduated from [[Highline High School]] in [[Burien, Washington]], where he served as student body president, captain of the baseball team, editor of the school newspaper, and the "most likely to succeed" in his graduating class.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; At age 19, as a college freshman, Driscoll converted to evangelical Christianity. The same year, according to Driscoll, "God spoke to me... He told me to marry Grace, preach the Bible, train men, and plant churches... I began preparing to devote my life to obey [God's] call for me."{{sfn|Driscoll|Breshears|2009|p = 152}} He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from [[Washington State University]]&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news | last = Tu| first = Janet | title = Pastor Mark packs 'em in | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/1130/cover.html | accessdate = July 11, 2010 | work=[[Seattle Times]]|date = November 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a minor in philosophy and holds a Master of Arts degree in [[exegesis|exegetical]] theology from [[Western Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://marshill.com/pastors/mark-driscoll|title = Pastor Profile: Mark Driscoll|accessdate = April 9, 2014|website = [[Mars Hill Church]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140414004847/http://marshill.com/pastors/mark-driscoll | archivedate = April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career at Mars Hill Church ==

After graduation, Mark and Grace relocated to Seattle, where they attended Antioch Bible Church and worked with that church's college ministry as volunteers. Mark was hired as an intern a few months later. Through his internship, Mark met Mike Gunn, who worked for an [[Athletes in Action]] ministry at the [[University of Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ocfchurch.com/ministries/missions/gunn|title = Mike &amp; Donna Gunn|website = OCF Church|accessdate = April 29, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140429191238/http://www.ocfchurch.com/ministries/missions/gunn|archivedate = April 29, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lief Moi, a radio show host. The three men began to discuss planting an "urban, [[Postmodern Christianity|postmodern]]" church in Seattle. Greg Kappas, the pastor responsible for Antioch Bible Church's new church planting ministry, mentored the three and helped them develop their plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marshill.fm/who/our_history.htm|title = Seasons of Grace: The Story of Mars Hill|year = 2000|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20001210191200/http://www.marshill.fm/who/our_history.htm|archivedate = December 10, 2000|website = Mars Hill Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding Mars Hill Church ===

Driscoll, Lief Moi, and Mike Gunn founded{{sfn|Driscoll|2006|p = 54}} Mars Hill Church in spring 1995 and officially launched it in fall 1996.{{sfn|Driscoll|2006|p = 38}} The church first met in the Driscolls' home. By spring 1997, the church had relocated and expanded to two services. Driscoll later reflected that he was "not ready" when he planted Mars Hill at age 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2012/01/31/10-reflections-on-the-elephant-room|title = Ten Reflections on the Elephant Room|website = |date = January 31, 2012|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|quote = I did not grow up in an evangelical church.

"And it shifted the conversation from reaching Generation X to the emerging mission of reaching postmodern culture."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Mars Hill Church and Driscoll were thrust into the national spotlight: he was interviewed on [[National Public Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Youth and Religion |series=[[All Things Considered]] |network=[[National Public Radio]] |credits=Reporter: [[Lynn Neary]] |airdate=March 1, 1999 |url=http://www.marshill.fm/who/articles/nprtranscript.htm |transcript= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418221244/http://www.marshill.fm/who/articles/nprtranscript.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'' magazine]]&lt;ref name="MoJo-1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leibovich|first=Lori|title=Generation: A look inside fundamentalism's answer to MTV: the postmodern church.|journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|issue=July–August 1998|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/07/generation|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a feature on the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Driscoll|2006|p=98}}.

In 1998, Driscoll and David Nicholas founded the Acts 29 Network ("Acts 29"), a [[church planting]] network, in response to people approaching Driscoll for advice on planting churches.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The goal of this parachurch organization was to plant 1000 new churches around the world&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; "through recruiting, assessing, training, funding, and coaching."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.acts29network.org/acts-29-blog/happy-birthday-and-happy-15th-anniversary-mark-driscoll/|title = Happy Birthday and Happy 15th Anniversary, Mark Driscoll|last = Thomas|first = Scott|website = [[Acts 29 Network]]|date = October 11, 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131112010415/http://www.acts29network.org/acts-29-blog/happy-birthday-and-happy-15th-anniversary-mark-driscoll/ | archivedate = November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts 29 started slowly under Driscoll's tenure, with 11 churches at its inception and 17 by 2003. At that point, it began to grow rapidly, reaching 50 churches by 2006 and 410 churches by 2011. The majority are still located in the U.S., with 38 churches in 16 other countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to ''Salon'', Driscoll structured Acts 29 to match his own "strict orthodoxy and views" on theology and politics, while allowing latitude in cultural specifics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Among other specifics, prospective Acts 29 church planters must be led by men.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://bitchmagazine.org/article/life-on-mars-hill|title = Life on Mars (Hill)|year = 2012|last = Sargent|first = Alison|last2 = Brown|first2 = Ryan|website = [[Bitch Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Resurgence ===
{{see also|The Resurgence (organization)}}
In 2006, Driscoll founded the Resurgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://theresurgence.com/authors/mark-driscoll|title = Mark Driscoll|website = [[The Resurgence (organization)|The Resurgence]]|accessdate = April 9, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527190410/http://theresurgence.com/authors/mark-driscoll|archivedate = May 27, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "theological cooperative" to support [[Acts 29 Network|Acts 29]] and [[Mars Hill Church]]. The Resurgence aims to train church leaders in conservative reformed theology. It has three main branches: ''Re:Lit'', a publishing house; ''Re:Train'', a missional training centre; and ''Re:Sound'', a music arm.

=== Mars Hill Church reorganization (2006–07) ===

==== Rationale ====

Driscoll, Mars Hill's first paid pastor, had been its main preaching pastor and public face since its inception. As the church grew, he began to train other elders and deacons, moving himself into a more executive role in setting vision and continuing to preach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Driscoll|first=Mark|title=10 Painful Lessons from the Early Days of Mars Hill Church|url=http://pastormark.tv/2011/12/06/10-painful-lessons-from-the-early-days-of-mars-hill-church|work=pastormark.tv|accessdate=April 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140414090209/http://pastormark.tv/2011/12/06/10-painful-lessons-from-the-early-days-of-mars-hill-church|archivedate=April 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, the church counted 4000–5000 weekly attendees at three campuses in the Seattle region.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pastor's apology defuses demonstration at church|date = December 4, 2006|last = King|first = Marsha|url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20061204&amp;slug=driscoll04m|newspaper = [[Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/why-the-mars-hill-faithful-have-started-to-question-mark/Content?oid=20257920|title = Why the Mars Hill Faithful Have Started to Question Mark: What Happened Over the Last Decade with Seattle’s Most Popular Church and Its Firebrand Pastor Mark Driscoll?|last = Kiley|first = Brendan|date = August 6, 2014|work = [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|accessdate = August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Driscoll claimed that he had reached a personal crisis due to his "overwhelming workload"—at this time he was the principal authority in Mars Hill, president of Acts 29, president of The Resurgence, an author, and an international traveler with speaking engagements. He was, by his own account, sleeping only 2–3 hours per night and began to fear that he would die early from a heart attack. Ultimately, in 2006–2007, he began to restructure the church and claimed he was going to divest power. Within Mars Hill, he publicly stated that he resigned as "legal president," president of the elder board, and chief of staff, while retaining his roles as public face and preaching pastor.{{sfn|Driscoll|Breshears|2009|pp = 152-155}}

Prior to the reorganization, Mars Hill was governed by a full council of two dozen church elders (including Driscoll) who had equal voting authority and voted on major decisions, and a five-member council of "executive elders" (also including Driscoll) who handled daily operations but deferred to the full council for major decisions. According to then-Mars Hill pastor Paul Petry, in summer 2007 Driscoll "replaced the [executive council] with yes-men" and began to make major decisions, such as purchasing a $4 million new building without consulting the full council.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

==== Proposed bylaw changes ====

In September 2007, Driscoll proposed changes to the bylaws that would grant indefinite terms of office to the "executive elders."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Firing of pastors roils Mars Hill Church|date = November 7, 2007|last = Tu|first = Janet I.|url = http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2004020898_webmarshill18m.html|newspaper = [[Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll and proponents of the changes argued that the church had outgrown its original governing structuring, while detractors contended that the changes consolidated power with Driscoll and his trusted lieutenants.&lt;ref name="Worthen" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Paul Petry and another pastor, Bent Meyer, both dissented to the changes. In response, Driscoll fired both from their jobs. In a Mars Hill forum posting, the pastors were not named, but they reported that one was fired for "displaying an unhealthy distrust in the senior leadership" and the other for "disregarding the accepted elder protocol for the bylaw deliberation period" and "verbally attacking the lead pastor [Driscoll]."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/church-or-cult/Content?oid=12172001|title = Church or Cult? The Control-Freaky Ways of Mars Hill Church|date = February 1, 2012|website = [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|last = Kiley|first = Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The morning after Petry and Meyer were fired, Driscoll said to his pastors and other church leaders at a conference: "Yesterday we fired two elders for the first time in the history of Mars Hill.... They were off mission, so now they're unemployed. This will be the defining issue as to whether or not you succeed or fail. I've read enough of the New Testament to know that occasionally [[Paul the Apostle|Paul [the Apostle]]] puts somebody in the wood chipper."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

In addition to the loss of their jobs, both were put on ecclesiastical trials to review their church membership. Petry was charged by Driscoll and the other elders with "lack of trust and respect for spiritual authority" and "improper use of confidential information",&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; the latter charge because Petry had discussed the bylaw changes with church deacon Rob Smith, who was not part of the council of elders but had been asked to join. Petry was permitted to respond to the charges, but was not allowed to attend his full trial. The elders came to a unanimous conclusion that Petry was no longer qualified to be a church elder. Driscoll urged his congregation to shun Petry's family.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/us/mark-driscoll-is-being-urged-to-leave-mars-hill-church.html|title = A Brash Style That Filled Pews, Until Followers Had Their Fill: Mark Driscoll Is Being Urged to Leave Mars Hill Church|last = Paulson|first = Michael|date = August 22, 2014|work = [[The New York Times]]|accessdate = August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worthen" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Meyer was given a "gentler" ecclesiastical trial but chose to resign. Rob Smith had written an email to the elders calling for a fair trial for Petry and Meyer; Smith said that in response, Driscoll told his congregants to stop giving to Agathos, an independent economic development charity that Smith also ran, causing donations to drop by 80 percent.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

==== Repercussions ====

Within a year of the changes, Lief Moi, co-founder of Mars Hill and a close friend of Driscoll, left Mars Hill and started a pizzeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Coming full circle|date = December 6, 2012|last = Ball|first = Linda|url = http://www.issaquahreporter.com/news/182419011.html|newspaper = [[Issaquah Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained that he was disillusioned with the bylaw changes and fallout; he felt it best to "leave quietly" rather than "add to the difficulty" that the restructuring had caused. He repudiated his past actions and met with Petry and Meyer to apologize for "not doing more to stand up for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/lief-mois-confession-2/|title = Lief Moi's Confession|date = March 29, 2014|accessdate = August 27, 2014|website = Repentant Pastor|publisher = |last = Moi|first = Lief|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140805151842/http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/lief-mois-confession-2/|archivedate = August 5, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Petry, Smith, and Moi all joined and, in some cases, organized online protests against Driscoll. Commentators linked the summer 2014 "unrest" at Mars Hill to the structural changes of 2007 along with other developments in Driscoll's career.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024380355_marshillxml.html|title = Driscoll to take break from Mars Hill pulpit|last = Broom|first = Jack|date = August 24, 2014|work = [[Seattle Times]]|accessdate = August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ABC Nightline special (2009) ===

In March 2009, Driscoll was involved in an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ''[[Nightline]] ''debate entitled, ''"Does Satan Exist?"'' Driscoll and [[Annie Lobert]], founder of the [[Hookers for Jesus]] Christian ministry, argued for the existence of the devil against [[Deepak Chopra]], philosopher, and [[Carlton Pearson]], former fundamentalist minister and author of "The Gospel of Inclusion."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A commentator described the debate as "contentious", with all participants taking "uncompromising" positions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Driscoll argued that a belief in both Satan and God was an essential tenet of Christianity. Driscoll has also been featured on the program discussing other topics including the [[Ten Commandments]] and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Ely|last2=Johnson|first2=Eric|title=''Nightline'' Face-Off: Does Satan Exist?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=7071125|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://marshill.com/media/in-the-news/nightline-satan-debate| title=Nightline Satan Debate | publisher=Mars Hill Church | date=March 26, 2009 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111017103201/http://marshill.com/media/in-the-news/nightline-satan-debate |deadurl=yes |archivedate=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti relief (2010) ===

After the catastrophic [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Driscoll and [[James MacDonald (pastor)|James MacDonald]] founded Churches Helping Churches to help churches rebuild after catastrophic natural disasters. They help to rebuild dozens of churches in Haiti and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Accomplished: Churches Helping Churches|url=http://www.harvestbible.org/10780/ministry/ministry_id/352425/Churches-Helping-Churches|work=Harvest Bible Chapel|accessdate=April 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182213/http://www.harvestbible.org/10780/ministry/ministry_id/352425/Churches-Helping-Churches|archivedate=April 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll first flew to Haiti shortly after the earthquake, and set up a partnership between his church and Jean F. E. St. Cyr, a Haitian pastor. Mars Hill Church donated $1.7&amp;nbsp;million in medical supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/19/seattle-pastor-returns-to-haiti/ |title=Seattle pastor returns to Haiti|last=Marrapodi|first=Eric|work=[[CNN]] Belief Blog|date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation from Acts 29 and The Gospel Coalition (2012) ===

On March 29, 2012, Driscoll resigned as President of Acts 29 and from the Council of The Gospel Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Driscoll Drops Acts 29 &amp; Gospel Coalition|date = March 30, 2012|last = Scaramanga|first = Url|url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/parse/2012/march/driscoll-drops-acts-29-gospel-coalition.html|journal = PARSE: Leadership Journal|publisher = Christianity Today International}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning his responsibilities over to [[Matt Chandler (pastor)|Matt Chandler]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mark Driscoll Steps Down as Leader of Acts 29; Resigns From Gospel Coalition|date = March 29, 2012|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/mark-driscoll-steps-down-as-leader-of-acts-29-resigns-from-gospel-coalition-72283/|last = Murashko|first = Alex|work = [[Christian Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the transition, Chandler said, "[the Acts 29 board was] running a network of 422 churches on six continents the same way when it was 80 to 100 churches on one continent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Murashko|first=Alex|title = No 'Vision Shift' After Mark Driscoll Leaves Acts 29 Leadership|date = April 11, 2012|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/no-vision-shift-after-mark-driscoll-leaves-acts-29-leadership-73047/|work = [[Christian Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler also planned to disentangle Acts 29 from Mars Hill Church; prior to Driscoll's departure, Acts 29 was primarily funded by Mars Hill. By mid-2014, Driscoll was no longer on the board of Acts 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.acts29network.org/about/leadership/|title = The Acts 29 Board|accessdate = April 16, 2014|website = [[Acts 29]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325113427/http://www.acts29network.org/about/leadership/ | archivedate = March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driscoll was a founding member of The Gospel Coalition, a fellowship of reformed evangelical churches. On his departure, he wrote he had no "relational conflict with anyone and no disagreement theologically"; rather, he explained that he was reorganizing his priorities and could not keep up with all of his commitments.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Driscoll indicated that he intended to devote more of his efforts to Mars Hill Church, more time to his family, and less time to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2012/03/28/what-is-next-for-me|title = What's Next for Me|date = March 28, 2012|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|website = Pastor Mark Driscoll|type = blog|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140501092421/http://pastormark.tv/2012/03/28/what-is-next-for-me|archivedate = May 1, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal charges filed by former elder Dave Kraft (2013) ===

In May 2013, now former Mars Hill elder Dave Kraft filed formal charges (under Mars Hill Church bylaws) of "mistreatment" against Mark Driscoll and other leaders at Mars Hill. He specifically accused Driscoll of being "domineering, verbally violent, arrogant, and quick-tempered." Kraft further argued that this "established pattern of... behavior" disqualified Driscoll from church leadership.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Specifically, Kraft said that Driscoll's behavior violated three different Bible passages that give the qualifications for church elders. Under Mars Hill bylaws, Driscoll is required to meet the biblical standards of a church elder. The passages are: {{bibleref2|1 Timothy|3}}, {{bibleref2|Titus|1}}, and {{bibleref2|1 Peter|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars Hill Church's Board of Advisors and Accountability responded, saying that they sent one hundred letters to former elders and staff in an effort to substantiate Kraft's charges. They received eighteen responses, which they reviewed, and determined them to be "non-disqualifying" with respect to Driscoll's leadership position. However, the Board did initiate a "reconciliation process" to address "many offenses and hurts that are still unresolved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Charges Against Mark Driscoll and Mars Hill Church Executive Elders 'Non-Disqualifying,' Says Advisory Board|date = March 27, 2014|last = Murashko|first = Alex|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/charges-against-mark-driscoll-and-mars-hill-church-executive-elders-non-disqualifying-says-advisory-board-116924/|work = [[Christian Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Kraft worked at Mars Hill from 2005 to 2013 and was Driscoll's personal "coach" during that time.&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024534198_marshillprofilexml.html|title = The rise and fall of Mars Hill Church|last = Welch|first = Craig|date = September 13, 2014|work = [[Seattle Times]]|accessdate = September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former leaders and members protest Driscoll (2014) ===

[[Michael Paulson]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that while Driscoll has endured criticism from the [[American political left]] and [[liberal Christianity]] for many years, recent years leading up to and including 2014 saw the rise of criticism from [[Evangelicalism#Diversity|conservative Christians]], including Driscoll's former "allies and supporters."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; According to the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', Janet Mefferd's plagiarism accusations were a "crucial turning point" that drew outside interest into Mars Hill's internal affairs, and prompted inquiries from new critics about the church and how it handled its finances.&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; After hearing of Mefferd's plagiarism accusations, [[evangelical Christian]] and [[Grove City College]] psychology professor [[Warren Throckmorton]] took interest and became a prominent critic of Driscoll and Mars Hill, documenting other examples of perceived plagiarism, abuse reported by former Mars Hill members, and questionable uses of church finances.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt;

==== "Repentant Pastors" ====

On March 29, 2014, four former Mars Hill elders (Kyle Firstenberg, Dave Kraft, Scott Mitchell, and co-founder Lief Moi) created a blog titled "Repentant Pastor" and posted online "confessions and apologies" related to their leadership roles in Mars Hill. In a joint statement, they wrote, "we recognize and confess that Mars Hill has hurt many people within the Mars Hill community, as well as those outside the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repentantpastor.com/|title = Home Page|date = |accessdate = May 12, 2014|website = Repentant Pastor|publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salon'' summarized the statements, writing that the former leaders emphasized their failures to "rein Driscoll in" and their complicity with Driscoll's "autocratic" management style.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Firstenberg wrote that while the church appeared to flourish, employees lived in constant stress, and "success was to be attained regardless of human and moral cost."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Firstenberg added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The reputation Driscoll got for being the cussing pastor simply because he used harsh language from the pulpit was nothing compared to the swearing and abusive language he used daily with staff. When people asked me how I liked working at Mars Hill, I would simply say, "It is a great church to attend, but I wouldn’t recommend working here." It was well known with the staff that what was preached on Sunday was not lived out Monday morning with the staff.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Lief Moi described his own behavior at Mars Hill as "driven by [[narcissism]] and anti-social tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/lief-mois-confession-2/|title = Lief Moi's Confession|date = March 29, 2014|accessdate = February 28, 2015|website = Repentant Pastor|publisher = |last = Moi|first = Lief|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140805151842/http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/lief-mois-confession-2/|archivedate = August 5, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Driscoll addresses former members' complaints ====

In a recorded message shown to church members on July 27, 2014, Driscoll discussed the various controversies of 2014. He said that he could "not address some members' discontent... because the complaints were anonymous." According to Rob Smith, former program director at the church, the anonymity assertion "really touched a nerve" with former members.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; In response, dissenters organized a [[Facebook]] group called "Dear Pastor Mark &amp; Mars Hill: We Are Not Anonymous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/former-members-protest-mars-hill-church/ngrWp/|title = Former Members Protest Mars Hill Church, Pastors rant revealed|date = July 30, 2014|work = [[KIRO-TV]]|accessdate = August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public demonstration at Mars Hill Church ====

The following Sunday, "dozens of demonstrators"&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.king5.com/news/local/Former-members-protest-Mars-Hill-pastor-269759231.html|title = Former members protest Mars Hill church pastor|last = Gibb|first = Abbey|date = August 3, 2014|work = [[King-TV]]|accessdate = August 5, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808064840/http://www.king5.com/news/local/Former-members-protest-Mars-Hill-pastor-269759231.html|archivedate = August 8, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized and picketed the Mars Hill Church Bellevue campus (where Driscoll preaches live), calling for Driscoll's resignation. Demonstrators carried placards reading "We Are Not Anonymous" and "Question Mark", and accused Driscoll of bullying, misogyny, inadequate transparency in church finances, and harsh discipline of members. Driscoll was away for his annual summer vacation. A church elder, Anthony Iannicielo, responded that the criticism of Driscoll and Mars Hill "goes with the territory" of running a large church with a long history. In a pre-recorded message, Driscoll said that he had been deliberately "rather silent" during the criticism, that he found it "a little overwhelming and a bit confusing", and indicated that he had no intention of resigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024235297_marshillprotestxml.html|title = Mars Hill protesters call for pastor's resignation|last = Mapes|first = Lynda V.|date = August 3, 2014|work = [[Seattle Times]]|accessdate = August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Removal from Acts 29 Network ====

On August 8, 2014, the board of Acts 29 removed both Driscoll and Mars Hill Church from membership. Chairman [[Matt Chandler (pastor)|Matt Chandler]] wrote, "it is our conviction that the nature of the accusations against Mark, most of which have been confirmed by him, make it untenable and unhelpful to keep Mark [Driscoll] and Mars Hill [Church] in our network."&amp;nbsp;The board of directors of Acts 29 expressed gratitude for Driscoll's work with the Network as co-founder and former President, but declared his recent actions "ungodly and disqualifying behavior." To Driscoll, they wrote, "our board and network have been the recipients of... dozens of fires directly linked to you... we are naturally associated with you and feel that this association discredits the network and is a major distraction." They further advised him to "step down from ministry for an extended time and seek help."&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acts29network.org/acts-29-blog/a-message-from-the-board-of-acts-29-concerning-mark-driscoll-and-mars-hill-church/|title = A Message from the Board of Acts 29 concerning Mark Driscoll and Mars Hill Church|date = August 8, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Acts 29|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150211134928/http://www.acts29network.org/acts-29-blog/a-message-from-the-board-of-acts-29-concerning-mark-driscoll-and-mars-hill-church/|archivedate = February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.worldmag.com/2014/08/acts_29_to_mark_driscoll_resign_and_seek_help|title = Acts 29 to Mark Driscoll: Resign and seek help: The church-planting network board calls on its co-founder to step down as pastor of Mars Hill Church|last = Smite|first = Warren Cole|date = August 8, 2014|work = [[World magazine]]|accessdate = August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts 29 had attempted to "lean on" the Mars Hill's Board of Advisors and Accountability (BOAA) to discipline Driscoll, but lost confidence in the board. The BOAA had been set up by Driscoll as his accountability board, rather than the elders of the church. (Members of the BOAA were for the most part professional clergy and businessmen who were not members of the church and hand picked by Driscoll.) The previous month, evangelical leaders and Acts 29 associates Paul Tripp and James MacDonald resigned from the BOAA. Religion correspondent [[Sarah Pulliam Bailey]] described Acts 29's decision as "unusual" since "ministries usually leave matters of church discipline up to local churches."&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/mark-driscoll-books-lifeway_n_5669700.html|title = Megapastor Mark Driscoll's Books Pulled From Major Christian Store In Wake Of Scandal|last = Bailey|first = Sarah P.|date = August 11, 2014|work = [[Huffington Post]]|accessdate = August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BOAA Chairman Michael Van Skaik responded, "Men, I told the lead pastors... that we are making real progress in addressing the serious reconciliation and unhealthy culture issues that have been part of Mars Hill Church for way too long. And we are...." He further added that Acts 29 leaders did not contact Mars Hill before acting, and that Driscoll had "changed his ways", and described Acts 29's actions as "divisive."

==== Hiatus from ministry ====

On August 24, 2014, Driscoll announced he would take a six-week "extended focus break" from his pastorship while charges against him were investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Morgan |last=Lee |title=Mark Driscoll Steps Down While Mars Hill Investigates Charges |magazine=[[Christianity Today]] |date=August 24, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/august/mark-driscoll-steps-down-while-mars-hill-investigates-charg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, a letter signed by nine current Mars Hill pastors which severely criticized Driscoll was leaked to the public. The letter, written days before Driscoll stepped down, urged him to step down from all aspects of ministry. It included a quote from "internationally recognized"&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; author, pastor and former BOAA member Paul Tripp saying, "This is without a doubt, the most abusive, coercive ministry culture I’ve ever been involved with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah Pulliam |last=Bailey |title=Pastors' letter on Mark Driscoll: Step down from all aspects of ministry and leadership |date=August 28, 2014 |accessdate=August 28, 2014 |work=[[Religion News Service]] |url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/08/28/mars-hill-pastors-letter-mark-driscoll-step-down-ministry-leadership/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pastors who signed the letter was fired five days later for "rebellion against the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Alison |last1=Morrow |first2=Alex |last2=Rozier |title=Mars Hill pastor terminated from position |url=http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/08/28/mars-hill-pastor-terminated/14767793/ |work=KING 5 News |date=August 29, 2014 |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 9, eight of the nine pastors who signed the letter had resigned or been terminated, including worship director [[Dustin Kensrue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/seismic.shift.in.mars.hill.leadership.as.three.more.pastors.step.down/40322.htm |title=Seismic shift in Mars Hill leadership as three more pastors step down |last=Lodge |first=Carey |date=September 5, 2014 |website=[[Christian Today]] |accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the nine pastors was demoted from pastor to lay elder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.christiantoday.com/article/mass.exodus.for.mars.hill.pastors.who.criticised.mark.driscolls.leadership/41415.htm|title = Mass exodus for Mars Hill pastors who criticised Mark Driscoll's leadership|date = October 8, 2014|accessdate = October 8, 2014|website = [[Christianity Today]]|publisher = |last = Lodge|first = Carey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll did not return at the end of the planned six weeks; after seven weeks, he announced his resignation.

==== Staff layoffs and closure of church branches ====
[[File:Mars Hill Church banners displayed at Daniels Recital Hall.jpg|thumb|Mars Hill Church's downtown Seattle campus, one of the first locations to close prior to Driscoll's resignation. The building is the historic [[Daniels Recital Hall]], a former Methodist Episcopal church.]]
On September 7, 2014 (the second week of Driscoll's hiatus), Mars Hill officials, citing "financial pressures in the wake of recent negative media attention", announced layoffs and closures of a few church branches. Weekly attendance at the start of the year for all branches was 12,000–13,000, but had dropped to 8,000–9,000. Donations also had a "steep decline." In response, the church planned to lay off "30 to 40 percent" of their 100 paid staff members, and close their downtown Seattle branch and [[University District, Seattle|University District]] branch, consolidating both congregations into the [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]] location. Two other branches outside Washington state were marked for possible closure if their finances did not improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024485113_marshillxml.html|title = More trouble for Mars Hill: cutting jobs, merging churches|last = Welch|first = Craig|date = September 7, 2014|work = [[Seattle Times]]|accessdate = September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars Hill also announced the resignation of Sutton Turner, executive elder since 2011, effective at the end of September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://marshill.com/2014/09/19/the-weekly-9-19-14|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;The Weekly | 9.19.14: Update from the BoAA&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date = September 19, 2014|accessdate = September 19, 2014|website = Mars Hill Church|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141020065942/https://marshill.com/2014/09/19/the-weekly-9-19-14|archivedate = October 20, 2014|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other repercussions ====

[[LifeWay Christian Resources]], a Christian bookseller and publishing arm of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], announced on August 10, 2014 that they suspended sales of Driscoll's books. Marty King, communications director for LifeWay, said, "[we] are not selling Mark Driscoll's books while we assess the situation regarding his ministry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/august/lifeway-stops-selling-mark-driscolls-books-at-180-christian.html|title = LifeWay Stops Selling Mark Driscoll's Books at 180 Christian Stores|last = Moon|first = Ruth|date = August 10, 2014|work = [[Christianity Today]]: Gleanings|accessdate = August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; King identified Acts 29's call for Driscoll to step down as "certainly a part" of their decision, along with the "cumulative effect" of other allegations against Driscoll.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

Driscoll was removed from the speaker roster of several planned ''Act Like Men ''conferences, which includes other Acts 29 speakers and past Driscoll associates, including James MacDonald and Matt Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/08/12/driscoll-disappears-from-agenda-of-act-like-men-conferences/|title = Driscoll disappears from agenda of Act Like Men conferences|last = Connelly|first = Joel|date = August 12, 2014|work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate = August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also removed as closing speaker at the [[Gateway Church Conference]], an annual gathering of thousands of evangelical pastors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/08/15/mark-driscoll-removed-as-closing-speaker-at-big-church-conference/#25601101=0|title = Mark Driscoll removed as closing speaker at big church conference|last = Connelly|first = Joel|date = August 15, 2014|work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate = August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars Hill Church also cancelled their own Resurgence 2014 conference, planned for October 2014, since several planned speakers had cut ties with Driscoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/mars-hill-cancels-annual-resurgence-conference-amid-controversy-surrounding-mark-driscoll-124878/|title = Mars Hill Cancels Annual Resurgence Conference Amid Controversy Surrounding Mark Driscoll|last = Martinez|first = Jessica|date = August 15, 2014|work = [[Christian Post]]|accessdate = August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation from Mars Hill Church ===

In the fall of 2014, a group of elders released a report on an investigation into accusations of bullying and intimidating behavior by Driscoll made by 21 former church elders. The investigation involved "some 1,000 hours of research, interviewing more than 50 people and preparing 200 pages of information." The report concluded that Driscoll had never been charged with "immorality, illegality or heresy," and considered "some of the accusations against Pastor Mark to be altogether unfair or untrue." Additionally, the report found that many of the "other charges had previously been addressed by Pastor Mark, privately and publicly. Indeed, he had publicly confessed and apologized for a number of the charges against him, some of which occurred as long as 14 years ago."&lt;ref name="Pastor Mark Driscoll's Resignation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marshillsbus.com/2014/10/15/pastor-mark-driscolls-resignation| title= Pastor Mark Driscoll's Resignation|accessdate=14 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, elders did find "bullying" and "patterns of persistent sinful behavior" by Driscoll.&lt;ref name="Driscoll quit"&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/10/19/the-pastors-persistent-sinful-behavior-why-driscoll-quit-mars-hill/|title =The pastor’s "persistent sinful behavior": Why Driscoll quit Mars Hill|last = Connelly|first = Joel|date = Oct 19, 2014|work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate = Oct 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board also concluded that Driscoll had "been guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner", but was not charged with anything immoral or illegal. Driscoll maintained that he had not disqualified himself from ministry.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

Church leadership crafted a "restoration" plan to help Driscoll and save the church. Instead, Driscoll declined the restoration plan and resigned on October 14, 2014,&lt;ref name="Driscoll quit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; citing concerns for his health and safety.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His resignation came as a "surprise" to the church's Board of Overseers, who said in a statement that they had not asked Driscoll for his resignation.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/october/goodbye-mars-hill-multisite-church-dissolve-mark-driscoll.html|title = Goodbye, Mars Hill: Mark Driscoll's Multisite Empire Will Sell Properties and Dissolve|date = October 31, 2014|accessdate = November 8, 2014|website = [[Christianity Today]]|publisher = |last = Lee|first = Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist Ruth Graham wrote that "there was no single disgrace or crime that brought Driscoll down. Instead, it was a series of accusations: of plagiarism, crudeness, a bullying management style, unseemly consolidation of power, and squishy book-promotion ethics, to name a few."&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; Theology professor Anthony Bradley remarked that while denominational churches have continuity after the departure of prominent leaders, Mars Hill Church was nondenominational and largely built on Driscoll's personal charisma.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

On October 20, 2014, six days after his resignation, Driscoll, at the invitation of mega-church leader, Robert Morris, spoke at Morris's Gateway Conference saying that, leading up to his resignation, he and his family were harassed and he had received death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/10/21/mark-driscoll-back-offers-spontaneous-address/|title=Mark Driscoll speaks for first time after resigning Seattle megachurch|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll subsequently appeared at other conferences and churches.

Driscoll has been described as a "gifted orator" and "charismatic leader."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; People call him a very compelling speaker, "gifted" and "dynamic and funny, with a potent mix of reverence for Jesus and irreverence for everything else."&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; His public speaking style, he says, is influenced by stand-up comedians like [[Chris Rock]].{{Sfn | Driscoll | 2006 |p = 70}} [[Crosscut.com]] described his presentation style as follows: "Pacing the stage at the main Ballard campus, he delivered a sermon on marriage roles as he saw them set forth in the [[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]. He told stories from his own marriage, offered statistics, and dropped jokes without their feeling forced. Every few minutes he would sniff in a thoughtful, practiced sort of way. This untucked, down-to-earth demeanor was the opposite of a huckster televangelist, but polished in its own way. It makes the guy easy to listen to."&lt;ref name="Hiskes2"&gt;{{cite web |last = Hiskes|first = Jonathan|url = http://crosscut.com/2008/10/30/religion/18602/|title = Evangelism meets Seattle: the view from Mars Hill|date = November 30, 2008|accessdate = April 10, 2014|work = [[Crosscut.com|Crosscut]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Wall, a professor at Seattle Pacific University, links the success of Mars Hill Church to Mark Driscoll's direct answers to complicated spiritual questions: "His style of public rhetoric is very authoritative. Whether it's about the Bible, or about culture, he is very clear and definitive."&lt;ref name="BNT12"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ballardnewstribune.com/articles/2008/07/14/news/local_news/news03.txt|title = Mars Hill Church one of nation's fastest growing|date = July 14, 2008|first = Rose|last = Egge|publisher = Ballard News-Tribune|accessdate = October 4, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803000401/http://www.ballardnewstribune.com/articles/2008/07/14/news/local_news/news03.txt|archivedate = August 3, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' called Driscoll "one of the most admired—and reviled—figures among evangelicals nationwide."&lt;ref name="Worthen" /&gt; In 2011, ''Preaching'' magazine named him one of the 25 most influential [English-speaking] pastors of the past 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.preaching.com/resources/articles/11629162/page-5/|title = The 25 Most Influential Pastors of the Past 25 Years|accessdate = April 9, 2014|last = Duduit|first = Michael|website = Preaching|publisher = [[Salem Publishing]]|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Forbes]] called Driscoll "one of the nation’s most prominent and celebrated pastors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/09/16/mars-hill-cautionary-tales-from-the-enron-of-american-churches/|title = Mars Hill: Cautionary Tales From The Enron Of American Churches|last = Asghar|first = Rob|date = September 16, 2014|work = [[Forbes]]|accessdate = September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driscoll is described in a 2014 profile by ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' as being the center of a [[cult of personality]], and of using controversy to increase his visibility.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; ''Salon'' has also described "[sex] talk fused with God talk, or titillation more broadly, [as] a key component of the Driscoll brand," adding: "Driscoll’s stage persona at times has included tight jeans and an extra button open on the shirt. He once greeted a crowd at the University of Washington by reporting that he had gotten his genitals caught in his zipper before the show and that he would be stopping on time because his wife was at home waiting for him with a cream pie".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

On July 30, 2014, dissenters released a "controversial, vulgar"&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; rant Driscoll had written under the pseudonym "William Wallace II" in 2000, dubbed the "Pussified Nation" rant.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://komonews.com/archive/mars-hill-dissenters-plan-protest-release-vulgar-driscoll-rant|title = Mars Hill: Dissenters plan protest, release vulgar Driscoll rant|last = Connelly|first = Joel|date = July 30, 2014|work = [[Komo News]] / [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate = July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rant contained "blunt and emotional comments critical of feminism, homosexual behavior, and 'sensitive emasculated' men", and called for "real men" to rise up in the spirit of Scottish warrior [[William Wallace]] as depicted in the film ''[[Braveheart]]''.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Mars Hill Church had long since deleted their unmoderated "Midrash" discussion board where the forum postings occurred.

More allegations of plagiarism in other Driscoll works soon surfaced,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; including passages from a sermon series companion text, ''Trial: 8 Witnesses From 1&amp;2 Peter'', which were copied verbatim from passages written by David Wheaton in the ''New Bible Commentary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Merritt |first=Jonathan |title=More allegations of plagiarism surface against Mark Driscoll |website=[[Religion News Service]] |url=http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/2013/11/27/mark-driscoll-silent-amid-mounting-allegations-of-plagiarism/ |date=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tracy"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tracy |first=Kate |date=December 9, 2013 |title=Publisher: Mark Driscoll Improperly Copied Paragraphs from Bible Commentary |website=[[Christianity Today]] |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2013/december/parsing-mark-driscoll-plagiarism-janet-mefferd-apologizes.html |accessdate= December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[InterVarsity Press]], publisher of the ''New Bible Commentary'', stated that Driscoll failed to properly provide quotation or attribution for the material.&lt;ref name="tracy" /&gt; The relevant passages were posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mefferd |first=Janet |title=Page scans of allegedly plagiarized material compared to alleged sources |website=The Janet Mefferd Show |url=http://www.janetmefferd.com/wp-content/uploads/MATERIAL-SCREENSHOTS-HERE.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203032816/http://www.janetmefferd.com/wp-content/uploads/MATERIAL-SCREENSHOTS-HERE.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations soon expanded to include claims that Driscoll used ghostwriters and researchers without giving them proper attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/mark-driscoll-remains-silent-as-circle-of-plagiarism-accusations-now-includes-questions-on-ghostwriting-john-piper-chimes-in-on-twitter-110596/|title = Mark Driscoll Remains Silent as Circle of Plagiarism Accusations Now Includes Questions on Ghostwriting; John Piper Chimes In on Twitter|date = December 12, 2013|website = [[The Christian Post]]|last = Murashko|first = Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/december-web-only/real-problem-with-mark-driscolls-citation-errors.html?start=1|title = The Real Problem with Mark Driscoll's 'Citation Errors'|date = December 10, 2013|accessdate = |website = [[Christianity Today]]|publisher = |last = Crouch|first = Andy|quote = No human being could do what "Pastor Mark Driscoll" does—[his] celebrity is actually a complex creation of a whole community of people who sustain the illusion of an impossibly productive, knowledgeable, omnicompetent superhuman.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2013, neither Peter Jones, D.A.

Syndicator Salem Radio subsequently removed both the broadcast interview with Driscoll and associated materials from Mefferd's program website and apologized for raising the matter in a broadcast interview.

Driscoll had used the apparent success of ''Real Marriage'' to negotiate a multi-book deal with Christian publisher Tyndale House. The first book under Driscoll's "Resurgence" [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] was ''A Call to Resurgence,'' with plans to publish five to seven books per year. Tyndale House defended Driscoll's alleged plagiarism in ''A Call to Resurgence'', and affirmed their continuing relationship with Driscoll.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Mars Hill Church responded with a statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Note From Our Board of Advisors &amp; Accountability|url=http://marshill.com/2014/03/07/a-note-from-our-board-of-advisors-accountability|publisher=[[Mars Hill Church]]|accessdate=April 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411044436/http://marshill.com/2014/03/07/a-note-from-our-board-of-advisors-accountability|archivedate=April 11, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing, "while not uncommon or illegal, this unwise strategy [of buying one's own books to drive up book sales figures] is not one we had used before or since, and not one we will use again." Mars Hill also claimed that the "true cost" of the effort was less than "what has been reported."&lt;ref name="CT-Tracy" /&gt;

On March 17, 2014, Driscoll posted an open letter of apology in response to this controversy and others, writing that he will no longer claim to be a ''New York Times'' bestselling author, and that he now sees the ResultSource marketing campaign as "manipulating a book sales reporting system, which is wrong."&lt;ref name="CT-Webet-Retracts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Jeremy|title=Mark Driscoll Retracts Bestseller Book Status, Resets Life|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/march/mark-driscoll-retracts-bestseller-status-resets-life.html|accessdate=April 15, 2014|newspaper=[[Christianity Today]]|date=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that he was giving up his status as a "celebrity pastor", that he considered his "angry young prophet" days to be over, and that he was reducing his public presence in speaking engagements and on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 17, 2014|title=Mark Driscoll Posts an Open Letter of Apology |website=[[Relevant (magazine)|Relevant]] |url=http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/church/mark-driscoll-posts-open-letter-apology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2015, Sutton Turner, a former elder of the church who signed the Result Source contract, explained that he disapproved of the marketing plan to use Result Source, but the decision to use it had already been made before he began work at Mars Hill, so he signed the contract anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.christiantoday.com/article/former.mars.hill.elder.gives.inside.story.of.controversial.plan.to.boost.mark.driscolls.book.sales/52669.htm|title = Former Mars Hill elder gives inside story of controversial plan to boost Mark Driscoll's book sales|date = April 23, 2015|website = Christianity Today|last = Woods|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planned appearance at Hillsong Conference 2015 ===

Driscoll was scheduled to appear at [[Hillsong Church]]'s 2015 Australian and UK conferences.

=== Calvinism ===

Driscoll adheres to [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] or [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theology, although he characterizes his position specifically as [[New Calvinism]] to differentiate himself from the more [[cessationist]] and non-[[Missional living|missional]] aspects associated historically with Calvinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://theresurgence.com/2009/03/12/time-magazine-names-new-calvinism-3rd-most-powerful-idea|title = ''TIME'' magazine names New Calvinism 3rd most powerful idea|last = Driscoll|website = [[The Resurgence (organization)|The Resurgence]]|first = Mark|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121113162916/http://theresurgence.com/2009/03/12/time-magazine-names-new-calvinism-3rd-most-powerful-idea|archivedate = November 13, 2012|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/julyweb-only/127-52.0.html?paging=off|title = Men Are from Mars Hill|last = Bailey|first = Jason|date = July 4, 2006|website = [[Christianity Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll denies the orthodox [[Calvinist]] view of [[Limited Atonement|limited atonement]] and believes instead that Jesus died for ''all people'' in some sense, and for ''some people'' (the elect) in another sense.&lt;ref name="Unlimited-Limited Atonement"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:URkA9lL6Tu0J:assets.marshillchurch.org/media/2005/11/20/20051120_unlimited-limited-atonement_document.pdf+Driscoll+limited+unlimited+atonement&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShEzho9WbrCsLn2bmtfGUNC7Dm3cmF3AoMPvieBF7ZKsMDhH8yCz3sMJdRAoc46le5tDJN965Wj-hIUchNJuh7b71hwbKynsISVAgCxYk0hlZVKykleFQLf3fKRNXIHM0E1iLjc&amp;sig=AHIEtbTyZCUbz0lPliwePg83Too9J-FjkQ | title = Unlimited-Limited Atonement | type = sermon notes | date = November 20, 2005 | last = Driscoll | first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unlimited Atonement audio"&gt;{{cite AV media | last = Driscoll | first = Mark | url = http://www.marshillchurch.org/Audio/Atonement8_Driscoll_112005.mp3 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200843/http://www.marshillchurch.org/Audio/Atonement8_Driscoll_112005.mp3 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | title = Unlimited-Limited Atonement | type = audio | format = [[MP3]] | at = 44–50 min }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thinks this position was what [[John Calvin]] believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin...

Driscoll distinguishes between [[Predestination (Calvinism)|double and single predestination]], and says that unlike [[John Calvin]], he believes only in single predestination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | publisher = [[Mars Hill Church]] | url = http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/religionsaves | chapter = Part 3 | type = sermon | title = Predestination | minutes = 8 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090721151116/http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/religionsaves | archivedate = July 21, 2009 | df = mdy-all }} through the sermon he talks briefly about this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Driscoll was associated with the [[emerging church]] movement. He described the movement as follows:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Driscoll|2006|p=22}}. ''Cited in''
{{Cite journal|title = Perspicuity of Scripture: The Emergent Approach|journal = [[Master's Seminary|Master's Seminary Journal]]|volume = 17|issue = 2|last = MacArthur|first = John F.|authorlink = John F. MacArthur|year = 2006|url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj17g.pdf|issn = 1066-3959|pages = 12–13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624213346/http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj17g.pdf|archivedate = June 24, 2010|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The emerging church is a growing, loosely connected movement of primarily young pastors who are glad to see the end of modernity and are seeking to function as missionaries who bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to emerging and postmodern cultures. The emerging church welcomes the tension of holding in one closed hand the unchanging truth of evangelical Christian theology ({{bibleref2|Jude 3}}) and holding in one open hand the many cultural ways of showing and speaking Christian truth as a missionary to America ({{bibleref2|1 Cor|9:19–23}}). Since the movement, if it can be called that, is young and is still defining its theological center, I do not want to portray the movement as ideologically unified because I myself swim in the theologically conservative stream of the emerging church.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Driscoll later distanced himself from the movement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Driscoll | first = Mark | title = Welcome | url = http://theresurgence.com/?q=node/5 | accessdate = July 11, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085722/http://theresurgence.com/?q=node%2F5 | archivedate = May 24, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the [[emerging church]] and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like [[Brian McLaren]] and [[Doug Pagitt]] began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to [[Gender of God in Christianity|God as a chick]], questioning [[Attributes of God in Christianity#Sovereignty|God's sovereignty]] over and [[open theism|knowledge of the future]], denial of the [[substitutionary atonement]] at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of [[hell]] which is one hell of a mistake.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Gender roles ===

On gender roles, Driscoll is a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]], believing that men and women have equal worth, but have different roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to a ''Mother Jones'' profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held [[Christian egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views at one time. He offered church courses in "evangelical feminism" and is quoted as saying "the Bible is clear that men and women are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way."&lt;ref name="MoJo-1998" /&gt; In 2003, Driscoll said that he wished he could change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Male leadership of the church is crucial, according to Driscoll, who believes that God called him specifically to "train men." He traces many modern spiritual and social problems to the acceptance of female leadership. Driscoll describes Eve's temptation by the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] as "the first invitation to an independent feminism." For Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was, according to Driscoll, "the first exercising of a woman's role in leadership in the home and in the church in the history of the world. It does not go well."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Driscoll believes that Christianity has been "feminized." In a 2006 interview with ''Desiring God'', he said, "The problem with the church today, it's just a bunch of nice, soft, tender, 'chickified' [''sic''] church boys. Sixty percent of Christians are chicks, and the forty percent that are dudes are still sort of chicks.... The whole architecture and the whole aesthetic [of church buildings and services] is really feminine."&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite video| people = Mark Driscoll (interviewee), Josh Brage (contributor)| title = Church Needs Dudes| accessdate = May 5, 2005| date = April 14, 2006 | time = 120 seconds| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lex6orNNzTs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Driscoll emphasizes what he perceives as macho behavior in the actions of biblical protagonists: he describes [[Jesus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], and [[David|King David]] saying: "... these guys were dudes. Heterosexual, win-a-fight, punch-you-in-the-nose, dudes."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; He believes that in order to be innovative, the church needs to get entrepreneurial young men involved, who will "make the culture of the future."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Driscoll interprets the Apostle Paul as writing that women are encouraged to be an active part of life and ministry in the church, but that only men can teach other men or become "[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]-pastors" (the terms being synonymous). Since Paul's prohibition of female elder-pastors appeals to the Genesis creation story ({{bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:14}}) for its rationale, Driscoll argues that the restriction is permanent and cannot be adjusted for changing culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|title = FAQ: Women and Ministry|date = September 20, 2011|accessdate = August 1, 2014|website = pastormark.tv|publisher = |last = Driscoll|first = Mark|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140806213738/http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|archivedate = August 6, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] elected [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as its first female [[Presiding Bishop]], Driscoll wrote on his blog that "if Christian males do not man up soon, the Episcopalians may vote a fluffy baby bunny rabbit as their next bishop to lead God's men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Connelly| first = Joel| title = New bishop brings wit to the job| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = September 4, 2007| accessdate = May 5, 2014| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/connelly/article/New-bishop-brings-wit-to-the-job-1248678.php#src=fb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexuality ===

{{main|Real Marriage}}
According to Salon.com, "Driscoll has been a key advocate for candid conversations about sexuality among conservative Christians".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Mark and Grace Driscoll published their first book together, entitled ''Real Marriage: The Truth About Sex, Friendship &amp; Life Together'', in January 2012. It includes a chapter entitled "Can We&amp;nbsp;___?", discussing a biblical rationale for specific sexual acts&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; that evangelical pastors are considered reluctant to discuss.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mark Driscoll's 'Real Marriage' Draws Controversy for 'Invasive' Sex Talk|date = January 9, 2012|last = Mohammed|first = Ravelle|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/mark-driscolls-real-marriage-draws-controversy-for-invasive-sex-talk-66609/|work = [[Christian Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll said that the book was written because "only two [Christian] books go into depth on sexuality... a lot of Christian teaching about sex is answering questions of a previous generation."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/januaryweb-only/mark-driscoll-sex-marriage.html|title = Q &amp; A: Mark and Grace Driscoll on Sex for the 21st-Century Christian|date = January 5, 2012|website = [[Christianity Today]]|last = Beaty|first = Katelyn|last2 = Graves|first2 = Marlena}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Driscolls and Mars Hill Church heavily promoted the book, taking interviews with ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'', and ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2012/03/16/the-new-york-media-tour|title = The New York Media Tour|website = Pastor Mark Driscoll|date = March 16, 2012|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|type = blog|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140501092900/http://pastormark.tv/2012/03/16/the-new-york-media-tour|archivedate = May 1, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Beast]]'' described the book as controversial, writing that "evangelicals of all stripes [were] outraged... from conservatives shocked by the graphic sex descriptions to liberals who hate its degrading of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mark Driscoll’s Sex Manual ‘Real Marriage’ Scandalizes Evangelicals|date = January 13, 2012|last = Sessions|first = David|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/13/mark-driscoll-s-sex-manual-real-marriage-scandalizes-evangelicals.html|work = [[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', the book "gives a green light to a range of sexual taboos such as anal sex and using sex toys", thereby taking aim at conservative religious views on sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Evangelical pastor under fire from Christians over sexually-explicit guide to marriage|date = January 10, 2012|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2084815/Evangelical-pastor-Christians-sexually-explicit-guide-marriage.html#ixzz30S1SJWFz|last = Dumas|first = Daisy|newspaper = [[The Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian author and blogger [[Rachel Held Evans]] wrote, "Grace [Driscoll] is often cast as the damaged and sinful wife who withholds sex from her deserving husband, Mark the hero who is justified in leaving his wife but instead comes along to rescue her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/mark-driscoll-real-marriage|title = Driscoll, "Real Marriage," and Why Being a Pastor Doesn’t Automatically Make You a Sex Therapist|date = January 3, 2012|last = Evans|first = Rachel Held|authorlink = Rachel Held Evans|type = blog}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll responded to criticism in a post to CNN's ''Belief Blog'', writing: "You try to write a book on marriage and sex with your wife and next thing you know there are a lot of ants crashing your picnic." He wrote that he and Grace anticipated criticism "from all sides" but felt it would be worthwhile anyway, because "we want to help marriages and single people aspiring to marry...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/24/my-take-why-christians-are-criticizing-my-christian-marriage-and-sex-book/|title = My take: Why Christians are criticizing my Christian marriage and sex book|website = [[CNN]] Belief Blog|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|date = January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 sermon he preached in Edinburgh, Scotland, Driscoll asserted that Song of Solomon 2:3 refers to oral intercourse and added, "‘Men, I am glad to report to you that oral sex is biblical.... The wife performing oral sex on the husband is biblical... Ladies, your husbands appreciate oral sex. They do.

{{Penance and Reconciliation}}
'''''Misericordia Dei''''' (''Mercy of God'') is the title of an [[apostolic letter]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] to foster and reemphasize the importance of the ''[[Sacrament of Reconciliation]]''. The letter is subtitled "''On Certain Aspects of the Sacrament of Penance''" and was promulgated on 7 April 2002 in  [[Rome]], issued as [[Motu proprio]] and was signed by him.&lt;ref&gt;''OSV's encyclopedia of Catholic history'' by Matthew Bunson 2004 {{ISBN|1-59276-026-0}} page 509&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''John Paul II: a light for the world'' by Mary Ann Walsh 2003 {{ISBN|1-58051-142-2}} page 242&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter begins by quoting the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|1:21|NIV}} that [[Jesus]] was born to "save his people from their sins" and emphasizes the fervent and energetic summons with which [[John the Baptist]] called for repentance. Quoting the [[Epistle to the Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|8:21|NIV}}, it states that "Salvation is therefore and above all redemption from sin, which hinders friendship with God." 

The letter emphasizes that Jesus himself granted the Apostles, through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], the authority to reconcile repentant sinners with God and the Church and quotes the [[Gospel of John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|20:22-23|NIV}}: “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained”.

The letter states that the [[Sacrament of Reconciliation]] entails not only the action of the minister – only a Bishop or priest, who judges and absolves, tends and heals in the name of Christ – but also the actions of the penitent: contrition, confession and satisfaction. The letter emphasizes the need for penitents to "name their own sins", except when this is not possible.

As in the year 2000 letter [[Novo Millennio Ineunte]] John Paul II again asked the clergy for "renewed pastoral courage in ensuring that the day-to-day teaching of Christian communities persuasively and effectively presents the practice of the Sacrament of Reconciliation".

'''Neo-Vedanta''', also called '''Hindu modernism''',{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} '''neo-Hinduism''',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} '''Global Hinduism'''{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} and '''Hindu Universalism''',&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; are terms to characterize interpretations of [[Hinduism]] that developed in the 19th century. Some scholars argue that these modern interpretations incorporate western ideas{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} into traditional Indian religions, especially [[Advaita Vedanta]], which is asserted as central or fundamental to [[Hindu culture]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

The term "Neo-Vedanta" was coined by Paul Hacker, in a somewhat pejorative way, to disntinguish modern developments from "traditional" Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Madaio|2017}} Other scholars have pointed out that a '''Greater Advaita Vedānta'''{{sfn|Madaio|2017}}{{refn|group=note|Madaio refers to Allen, Michael S. 2013. The Ocean of Inquiry: A Neglected Classic of Late Advaita Vedānta. Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.}} developed since medieaval times, in the Muslim period of India, when Hindus responded to Muslim rule and domination.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} When Muslim rule was replaced by British rule, Hindu religious and political leaders and thinkers responded to this western [[colonialism]] and [[orientalism]], contributing to the [[Indian freedom struggle]] and the modern national and religious identity of [[Hindu]]s in the [[Republic of India]]. This societal aspect is covered under the term of [[Hindu reform movements]].

Among the main proponents of such modern interpretations of Hinduism were [[Vivekananda]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], who to some extent also contributed to the emergence of [[Neo-Hindu movements in the West]].

Neo-Vedanta has been influential in the perception of Hinduism, both in the west and in the higher educated classes in India. It has received appraisal for its "solution of synthesis",{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}} but has also been criticised for its Universalism. The terms "Neo-Hindu" or "Neo-Vedanta" themselves have also been criticised for its polemical usage, the prefix "Neo-" then intended to imply that these modern interpretations of Hinduism are "inauthentic" or in other ways problematic.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=587}}

==Definition and etymology==
According to Halbfass, the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" refer to "the adoption of Western concepts and standards and the readiness to reinterpret traditional ideas in light of these new, imported and imposed modes of thought".{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} Promiment in Neo-Vedanta is Vivekananda, who's theology, according to Madaio, is often characterised in earlier scholarship as "a rupture from 'traditional' or 'classical' Hindusim, particularly the 'orthodox' Advaita Vedanta of the eight century Samkara."{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=2}}

The term "Neo-Vedanta" appears to have arisen in Bengal in the 19th century, where it was used by both Indians and Europeans.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} According to [[Wilhelm Halbfass|Halbfass]] the term was invented by a Bengali, [[Brajendra Nath Seal]] (1864–1938), who used the term to characterise the literary work of [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] (1838–1894).{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}}

The term "neo-Vedanta" was used by Christian missionaries as well as Hindu traditionalists to criticize the emerging ideas of the [[Brahmo Samaj]], a critical usage whose "polemical undertone [...] is obvious".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9,21(n33)}}

The term "neo-Hinduism" was used by a Jesuit scholar resident in India, [[Robert Antoine]] (1914–1981), from whom it was borrowed by Paul Hacker, who used it to demarcate these modernist ideas from "surviving traditional Hinduism,"{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} and treating the Neo-Advaitins as "dialogue partners with a broken identity who cannot truly and authentically speak for themselves and for the Indian tradition".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}} Hacker made a distinction between "Neo-Vedanta" and "neo-Hinduism",{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} seeing nationalism as a prime concern of "neo-Hinduism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}}

==History==
Although neo-Vedanta proper developed in the 19th century in response to western colonialism, it has got deeper origins in the Muslim period of India.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

===Islamic rule – Unifying Hinduism===
{{main article|Unifying Hinduism}}
With the onset of Islamic rule, hierarchical classifications of the various orthodox schools were developed to defend Hinduism against Islamic influences.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} According to Nicholson, already between the twelfth and the sixteenth century,
{{quote|... certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}}}

The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions"  has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24-33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26-27}} Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term "Hinduism" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}

Within these so-called ''[[Doxology|doxologies]]'' Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} [[Vijnanabhiksu]], a 16th-century philosopher and writer, is still an influential representant of these doxologies. He's been a prime influence on 19th century Hindu modernists like Vivekananda, who also tried to integrate various strands of Hindu thought, taking Advaita Vedanta as its most representative specimen.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

===Western colonialism and Hindu reform movements===
{{See also|Orientalism|Hindu nationalism|Hindu reform movements}}

====Western colonialism====
With the colonisation of India by the British, a darker era in the history of India began. Prior to this, Muslim rule over North India had had a drastic effect on [[Hinduism]] (and [[Buddhism]]) through systematic [[Persecution of Hindus#Persecution by Muslim Rulers|persecution]]. While the Indian society was greatly impacted, its [[Economic history of India|economy]] however continued to remain one of the largest in the World.{{sfn|Maddison|2006}} Muslim rule over Southern India was also relatively short-lived before the 17th century. In contrast to the Muslim rulers, the British actively engaged in destroying the Indian economy as well.{{sfn|Maddison|2006}}{{sfn|Dharampal|1971}} The economic destruction wrought by restrictive British policies and [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial revolution]] in Europe, led to the dismantling of the prevailing decentralized education systems in India in the 18th century.{{sfn|Dharampal|1971}} The British state-supported education system, after the [[English Education Act 1835|English Education Act]] of 1835, emphasized western religions and thoughts at the cost of indigenous ones.

The British also nurtured and were involved, post 1813, in the aggressive propagation of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002}} This was concomitant with the British [[Political warfare in British colonial India|propaganda]] machine's involvement in the spreading [[Anti-Indian sentiment#Colonialists|anti-Hindu]] sentiments.

====Hindu reform movements====
In response to the British rule and cultural dominance, [[Hindu reform movements]] developed,{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} propagating societal and religious reforms, exemplifying what [[Percival Spear]] has called
{{quote|... the 'solution of synthesis'—the effort to adapt to the newcomers, in the process of which innovation and assimilation gradually occur, alongside an ongoing agenda to preserve the unique values of the many traditions of Hinduism (and other religious traditions as well).{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=319-320}}{{refn|group=note|[[Percival Spear]] (1958), ''India, Pakistan and the West'', pp 177–91. In :{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=319-320}} "Spear develops a typology of behavioral responses that appeared among the people of India with the coming of the British. This typology is to some degree still relevant for formulating how Indic religion and philosophy may begin to play an innovative role in the intellectual discourses
of our time. Spear identifies five types of distinctive responses:
# a "military" or openly hostile response—taking up arms against the intruders;
# a "reactionary" response—the attempt to reconstitute the older political order, for example, the North Indian Rebellion (formerly called the "mutiny") in 1857–58;
# a "westernizing" response—assimilating to the new values;
# an "orthodox" response—maintenance of the older religion with appropriate reform; and
# the "solution of synthesis"—the effort to adapt to the newcomers, in the process of which innovation and assimilation gradually occur, alongside an ongoing agenda to preserve the unique values of the many traditions of Hinduism (and other religious traditions as well)."}}}}

Neo-Vedanta, also called "neo-Hinduism"{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a central theme in these reform-movements.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} The earliest of these reform-movements was Ram Mohan Roy's [[Brahmo Samaj]], who strived toward a purified and monotheistic Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005}}

==Major proponents==
Neo-vedanta's main proponents are the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj, especially [[Ram Mohan Roy]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=190-192}} while [[Vivekananda]], [[Gandhi]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] are the main proponents of neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}}

===Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj===
{{Main article|Ram Mohan Roy|Brahmo Samaj|Brahmoism}}

The Brahmo Samaj was the first of the 19th century reform movements. Its founder, Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), strived toward an [[Universalism|universalistic]] interpretation of Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} He rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} He founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=7-8}} By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=15}} but after Roy's death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268-269}} who strived towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} The Unitarians were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}}

Rammohan Roy's ideas were "altered ... considerably" by [[Debendranath Tagore]], who had a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the ''Vedas''.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46-47}} Tagore also brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} Sen was influencded by [[Transcendentalism]], an American philosophical-religious movement stringly connected with Unitarianism, which emphasized personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen strived to "an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality", introducing "lay systems of spiritual practice" which can be regarded as proto-types of the kind of Yoga-exercises which Vivekananda populurized in the west.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=49}}

The theology of the Brahmo Samaj was called "neo-Vedanta" by Christian commentators,{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} who "partly admired [the Brahmos] for their courage in abandoning traditions of polytheism and image worship, but whom they also scorned for having proffered to other Hindus a viable alternative to conversion".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} Critics accused classical Vedanta of being "cosmic self-infatuation" and "ethical nihilism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} Brahmo Samaj leaders responded to such attacks by redefining the Hindu path to liberation, making the Hindu path available to both genders and all castes,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} incorporating "notions of democracy and worldly improvement".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=193}}

===Vivekananda (1863–1902)===
{{Main article|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

According to Gavin Flood, Vivekananda (1863–1902){{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} (Narendranath Dutta) "is a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} He played a major role in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].{{refn|group=note|His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta".{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

In 1880 Vivekananda joined [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]'s ''[[Nava Vidhan]]'', which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Narendranath (a.k.a. Narendra) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge "at some point before 1884"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshub Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}}{{sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}}{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=20}} From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's [[Band of Hope]], which tried to discourage the youth from smoking and drinking.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of [[idolatry]],{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=29}} and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the ''Upanisads'' and of the Vedanta".{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} He propagated the idea that "the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that "seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}}

During this period, he came in contact with [[Ramakrishna]], who eventually became his guru, and fitted into his broadening views on spirituality and liberation.

Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}} An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga's model, which includes [[Raja yoga]], his interpretation of Patanjali's [[Yoga sutras]],{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=123-126}} which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism.{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}} In 1896 his book ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'' was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga.{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=125-126}}{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=149-180}}

In line with Advaita vedanta texts like ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka]]'' (14th century) and ''[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)]]'' (15th century), Vivekananda saw [[samadhi]] as a means to attain liberation.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

===Gandhi===
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}

Gandhi (1869–1948) has become a worldwide hero of tolerance and striving toward freedom. In his own time, he objected to the growing forces of [[Indian nationalism]], [[communalism]] and the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] response.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=8-10}}{{refn|group=note|"Subaltern" is the social group who is socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of a country. In the Indian colonial and post-colonial context this entails the hegemony of upper-class visions on Indian history, such as the ''Vedic'' origins of Hinduism, and the alternative visions{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=9}} such as [[Dravidian nationalism]] and the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]].}} Gandhi saw religion as an uniting force, confessing the equality of all religions.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} He synthesized the ''[[Astika]]'', ''Nastika'' and ''Semitic religions'', promoting an inclusive culture for peaceful living.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} Gandhi pled for a new hermeneutics of Indian scriptures and philosophy, observing that "there are ample religious literature both in ''Astika'' and ''Nastika'' religions supporting for a pluralistic approach to religious and cultural diversity".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}}

The orthodox Advaita Vedanta, and the heterodox Jain concept [[Anekantavada]] provided him concepts for an "integral approach to religious pluralism".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} He regarded Advaita as a universal religion ("dharma"{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}) which could unite both the orthodox and nationalistic religious interpretations, as the subaltern alternatives.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} Hereby Gandhi offers an interpretation of ''Hindutva'' which is basically different from the ''[[Sangh Parivar]]''-interpretation.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} The concept of ''anekantavada'' offered Gandhi an axiom that "truth is many-sided and relative".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} It is "a methodology to counter exclusivism or absolutism propounded by many religious interpretations".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} It has the capability of synthesizing different percpetions of reality.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} In Gandhi's view,
{{quote|...the spirit of 'Synthesis' essentially dominated Indian civilization. This spirit is absorption, assimilation, co-existence and synthesis.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}}}

Anekantavada also gives room to an organic understanding of "spatio-temporal process",{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} that is, the daily world and its continued change.{{refn|group=note|Compare Gier (2012), who pleads for a [[Process philosophy|process-philosophy]] instead of a [[Substance theory|substance-philosophy]].{{sfn|Gier|2012}}}} The doctrine of anekantavada is a plea for ''samvada'', "dialogue", and an objection against proselytizing activities.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}

===Sarvepalli Radhakrisnan===
{{Main article|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan}}

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was a major force in the further popularization of Neo-Vedanta.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194-196}} As a schoolboy, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was inspired by Vivekananda's lectures, in which he found "an ennobling vision of truth and harmony as well as a message of Indian pride".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}} He was educated by Christian missionaries, and wrote a master thesis on Vedanta and ethics.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} In later life, he became vice-president and president of India.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} According to Rinehart, he presented his view of Hinduism as ''the'' view of Hinduism.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} Central in his presentation was the claim that religion is fundamentally a kind of experience,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} ''anubhava'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEP-Radhakrishnan"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#SH3b Michael Hawley, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan'']&lt;/ref&gt; reducing religion "to the core experience of reality in its fundamental unity".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}}{{refn|group=note|The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p = 47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular citique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}}} For Radhakrishnan, Vedanta was the essence and bedrock of religion.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196}}

===Religion===

====Unity of Hinduism====
Neo-Vedanta aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} It presents
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Neo-Vedanta was influenced by Oriental scholarship, which portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{refn|group=note|The same tendency to prefer an essential core teaching has been prevalent in western scholarship of Theravada Buddhism,{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and has also been constructed by D.T.

====Universalism====
{{Main article|Universalism}}
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}

Following Ramakrishna, neo-Vedanta regards all religions to be equal paths to liberation, but also gives a special place to Hinduism, as the ultimate universal religion.

====Vedanta and nondualism====
{{Main article|Nondualism}}

According to Benavides, neo-Vedanta is closer to Ramanuja's [[Vishishtadvaita|qualified non-dualism]] than it is to Shankara Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Benavides|1993}} Nicholas F. Gier notes that neo-Vedanta does not regard the world to be illusionary, in contrast to Shankara's Advaita.{{sfn|Gier|2012|p=268-269}}{{refn|group=note|Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K.

According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formless and form.{{sfn|Taft|2014}} Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive.&lt;ref group=web name="GM" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Ramakrishna: "When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying - I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God.

The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other.

Hence it is sometimes referred to as Kevala-Advaita or unqualified monism. It may also be called abstract monism in so far as Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is, according to it, devoid of all qualities and distinctions, nirguna and nirvisesa ... The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ''ekamevadvitiyam''. But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna (Chatterjee, 1963 : 260)."{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}}}

Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world.

Gandhi endorsed the Jain concept of [[Anekantavada]],{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=190-191}} the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.{{sfn|Dundas|2004|p=123–136}}{{sfn|Koller|2004|p=400–407}} This concept embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes [[Substance theory|substances]] but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes [[Process philosophy|process]] but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').{{sfn|Burch|1964|p=68–93}}

According to Sarma, who stands in the tradition of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], Advaitavāda means "spiritual non-dualism or absolutism",{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1}} in which opposites are ''manifestations'' of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}{{refn|group=note|Sarma: "All opposites like being and non-being, life and death, good and evil, light and darkness, gods and men, soul and nature are viewed as manifestations of the Absolute which is immanent in the universe and yet transcends it."{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}}}

====''Sruti'' versus "experience"====

A central concern in Neo-Vedanta is the role of ''[[sruti]]'', sacred texts, versus (personal) experience. Classical Advaita Vedanta is centered on the correct understanding of ''sruti'', the sacred texts. Correct understanding of the ''sruti'' is a ''pramana'', a means of knowledge to attain liberation.{{sfn|Myers|2013|p=104-105}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}} It takes years of preparation and study to accomplish this task, and includes the mastery of Sanskrit, the memorisation of texts, and the meditation over the interpretation of those texts.{{sfn|Dubois|2013}} Understanding is called ''[[anubhava]]'',{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=5}} knowledge or understanding derived from (personal) experience.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.0:100.apte V.S.Apte, ''The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary]}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Myers|2013|p=105}} ''Anubhava'' removes ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'', ignorance, regarding Brahman and Atman, and leads to ''[[moksha]]'', liberation. In neo-Vedanta, the status of ''sruti'' becomes secondary, and [[religious experience|"personal experience"]] itself becomes the primary means to liberation.{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=1-14}}

==Smarta Tradition==
{{Main article|Smarta Tradition}}

According to Ninian Smart, Neo-Vedanta is "largely a smarta account."{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=186}} In modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indian{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=186}}&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta"&gt;[http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1204.htm iskcon.org, ''Heart of Hinduism: The Smarta Tradition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113092719/http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1204.htm |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and western&lt;ref group=web name="hinduism-guide.com-Hinduism"&gt;[http://www.hinduism-guide.com/hinduism/hinduism.htm Hinduism-guide.com, ''Hinduism'']&lt;/ref&gt; understanding of Hinduism. According to iskcon.org, 
{{quote|Many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers.&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta" /&gt;}}

Vaitheespara notes adherence of Smartha Brahmans to "the pan-Indian Sanskrit-Brahmanical tradition":{{sfn|Vaitheespara|2010|p=91}}
{{quote|The emerging pan-Indian nationalism was clearly founded upon a number of cultural movements that, for the most part, reimagined an 'Aryo-centric', neo-brahmanical vision of India, which provided the 'ideology' for this hegemonic project.

The majority of members of Smarta community follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Shankara.&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta" /&gt; Smarta and Advaita have become almost synonymous, though not all Advaitins are Smartas.&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta" /&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] was a Smarta,&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta"&gt;[http://www.hinduism-guide.com/hinduism/smarta.htm Hinduism-guide.com, ''Hinduism: Details about "Smarta"'']&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=179}}{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=3}} Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five ([[panchadeva]]) or six ([[Shanmata]] deities as personifications of the Supreme.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Smartism, supreme reality, Brahman, transcends all of the various forms of personal deity.{{sfn|Espin|2007|p=563}} God is both [[Saguna brahman|Saguna]] and [[Nirguna Brahman|Nirguna]]:&lt;ref group=web name="WiseGeek" /&gt;

Lola Williamson further notes that "what is called Vedic in the smarta tradition, and in much of Hinduism, is essentially Tantric in its range of deities and liturgical forms."{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=89}}

==Influence==
Neo-Vedanta was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]],{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and western orientalists who regarded Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

===Vedanticization===
Neo-Vedanta has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta [[Sampradaya]] founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. The influence of Neo-Vedanta on Indian culture has been called "Vedanticization" by [[Richard E. King|Richard King]].{{sfn|King|2011|p=69}}

An example of this "Vedanticization" is [[Ramana Maharshi]], who is regarded as one of the greatest Hindu-saints of modern times,{{refn|group=note|A comparable change of reception can be seen in the status of [[Meister Eckhart]], who has come to be celebrated the most noted western mystic.}}, of whom Sharma notes that "among all the major figures of modern Hinduism [he] is the one person who is widely regarded as a ''[[jivanmukti]]''".{{sfn|Sharma|2005|p=208}} Although Sharma admits that Ramana was not acquainted with Advaita Vedanta before his personal experience of liberation,{{sfn|Sharma|2005|p=213}} and Ramana never received [[Diksha|initiation]] into the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]] or any other [[sampradaya]],&lt;ref group=web name="jd6"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/jd6.shtml John David, ''An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings.

===Diversity and pluralism===
In response to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism, various visions on Indian diversity and unity have been developed within the nationalistic and reform movements.{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

The [[Brahmo Samaj]] strived towards monotheism, while no longer regarding the Vedas as sole religious authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} The Brahmo Samaj had a strong influence on the Neo-Vedanta of Vivekananda,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan and Gandhi,{{sfn|King|2001}} who strived toward a modernized, humanistic Hinduism with an open eye for societal problems and needs.{{sfn|King|2001}} Other groups, like the [[Arya Samaj]], strived toward a revival of Vedic authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Arya Samaj]] "teaches that the ''Vedic'' religion is the only true religion revealed by God for all."{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}} The Arya Samaj was founded by [[Dayanand Saraswati]] (1824-1883), who "was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility".{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}}}} In this context, various responses toward India's diversity developed.

====Hindu inclusivism – Hindutva and "Dharmic religions"====
In modern times, the orthodox measure of the primacy of the Vedas has been joined with the 'grand narrative' of the Vedic origins of Hinduism. The exclusion of Jainism and Buddhism excludes a substantial part of India's cultural and religious history from the asserttion of a strong and positive Hindu identity. Hindutva-ideology solves this problem by taking recourse to the notion of ''[[Hindutva]]'', "Hinduness", which includes Jainism and Buddhism. A recent strategy, exemplified by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], is the use of the term ''[[dharma]]'' as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Springer|2012}}

According to Larson, Malhotra's notion of "the so-called "Dharma” traditions"{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=314}} and their "integral unity" is another example of "neo-Hindu discourse".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=314}} Malhotra, in his ''[[Being Different]]'', uses the term "Dharmic tradition" or "dharmic systems", "referring to all the Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina and Sikh traditions".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} He proposes that those traditions, despite their differences, share common features, the most important being "[[Dharma]]".{{refn|group=note|According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], as described by Halbfass, the term "dharma" "assumed a fundamentally new meaning and function in modern Indian thought, beginning with [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] in the nienteenth century. This process, in which ''dharma'' was presented as an equivalent of, but also a response to, the western notion of "religion", reflects a fundamental change in the Hindu sense of identity and in the attitude toward other religious and cultural traditions. The foreign tools of "religion" and "nation" became tolls of self-definition, and a new and precarious sense of the "unity of Hinduism" and of national as well as religious identity took root".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=10}}}} They are also characterised by the notion of "Integral Unity", which means that "ultimately only the whole exists; the parts that make up the whole have but a relative existence. The whole is independent and indivisible",&lt;ref group=web name="Hitchhiker"&gt;[http://beingdifferentforum.blogspot.nl/2013/01/why-integral-unity-and-not-synthetic.html Hitchhiker's Guide to Rajiv Malhotra's Discussion Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to "Synthetic Unity", which "starts with parts that exist separately from one another".&lt;ref group=web name="Hitchhiker" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Malhotra, "the four Dharma systems also share these general presuppositions":{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They all lead to the transcendent principle expressed variously as [[brahman]], [[nirvana]] and [[kevala]]";{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They facilitate the attainment of an extraordinary and direct experience (such as the highest yogic [[samadhi]]), leading to the realization of the transcendent principle at the personal level (sometimes even at the embodied level as [[Jivanmukta|jivanamukta]] or avalokateçvara);{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They facilitate a harmonious relation between the phenomenal and material mode of life ([[samsara]]) with the goal of spiritual liberation (paramartha) variously";{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They all share praxis, including symbols, foods, customs, social values, sacred geography, family values, festivals and so on."{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}}} Malhotra has received strong criticism of his ideas, for 'glossing over'{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}} the differences between and even within the various traditions of India.{{sfn|Larson|2012}}{{sfn|Yelle|2012}}

In response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused "integral unity" with "homogeneity", thinking that Malhotra said all those traditions are essentially the same, when he actually wrote that Dharmic traditions share a sense of an "integral unity" despite differences.{{sfn|Malhotra|2013}}{{refn|group=note| According to Larson,
{{quote|Malhotra would have the reader believe that there is an "integral unity" underlying the various Dharma traditions, but, in fact, the very term "[[dharma]]" signals fascinating differences."{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

And according to Yelle,
{{quote|The idea of "dharmic traditions" represents a choice to gloss over, whether for ideological or strategic reasons, the vast differences that exist among and even within the various traditions of India ... These differences are invoked occasionally in order to buttress Malhotra’s argument for the pluralism of Indian culture, only to be erased as he presents as universal to dharmic traditions what is, in fact, easily recognizable as a thoroughly modern and homogenized ideal of Hinduism drawn from certain aspects of Vedanta philosophy and Yoga.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}}}}

In a response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused "integral unity" with "homogeneity", and that all those traditions are essentially the same, but that they share the assertion of an "integral unity":{{sfn|Malhotra|2013}}
{{quote|Yelle is right when he says that, "Every tradition is in fact an amalgam, and retains the traces of its composite origins." But he is wrong when he argues against my use of common features such as integral unity and embodied knowing, calling these "a thoroughly modern and homogenized ideal of Hinduism drawn from certain aspects of Vedånta philosophy and
Yoga." His concern about homogenization would have been legitimate if Being Different had proposed an integration of all Dharma traditions into a single new tradition. This is simply not my goal. Looking for commonality as a standpoint from which to gaze at a different family does not require us to relinquish the internal distinctiveness among the members of either family.{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=375-376}}}}}}

====Inclusivism and communalism====
According to Rinehart, neo-Vedanta is "a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|Though neo-Hindu authors prefer the idiom of tolerance to that of inclusivism, it is clear that what is advocated is less a secular view of toleration than a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth. Thus Radhakrishnan's view of experience as the core of religious truth effectively leads to harmony only when and if other religions are willing to assume a position under the umbrella of Vedanta. We might even say that the theme of neo-Hindu tolerance provided the Hindu not simply with a means to claiming the right to stand alongside the other world religions, but with a strategy for promoting Hinduism as the ultimate form of religion itself.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}}} According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is [[Communalism]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} the idea that "all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.pluralindia.com/book/Illustrated_prmier/Chapter_5.pdf Ram Puniyani, ''COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5'']&lt;/ref&gt; Communalism has become a growing force in Indian politics, presenting several threats to India, hindring its [[nation-building]]{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=3}} and threatening "the secular, democratic character of the Indian state".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=3}}

Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and that "the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} But Rinehart also points out that it is 
{{quote|...clear that there isn't a neat line of causation that leads from the philosophies of Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan to the agenda of [...] militant Hindus.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Neither is Radhakrishnan's "use" of religion in the defense of Asian culture and society against colonialism unique for his person, or India in general. The complexities of Asian nationalism are to be seen and understood in the context of colonialism, [[modernization]] and [[nation-building]].

===Influence on western spirituality===
{{Main article|Hinduism in the West|Nondualism}}

Neo-Vedanta has been influenced by western ideas{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but has also had a reverse influence on western spirituality.  Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the late 18th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} In 1785 appeared the first western translation of a Sanskrit-text.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked the growing interest in the Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} which influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them "the consolation of my life".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}{{refn|group=note|And called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}

A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]]{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}}, "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

==Appraisal and criticism==

===Appraisal===
According to Larson, the "solution of synthesis" prevailed in the work of Rammohun Roy, Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Rabindranath Tagore, [[Swami Vivekananda]], M.K. Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Iqbal, V.D. Savarkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, "and many others".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}} Spear voices appraisal of this "solution of synthesis",{{refn|group=note|[S]uch willingness to achieve a synthesis that is neither fearful of the new nor dismissive of the old is 'the ideological secret of modern India'.}}{{refn|group=note|Spear 1958, page 187, in {{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}}}} while G.R.

It alone can supply the philosophical framework for the understanding of the problems of our society.{{sfn|Sharma|2003|p=179}}}}

===Criticism===
Vivekenanda's presentation of Advaita Vedanta has been criticised for its misinterpretation of this tradition:
{{quote|Without calling into question the right of any philosopher to interpret Advaita according to his own understanding of it, [...] the process of Westernization has obscured the core of this school of thought. The basic correlation of renunciation and Bliss has been lost sight of in the attempts to underscore the cognitive structure and the realistic structure which according to Samkaracarya should both belong to, and indeed constitute the realm of māyā.{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

According to [[Anantanand Rambachan]], Vivekananda emphasised ''[[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]]'' ("personal experience"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}) over scriptural authority,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}} but in his interpretation of Shankara, deviated from Shankara, who saw knowledge and understanding of the scriptures as the primary means to moksha.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} According to Comans, the emphasis on samadhi also is not to be found in the Upanishads nor with Shankara.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=307}} For Shankara, meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

In the 21st century, Neo-Vedanta has been criticized by Hindu traditionalists for the influence of "Radical Universalism", arguing that it leads to a "self-defeating philosophical relativism," and has weakened the status and strength of Hinduism.&lt;ref group=web name=moralies2013&gt;Frank Morales (February 15, 2013).

==Criticism of neo-Hinduism label==

===Criticism of Paul Hacker===
In the 20th century the German Indologist [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]] used the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" polemically, to criticize modern Hindu thinkers,.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b}} Halbfass regards the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" as "useful and legitimate as convenient labels",{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} but has criticized Hacker for use that was "simplistic".{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} Furthermore, he asks,
{{quote|What is the significance and legitimacy of the "Neo" in expressions like "Neo-Hinduism and "Neo-Vedanta"? Could we speak of "Neo-Christianity" as well? In fact, I have used this term [...] and not all my Christian readers and reviewers were happy about the term.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}}}}

Halbfass wrote that the adoption of the terms 
{{quote|"Neo-Hinduism" and "Neo-Vedanta" [...] by Western scholars reflects Christian and European claims and perspectives which continue to be an irritant to Indians today. For Hacker, the "Neo" in "Neo-Hinduism" implies a lack of authenticity, an apologetic accommodation to Western ideas, and a hybridization of the tradition.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=587–588}}{{refn|group=note|Halbfass adds that "I have tried [...] to argue that Hacker's radical critique reflects above all a typically Christian and European obsession with the concept of the individual person."{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=588}}}}}}

Bagchee and Adluri argue that German Indology, including Hacker, was merely "a barely disguised form of religious evangelism".{{sfn|Bagche|Adluri|2013|p=215–229}}

According to Malhotra, an Indian-American Hindu writer, it was Paul Hacker who popularized the term 'neo-Hinduism' in the 1950s, "to refer to the modernization of Hinduism brought about by many Indian thinkers, the most prominent being Swami Vivekananda."&lt;ref group=web name="HT" /&gt; In Malhotra's view, "Hacker charged that 'neo-Hindus', most notably Vivekananda, have disingenuously adopted Western ideas and expressed them using Sanskrit."&lt;ref group=web name="HT" /&gt; Malhotra also notes that Hacker was a biased Christian apologist: 
{{quote|What is less known about Hacker is that he was also an unabashed Christian apologist who freely used his academic standing to further the cause of his Christian agenda. He led a parallel life, passionately advocating Christianity while presenting the academic face of being neutral and objective.&lt;ref group=web name="HT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinduism Today Staff|title=Book Review: Defending Hinduism’s Philosophical Unity|journal=Hinduism Today|date=October 2015|issue=October 2015|pages=66–69|url=http://rajivmalhotra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hinduism-today_indras-net-review.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}According to David Smith, Hacker's belief was that the ethical values of 'neo-Hinduism" came from Western philosophy and Christianity, just in Hindu terms. Hacker also believed that Hinduism began in the 1870's. He saw Bankin Chattopadhyaya, Aruobindo, Gandhi, and Radhakishnan as its most famous proponents.&lt;ref name="'Reformed' Hinduism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=David |title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations |date=February 3, 2016 |publisher=Linda Woodhead |isbn=9780415858816 |page=57 |edition=third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of inherent development of religions===
Brian K. Smith notes that "The Neo-Hindu indigenous authorities are often dismissed as 'inauthentic,' their claims to legitimacy compromised by their encounters with modernity", which influenced their worldview and religious positions,{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=324}} but points out that 
{{quote|''All'' religions, at various points in recent history and under varying circumstances, have adopted to the modern world and the accompanying intellectual trends of modernity. 'Hinduism' (or 'Neo-Hinduism') is not unique in this regard either; the Neo-Hindu movement shares many commonalties with developments in other religious traditions around the world over the past several hundred years. The study of religion is the study of traditions in constant change.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=325}}{{refn|group=note|Smith expressed concern that "scholars of religion do not exercise their authority to write about religion(s) in a vacuum [...] One of the principal ramifications of the trend in Indology to deny the existence of a unified religion called 'Hinduism' is to delegitimize those in India who, in varying ways, have represented themselves as 'Hindus' and their religion as 'Hinduism.' [...] This kind of indifference to indigenous conceptualizations of self-identity [...] is especially problematic in an age where Western scholars often claim to be concerned to allow the 'natives to speak' and 'assume agency' over representational discourse [...] Denying the legitimacy of any and all 'Hindu' representations of Hinduism can easily crossover into a [[Orientalism|Neo-Orientalism]], whereby indigenous discourse is once again silenced or ignored as the product of a false consciousness delivered to it by outside forces or as simply irrelevant to the authoritative deliberations of Western [[Indology|Indologists]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=332–333}}}}}}

According to Madaio, the notion that Vivekananda and other Hindu modernists deviate from orthodox, classical Advaita Vedanta, neglects the fact that considerable developments took place in Indian religious thinking, including Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=2}}

===The "myth of Neo-Hinduism"===
[[Rajiv Malhotra]], in his book [[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net]], has stated that there is a "myth of Neo-Hinduism".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=26}} According to him, there are "eight myths"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=28}} of Neo-Hinduism such as "colonial Indology's biases were turned into Hinduism" (Myth 2){{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=31}} and "Hinduism was manufactured and did not grow organically" (Myth 3).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=32}} Malhotra denies that "Vivekananda manufactured Hinduism", or that `neo-Vedanta' suppressed "the traditions of the Indian masses." According to Malhotra, there is "an integrated, unified spiritual substratum in ancient India,"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}} and argues that
{{quote|the branding of contemporary Hinduism as a faux 'neo-Hinduism' is a gross mischaracterization of both traditional and contemporary Hinduism [...] [C]ontemporary Hinduism is a continuation of a dynamic tradition. It is not in any way less authentic or less 'Hindu' than what may be dubbed traditional Hinduism. There are negative connotations to the term 'neo' which imply something artificial, untrue, or unfaithful to the original. Other world religions have undergone similar adaptations in modern times, though there are no such references to 'neo-Christianity' [...] I resist the wide currency being gained for the term 'neo-Hinduism', because this fictional divide between 'neo' and 'original' Hinduism subverts Hinduism.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=30}}}}

According to Malhotra, the 'myth of neo-Hinduism' "is used to fragment Hindu society by pitting its spiritual giants against one another and distorting their subtle and deeply intricate viewpoints."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}} Also according to him, "the definition of neo-Hinduism has been contrived and [...] gained authenticity, in part because it suits certain academic and political agendas, and in part because it has been reiterated extensively without adequate critical response."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=42}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21894">Even though [[intimacy]] has been broadly defined in terms of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] and [[sexual desire and intimate relationships|sexual desire]], the '''[[neuroanatomy]] of intimacy''' needs further explanation in order to fully understand their neurological functions in different components within intimate relationships, which are romantic love, lust, attachment, and rejection in love.  Also, known functions of the neuroanatomy involved can be applied to observations seen in people who are experiencing any of the stages in intimacy.  Research analysis of these systems provide insight on the [[biological basis of love|biological basis of intimacy]], but the neurological aspect must be considered as well in areas that require special attention to mitigate issues in intimacy, such as violence against a beloved partner or problems with social bonding.

== Components of intimacy and neuroanatomy==

===Attachment===
[[Pair bonding]], or intense social attachment, normally initiates partner preference in sexual situations and monogamy in many mammalian species.  Monogamous species generally exhibit an exclusive responsibility to each other as well as co-parenting to their offspring.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Larry J|author2=Wang, Zuoxin|title=The neurobiology of pair bonding|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=October 2004|volume=7|issue=10|pages=1048–1054|doi=10.1038/nn1327}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies using monogamous [[prairie vole]]s (''Microtus ochrogaster'') showed that forming a pair bond stimulated the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway.  In this pathway, [[dopamine]] is released from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[prefrontal cortex]], which then signals the [[ventral pallidum]] to complete reward processing in the pathway.&lt;ref name="Anatomy and neurochemistry - Young"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Larry J.|last2=Murphy Young|first2= Anne Z.|last3= Hammock|first3= Elizabeth A.D.|title=Anatomy and neurochemistry of the pair bond|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=5 December 2005|volume=493|issue=1|pages=51–57|doi=10.1002/cne.20771|pmid=16255009}}&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:Dopamine Pathways.png|thumb|Dopamine Pathways | The dopamine pathway starts at the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and is routed to the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex for ultimate dopamine release that yields reward and reinforcement.  This helps in feeling pleasure or enjoyment of a certain stimuli and reinforcing that positive feeling when that initial stimuli occurs again.]]
Two important neuropeptides that mediated pair bond formation were [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin|arginine vasopressin (AVP)]].  Even though both males and females have both molecules, oxytocin was shown to be predominantly in females and vasopressin predominantly promoted pair bonding in males.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;  Receptor specificity was shown essential for mating by activating the [[dopamine receptor D2|dopamine D2 receptors]] in the nucleus accumbens in both male and female prairie voles.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;  Other locations that were also activated in the study were gender specific, such as oxytocin receptors (OTR) in the prefrontal cortex and AVP 1a receptors (V1aR) in the ventral pallidum.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;

[[File:Love-triangle.jpg|thumb| The [[Triangular theory of love]] by psychologist [[Robert Sternberg]] to describe the interpersonal aspects of love.]]

===Romantic love===
Romantic love is described as involving an individual who pays closer attention to another individual in special ways, involving attention on traits worthy to pursue.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Helen|author2=Aron, Arthur |author3=Brown, Lucy L. |title=Romantic Love: A Mammalian Brain System for Mate Choice|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 December 2006|volume=361|issue=1476|pages=2173–2186|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1938|pmid=17118931|pmc=1764845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), studies have shown that the right ventral tegmental area (VTA) is stimulated when subjects are shown a picture of their beloved.  As part of the reward mechanism, the VTA signals to other parts of the brain, such as the [[caudate nucleus]] to release dopamine for reward.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=Arthur|author2=Fisher, Helen |author3=Mashek, Debra J. |author4=Strong, G. |author5=Li, Haifang |author6= Brown, Lucy L. |title=Reward, Motivation, and Emotion Systems Associated with Early-Stage Intense Romantic Love|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=31 May 2005|volume=94|issue=1|pages=327–337|doi= 10.1152/jn.00838.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Constudoverbrain - 2.png|thumb|Constudoverbrain|Neuroanatomical structures involved in romantic love are closely related to structures that are involved in motivation and emotion.]]
Older studies have generally attributed love to the [[limbic system]] consisting of the [[temporal lobe]]s, [[hypothalamus]], [[amygdala]] as well as the [[hippocampus]].  These functional components of the limbic system are important components of emotional processing, motivation, and memory.&lt;ref name=Amen&gt;{{cite book|last=Amen, M.D.|first=Daniel G.|title=Change Your Brain, Change Your Life|year=1998|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8129-2998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, current research also suggests components, such as the hypothalamus, as playing a role in romantic love because it possesses the penchant for bonding in mammals by secreting the neuropeptides, oxytocin and vasopressin.&lt;ref name=Beauregard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beauregard|first=Mario|author2=Courtemanche, Jerome |author3=Paquette, Vincent |author4= St-Pierre, Evelyne L. |title=The neural basis of unconditional love|journal=Psychiatry Research- Neuroimaging|date=15 May 2009|volume=172|issue=2|pages=93–98|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has implicated [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF), a neurotrophin that is fundamental in the neuron survival and development in the nervous system, in early-stage romantic love in subjects experiencing euphoria and emotional dependency, which is often a characteristic in romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emanuele|first=E|author2=Politi, P |author3=Bianchi, M |author4=Minoretti, P |author5=Bertona, M |author6= Geroldi, D |title=Raised plasma nerve growth factor levels associated with early-stage romantic love|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=April 2006|volume=31|issue=3|pages=288–294|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.09.002|pmid=16289361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lust===
[[Lust]], also known as libido, is defined as pursuing [[sexual gratification]].&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Helen E.|author2=Aron, Arthur |author3=Mashek, Debra |author4=Li, Haifang |author5= Brown, Lucy L. |title=Defining the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction, and Attachment|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2002|volume=31|issue=5|pages=413–419|doi=10.1023/A:1019888024255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is primarily driven by the endocrine system, but the brain is also involved in neural processing.  Specifically, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal]] (HPG) and [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA)  axes play primary roles in the priming for sex as well as the stress response, respectively.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sue Carter|first=C|title=Neuroendocrine Perspectives on Social Attachment and Love |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=November 1998|volume=23|issue=8|pages=779–818|doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Larry|title=The chemistry between us : love, sex, and the science of attraction|year=2012|publisher=Current|location=New York|isbn=1591845130|author2=Alexander, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because intimacy is motivated by the reward system, steroid hormones activate desire to promote partner preference and social attachment in the process of sexual union.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt; Dopamine is then released when an individual is aroused, which associates lust as a product of the dopaminergic reward system.

However, interactions of sex and romantic love do not have the same goal orientation, which helps to confirm the difference in brain activation patterns.  Contrasting with the primary goal of romantic love, copulation can occur without two individuals being in romantic love or having a monogamous bond.  Sometimes, copulation might not even occur in romantic love relationships.  However, it still does play a role in successful reproduction when it is supplemented with romantic love.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006" /&gt;

===Rejection in love===
Rejection in love is considered [[unrequited love|unrequited or unreciprocated love]].&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;   Separation from a loved one can cause grief and sometimes lead to an individual expressing characteristics of depression.  In a study, symptoms seen in nine women who had experienced a recent breakup suggested involvement of certain neuroanatomy.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt; Eating, sleeping, and neuroendocrine regulation was associated with the hypothalamus, [[anhedonia]] was associated with the ventral [[striatum]] and the amygdala was associated with emotional processing in these women.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt;   
[[File:Medial surface of cerebral cortex - gyri.png|thumb|Medial surface of cerebral cortex - gyri| The neuroanatomy of the medial surface of the cerebral cortex are implicated in rejection in love.  Regular functions of many of the anatomical structures connect rejection in love to motivation, emotions, deep thinking, and reward.]]
Other neuroanatomy that registered unrequited love included the [[cerebellum]], [[insular cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt;  All of the areas that were activated showed decreased activity when subjects emotionally reflected about the beloved rejecter.&lt;ref name="Women grieving"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Najib|first=A.|title=Regional Brain Activity in Women Grieving a Romantic Relationship Breakup|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 December 2004|volume=161|issue=12|pages=2245–2256|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2245|pmid=15569896}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In contrast, another study observed significant increase in activation in the VTA as well as the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  Further, those rejected in love had higher stimulation in the right nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen/pallidum compared to subjects who were in romantic love &lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=H. E.|author2=Brown, L. L. |author3=Aron, A. |author4=Strong, G. |author5= Mashek, D. |title=Reward, Addiction, and Emotion Regulation Systems Associated With Rejection in Love|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=5 May 2010|volume=104|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1152/jn.00784.2009 |pmid=20445032}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study ultimately showed that areas that are activated in romantic love are also activated in rejection in love.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;  Results from this study suggest that rejected lovers have same stimulation of brain regions because they are still "in love" with their rejecters.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  Since romantic love follows the dopaminergic reward system, the anticipatory nature of receiving a reward as well as deciding on losses and gains in decision making, allows the neural circuitry to become adaptable.  This allows the rejected to change their behavior through two stages.  The first is the "protest" stage where they try to win back the rejecter.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  The second stage or the "rejection" stage is where they feel resignation and despair, eventually leading to continuing life without the rejecter.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love"/&gt; On the other hand, the involvement of the reward gain/loss pathways intrinsic to survival provides insight on behaviors of stalking, suicide, obsessiveness and depression.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;

==Other neurological implications of intimate brain systems ==

===Mother–child pair bond===
An attachment between a mother and child arises from behavioral changes during birth, which includes lactation.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives" /&gt;  Release of oxytocin is important in the birthing process for the mother–child pair bond to occur in both individuals. Lactation relies on the constant release of oxytocin for the release of milk in the breast, which strengthens the first social bond of the infant and the mother.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives" /&gt;

Although this is considered another type of social attachment that activates the same reward system, maternal attachment activates different regions of the brain compared to those in partner attachment.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  In one study, overlap of activated brain regions with romantic love was found to include the nucleus accumbens, [[putamen]], caudate nucleus, which are important in social attachment.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  However, the only regions that were specific to maternal love were the orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal cortex as well as the occipital and lateral fusiform cortex.&lt;ref name="Bartels Maternal Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartels|first=Andreas|author2=Zeki, Semir|title=The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love|journal=NeuroImage|date=March 2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1155–1166|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.11.003|pmid=15006682}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreover, oxytocin is important between the mother and her offspring, so it is suggested that oxytocin deficiency can influence how successfully the offspring is able to form a monogamous pair bond with another individual in the future. This may provide insight on issues with formation of pair bonds as well as psychological problems from an inefficient upbringing.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartels Maternal Love"/&gt;

===Addictiveness===

[[File:PET - Human Addiction.jpg|thumb|PET - Human Addiction| [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans of brains that are normal in comparison to brains of an obese subject, alcoholic subject, and cocaine user.  Love is suggested to simulate patterns of a cocaine user in brain activation.]]
Love activates the same neural circuitry as maladaptive drugs, such as cocaine. Dopaminergic reward pathways are involved to elicit a response of gaining a reward and reinforcement, thereby leading some researchers to believe that love is addictive.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  Love and drugs of abuse stimulate similar levels of dopamine for reward and reinforcement from the VTA.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt; Actions between the two mental states are very similar with those in love experiencing excessive exhilaration, insomnia, anxiety, and loss of appetite also seen in drug users.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beauregard|first=Mario|author2=Courtemanche, Jérôme |author3=Paquette, Vincent |author4= St-Pierre, Évelyne Landry |title=The neural basis of unconditional love|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging|date=May 2009|volume=172|issue=2|pages=93–98|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Larry J.|author2=Lim, Miranda M. |author3=Gingrich, Brenden |author4= Insel, Thomas R. |title=Cellular Mechanisms of Social Attachment|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=September 2001|volume=40|issue=2|pages=133–138|doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, brain activity observed through [[single-photon emission computed tomography| single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)]] showed that dopamine release in the [[basal ganglia]] of a subject who was romantically in love appeared similar to a subject addicted to cocaine.&lt;ref name=Amen /&gt;  Although love is suggested to be addictive based on its neurological circuitry, it cannot be simplified as addictive because it is expressed in different ways across a wide spectrum.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Gender differences in the intimate brain===

====Emotional processing====
The amygdala, a key player in emotional processing, is suggested different between men and women.  In males, emotions are considered to be primarily directed from the right hemisphere; on the other hand, it is primarily directed from the left hemisphere in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Medina|first=John|title=Brain rules : 12 principles for surviving and thriving at work, home, and school|year=2009|publisher=Pear Press|location=Seattle, Wash.|isbn=0979777747|edition=1st Pear Press trade pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FrontalCapts.png|thumb|FrontalCapts|Many of the [[gyrus|gyri]] of the brain are implicated in the emotional processing of valenced words in males and females.]]
One study that tested positively and negatively valenced words on both male and female subjects found that emotional processing was indeed gender specific. In males, positively valenced words activated the left sensimotor cortex, angular gyrus, left hippocampus, left frontal eye field and the right cerebellum, while females had activations in the right putamen, right superior temporal gyrus, left [[supramarginal gyrus]], left inferior frontal gyrus and the left sensorimotor cortex.  By contrast, negatively valenced words stimulated greater activation in the right supramarginal gyrus in males, while greater activation in the left part of the hippocampus with negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofer|first=Alex|author2=Siedentopf, Christian M. |author3=Ischebeck, Anja |author4=Rettenbacher, Maria A. |author5=Verius, Michael |author6=Febler, Stephan |author7= Wolfgang Fleischhacker, W. |title=Sex differences in brain activation patterns during processing of positively and negatively valenced emotional words|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=12 October 2006|volume=37|issue=01|pages=109|doi=10.1017/S0033291706008919 |pmid=17038205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, different brain regions in males and females could allude to differential responses emotional processing in intimate situations.

====Jealousy====
[[File:Gender Differences in Jealousy When Looking at Actual Infidelity.png|thumb|Gender Differences in Jealousy When Looking at Actual Infidelity| Induction of jealousy through emotional and sexual imagery of their partner elicited differential responses in males and females.]]

Known as the insecure feeling of a partner in regards to losing their loved one to another,  [[jealousy]] can result in extreme situations such as violence and abuse from the insecure partner to their beloved.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  In one study, men and women were shown sentences that suggested sexual and emotional infidelity and rated the intensity of jealousy that they felt.&lt;ref name="Gender differences"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Hidehiko|author2=Matsuura, Masato |author3=Yahata, Noriaki |author4=Koeda, Michihiko |author5=Suhara, Tetsuya |author6= Okubo, Yoshiro |title=Men and women show distinct brain activations during imagery of sexual and emotional infidelity|journal=NeuroImage|date=September 2006|volume=32|issue=3|pages=1299–1307|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.049 |pmid=16829139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sexual infidelity=====
In males, activation of brain areas that were induced by sexual infidelity laden statements included the [[visual cortex]], middle temporal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, and [[claustrum]].  In females, the visual cortex, middle frontal gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum were activated.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  It was found that males showed more stimulation in the amygdala in regards to sexual infidelity, while females showed greater activation in the visual cortex and thalamus.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  The regions in the male brain provided insight on neuroanatomy associated with sexual and aggressive behavior.  These regions could be studied further in increased violent cases against partners, which are commonly due to male aggression.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;

=====Emotional infidelity=====
In males, the visual cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus, and cerebellum were shown to be activated.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  In females, activations in the visual cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum were noted.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt; Male activations were greater in the precentral gyrus, insula, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum, while women shower greater activations in the visual cortex, angular gyrus, and thalamus.  Regions in the female brain have been implicated in detection of intention, deception, and trustworthiness of others.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt; It is ultimately suggested that the different emotional processing in males and females contributes to the different responses in issues in intimate relationships.

==Life==
He was educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] and [[St John's College, Oxford]] where he matriculated in 1587, graduated B.A. and became Fellow in 1590.

''Philosophia epicurea, democritiana, theophrastica'' was a work on the classical [[atomism]] of [[Epicurus]] and [[skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'' (1992), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of 509 [[aphorism]]s, which drew on Bruno and [[Lullism]], [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Paracelsus]], as well as classical authors.&lt;ref name = Pyle/&gt; It was published in 1601 (Paris), and in another edition in 1619 (Geneva). It included thoughts on an imaginary voyage to the Moon, a theme taken from Bruno.&lt;ref name="historycooperative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/111.4/cressy.html|website=historycooperative.org|title=cressy|accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also shows a close relation to Bruno's ''De Immenso'' and ''De Minimo''.&lt;ref name="Empson, pp. 42-3"&gt;Empson, pp. 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences were [[Democritus]], [[Hermes Trismegistus]] and [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaukroger, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], perhaps also following [[Francesco Patrizi]].&lt;ref name = Serjeantson/&gt; Hill, however, stops short of exploring atomism as a mechanistic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, Michael Ayers (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy'' (2003), p. 673.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kargon considers that Hill was not, in strict terms, an Epicurean, reserving to [[Walter Charleton]] the first English exposition of Epicurean thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linhard.com/FL2005/Atomism_England.pdf, note p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Philosophia epicurea'' was known to [[John Donne]], through Ben Jonson's copy.&lt;ref name="Empson, pp. 42-3"/&gt; It was referenced in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C.

According to Robert Hues, other unpublished work followed Bruno.

'''Oliver Chase Quick''' (21 June 1885 – 21 January 1944) was an English theologian, philosopher, and Anglican priest.{{sfnm |1a1=MacKinnon |1y=1993 |1p=101 |2a1=Robbins |2y=2008 |2p=168}}

==Early life and education==
Oliver Quick was born on 21 June 1885 in [[Sedbergh]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of the educationist [[Robert Hebert Quick]] and Bertha Parr.{{sfnm |1a1=Chapman |1y=2004 |2a1=Lindgren |2y=2004 |3a1=Sell |3y=2010 |3p=143}} He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and studied classics and theology at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].{{sfnm |1a1=Chapman |1y=2004 |2a1=Lucas |2y=1993 |2p=4}}

Quick married Frances Winifred Pearson,{{sfn|Sell|2010|p=144}} a niece of [[Karl Pearson]].

==Ecclesiastical and academic career==
Quick was ordained {{citation needed span |date=November 2017 |text=to the diaconate}} in 1911{{sfnm |1a1=Chapman |1y=2004 |2a1=Chapman |2y=2006 |2p=830}} and to the priesthood in 1912.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Prior to becoming chaplain to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1915, he was a vice-principal of [[Leeds Clergy School]] and then a curate at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], [[London]].{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=830}} He was given his first [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbency]] in 1918 in his appointment to the vicarage of [[Kenley]], [[Surrey]].{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=830}} He went on to be appointed to residentiary canonries of [[Newcastle Cathedral|Newcastle]] (1920), [[Carlisle Cathedral|Carlisle]] (1923), and [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] (1930).{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=830}} He became a professor of theology at [[Durham University]] in 1934 and was appointed to a canonry of [[Durham Cathedral]] ''ex officio''.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=830}} He moved to [[Oxford]] in 1939, having been appointed to the [[Regius Professor of Divinity|Regius Professorship of Divinity]] at the [[University of Oxford]], which carried with it a canonry of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]].{{sfnm |1a1=Chapman |1y=2006 |1p=830 |2a1=Lucas |2y=1993 |2p=17 |3a1=Sell |3y=2010 |3p=144}} He remained in the post until his death in 1944.{{sfn|Chapman|2017|p=39}}

In his works he advocated the doctrines of [[soul sleep]] and [[conditional immortality]].{{sfn|Quick|1938|pp=260–261}} He was one of the leading exponents of orthodox Anglicanism{{sfnm |1a1=Chapman |1y=2006 |1pp=830–831 |2a1=Mozley |2y=1945 |2p=36}} and upheld a position similar to that of the authors of ''Essays Catholic and Critical'' (1926). He followed systematic and synthetic rather than historical methods and expressed his thought in a modern way.

Quick died on 21 January 1944 in [[Longborough]], [[Gloucestershire]], and was buried four days later in the churchyard in Longborough.{{sfn|Sell|2010|p=147}}

'''Omniscience''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|m|ˈ|n|ɪ|ʃ|ə|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|omniscience}}"&lt;/ref&gt; is the capacity to know everything. In [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Sikhism]] and the [[Abrahamic religions]], this is an [[God#Specific attributes|attribute of God]]. In some other religions that do not include a supreme deity, such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], omniscience is an attribute that any individual can eventually attain.

== Islam ==
In Islam, [[Allah]] is attributed with absolute omniscience. He knows the past, the present and the future. It is compulsory for a [[Muslim]] to believe that Allah is indeed omniscient as stated in one of the  [[Iman_(concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of faith]] which is :
* To believe that Allah’s divine decree and predestination 

{{Quote|“Say: Do you instruct Allah about your religion? But Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on the earth; Allah is Knowing of all things” 
-Holy Qur'an (49:16)|}}

It is however, believed that human can only change their [[Predestination in Islam|predestination]] (wealth, health, deed etc.) and not divine decree (date of birth, date of death, family etc.), thus allowing free wills.

== Buddhism ==
&lt;!--"Ananda" links here. If this section is renamed or removed, please adjust wikilink over there accordingly.--&gt;
The topic of omniscience has been much debated in various Indian traditions, but no more so than by the Buddhists. After [[Dharmakirti]]'s excursions into the subject of [[pramana|what constitutes a valid cognition]], [[Śāntarakṣita]] and his student [[Kamalaśīla]] thoroughly investigated the subject in the [[Tattvasamgraha]] and its commentary the Panjika. The arguments in the text can be broadly grouped into four sections:
* The refutation that cognitions, either perceived, inferred, or otherwise, can be used to refute omniscience.
* A demonstration of the possibility of omniscience through apprehending the selfless universal nature of all knowables, by examining what it means to be ignorant and the nature of mind and awareness.
* A demonstration of the total omniscience where all individual characteristics (svalaksana) are available to the omniscient being.
* The specific demonstration of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]'s non-exclusive omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Sara L. (2010). ''Omniscience and the Rhetoric of Reason''. Wisdom Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Attributes of God}}
{{See also|Attributes of God in Christianity}}
Some modern [[Christian]] [[theologian]]s argue that God's omniscience is inherent rather than total, and that God chooses to limit his omniscience in order to preserve the freewill and dignity of his creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]], ''Science and Theology'' SPCK/Fortress Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8006-3153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]], among other theologians of the 16th century, comfortable with the definition of God as being omniscient in the total sense, in order for worthy beings' abilities to choose freely, embraced the doctrine of [[predestination]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Kevala Jnana}}
In [[Jainism]], omniscience is considered the highest type of perception. In the words of a Jain scholar,
"The perfect manifestation of the innate nature of the self, arising on the complete annihilation of the obstructive veils, is called omniscience."{{sfn|Mehta|1954|p= 99}}

Jainism views infinite knowledge as an inherent capability of every soul. ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihanta]]'' is the word used by Jains to refer to those human beings who have conquered all inner passions (like attachment, greed, pride, anger) and possess ''Kevala Jnana'' (infinite knowledge). They are said to be of two kinds:{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
# ''Sāmānya kevali'' – omniscient beings (''Kevalins'') who are concerned with their own liberation.
# ''[[Tirthankara]] kevali'' – human beings who attain omniscience and then help others to achieve the same.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Orozco Mural Omniciencia 1925 Azulejos.jpg|thumb|left|''Omniciencia'', mural by [[José Clemente Orozco]]]]
{{seealso|Determinism|Free will|Argument from free will}}
Whether omniscience, particularly regarding the choices that a human will make, is compatible with [[free will]] has been debated by [[Theology|theologians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]]. The argument that divine foreknowledge is not compatible with free will is known as [[theological fatalism]]. It is argued that if humans are free to choose between alternatives, God could not know what this choice will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/~rbarnett/phi/free.html |title=Ron Barnette, a Bright-OMNISCIENCE AND FREEDOM |publisher=Valdosta.edu |date=1999-09-16 |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422202913/http://www.valdosta.edu/~rbarnett/phi/free.html |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A question arises: if an omniscient entity knows everything, even about its own decisions in the future, does it therefore forbid any free will to that entity? [[William Lane Craig]] states that the question subdivides into two:
# If God foreknows the occurrence of some event E, does E happen necessarily?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Purtill on Fatalism and Truth|journal=Faith and Philosophy|date=1990|pages=229–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# If some event E is contingent, how can God foreknow E’s occurrence?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2771 |journal=Process Studies |pages=30–37 |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1989 |title=Does Omniscience Imply Foreknowledge?

However, this kind of argument fails to recognize its use of the [[modal fallacy]]. It is possible to show that the first premise of arguments like these is fallacious. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow/#SH6b |title=Foreknowledge and Free Will |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430091819/https://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow/ |archivedate=30 April 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/modal_fallacy.htm#omniscience |title='The' Modal Fallacy |publisher=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/ |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809215754/https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/modal_fallacy.htm |archivedate=9 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Omniscience and the privacy of conscious experience ==
Some philosophers, such as Patrick Grim, [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]], Stephan Torre and William Mander have discussed the issue of whether the apparent exclusively first-person nature of conscious experience is compatible with God's omniscience. There is a strong sense in which conscious experience is private, meaning that no outside observer can gain knowledge of what it is like to be me ''as me''. If a subject cannot know what it is like to be another subject in an objective manner, the question is whether that limitation applies to God as well. If it does, then God cannot be said to be omniscient since there is then a form of knowledge that God lacks access to.

The philosopher Patrick Grim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grim|first=Patrick|date=1985|title=Against omniscience: The case from essential indexicals|journal=Noûs|volume=19|pages=151–180|jstor=2214928}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably raised this issue. Linda Zagzebski&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Omnisubjectivity : a defense of a divine attribute|last=1946-|first=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus|isbn=9780874621839|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|oclc=825106425|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to avoid it by introducing the notion of ''perfect empathy'', a proposed relation that God can have to subjects that would allow God to have perfect knowledge of their conscious experience. William Mander&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mander|first=William|date=2000|title=Does God know what it is like to be me?|journal=Heythrop Journal|volume=43|issue=4|pages=430–443|doi=10.1111/1468-2265.00203}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that God can only have such knowledge if our experiences are part of God's broader experience. Stephan Torre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Stephan|date=2006|title=De Se Knowledge and the Possibility of an Omniscient Being|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/faithphil/content/faithphil_2006_0023_0002_0191_0200|journal=Faith and Philosophy|volume=23|pages=191–200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that God can have such knowledge if self-knowledge involves the ascription of properties, either to oneself or to others. Patrick Grim saw this line of reasoning as a motivation for accepting atheism.

The '''Ordinary Mind Zen School''' is a network of independent Zen centers established by [[Charlotte Joko Beck]] and her [[Dharma heirs|Dharma Successors]] in 1995.

==History==

The school is unaffiliated with any Zen centers which fall outside of its own network. The history of the Ordinary Mind Zen School dates back to 1983, which was the year that Joko Beck had left the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| coauthors =| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| location =| pages =173–175| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70174891&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was the year her teacher, [[Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi]], had been confronted by his students about his [[alcoholism]] and sexual liaisons with some female students. Joko Beck established the Zen Center of San Diego&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zencentersandiego.org/ Zen Center of San Diego]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983, currently run by [[Ezra Bayda]] and Elizabeth Hamilton, though Joko Beck had disassociated herself from these teachers.&lt;ref name=Lachs&gt;{{cite news|title=Stuart Lachs|date=August 26, 2010|url=http://www.nondualitymagazine.org/nonduality_magazine.2.stuartlachs.interview.htm|work=Non-Duality|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry Magid Interview|date=June 4, 2009|url=http://sweepingzen.com/barry-magid-interview-2/|publisher=Sweeping Zen|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Hughes Seager, "By 1998, the Ordinary Mind School had centers in [[San Diego]], [[Champaign, Illinois]], [[Oakland, California]], Portland, Oregon and [[New York City]]."&lt;ref&gt;Seager, 102&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one set structure of curriculum in the Ordinary Mind School, as the [[Dharma heirs|Dharma Successors]] of Joko Beck get to decide their method of training independent of any organizational head. Long before retirement, Joko Beck had done away with all titles and no longer wore her [[okesa]]. She had distanced herself considerably from her roots in the [[Sōtō]] school, and much of the ceremony had been abandoned in favor of pure meditation practice.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;

'''Papal diplomatics''' is the scholarly and critical study ([[diplomatics]]) of the authentic documents of the [[Papacy]], largely to distinguish them from spurious documents. The study emerges in the Middle Ages and has been further refined in the centuries since. 

==History==

The authenticity of [[papal Bull]]s, alongside royal charters and other legal instruments, became a matter of concern in the Middle Ages. The [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs|Papal Chancery]] oversaw control of documents and precautions taken against forgery. [[Pope Gregory VII]] refrained even from attaching the usual leaden seal to a Bull for fear it should fall into unscrupulous hands and be used for fraudulent purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Dubitavimus hic sigillum plumbeum ponere ne si illud inimici caperent de eo falsitatem aliquam facerent. - Jaffé-Löwenfeld, "Regesta", no. 5225; cf. no. 5242.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Pope Innocent III]] issued instructions with a view to the detection of forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;See Migne, ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', CCXIV, 202, 322, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; An ecclesiastic of the standing of [[Lanfranc]] has been seriously accused of conniving at the fabrication of Bulls,&lt;ref&gt;H. Böhmer, "Die Fälschungen Erzbischof Lanfranks", 1902; cf. Liebermann's review in "Deutsche Literaturzeitung", 1902, p. 2798, and the defence of Lanfrane by L. Saltet in "Bulletin de litt. eccl.", Toulouse, 1907, 227 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; and so the need of some system of tests became obvious.

But the medieval criticism of documents was not very satisfactory even in the hands of a jurist like [[Pope Alexander III]].&lt;ref&gt;See his comments on two pretended privileges of Popes Zacharias and Leo, Jaffé-Löwenfeld, "Regesta", no. 11,896.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Laurentius Valla]], the humanist, was right in denouncing the [[Donation of Constantine]], and though the [[Magdeburg Centuriator]], [[Matthias Flacius]], was right in attacking the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], their methods, in themselves, were often crude and inconclusive. The modern discipline of [[diplomatics]] really dates only from the time of the Benedictine Dom [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707), whose fundamental work, ''De Re Diplomatica'' (Paris, 1681), was written to correct the principles advocated in the criticism of ancient documents by the [[Bollandist]], [[Daniel Papebroch]].

Scholars including [[Barthélemy Germon]] (1663–1718) and [[Jean Hardouin]] in France, and, to a lesser degree, [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] in England, rejected Mabillon's criteria; but all that has been done since Mabillon's time has been to develop his methods and occasionally to modify his judgements upon some point of detail. After the issue of a ''Supplement'' in 1704, a second, enlarged and improved edition of the ''De Re Diplomatica'' was prepared by Mabillon himself and published in 1709, after his death, by his pupil [[Thierry Ruinart]]. This pioneer work had not extended to any documents later than the thirteenth century and had taken no account of certain classes of papers, such as the ordinary letters of the popes and privileges of a more private character. Two other [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists, [[Dom Toustain]] and [[Dom Tassin]], compiled a work in six large quarto volumes, with many facsimiles etc., known as the ''Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique'' (Paris, 1750–1765). It was a small advance on Mabillon's own treatise, but was widely used; and was presented in a more summary form by [[François Jean de Vaines]], and others.

With the exception of some useful works directed at particular countries,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Maffei]], ''Istoria diplomatica'' (Mantua, 1727), unfinished; and [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori|Muratori]], "De Diplomatibus Antiquis", included in his ''Antiquitates Italicae'' (1740), vol. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; as also the treatise of [[Luigi Gaetano Marini]] on papyrus documents,&lt;ref&gt;''I papiri diplomatici'' (Rome, 1805)&lt;/ref&gt; no great advance was made in the science for a century and a half after Mabillon's death. The ''Dictionnaire raisonné de diplomatique chrétienne'' by [[Maximilien Quantin]], which forms part of Migne's ''Encyclopedia'', is a digest of older works; and the sumptuous ''Eléments de paléographie'' of [[de Wailly]] (2 vols, 1838) has little independent merit.
 
In the second half of the 19th century the field was active, with the names of [[Léopold Delisle]], the chief librarian of the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris, [[M. de Mas-Latrie]], professor at the Ecole de Chartres, and [[Julius von Pflugk-Harttung]], the editor of a series of facsimiles of papal Bulls. A calendar of early papal Bulls began appearing from 1902, the results of researches of P. Kehr, A. Brackmann, and W. Wiederhold, in ''Nachrichten der Göttingen Gesellsehaft der Wissenschaften''. [[Papal regesta]] were published, especially by members of the [[Ecole Française de Rome]].

==Subject-matter==

Officials concerned with the preparation of the documents collectively formed the [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs|Chancery]]. The constitution of the Chancery, which in the case of the [[Holy See]] seems to date back to a ''[[Notarius|schola notariorum]]'', with a ''[[primicerius]]'' at its head, of which we hear under [[Pope Julius I]] (337–352), varied from period to period, and the part played by the different officials composing it necessarily varied also. Besides the Holy See, each bishop also had some sort of chancery for the issue of his own episcopal Acts. The procedure of the Chancery is only a study preparatory to the examination of the document itself.

Secondly, we have the text of the document. As the position of the Holy See became more fully recognized, the business of the Chancery increased, and there arose a marked tendency to adhere strictly to the forms prescribed by traditional usage. Various collections of these formulae, of which the ''Liber Diurnus'' is one of the most ancient, were compiled at an early date. Many others will be found in the ''Recueil général des formules'' of Eugène de Rozière (Paris, 1861–1871), though these, like the series published by [[Zeumer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Formulae Merovingici et Karolini aevi'' (Hanover, 1886)&lt;/ref&gt; are mainly secular in character.

After the text of the document, which of course varies according to its nature, and in which not merely the wording but also the rhythm (the so-called ''cursus'') has often to be considered, attention must be paid:

* to the manner of dating
* to the signatures
* to the attestations of witnesses etc.
* to the seals and the attachment of the seals ([[sigillography]])
* to the material upon which it is written and to the manner of folding
* to the handwriting (including the science of [[palaeography]]).

All these matters fall within the scope of diplomatics, and all offer different tests for the authenticity of any given document. There are other details which often need to be considered, for example the [[Tironian notes]] (or shorthand), which are of not infrequent occurrence in primitive ''[[Urkunden]]'', both papal and imperial.&lt;ref&gt;See Tangl, "Die tironischen Noten", in ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'' (1907), vol. 1, pp. 87-166.&lt;/ref&gt; A special section in any comprehensive study of diplomatics is also likely to be devoted to spurious documents: the number is surprisingly great.

'''Paul Copan''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|p|æ|n}}&lt;!-- syllable stress missing --&gt;, born September 26, 1962) is a [[Christian]] [[theologian]], [[analytic philosopher]], [[apologist]], and author. He is currently a professor at the [[Palm Beach Atlantic University]] and holds the endowed Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and [[Ethics]]. He has written and edited over 25 books in the area of [[philosophy of religion]], [[apologetics]], [[theology]], [[science &amp; religion]], and the historicity of [[Jesus Christ]]. He has contributed many articles to professional journals and has written many essays for edited books. For six years he served as the president of the Evangelical Philosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pba.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=faculty.detail&amp;contactID=795 |title= Paul Copan |date= |website=Faculty Page |publisher=Palm Beach Atlantic University |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Paul Copan's father, Valery Copan, is of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] origin, and his mother, Valtraut (Kirsch) Copan, was born in Riga, Latvia.  He was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and then moved to [[Connecticut]] as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-03-17/features/0703150709_1_philosophy-book-religion |title=Paul Copan |date= |website=Sun Sentinel |publisher= |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980-1984, he attended Columbia International University and earned a B.A. degree in biblical studies. Copan attended Trinity International University, where he received his M.A. in philosophy of religion, as well as his M.Div. At Trinity International. Copan received the Prof. C.B. Bjuge Award for a thesis that “evidences creative scholarship in the field of Biblical and Systematic Theology.”

In May 2000, Copan received his Ph.D. in philosophy of religion from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His dissertation topic was "The Moral Dimensions of Michael Martin’s Atheology: A Critical Assessment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.paulcopan.com/cv/|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Copan_at_Tyndale.jpeg|thumb|right|Copan at [[Tyndale University College]]. His talk, "Slavery and Genocide? A Fresh Look at Two Old Testament Ethical Issues" addressed charges that the Old Testament condones slavery and genocide.]]
Copan started his career on the pastoral staff of First Presbyterian Church in [[Schenectady, NY]].

He served with Ravi Zacharias International Ministries and was Adjunct Associate Professor at [[Trinity International University]] ([[Deerfield, Illinois]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/author.pl/author_id=4 |title=Paul Copan |website=IVP |publisher=InterVarsity Press |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Adjunct Associate Professor of Theology and Philosophy at Bethel Seminary. He was Adjunct Associate Professor of Philosophy at Georgia Perimter College.

Currently, Copan is the Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics/Professor, Philosophy and Ethics at [[Palm Beach Atlantic University]] in [[West Palm Beach, FL]], where he received the Mentor of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Copan CV|url=http://www.paulcopan.com/cv/|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Atheism===
He has criticized the presumption of atheism, i.e. the notion that atheism should be one's default position when evaluating arguments over the existence of God. He argues that such a position rigs the rules, since atheism is just as much a claim to knowledge as theism. The only natural default position is agnosticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=The Presumptuousness of Atheism|journal=Christian Research Journal|date=Spring 1996|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copan cites atheists such as Baggini and [[Antony Flew|Flew]] in arguing that atheism is not a mere lack of belief but a rejection of belief in God or gods. He argues that atheists often slide into defending agnosticism when asked for reasons for their view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=Atheism and the Burden of Proof,|journal=Christian Enrichment Journal|date=Summer 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suggests that scientific naturalists will argue that all claims of knowledge have to be scientifically verifiable; otherwise, they are meaningless. Copan argues that such a position commits the fallacy exemplified in ''Horton Hears a Who''. "If you cannot see, hear or feel something, it does not exist." Copan argues that this position is an arbitrary philosophical (rather than scientific) pronouncement. He also argues that the position of the scientific naturalist is self-refuting because scientism itself cannot be scientifically verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=If You Cannot Scientifically Prove Your Belief, Is It Meaningless?|journal=Enrichment Journal|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copan also believes that belief in God is generally not a psychological crutch, claiming that the argument that Christianity is wish fulfillment itself falls victim to a number of fallacies. Freud himself admitted to Oskar Pfister that psychoanalysis of religion has no clinical evidence, and are merely Freud's personal views. Copan also argues that it is odd and arbitrary to claim that whatever brings comfort and solace is false. He notes that comforting father figure, while unique to the biblical faith, is not at the heart of the other world religions. Copan also notes that the wish fulfillment argument against Christianity is a classic example of the [[genetic fallacy]], claiming that because one can explain how the belief arose, that the belief is therefore false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=Is God Just a Psychological Crutch|journal=Enrichment Journal|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presuppositionalism===
Copan is also a critic of [[presuppositionalism]], arguing that Christians can use common ground to engage non-Christians in debate. He argues that presuppositionalism begs the question. It assumes that God exists in order to argue that God exists. Instead, Christians can begin dialogues with non-Christians with common ground such as the law of non-contradiction. Copan uses Genesis 9:6  to make his point. He claims that the image of God was not completely destroyed in the fall, meaning that non-Christians can respond to general revelation, arguments from cosmology and history, as well as personal testimony and living a godly life. Ultimately, Copan argues, presuppositionalism confuses private knowledge of God with public proclamation and argument for God. One can have epistemic certainty of God's existence from private experience and still appeal to public evidence to persuade others of that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=Questioning Presuppositionalism|url=http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2012/03/12/questioning-presuppositionalism/|publisher=The Gospel Coalition|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Testament Ethics===
Copan is known for his defense of the ethics of the Old Testament, particularly [[Divine command theory|divine command morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Sense of the Old Testament God|url=http://www.bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/is-god-a-moral-monster/323990|publisher=Baker Publishing Group|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warfare====
He argues that the books of Joshua and Judges are literarily connected, and therefore need to be read in light of one another. The book of Judges demonstrates that military engagement.  The sweeping words like “all,” “young and old,” and “man and woman,” however, are stock expressions for totality — even if women and children were not present. This stereotypical ancient Near East language of “all” people describes attacks on what turn out to be military forts or garrisons containing combatants — not a general population that includes women and children.

Copan states that we have no archaeological evidence of civilian populations at Jericho or Ai. At first glance, it appears that Joshua captured all the land, defeated all the kings, and destroyed all the Canaanites. Joshua later refers to nations that “remain among you,” and he warns Israel not to mention, swear by, serve, or bow down to their gods, indicating that he did fulfill the command, and yet did not literally obliterate the Canaanite population. Copan states that Joshua uses ancient conventional warfare rhetoric. He notes many other ancient Near East military accounts are full of bravado and exaggeration, depicting total devastation. Ancient Near East readers knew this was massive hyperbole and not literally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=How Could God Command Killing the Canaanites?|journal=Enrichment Journal|date=Fall 2010|pages=138–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slavery====
Copan argues that the Biblical concept of slavery is misunderstood. He says that we should compare Hebrew debt-servanthood (many translations render this “slavery”) more fairly to apprentice-like positions to pay off debts. This resembles indentured servitude during America’s founding when people worked for approximately 7 years to pay off the debt for their passage to the New World. Copan states that God did not allow physical abuse of servants. If a servant was harmed, for example, by having a tooth or eye knocked out, the servant received freedom immediately. Masters that killed their servants were put to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? An Overview|journal=Enrichment Journal|date=Spring 2011|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also argues that the New Testament is not silent on the issue of slavery. During the first century, 85 to 90 percent of Rome’s population consisted of slaves in both lowly and prestigious positions. This was a much higher percent than Israel had in the Old Testament, but this was due to Rome’s policies and laws. Copan uses James 3:9 to argue that the New Testament presupposes a fundamental equality because all humans are created in God’s image. Christian masters called Christian slaves “brothers” or “sisters.” The New Testament commanded masters to show compassion, justice, and patience. Their position as master meant responsibility and service, not oppression and privilege. Given the spiritual equality of slave and free, slaves even took on leadership positions in churches. He states that early Christians undermined slavery indirectly, rejecting many common Greco-Roman assumptions about it and acknowledging the intrinsic, equal worth of slaves.

Copan argues that if the New Testament authors had been too explicit about overthrowing Rome's slavery system, it would have done the gospel a disservice. Rome would have quashed any such flagrant opposition with speedy, lethal force. Copan concludes that the New Testament took a more subversive strategy, by opposing oppression, slave trade, and treating humans as cargo — which eventually led to a slavery-free Europe a few centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why Is the New Testament Silent on Slavery — or Is It?|journal=Enrichment Journal|date=Fall 2011|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imprecatory Psalms====
Copan defends the Old Testament imprecatory psalms, which are psalms that call down curses and divine judgments against Israel's enemies. He argues that they fit into the literary genre of the time. He states "Consider how you would react if a neighbor tried to seduce your daughter or give your children drugs. Outrage indicates that we care and take injustice seriously." Copan also compares these psalms to the emotional rants of Jeremiah, wishing he had remained in his mother’s womb until he died. Jeremiah's desire was one of emotional outburst, and he did not sincerely believe what he said. Copan argues that the imprecatory Psalms should be read in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copan|first=Paul|title=Hateful, Vindictive Psalms?|journal=Christian Research Journal|date=2008|volume=31|issue=5|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life==
Copan is married to Jacqueline Mariette (van Tol) Copan, the daughter of Dutch parents, and they have six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/LeeStrobel/2011/08/god-a-moral-monster/ |title=God: A Moral Monster |website=Bible Gateway |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18814">The '''philosophy of medicine''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that includes the [[epistemology]], [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]], and ethics of medicine. Perhaps the most well known area is [[medical ethics]], which overlaps with [[bioethics]]. It can be distinguished from the [[philosophy of healthcare]], which is mostly concerned with ethical and political issues arising from healthcare research and practice. There are a variety of university courses,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/research/research_centres/hpsmgroup/ Durham University History and Philosophy of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/B900-77 University of Oxford course on the History and Philosophy of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; journals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/medicine/journal/11019 Springer Journal, Medicine, Health Care, and Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/ Oxford Journals, Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/journal/11017 Springer Journal, Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pijush Kanti Bhattacharjee | year = 2014 | title = Working Philosophy of All Medicines | journal = International Journal of Advanced Engineering and Global Technology | volume = 2 | issue = 7| pages = 823–827 | url = http://ijaegt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IJAEGT-409192-Page-823-827-Pijush-updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Dov M.

There is also a new direction, or school, in the philosophy of medicine termed [[Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh|analytic philosophy of medicine]].

==Epistemology of medicine==

Epistemology is the study of knowledge. The ways in which health-care professionals (ranging from clinicians to biomedical scientists) come to know and use knowledge, whether as individuals or as groups, are central concerns of medical epistemology.  Many different claims to knowledge have been identified.&lt;ref name=Khushf-2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khushf G |title=A framework for understanding medical epistemologies |journal=The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=461–86 |year=2013 |pmid=24038643 |doi=10.1093/jmp/jht044 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence-based medicine===
[[Evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) is underpinned by the study of the ways in which we can gain knowledge regarding key clinical questions such as the effects of medical interventions, the accuracy of diagnostic tests, and the predictive value of prognostic markers. EBM provides an account of how medical knowledge can be applied to clinical care. EBM not only provides clinicians with a strategy for best [[Evidence-based practice|practice]], but also, underlying that, a philosophy of evidence.

Interest in the EBM philosophy of evidence has led philosophers to consider the nature of EBM’s [[hierarchy of evidence]], which rank different kinds of research methodology, ostensibly, by the relative evidential weight they provide. While [[Jeremy Howick]] provides a critical defense of EBM,&lt;ref name="Jeremy Howick"/&gt; most philosophers have raised questions about its legitimacy. Key questions asked about hierarchies of evidence concern the legitimacy of ranking methodologies in terms of the strength of support that they supply;&lt;ref name="La Caze 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = La Caze A | year = 2008 | title = Evidence-Based Medicine Can't Be… | url = | journal = Social Epistemology | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 353–379 | doi=10.1080/02691720802559438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Caze 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = La Caze A | year = 2009 | title = Evidence-Based Medicine Must Be … | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine and Philosophy | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 509–527 | doi=10.1093/jmp/jhp034}}&lt;/ref&gt; how instances of particular methods may move up and down a hierarchy;&lt;ref name="Guyatt et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guyatt G.H. | year = 2008 | title = GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 336 | issue = 7650| pages = 924–6 | pmid = 18436948 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.AD | pmc=2335261|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as how different types of evidence, from different levels in the hierarchies, should be combined. Critics of medical research have raised numerous questions regarding the unreliability of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Medical Nihilism |author=Jacob Stegenga |publisher=OUP |year=2018 |isbn= 9780198747048 | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=hr&amp;lang=en&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the epistemological virtues of particular aspects of [[clinical trial]] methodology have been examined, mostly notably the special place that is given to [[randomisation]],&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Papineau D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

==Ontology of medicine==

There is a large body of work on the ontology of biomedicine, including ontological studies of all aspects of medicine. Ontologies of specific interest to the philosophy of medicine include,
for instance: (1) the ontological revolution which made modern science, in general, possible, (2) Cartesian dualism which makes modern medicine, in particular, possible, (3) the monogenenic conception of disease which has informed clinical medicine for a century or so&lt;ref name="Lee 2012"&gt;Lee, K., 2012. The Philosophical Foundations of Modern Medicine, London/New York, Palgrave/Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the chemical and biological pathways which underlie the phenomena of health and disease in all organisms, (4) the conceptualization of entities such as ‘placebos’ and ‘placebo effects’.

===The ontology of general medical science===

The ontology of general medical science (OGMS) is an ontology of entities involved in a clinical encounter. It includes a set of logical definitions of very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', and 'patient'. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied also to other organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that is elaborated further by specific disease ontologies which extend it, including the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and the Mental Disease Ontology.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Cartesian dualism===

[[Descartes|René Descartes]] made ontological space for modern medicine by separating body from mind – while mind is superior to body as it constitutes the uniqueness of the human soul (the province of theology), body is inferior to mind as it is mere matter. Medicine simply investigated(s) the body as machine. While Cartesian dualism dominates clinical approaches to medical research and treatment, the legitimacy of the split between mind and body has been consistently challenged from a variety of perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewen|first1=Stuart|title=Typecasting: On the arts and sciences of human inequality|date=2009|publisher=Seven Stories Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagleton|first1=Terry|title=Materialism|date=2016|publisher=Yale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nosology and the monogenic conception of disease===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Modern medicine, unlike [[Galen|Galenic medicine]] (which dealt with [[humours]]), is [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]]. For example, when a bit of solid matter such as a poison or a worm impacts upon another bit of matter (when it enters the human body), this sets off a chain of motions, giving rise to disease, just as when one billiard ball knocks into another billiard, the latter is set in motion. When the human body is exposed to the solid pathogen, it falls ill, giving rise to the notion of a disease entity. Later in the history of modern medicine, particularly by the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, in nosology (which is the classification of disease), the most powerful is the etiogically-defined approach as can be found in the monogenic conception of disease which covers not only infectious agents (bacteria, viruses. fungi, parasites, prions) but also genetics, poisons. While clinical medicine is concerned with the ill health of the individual patient when s/he has succumbed to disease, epidemiology is concerned with the pattern of diseases in populations in order to study their causes as well as how to manage, control, ameliorate the problems identified under study.

Clinical medicine, as presented above, is part of a reductionist approach to disease, based ultimately on Cartesian dualism which says that the proper study of medicine is an investigation of the body when the latter is viewed as machine. A machine can exhaustively be broken down into its component parts and their respective functions; in the same way, the dominant approach to clinical research and treatment assumes the human body can be broken down/analysed in terms of its component parts and their respective functions, such as its internal and external organs, the tissues and bones of which they are composed, the cells which make up the tissues, the molecules which constitute the cell, down to the atoms (the DNA sequences) which make up the cell in the body.

===Placebo===

[[Placebo]]s and placebo effects have generated years of conceptual confusion about what kinds of thing they are.&lt;ref name="Grünbaum 1981"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grünbaum A | year = 1981 | title = The Placebo Concept | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 157–167 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(81)90040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gøtzsche 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gøtzsche P.C. | year = 1994 | title = Is there logic in the placebo? | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 344 | issue = 8927| pages = 925–926 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92273-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunn 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nunn R | year = 2009 | title = It's time to put the placebo out of our misery | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 338 | issue = | page = b1568 | doi=10.1136/bmj.b1568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Turner A | year = 2012 | title = Placebos" and the logic of placebo comparison | url = | journal = Biology &amp; Philosophy | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 419–432 | doi = 10.1007/s10539-011-9289-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holman|first1=Bennett|title=Why Most Sugar Pills are Not Placebos|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=2015|volume=82|issue=5|pages=1330–1343|doi=10.1086/683817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example definitions of a placebo may refer to their inertness or pharmacological inactivity in relation to the condition they are given for. Similarly, example definitions of placebo effects may refer to the subjectivity or the non-specificity of those effects.&lt;ref name="Shapiro &amp; Shapiro 1997"&gt;Shapiro, A.K. &amp; Shapiro, E., 1997. The Powerful Placebo, London: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These type of definition suggest the view that when given a placebo treatment, one may merely feel better while not being ‘really’ better.

The distinctions at work in these types of definition: between active and inactive/inert, specific and non-specific, and subjective and objective, have been problematized.&lt;ref name="Grünbaum 1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Brody 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Miller F.G. |author2=Brody H. | year = 2011 | title = Understanding and Harnessing Placebo Effects: Clearing Away the Underbrush | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine and Philosophy | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 69–78 | pmid = 21220523 | doi=10.1093/jmp/jhq061 | pmc=3916752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howick 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Howick J | date = Sep 2009 | title = UQuestioning the methodologic superiority of 'placebo' over 'active' controlled trials | url = | journal = American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 9 | issue = 9| pages = 34–48 | pmid = 19998192 | doi=10.1080/15265160903090041}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if placebos are inactive or inert, then how do they cause placebo effects? More generally, there is scientific evidence from research investigating placebo phenomena which demonstrates that, for certain conditions (such as pain), placebo effects can be both specific and objective in the conventional sense.&lt;ref name="Benedetti 2009"&gt;Benedetti, F., 2009. Placebo Effects: Understanding the mechanisms in health and disease, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to define placebos and placebo effects therefore shift focus away from these distinctions and onto therapeutic effects that are caused or modulated by the context in which a treatment is delivered and the meaning that different aspects of treatments have for patients.&lt;ref name="Moerman 2002"&gt;Moerman, D.E., 2002. Meaning, Medicine, and the "Placebo Effect," Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson J.J. |author2=Ritenbaugh C. |author3=Nichter M. | year = 2009 | title = Reconsidering the Placebo Response from a Broad Anthropological Perspective | url = | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 112–152 | doi=10.1007/s11013-008-9122-2|pmc=2730465}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 	 	
The problems arising over the definition of placebos and their effects may be said to be the heritage of Cartesian dualism, under which mind and matter are understood as two different substances. Furthermore, Cartesian dualism endorses a form of materialism which permits matter to have an effect on matter, or even matter to work on mind (epiphenomenalism, which is the raison d’être of psycho-pharmacology), but does not permit mind to have any effect on matter. This then means that medical science has difficulty in entertaining even the possibility that placebo effects are real, exist and may be objectively determinable and finding such reports difficult if not impossible to comprehend and/or accept. Yet such reports which appear to be genuine pose a threat to Cartesian dualism which provides the ontological underpinning for biomedicine especially in its clinical domain.&lt;ref name="Lee 2012" /&gt;

==Metaphysics==

Although most areas of study within the Philosophy of Medicine are concerned with matters of epistemology, there is a growing interest in the metaphysics of medicine,&lt;ref name="Worrall 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Worrall J | year = 2011 | title = Causality in medicine: Getting back to the Hill top | url = | journal = Preventive Medicine | volume = 53 | issue = 4-5| pages = 235–238 | pmid = 21888926 | doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the idea of [[causality]].  Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena. Causation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships, e.g. what causes disease, or what causes people to get better.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cartwright N | year = 2009 | title = What are randomised controlled trials good for? | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 147 | issue = 1| pages = 59–70 | doi = 10.1007/s11098-009-9450-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the idea of cause is central to this philosophy. The scientific processes used to generate causal knowledge give clues to the metaphysics of causation. For example, the defining feature of [[randomised controlled trials]] (RCTs) is that they are thought to establish causal relationships, whereas [[observational studies]] do not.&lt;ref name="Hill 1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bradford Hill A | year = 1965 | title = The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 295–300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, causation can be considered as something which is counterfactually dependent, i.e. the way RCTs differ from observational studies is that they have a comparison group in which the intervention of interest is not given. 
	 	 	
At least two different causal paradigms in biomedicine have been identified – the Humean, linear, mono-factorial paradigm championed mainly in clinical medicine; and the non-linear, reciprocal, multi-factorial paradigm invoked in epidemiology.&lt;ref name="Lee 2012" /&gt;

'''Philosophy of psychedelics''' is the philosophical investigation of the [[psychedelic experience]]. While [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[entheogenic]] or [[hallucinogenic]] substances have been used by many traditional cultures throughout history mostly for religious purposes, recorded philosophical speculation and analysis of these substances, their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] effects and the relevance of these [[altered states of consciousness]] to philosophical questions is a relatively late phenomenon in the [[history of philosophy]]. Traditional cultures who use psychedelic substances such as the Amazonian and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indigenous Mexican]] peoples hold that ingesting medicinal plants such as [[Ayahuasca]] and [[Peyote]] allows one to commune with the beings of the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].

==Indian philosophy==
The Indian Yogi and scholar [[Patanjali]] in his Yoga sutras mentions that mystic powers (''siddhaya'') can arise from certain "herbs" or "healing plants"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Arthur Berriedale; Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 1; Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt; (''osadhi''):

:janmauṣadhi-mantra-tapaḥ samādhi jāḥ siddhayaḥ||
:The mystic powers arise due to birth, herbs, [[mantras]], the performance of austerity and [[samadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary, chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

Later commentators on the Yoga sutras like [[Vyasa]] mention elixirs of the [[asuras]], and also state these herbal concoctions can be found in this world. [[Adi Shankara]] meanwhile refers to the Vedic drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary, chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vajrayana]] Buddhist [[Tantras]] mention the nectar "[[amrita]]" (literally "immortal", "deathless") which was drunk during rituals and which is associated in the tradition with 'spiritual intoxication'.&lt;ref&gt;Gimian, Carolyn Rose; The Essential Chogyam Trungpa, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; A biography of the scholar [[Gampopa]] mentions how one of his teachers stated that "You can obtain [[Buddhahood]]: by taking a medicine pill which will make you immortal like the sun and moon."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. M. The Life of Gampopa, The Incomparable Dharma Lord of Tibet, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, N. Y., USA, 1995, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to the Vajrayana practice of [[rasayana]] (Skt: "alchemy") to create certain potions or pills. According to M.L. Walter's study of Indo-Tibetan rasayana, ingestion of these substances were said to "strengthen the yogin and procure the [[siddhi]] for him, as well as bringing him to the final goal." &lt;ref&gt;Walter, M. L, Preliminary Results from a study of two Rasayana systems in Indo-Tibetan Esoterism published in Tibetan Studies in Honour of Hugh Richardson (M. Aris, ed.), Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd., Warminster, England 1980, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mike Crowley there are two traditions of Indo Tibetan-rasayana preserved in Tibet, one founded by [[Padmasambhava]] and the other by his contemporary, [[Vimalamitra]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Mike; When the Gods Drank Urine A Tibetan myth may help solve the riddle of soma, sacred drug of ancient India, Fortean Studies, vol. III, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chogyam Trungpa]] (1939 – 1987), a modern teacher is the [[Kagyu]] tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;amrita... is used in conferring the second abhisheka, the secret abhisheka. This transmission dissolves the student's mind into the mind of the teacher of the lineage. In general, amrita is the principle of intoxicating extreme beliefs, belief in ego, and dissolving the boundary between confusion and sanity so that coemergence can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, C.; Sacred Outlook: The Vajrayogini Shrine and Practice (in The Silk Route and the Diamond Path, D. E. Klimburg-Salter, editor ), UCLA Art Council, Los Angeles, 1982, page 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==19th century==
European literature such as [[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]] by [[Thomas De Quincey]] (one of the first English commentators on [[Kant]])&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, James Hutchison (1867). "De Quincey and Coleridge Upon Kant," Fortnightly Review, Vol. 8, pp. 377–97.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Kubla Khan]] described the use and phenomenal character of mind-altering substances such as [[Opium]]. De Quincey held that [[Opium]] allowed one to access the earliest of memories and that therefore no memories were ever truly forgotten:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The minutest incidents of childhood, or forgotten scenes of later years, were often revived: I could not be said to recollect them; for if I had been told of them when waking, I should not have been able to acknowledge them as parts of my past experience. But placed as they were before me, in dreams like intuitions, and clothed in all their evanescent circumstances and accompanying feelings, I recognized them instantaneously […] I feel assured that there is no such thing as forgetting possible to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Quincey, Thomas de.  Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and Other Writings.London: Penguin Books, 2003, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]], who reported his experiments with mental patients and drugs, believed that “the hashish experience was a way to gain insight into mental disease.”&lt;ref&gt;Nahas, Gabriel G.  Marihuana—Deceptive Weed.  New York: Raven Press, 1973. see: Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism http://evitanza.bol.ucla.edu/baudelaire.html#_ftn15&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Poet [[Baudelaire]] wrote about the effects of [[Hashish]] and [[Opium]] in [[Les Paradis artificiels]] (1860) and theorized about how they could be used to allow the individual to reach "ideal" states of mind. Charles Baudelaire was member of the '[[Club des Hashischins]]', a Parisian literary group dedicated to the exploration of altered states of consciousness which included [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]] and literary figures such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gerard de Nerval]], [[Honore de Balzac]], and [[Theophile Gautier]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinthal, C. F. (2012). Drugs, behavior, and modern society. (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire's opinion of the drug was generally negative, believing that it weakened and dampened artistic capacities, the personal Will and even the very identity of the hashish eater. He compared it to suicide and a false happiness, and saw wine as the true intoxicant of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Vitanza, Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The Hasheesh Eater]] (1857) an autobiographical book by [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] became popular. Ludlow wrote that a [[Marijuana]] user sought "the soul’s capacity for a broader being, deeper insight, grander views of Beauty, Truth and Good than she now gains through the chinks of her cell."&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Fitz Hugh "The Visionary", The Hasheesh Eater 1857&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[William James]] was one of the first academic philosophers to write about the effects of hallucinogenic substances in his ''The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide'' (1882) in which he writes that the gas can produce a "tremendously exiting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination. Truth lies open to the view in depth beneath depth of almost blinding evidence. The mind sees all logical relations of being with an apparent subtlety and instantaniety to which its normal consciousness offers no parallel".&lt;ref&gt;James; ''The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide'' (1882), https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the experience gave him the sense that the philosophy of [[Hegel]] was true. In his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' he likewise writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide … stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree. … [In] the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysical revelation. … [Our] normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.&lt;ref&gt;James, William; The Varieties of Religious Experience, ch. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==20th century== 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

After using [[mescaline]] in 1953, [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote the [[Doors of Perception]] where he advanced the theory that psychedelic compounds could produce mystical experiences and knowledge, "what the visionary, the medium, even the mystic were talking about" and what eastern philosophy described with terms like [[Satcitananda]], the Godhead, [[Suchness]], [[Shunyata|Void]], [[Anatta|Not-self]] and [[Dharmakaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, The Doors of Perception&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also quotes the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]], which held that the brain and nervous might act as a reducing valve of all the stimuli in the universe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially [[Mind at Large]]. But in so far as we are animals, our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this Particular planet.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, The Doors of Perception&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley wrote that it was possible that certain human beings could, through drugs, meditation, etc. circumvent the 'reducing valve' and experience something far beyond everyday consciousness. This experience Huxley saw as the source of all mysticism, a theory termed the [[Perennial philosophy]]. He also discusses art and the legality of various drugs in the West as well as arguing for the importance for self-transcendence. Huxley's philosophical novel [[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]] also described a Utopian society that used a psychedelic substance for spiritual purposes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the early 1960s a group that eventually came to be called "Harvard Psychedelic Club" which included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Huston Smith]] and [[Ram Dass]] administered psychedelics to Harvard students. The group experimented with psychedelics in experiments such as the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. Huston Smith's last work, [[Cleansing the Doors of Perception]], describes the Harvard Project in which he participated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ram Dass' [[Be Here Now (book)|Be here now]] and Tim Leary's [[The Psychedelic Experience|The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead]] compared the psychedelic experiences to [[eastern philosophy]] and mystical states of consciousness. These books further popularized the idea that eastern - particularly Indian philosophical and spiritual insights could be obtained from using psychedelics. One of these experiences described in ''The Psychedelic Experience'' is that of [[ego death]] or depersonalization.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The idea that the psychedelic experience could grant access to eastern spiritual insights was also promoted by the popular philosopher [[Alan Watts]] in his writings such as ''The Joyous Cosmology'', who also argued that one should not remain dependent on them for spiritual growth: "If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen."&lt;ref&gt;The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various psychologists during the 1960s also studied psychedelic substances and worked with [[Psychedelic therapy]] and later developed various theories about their effects and significance. [[Stanislav Grof]] is known for his extensive work in LSD psychotherapy and for developing a theory which stated that the psychedelic experience allowed one to relive birth trauma and to explore the depths of the unconscious mind. Grof observed four levels of the LSD experience, which for him correspond to areas of the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences (2) Psychodynamic experiences (3) Perinatal experiences, and (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof defined the last level as "experiences involving an expansion or extension of consciousness beyond the usual ego boundaries and beyond the limitations of time and/or space."&lt;ref&gt;PSYPRESSUK CONTRIBUTORS; Realms of the Human Unconscious by Stanislav Grof PUBLISHED JANUARY 19, 2011 · UPDATED FEBRUARY 5, 2015, http://psypressuk.com/2011/01/19/literary-review-realms-of-the-human-unconscious-by-stanislav-grof/&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Transpersonal psychology]] focuses on this type of experience. Grof included topics such as consciousness, mysticism and metaphysics in his later writings.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The scientist and philosopher [[John C. Lilly]] discussed his experiments with psychedelics and [[altered states of consciousness]] in [[The Center of the Cyclone: An Autobiography of Inner Space]] and Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer. Other psychologists who studied and wrote on psychedelic use include [[Walter Pahnke]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Claudio Naranjo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

According to writer James Oroc, the 1990s brought about a second phase in modern psychedelic culture. The 'philosophical foundation' of this new wave of psychedelic thought was based on the works of [[Alexander Shulgin]], [[Alex Grey]] and [[Terence McKenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Oroc, James; The Second Psychedelic Revolution, http://realitysandwich.com/216613/the-second-psychedelic-revolution-part-one-the-end-of-acid/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refexample|section|date=March 2017}}
Neuroscientist [[Rick Strassman]] has written about his research into the psychedelic [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine]] in his book ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule'' (2001). In his book Strassman investigates the possible connection between natural DMT in mystical and [[Near Death Experiences]] and psychedelic states caused by outwardly administered DMT. He also describes the psychedelic experiences of the volunteers in his experiments and their encounter with certain strange "beings" after being administered DMT.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In his study of recent scientific research on psychedelics and its [[neurophilosophy]] (''Neuropsychedelia'', 2012), Nicolas Langlitz has argued that Huxley's view expressed in the Doors of perception of the brain as a "reducing valve" which when released produced a perennial mystical experience has been a very influential theory among contemporary psychopharmacologists who study psychedelics, who have given it a materialist 'neurobiological reinterpretation' which he calls “mystic materialism”.&lt;ref&gt;Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR
PSYCHEDELICS IN PHILOSOPHY? Fieldwork in Neuro- and Perennial Philosophy, http://www.nicolaslanglitz.de/nicolaslanglitz.de/Texts_files/Langlitz%202016%20-%20IS%20THERE%20A%20PLACE%20FOR%20PSYCHEDELICS%20IN%20PHILOSOPHY%3F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Langlitz defines this as: "a this-worldly mysticism that reveres not transcendence but biological life" and holds to a certain "metaphysical unity of the world".&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Metzinger]] has discussed the effects of substances such as LSD, dimethyltryptamine, and mescaline in his ''Being No One'' (2003). Metzinger describes the hallucinatory component of the psychedelic experience as "epistemically vacuous" i.e. it provides no [[epistemic]] knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR
PSYCHEDELICS IN PHILOSOPHY? Fieldwork in Neuro- and Perennial Philosophy, http://www.nicolaslanglitz.de/nicolaslanglitz.de/Texts_files/Langlitz%202016%20-%20IS%20THERE%20A%20PLACE%20FOR%20PSYCHEDELICS%20IN%20PHILOSOPHY%3F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, Metzinger still believes that philosophers and consciousness researchers would have much to gain if they were "well traveled in phenomenal state space, if they were cultivated in terms of the richness of their own inner experience" through the psychedelic experience.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt; According to Metzinger, psychedelic experiences could change researchers' theoretical intuitions as well as serving as a form of 'mental culture', an analogue to [[Physical culture]].&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher [[Sam Harris]] has discussed his use of psychedelics in his book [[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]] which also attempts to argue for a [[spiritual naturalism|naturalized spirituality]].

Another contemporary philosopher write about psychedelics is Peter Sjöstedt-H. His recent ''Noumenautics'' (2015) discusses psychedelic phenomenology and its metaphysical implications. 

In his encyclopedic overview of psychedelic culture and thought ''Psychedelia'' (2012), [[Patrick Lundborg]] developed a psychedelic philosophy he called "Unified Psychedelic Theory" (UPT) which draws from [[Platonism]], the phenomenology of [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Paul D. MacLean]]'s [[Triune brain]] theory, the work of [[Eugen Fink]] and other thinkers.

'''Radim Palouš''' (6 November 1924 – 10 September 2015) was a Czech dissident, philosopher, educator, and former spokesman for [[Charter 77]], and from 1990 to 1994, was the rector of [[Charles University]] in Prague.

==Life==
Palouš was born into a family of journalists and active athletes. After graduating in Prague, he was placed in forced labor during [[World War II]]. From 1945 onwards, he studied philosophy at [[Charles University]] (taught by [[Jan Patočka]]), and in 1948 he defended his doctoral thesis on [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk]]s philosophy of youth. He worked as a teacher and studied chemistry at the pedagogical branch in Charles University, where, since 1957, he worked as an assistant. He was qualified in the field of education (Labour School of the modern age), and dealt with the work of [[John Amos Comenius|Comenius]] and on modern teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;J. Beránek, Dobrodružství pobytu vezdejšího, Prague 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions enriched the philosophy of education in [[Czechoslovakia]].

In 1976, he signed [[Charter 77]], and from 1982 to 1983 he was its spokesman. Since 1989 until his death, he was a member of the Masaryk Democratic Movement. In November 1989, as one of the representatives of the [[Civic Forum]], he participated in meetings and negotiations during the [[Velvet Revolution]] to release [[Czechoslovakia]] from its Communist rule. In January 1990, he became the rector of Charles University. He participated in the restoration of the reform of higher education and to restore international relations with the [[United Kingdom]]. Throughout his times, he traveled and lectured in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia and received nine honorary doctorates (eight at foreign universities and one in the Czech Republic). For his work in publishing writings on Patočka, he was awarded the Prize of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, and most notably, for his lifelong work, the third class of the [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in 1997.

On 10 September 2015, Radim Palouš died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/zemrel-radim-palous-prvni-rektor-univerzity-karlovy-po-roce-1989/1257150 |title=Zemřel Radim Palouš, první rektor Univerzity Karlovy po roce 1989 - ČeskéNoviny.cz |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz |date=2015-09-11 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8381">[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-15750, Ausstellung "Deutsches Volk-Deutsche Arbeit".jpg|thumb|right|Nazi German architecture mixing modernist design with the antiquated, ancient [[Swastika]] symbol]]
"'''Reactionary modernism'''" is a term first coined by [[Jeffrey Herf]] in his 1984 book, ''Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich'', to describe the mixture of "great enthusiasm for modern [[technology]] with a rejection of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the values and institutions of [[liberal democracy]]" which was characteristic of the German [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Herf&gt;[https://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=651 The Totalitarian Present: Why the West Consistently Underplays the Power of Bad Ideas, Jeffrey Herf, The American Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this ideology of reactionary [[modernism]] was closely linked to the original, positive view of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'', which saw Germany as the great Central European power neither of the West nor of the East.

Herf's application of the term to describe [[fascism]] has been widely echoed by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous, ''Fascism'', University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Herf had used the term to denote a trend in intellectual thought during the era, what German novelist [[Thomas Mann]] had described as "a highly technological romanticism" during the interwar years. Herf used the term in reference to a wide range of German cultural figures, including [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Carl Schmitt]], and [[Hans Freyer]].

==Reception of the concept==
Historian Nicolas Guilhot has broadened the scope of reactionary modernism, applying the term to trends in [[Weimar Republic]] industry, medicine ([[eugenics]]), mass politics, and social engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guilhot|first=Nicolas|title=The Invention of International Relations Theory: Realism, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the 1954 Conference on Theory|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231152679|pages=213–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactionary modernism can be seen in the fascist concept of the [[New Man (utopian concept)|New Man]], as well as in art movements of [[Weimar culture]] that emphasized rationalism and embraced [[Futurism]] and the [[New Objectivity]]. Many Weimar period artists rejected the Futurists' [[fetishization]] of machinery and violence, for example the proponents of [[German Expressionism]]. Despite this, the [[return to order]] became a dominant theme in German culture and in that of other European countries.

Reactionary modernism has been explored as a theme in the interwar literature and broader political culture of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|title=Women Modernists and Fascism|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107008526|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been examined in the context of other European countries during the interwar period, including Romania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotoi|first=Calin|title=Nationalisms Today|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783039118830|pages=125|editor=Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski|chapter=Reactionary Modernism in Interwar Romania: Anton Golopentia and the Geopoliticization of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bien|first=Peter|title=Greek Modernism and Beyond: Essays in Honor of Peter Bien|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847685776|pages=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pietikäinen|first=Petteri|title=Neurosis and Modernity: The Age of Nervousness in Sweden|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004160750|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Jensen, Irrational Triumph: Cultural Despair, Military Nationalism, and the Ideological Origins of Franco's Spain (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2001), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been examined in the context of fascism in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tansman|first=Alan|title=The Culture of Japanese Fascism|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822344681|pages=336–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians acknowledge the term's recognition of an influential trend in European philosophical, cultural and political thought during the period when fascism was on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Critchley|first=Simon|title=Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192853592|pages=N.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the neologism was created by Herf, it has gained mainstream currency with historians in discussing the paradoxical European enthusiasm for paternalistic authoritarianism and [[volkish]] nationalism on the one hand, and new technological and political concepts on the other hand, all under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Dyke|first=James A.|title=Franz Radziwill and the Contradictions of German Art History, 1919-45|year=2010|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472116287|pages=1|chapter=Introduction: Reactionary Modernism and the Problem of Nazi Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herf now applies the term to claim similarity to the governments of [[Iran]] under the Ayatollahs, the government of [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]], and extremist [[Islamist]] groups such as [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name=Herf/&gt; Other scholars, including [[Paul Berman]], have also applied Herf's term to radical  Islamism.&lt;ref&gt;Power and the idealists, or, The passion of Joschka Fischer and its aftermath, Paul Berman, Soft Skull Press, 2005, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fascism, Mark Neocleous, University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New World Empire: Civil Islam, Terrorism, and the Making of Neoglobalism, William H. Thornton, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radical Islam: Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, Emmanuel Sivan, Yale University Press, 1990, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Richard Barbrook]] argues that members of the [[digerati]], who adhere to the [[Californian Ideology]], embrace a form of reactionary modernism which combines [[economic growth]] with [[social stratification]].&lt;ref name="Barbrook 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Richard Barbrook|Barbrook, Richard]] | title = Cyber-Communism: How The Americans Are Superseding Capitalism In Cyberspace | year = 1999 | url = http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/cyber-communism-how-the-americans-are-superseding-capitalism-in-cyberspace/ | accessdate = 2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rohkrämer criticized the concept of reactionary modernism, arguing "It is simply not strange or 'paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace technology at the same time', but a common practice in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany as well as in many other countries. Instrumental reason and technology are available for an endless number of different purposes, many of which are not humane or enlightened".&lt;ref&gt;Rohkämer, Thomas, [http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/21039/1/download.pdf  "Antimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism. Technocratic Tendencies in Germany, 1890-1945"], accessed 28/12/2016, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Support for this view also came from Roger Griffin, who argued "[F]ascism as an ''ideology'' and ''movement'' can be seen as proposing a radical alternative to liberal and socialist visions of what form modernity ideally should take. It represents an uncompromising rejection both of thorough-going liberalism and extreme 'modernism', whose logical culmination it sees as relativism, anomie, subjectivism, and the loss of definitive meaning and 'eternal' values. It is an attempt to re-anchor modern human beings within that highly modern phenomenon, the totalitarian state (a term used positively by Fascism) through consciously manipulated historical, national and racist myth (all deeply modern ideological constructs)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin|Griffin, Roger]], [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.194.6474&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Modernity under the New Order: The Fascist Project for Managing the Future"], published by Thamesman Publications, Oxford Brookes School of Business imprint, 1994, accessed 28/12/2016, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Adams''' (January 21, 1928 – March 2, 1997) was an American [[Non-dualism|Advaita]] teacher. In his late teens, he was a devotee of [[Sri Ramana Maharshi]] in [[Tiruvannamalai]], India.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=22}} In later life Adams held [[satsang]] with a small group of devotees in [[California]], US.{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=94}} He mainly advocated the path of [[jnana yoga|jñāna yoga]]{{refn|group=note|Jñāna means 'knowledge' in [[Sanskrit]]. The pronunciation can be approximated to 'gyaan yoga'.}} with an emphasis on the practice of [[self-enquiry]].{{sfn|Parker|2009|p=32}}

Adams' teachings were not well known in his lifetime, but have since been widely circulated amongst those investigating the [[philosophy]] of Advaita and the Western devotees of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.{{sfn|Waite|2010|p=13}}{{refn|group=note|[[Bhagavan]] means God, Sri is an honorific title, Ramana is a short form of Venkataraman, and Maharshi means 'great seer' in Sanskrit.}} A book of his teachings, ''Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams,'' was published in 1999.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Robert Adams was born on January 21, 1928 in [[Manhattan]]{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=21}} and grew up in [[New York City]], USA.{{sfn|Muzika|1998|p=86}} Adams claimed that from as far back as he could remember, he had had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of a white haired, bearded man seated at the foot of his bed, who was about two feet tall, and who used to talk to him in a language which he did not understand.{{sfn|Krushel|2010|p=40}} He told his parents but they thought he was playing games. He would later find out that this man was a vision of his future [[guru]] Sri Ramana Maharshi. At the age of seven, Adams's father died and the visitations suddenly stopped.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=21}}

Adams said that he then developed a [[siddhi]] whereby whenever he wanted something, from a candy bar to a violin, all he needed to do was say the name of the object three times and the desired object would appear from somewhere, or be given to him by someone.{{sfn|Ullman|2001|p=191}} If there was a test at school Adams would simply say 'God, God, God' and the answers would immediately come to him; no prior study was necessary.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=21}}

=== Awakening ===
{{Main|Enlightenment (spiritual)}} 
Adams claimed to have had a profound [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual awakening]] at the age of fourteen. It was the end of term finals maths test{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=94}} and Adams had not studied for it at all. As was his custom he said 'God' three times, but with a phenomenal and unintended outcome:{{sfn|Ullman|2001|p=191}}

{{quote|Instead of the answers coming, the room filled with light, a thousand times more brilliant than the sun. It was like an atomic bomb, but it was not a burning light. It was a beautiful, bright, shining, warm glow. Just thinking of it now makes me stop and wonder. The whole room, everybody, everything was immersed in light. All the children seemed to be myriads particles of light. I found myself melting into radiant being, into consciousness. I merged into consciousness. It was not an out of body experience. This was completely different. I realised that I was not my body. What appeared to be my body was not real. I went beyond the light into pure radiant consciousness. I became omnipresent. My individuality had merged into pure absolute bliss. I expanded. I became the universe. The feeling is indescribable. It was total bliss, total joy. The next thing I remembered was the teacher shaking me. All the students had gone. I was the only one left in the class. I returned to human consciousness. That feeling has never left me.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=21}}}}
Not long after this experience, Adams went to the school library to do a book report. While passing through the philosophy section he came across a book on [[yoga]] masters. Having no idea what yoga was, he opened the book and for the first time saw a photo of the man he had experienced visions of as a young child, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=21}}
[[File:Paramahansa Yogananda Standard Pose.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]]]

=== Journey to the Guru ===
{{Main|Guru}} 
At the age of 16, Adams' first [[Spirituality|spiritual]] mentor was [[Joel S. Goldsmith]], a [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] from New York,{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=22}} whom he used to visit in Manhattan, in order to listen to his sermons. Goldsmith helped Adams to better understand his enlightenment and advised him to go and see [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]. Adams did so and visited Yogananda at the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] in [[Encinitas]], California, where he intended to be initiated as a [[monk]].{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=22}}
However, after speaking to him, Yogananda felt that Adams had his own path and should go to India.{{sfn|Krushel|2010|p=40}} He told him that his [[satguru]] was Sri Ramana Maharshi and that he should go to him as soon as possible because Ramana Maharshi's body was old and in ill-health. Sri Ramana Maharshi lived at [[Sri Ramana Ashram|Sri Ramanasramam]] at the foot of [[Arunachala]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[South India]].{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=22}}

=== Ramana Maharshi ===
{{Main|Ramana Maharshi}} 
With $14,000 of inheritance money from a recently deceased aunt, Adams set off for India and his guru Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1946:{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=94}}

{{quote|When I was eighteen years old, I arrived at Tiruvannamalai. In those days they didn’t have jet planes. It was a propeller plane. I purchased flowers and a bag of fruit to bring to Ramana. I took the rickshaw to the ashram. It was about 8:30 a.m. I entered the hall and there was Ramana on his couch reading his mail. It was after breakfast. I brought the fruit and the flowers over and laid them at his feet. There was a guardrail in front of him to prevent fanatics from attacking him with love. And then I sat down in front of him. He looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. I have been to many teachers, many saints, many sages. I was with Nisargadatta, Anandamayi Ma, Papa Ramdas, Neem Karoli Baba and many others, but never did I meet anyone who exuded such compassion, such love, such bliss as Ramana Maharshi.&lt;ref group=web name="ramana"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.co.uk/2008/06/robert-adams-again.html Godman, David (2008, June 11th), Arunachala and Sri Ramana Maharshi Blog - ''Robert Adams Again'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Ramana 3 sw.jpg|170px|left|thumb|[[Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi]]]]

Adams stayed at Sri Ramanasramam for the final three years of Sri Ramana Maharshi's life.{{sfn|Whitwell|2004|p=84}} Over the course of this time he had many conversations with Sri Ramana Maharshi, and through abiding in his presence was able to confirm and further understand his own experience of awakening to the non-dual [[Ātman (Hinduism)|''Self'']].{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=22}}
After Sri Ramana Maharshi left the body in 1950 Adams spent a further seventeen years travelling around India{{refn|group=note|[[Arthur Osborne (writer)|Arthur Osborne]], a writer and devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi, was reputed to have given some money to Adams in order for him to travel around India after Sri Ramana Maharshi died.{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=94}}}} and stayed with well known gurus such as [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]],{{refn|group=note|Adams is said to have stayed six months with Nisargadatta Maharaj, at the time when [[Ramesh Balsekar]] was his interpreter.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=23}}}} [[Anandamayi Ma]], [[Neem Karoli Baba]] and [[Swami Ramdas]] to name but a few. He also spent time with less well-known teachers such as Swami Brahmadanda "the Staff of God" in the [[Sapta Puri|holy city]] of [[Varanasi]].{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=25}}

=== Later years ===

In the 1960s Adams returned to the United States and lived in [[Hawaii]] and [[Los Angeles]] before finally moving to [[Sedona]], [[Arizona]]{{sfn|Muzika|1998|p=138}} in the mid 1990s.{{refn|group=note|Clear biographical details of Adams' life, from the 1950s up until the 1990s, are hard to come by as he rarely talked about his past.{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=93}}}} He was married to Nicole Adams and fathered two daughters. In the 1980s Adams developed [[Parkinson's Disease]],{{sfn|Muzika|1998|p=89}} which forced him to settle in one location and receive the appropriate care.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=25}} A small group of devotees soon grew up around him and in the early 1990s he gave weekly [[satsang]]s in the [[San Fernando Valley]], along with other surrounding areas of Los Angeles.{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=94}} These satsangs were both recorded and transcribed.{{sfn|Waite|2010|p=380}} After several years of deteriorating health, Adams died on March 2, 1997{{sfn|Ramamani|1997|p=94}} in Sedona, Arizona, where he was surrounded by family members and devotees. He died at the age of 69 from [[cancer of the liver]].{{sfn|Muzika|1998|p=85}}

== Teachings ==

=== Confessions of a Jnani ===
{{See also|Jnana Yoga|Jnana}} 
{{Rquote|right|The teacher is really yourself. You have created a teacher to wake you up. The teacher would not be here if you were not dreaming about the teacher. You have created a teacher out of your mind in order to awaken, to see that there is no teacher, no world - nothing. You've done this all by yourself.|Robert Adams|''The Mountain Path''{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=24}}}}

Adams did not consider himself to be a teacher, a philosopher or a preacher.{{sfn|Whitwell|2004|p=84}} What he imparted he said was simply the confession of a [[Jnana yoga|jnani]].{{sfn|Ullman|2001|p=196}} He said he confessed his and everyone else's own [[Brahman|reality]], and encouraged students not to listen to him with their heads but with their hearts. Adams' way of communicating to his devotees was often funny,{{sfn|Dasarath|2002|p=53}} and with interludes of silence or music between questions and answers. He stated that there was no such thing as a new teaching. This knowledge could be found in the [[Upanishads]], the [[Vedas]] and other [[List of Hindu scriptures|Hindu scriptures]].{{refn|group=note|The [[Ashtavakra Gita]], for instance, was a beloved scripture of both Adams and Sri Ramana Maharshi.{{sfn|Jacobs|1999|p=205}}}}

=== Silence of the Heart ===
{{See also|Vimalakirti Sutra}}
Adams did not write any books himself nor publish his teachings as he did not wish to gain a large following. He instead preferred to teach a small number of dedicated seekers.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=25}} However, in 1992, a book of his dialogues was transcribed, compiled and distributed by and for the sole use of his devotees.&lt;ref group=web name="silence"&gt;[http://www.wearesentience.com/silence-of-the-heart-first-edition.html Muzika, Ed, (1992) Photographs of First Edition - ''Silence of the Heart - First Edition'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|After being shown the first edition of ''Silence of the Heart'' in 1994, [[H. W. L. Poonja]] read out the whole book at his satsang in [[Lucknow]]. Something he never did for any other living teacher.{{sfn|Premananda|2009|p=67}}}} In 1999, a later edition of this book, ''Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams'', was posthumously published by Acropolis Books Inc.{{refn|group=note|Acropolis Books is a publishing company, set up in 1993, with the sole purpose of publishing and preserving the books of Adams' first spiritual mentor, Joel S. Goldsmith.}} As conveyed by the title of these dialogues, Adams considered [[Silence#In spirituality|silence]] to be the highest of spiritual teachings:{{sfn|Parker|2009|p=28}}

{{quote|The highest teaching in the world is silence. There is nothing higher than this. A devotee who sits with a Sage purifies his mind just by being with the Sage. The mind automatically becomes purified. No words exchanged, no words said. Silence is the ultimate reality. Everything exists in this world through silence. True silence really means going deep within yourself to that place where nothing is happening, where you transcend time and space. You go into a brand new dimension of nothingness. That's where all the power is. That's your real home. That's where you really belong, in deep Silence where there is no good and bad, no one trying to achieve anything. Just being, pure being.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=25}}}}

}}
Although Adams was never [[initiated]] into a [[Matha|religious order]] or [[spiritual practice]], nor became a [[Sannyasa|renunciate]], his teachings were described by Dennis Waite as being firmly based in the [[Vedic]] philosophy and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Waite|2010|p=13}} Advaita (''non-dual'' in [[sanskrit]]) refers to the ultimate and supreme reality, [[Brahman]],{{refn|group=note|[[Brahman]], with the accent on the second syllable, is not to be confused with the Hindu god [[Brahmā]] nor the Hindu class/caste [[Brahmin]].}} which according to Ramana Maharshi, as interpreted by some of his devotees, is the substratum of the manifest [[universe]],{{sfn|Maharshi|1923|p=1-2}} and if describable at all, could be defined as pure consciousness. Another term for Brahman is [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]].{{sfn|Maharshi|1923|p=1-2}} The word Ātman is used when referring to Brahman as the inmost spirit of man. Ātman and Brahman are not different realities, but identical in nature.{{sfn|Maharshi|1923|p=1-2}} Adams used a metaphor to explain this:

{{quote|A clay pot has space inside of it and outside of it. The space inside is not any different from the space outside. When the clay pot breaks, the space merges the inside with the outside. It's only space. So it is with us. Your body is like a clay pot, and it appears you have to go within to find the truth. The outward appears to be within you. The outward is also without you. There's boundless space. When the body is transcended, it's like a broken clay pot. The Self within you becomes the Self outside of you ... as it's always been. The Self merges with the Self. Some people call the inner Self the Ātman. And yet it is called Brahman. When there is no body in the way, the Atman and the Brahman become one ... they become free and liberated.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=277}}}}

Those in search of [[Moksha|liberation]] from the manifest world will gain it only when the [[mind]] becomes quiescent. The world is in fact nothing other than the creation of the mind, and only by the removal of all thoughts, including the 'I' thought, will the true reality of Brahman shine forth.{{sfn|Maharshi|1923|pp=1&amp;ndash;2}} Adams taught self-enquiry, as previously taught by Sri Ramana Maharshi, in order to achieve this.

=== Self-enquiry ===
[[File:Robert_Adams_-_Empty_-_by_Jane_Adams.jpg|thumb|210px|Sketch of Robert Adams in 1996.]]
{{Main|Self-enquiry|Vichara}}
In his weekly satsangs Adams advocated the practice of [[self-enquiry]] (''ātma-vichāra''){{sfn|Waite|2010|p=380}} as the principal means of transcending the [[Ahamkara|ego]] and realising oneself as [[Satchitananda|sat-chit-ananda]] (''being-consciousness-bliss''). After acknowledging to oneself that one exists, and that whether awake, dreaming or in deep sleep one always exists, one then responds to every thought that arises with the question "Who am I?":{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=161&amp;ndash;162}}

{{quote|What you are really doing is, you’re finding the source of the 'I'. You're looking for the source of 'I', the personal 'I'. 'Who am I?' You're always talking about the personal 'I'. 'Who is this I? Where did it come from? Who gave it birth?' Never answer those questions. Pose those questions, but never answer them ... do nothing, absolutely nothing. You're watching the thoughts come. As soon as the thoughts come, in a gentle way you enquire, 'To whom do these thoughts come? They come to me. I think them. Who is this I? Where did it come from? How did it arise? From where did it arise? Who is the I? Who am I?' You remain still. The thoughts come again. You do the same thing again and again and again.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=27&amp;ndash;29}}}}

=== Four Principles of Self-Realization ===
{{See also|Lankavatara Sutra}} 
Adams rarely gave a [[sadhana]] to his devotees, however, he did often have visions,{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=25}}{{refn|group=note|Adams would explain that visions were not the same as dreams. A vision is an actual experience that occurs in the phenomenal world. After Sri Ramana Maharshi died, Adams would have visions of them walking along the [[Ganges]] together and discussing simple things like the weather.{{sfn|Ganesan|1993|p=25}}}} and in one such vision he gave a teaching as the [[Buddha]]. He visualised himself sitting under a tree in a beautiful open field with a lake and a forest nearby. He was wearing the [[Kasaya (clothing)|orange garb]] of a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist renunciate]]. All of a sudden hundreds of [[bodhisattvas]] and [[Mahāsattva|mahasattvas]] came out of the forest and sat down in a semi-circle around Adams as the Buddha. Together they proceeded to [[meditate]] for several hours. Afterwards, one of the bodhisattvas stood up and asked the Buddha what he taught. The Buddha answered, "I teach Self-realization of [[Buddhist wisdom|Noble Wisdom]]." Again they sat in silence for three hours before another bodhisattva stood up and asked how one could tell whether they were close to [[Self-realization#Eastern understanding|self-realization]]. In reply, Adams as the Buddha, gave the bodhisattvas and mahasattvas four principles, which he named ''The Four Principles of Self-Realization of Noble Wisdom'':{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=222}}&lt;ref group=web name="robert"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.co.uk/2008/06/robert-adams-on-self-enquiry.html Godman, David (2008, June 5th), Arunachala and Sri Ramana Maharshi Blog - ''Robert Adams On Self-Enquiry'']&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''First Principle:''' You have a feeling, a complete understanding that everything you see, everything in the universe, in the world, emanates from your mind. In other words, you feel this. You do not have to think about it, or try to bring it on. It comes by itself. It becomes a part of you. The realization that everything you see, the universe, people, worms, insects, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, your body, your mind, everything that appears, is a manifestation of your mind.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=222}}
*'''Second Principle:''' You have a strong feeling, a deep realization, that you are unborn. You are not born, you do not experience a life, and you do not disappear, you do not die ... You exist as I Am. You have always existed and you will always exist. You exist as pure intelligence, as absolute reality. That is your true nature. You exist as sat-chit-ananda. You exist as bliss consciousness ... But you do not exist as the body. You do not exist as person, place or thing.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=230}}
*'''Third Principle:''' You are aware and you have a deep understanding of the egolessness of all things; that everything has no ego. I'm not only speaking of sentient beings. I'm speaking of the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, the human kingdom. Nothing has an ego. There is no ego ... It means that everything is sacred. Everything is God. Only when the ego comes, does God disappear ... When there is no ego, you have reverence for everybody and everything ... There is only divine consciousness, and everything becomes divine consciousness.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=237&amp;ndash;238}}
*'''Fourth Principle:''' You have a deep understanding, a deep feeling, of what self-realization of noble wisdom really is ... You can never know by trying to find out what it is, because it’s absolute reality. You can only know by finding out what it is not. So you say, it is not my body, it is not my mind, it is not my organs, it is not my thoughts, it is not my world, it is not my universe, it is not the animals, or the trees, or the moon, or the sun, or the stars, it is not any of those things. When you've gone through everything and there's nothing left, that's what it is. Nothing. Emptiness. Nirvana. Ultimate Oneness.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=242&amp;ndash;243}}

'''Simion Bărnuțiu''' ({{IPA-ro|simiˈon bərˈnut͡sju}}; 21 July 1808 – 28 May 1864) was a [[Transylvania]]n, later [[Romania]]n historian, academic, philosopher, jurist, and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] politician. A leader of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolutionary movement of Transylvanian Romanians]], he represented its [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Eastern Rite Catholic]] wing. Bărnuțiu lived for a large part of his life in [[Moldavia]], and was for long a professor of philosophy at [[Academia Mihăileană]] and at the [[University of Iaşi|University of Iași]].

== Biography ==

=== Early activities ===
Born in [[Bocșa, Sălaj|Bocșa]] ({{lang-hu|Oláhbaksa}}), [[Szilágy County]], Transylvania. He became a teacher of history at the secondary school in [[Blaj]], which was at the time, like the rest of Transylvania, part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Bărnuțiu was influenced early-on by the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (''[[Kantianism]]''), in which he saw the means to reform society in opposition to traditional [[Theology|theological]] views, while supporting a presence of [[laity]] in the administrative structures of his own church.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.271, 277&lt;/ref&gt; An active contributor to ''[[Foaie pentru minte, inimă şi literatură|Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură]]'', the literary supplement of [[George Bariţiu|George Barițiu]]'s journal ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]'', he became noted after 1842 for virulently opposing the decision of the [[Magyars|Magyar]]-dominated [[Transylvanian Diet]] to give [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] a status of a semi-official language in local administration of Transylvania(''see [[History of Transylvania]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1848, Bărnuțiu issued one in a series of appeals by various authors, calling for [[self-determination]] of [[Romanians]] inside Transylvania, viewing it as a necessary step in matching Magyar success in obtaining rights from [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], and professing that Romanians should reject the projected union of the region with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until ensured [[proportional representation]] and the official condemnation of [[serfdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp.311-312&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blaj Assemblies and National Committee ===
The [[Blaj Assemblies|Blaj Assembly]] convened in April on the basis of such proclamations gathered together intellectuals, clergy, and commoners.

Bărnuțiu gave several speeches in front of the Assembly, calling for patience and moderation while continuing to campaign against all unilateral change in Transylvania's government and disagreeing with more skeptical political leaders, such as Bariț and [[Andrei Şaguna|Andrei Șaguna]], and finally being persuaded to include an oath of allegiance to the Emperor in his political strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.312-313&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the Second Assembly in May, he agreed to moderate his tone further, taking in view the points made by Bariț in regard to the fragile situation facing Romanians in the region, and partly reformulated his program on self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.315&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, he was elected vicepresident of the ''Permanent Committee'' formed by Blaj delegates as a supervising body (one presided by Șaguna), later the basis of the ''National Romanian Committee''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid succession of events after the proclamation of Transylvania's union with the Hungarian Kingdom (July 11) and of [[Hungary]]'s independence (September 27), with an Austrian military debacle in Transylvania, saw a rapprochement between the loyalist Austrian [[Anton Freiherr von Puchner]], nominal governor of the region, and Bărnuțiu's Committee. From the Committee's perspective, this was an Austrian recognition of Transylvania's self-government as a Romanian region, which was to be advanced to the new emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.319&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Moldavia and Romania ===
After [[Imperial Russia]]n intervention in Transylvania, he decided to go into exile, and settled in [[Iaşi|Iași]], Moldavia's capital. He wrote several treaties on law and philosophy (including a passionate defense of [[Roman law]]),&lt;ref&gt;Panu, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; and, before and after the union of the [[Danubian Principalities]] under ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] advocated [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] reforms which were a direct inspiration to the Moldavian liberal dissidents grouped as ''[[Fracţiunea liberă şi independentă|Fracțiunea liberă și independentă]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, in Panu, p. VI&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, Bărnuțiu wrote against the popular project of electing a foreign prince as ruler of the Principalities, an opposition which ''Fracțiunea'' carried into the [[Parliament of Romania|Constituent Assembly]] following the toppling of Cuza two years after Bărnuțiu's death.&lt;ref&gt;Panu, pp.16-17&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Junimea]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[literary society]] created during that period, criticized him along with other Transylvanian intellectuals (such as [[Timotei Cipariu]], [[Gheorghe Şincai|Gheorghe Șincai]], and [[August Treboniu Laurian]]) for having supported a [[Romanian grammar]] and [[Romanian alphabet|alphabet]] based on [[Latin]] etymologies instead of one reflecting the spoken language (at the time, "Latinist" influences following Transylvanian guidelines had come to be favoured by the [[Romanian Academy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Panu, pp.142-143, 321, 493&lt;/ref&gt;

After having fallen gravely ill, Simion Bărnuțiu asked to be allowed to return to his native village. He died on the way there, in [[Hida, Sălaj|Hida]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">'''Split labor market theory''' was proposed by sociologist [[Edna Bonacich]] in the early 1970s as an attempt to explain racial/ethnic tensions and [[labor market segmentation]] by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]] in terms of [[social structure]] and [[political power]] rather than individual-level [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name="Bonacich"&gt;{{cite journal 
|last= Bonacich 
|first= Edna 
|date=October 1972 
|title= A Theory of Ethnic Antagonism: The Split Labor Market 
|journal= American Sociological Review 
|volume= 37 
|issue= 5 
|pages= 547–559 
|accessdate= |quote= 
|doi= 10.2307/2093450
|jstor=2093450 
|pmid= 4634743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonacich argues that ethnic antagonism emerges from a split [[labor market]], where two or more racially/ethnically distinct groups of workers vie for the same jobs, and where the total cost to the employer (including wages) of hiring workers from one group is significantly lower than the cost of hiring from the other group. Employers (or [[capitalism|capitalists]]) prefer to hire cheaper workers and will do so absent active opposition from higher-priced workers, creating an antagonism between higher- and lower-priced groups. Differences in the price of labor are sociological and political in nature, not a matter of personal preference, so that, e.g., native, unionized workers, who enjoy full political rights will demand higher wages and be more likely to resist employer prerogatives than [[undocumented immigrant]], non-union workers from poorer countries. According to Bonacich, likely outcomes of a split labor market include not only antagonism but, depending on the political power of higher-priced workers, a [[caste]]-like system where lower-priced workers are restricted to specific occupations, or total exclusion of the lower-priced group from the labor market.

==Dynamics of three labor groups==

Conflict develops between these three classes because each has a different interest.

''Business or employers (white capitalists)'' aim to have a cheap and docile labor force in order to compete effectively with other businesses and maximize economic return.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  Business will dispense with and undercut the white working-class if they could, and have done so when they have the opportunity.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;

''Higher paid labor'', otherwise called the "primary labor market", is threatened by introduction of cheaper labor into their market fearing that it will force them to leave the workplace or reduce their pay level.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  If the Higher Paid Labor is strong enough or possess the power resources, they can prevent being replaced or undercut by cheaper labor through [[wikt:exclusion|exclusion]] movements or creating [[caste systems]] (exclusiveness or aristocracy of labor).&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;

''Cheaper labor'', also called the "secondary labor market", is used by the employer to undermine the position of more expensive labor through strikebreaking and undercutting.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  Cheaper laborers are usually unskilled, but can be trained.

==Economics of discrimination==

The split labor market theory attributes events to social structure rather than to individual preferences.  It is a form of [[conflict theory]] in that it sees [[discrimination]] as a result of the conflict between competing interest groups.&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Farley
  | first = John E.
  | title = Majority-Minority Relations
  | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]
  | series = Edition 2
  | year = 1988
  | isbn = 0-13-545625-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The business owner or capitalist ''recognizes'' that racial discrimination is dysfunctional for the business enterprise and prefers ''not'' to discriminate.  The objective of the capitalist is to get the best worker for the cheapest wage, and it is therefore in the capitalist's interest ''not'' to discriminate, because discrimination limits the pool of workers available for the position.  Accordingly, those doing the hiring discriminate ''not'' because they have a 'taste for discrimination', but rather because they might have been ''forced'' to do so by the laborers that do benefit" (Farley).  Higher paid laborers may be able to impose a system of discrimination in a number of ways.&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;  Discrimination occurs in a split labor market because workers benefit when they eliminate minority competition.&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;

==Ethnic antagonism in relation to split labor market==

Ethnic [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]] is produced when competition arises from a price differential.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  A source of antagonism between ethnic groups is assumed to be a split labor market or one in which there is a large differential in price of labor for the same occupation/work.  The price of labor is not a response to the race or ethnicity of those entering the labor market.  A price differential results from differences in resources and motives which are often correlates of ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;

==Conclusion==

According to Bonacich, "The central hypothesis [deriving from split labor market theory] is that ethnic antagonism first germinates in a labor market split along racial lines".&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  Split labor market theory traces the roots of racial/ethnic stratification to social and political differences that predate inter-group contact in the labor market, but the specific outcomes (caste system, exclusion, or something else) result mainly from the actions of the higher paid segment of the working class and their power relative to that of capital.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book

In one of the best-known applications of split labor market theory, [[William Julius Wilson]] argued in ''The Declining Significance of Race'' that a split labor market provided much of the racial antagonism between blacks and whites during the earlier years of what he called the period of industrial race relations.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Wilson argued that this did not last, however, as "the passage of protective union legislation during the New Deal era, and the equal employment legislation in the early sixties have virtually eliminated the tendency of employers to create a split labor market in which black labor is deemed cheaper than white labor regardless of the work performed".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

'''''The Book of the Courtier''''' ({{lang-it|Il Cortegiano}} {{IPA-it|il korteˈdʒaːno|}}) is a [[courtesy book]] or book of manners which dealt with issues of [[etiquette]], behaviour and morals, particularly at [[Court (royal)|princely, or royal  courts]]. Courtesy literature can be traced back to 13th century German and Italian writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution=courtesy literature | title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year=2008
| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140802/courtesy-literature}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of the Courtier'' was written by [[Baldassare Castiglione]] over the course of many years, beginning in 1508, and was ultimately published in 1528 by the [[Aldine Press]] in [[Venice]] just before his death. An English edition was published in 1561. 

''The Book of the Courtier'' addresses the  constitution of a perfect [[courtier]], and in its last installment, a perfect lady. It takes the form of a Renaissance dialogue, a literary form that incorporated elements of drama, conversation, philosophy, and essay.  Considered the definitive account of [[Renaissance]] [[courtier|court life]], it is cited frequently, along with [[Stefano Guazzo]]'s ''The civil conversation''  of 1574 and [[Giovanni Della Casa]]'s ''Galateo '' of 1558, as an important resource on court life during the Italian Renaissance.

The book is organized as a series of fictional conversations that occur between the [[courtier]]s of the [[Duke of Urbino]] in 1507 (when Castiglione was in fact part of the Duke's Court). In the book, the courtier is described as having a cool mind, a good voice (with beautiful, elegant and brave words) along with proper bearing and gestures. At the same time though, the courtier is expected to have a warrior spirit, to be athletic, and have good knowledge of the humanities, [[Classics]] and [[fine art]]s.  
Over the course of four evenings, members of the court try to describe the perfect gentleman of the court.  In the process they debate the nature of nobility, humor, women, and love.

==Reception==
''The Book of the Courtier'' was one of the most widely distributed books of the 16th century, with editions printed in six languages and in twenty European centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01516-0.html|title=The Fortunes of the Courtier|work=Penn State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1561 English translation by [[Thomas Hoby]] had a great influence on the English upper class's conception of English gentlemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Lawrence Cunningham, John Reich|author2=John J.

==Rhetoric==
{{Undue weight section|date=November 2013}}
Of the many qualities Castiglione’s characters attribute to their perfect courtier, oratory and the manner in which the courtier presents himself while speaking is amongst the most highly discussed. Wayne Rebhorn, a Castiglione scholar, states that the courtier’s speech and behavior in general is “designed to make people marvel at him, to transform himself into a beautiful spectacle for others to contemplate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rebhorn|first=Wayne|title=Baldesar Castiglione, Thomas Wilson, and the Courtly Body of Renaissance Rhetoric|journal=Rhetorica|year=1992|volume=11|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1525/rh.1993.11.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As explained by Count Ludovico, the success of the courtier depends greatly on his reception by the audience from the first impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castiglione|first=Baldassare|title=The Book of the Courtier|year=2003|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This partly explains why the group considers the courtier's dress so vital to his success.

Castiglione's characters opine about how their courtier can impress his audience and win its approval. Similar to the Classical Roman rhetoricians [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], Castiglione stresses the importance of delivery while speaking. In Book I, the Count states that when the courtier speaks he must have a “sonorous, clear, sweet and well sounding” voice that is neither too effeminate nor too rough and be “tempered by a calm face and with a play of the eyes that shall give an effect of grace.” (Castiglione 1.33) This grace, or ''grazia'', becomes an important element in the courtier’s appearance to the audience. Edoardo Saccone states in his analysis of Castiglione, “''grazia'' consists of, or rather is obtained through, ''[[sprezzatura]]''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saccone|first=Eduardo|title=The Portrait of the Courtier in Castiglione|journal=Italica|year=1987|volume=64|issue=1|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Count, ''[[sprezzatura]]'' is amongst one of the most important, if not the most important, rhetorical device the courtier needs. Peter Burke describes ''sprezzatura'' in ''The Book of the Courtier'' as “nonchalance”, “careful negligence”, and “effortless and ease.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Burke| first = Peter| title = The Fortunes of the Courtier| year = 1996| publisher = The Pennsylvania State University Press| location = University Park, Pennsylvania| isbn = 0-271-01517-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal courtier is someone who “conceals art, and presents what is done and said as if it was done without effort and virtually without thought.” (31).

The Count advocates the courtier engage in ''sprezzatura'', or this “certain nonchalance”, in all the activities he participates in, especially speech. In Book I, he states, "Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does not appear to be art; nor to anything must we give greater care than to conceal art, for if it is discovered, it quite destroys our credit and brings us into small esteem." (Castiglione 1.26) The Count reasons that by obscuring his knowledge of letters, the courtier gives the appearance that his “orations were composed very simply” as if they sprang up from “nature and truth [rather] than from study and art.” (1.26).  This much more natural appearance, even though it is not natural by any means, is more advantageous to the courtier.

The Count contends that if the courtier wants to attain ''grazia'' and be esteemed excellent, it would be in his best interest to have this appearance of nonchalance. By failing to employ ''sprezzatura'', he destroys his opportunity for grace. By applying ''sprezzatura'' to his speech and everything else he does, the courtier appears to have ''grazia'' and impresses his audience, thereby achieving excellence and perfection. (Saccone 16).

Another feature of rhetoric which Castiglione discusses is the role of written language and style. Castiglione declined to imitate [[Boccaccio]] and write in Tuscan Italian, as was customary at the time; instead he wrote in the Italian used in his native Lombardy (he was born near [[Mantua]]): as the Count says, “certainly it would require a great deal of effort on my part if in these discussions of ours I wished to use those old Tuscan words which the Tuscans of today have discarded; and what’s more I’m sure you would all laugh at me” (Courtier 70). Here, the use of the old and outdated Tuscan language is seen as a form of excess rather than a desirable trait. Castiglione states that had he followed Tuscan usage in his book, his description of sprezzatura would appear hypocritical, in that his effort would be seen as lacking in nonchalance (Courtier 71).

Federico responds to the Count's assessment of the use of spoken language by posing the question as to what is the best language in which to write rhetoric. The Count’s response basically states that the language does not matter, but rather the style, authority, and grace of the work matters most (Courtier 71). Robert J. Graham, a Renaissance literary scholar, notes that “questions of whose language is privileged at any given historical moment are deeply implicated in matters of personal, social and cultural significance”,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Robert J. Composing ourselves in Style: The Aesthetics of Literacty in ‘The Courtier’”. Journal of Aesthetic Education. University of Illinois Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; which he states is the primary reason for Castiglione’s usage of the native vernacular. This also illustrates the Count’s response on the relativity of language in Latin. With the role of language set, Castiglione begins to describe the style and authority in which the courtier must write in order to become successful.

The Count explains, "it is right that greater pains would be taken to make what is written more polished and correct…they should be chosen from the most beautiful of those employed in speech" (Courtier 71). This is where the style of which the courtier writes encourages the persuasiveness or successfulness of a speech. The success of a written speech, in contrast to the spoken speech, hinges on the notion that "we are willing to tolerate a great deal of improper and even careless usage"&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Robert J. ''Composing ourselves in Style: The Aesthetics of Literacty in The Courtier''. Journal of Aesthetic Education. University of Illinois Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; in oral rhetoric than written rhetoric. The Count explains that along with proper word usage, an ideal courtier must have a proper sense of style and flow to their words. These words must be factual yet entertaining as the Count states, “then, it is necessary to arrange what is to be said or written in its logical order, and after that to express it well in words that, if I am not mistaken, should be appropriate, carefully chosen, clear and well formed, but above all that are still in popular use" (Courtier 77). This form of emphasis on language is noted by Graham as; "Although the Count is aware that more traditional aspects of the orator (appearance, gestures, voice, etc.)…all this will be futile and of little consequence if the ideas conveyed by these words themselves are not witty or elegant to the requirements of the situation” (Graham 49).

As the trend of painting pebbles has spread, it has many derivatives. Rocks are painted as a fun activity for kids, as well as to support particular charities, events or movements. Sometimes the name of a hashtag or the Facebook group the painter belongs to is written on it as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.familiesonline.co.uk/local/dunfermline/in-the-know/-kids-are-going-to-love-doing-this-during-the-school-holidays-60529|title=Kids Are Going to Love Doing This During the School Holidays|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|website=www.familiesonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/viral/this-is-why-youre-seeing-pictures-of-really-pretty-rocks-in-your-feeds-36192892.html|title=This is why you’re seeing pictures of really pretty rocks in your feeds|last=|first=|date=October 3, 2017|work=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the structure of the [[experiment]], it may not be possible to perform it, and even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it.

The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question:
::"A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent)" (Yeates, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;150).

Examples of thought experiments include [[Schrödinger's cat]], illustrating [[quantum indeterminacy]] through the manipulation of a perfectly sealed environment and a tiny bit of [[radioactive]] substance, and [[Maxwell's demon]], which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics|2nd law of thermodynamics]].

== Overview ==
The ancient Greek '''δείκνυμι''' ''([[Transliteration|transl.]]: deiknymi)'', or thought experiment, "was the most ancient pattern of [[mathematical proof]]", and existed before Euclidean mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Szábo, Árpád. (1958) " 'Deiknymi' als Mathematischer Terminus fur 'Beweisen' ", ''Maia'' N.S. '''10''' pp. 1–26 as cited by [[Imre Lakatos]] (1976) in ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' p.9. (John Worrall and Elie Zahar, eds.) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-21078-X}}. The English translation of the title of Szábo's article is "'Deiknymi' as a mathematical expression for 'to prove'", as translated by [http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf András Máté] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231500/http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; where the emphasis was on the conceptual, rather than on the experimental part of a thought-experiment. Perhaps the key experiment in the history of modern science is [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This is widely thought&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Martin, "Wittgenstein's Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments", Blackwell, (Oxford), 2005, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  to have been a straightforward physical demonstration, involving climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy  weights off it, whereas in fact, it was a logical demonstration, using the 'thought experiment' technique. The 'experiment' is described by Galileo in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche]]'' (1638) (literally, 'Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations') thus:

{{quote|''Salviati''. If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter. Do you not agree with me in this opinion?

''Simplicio''. You are unquestionably right.

''Salviati''. But if this is true, and if a large stone moves with a speed of, say, eight while a smaller moves with a speed of four, then when they are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before moved with a speed of eight. Hence the heavier body moves with less speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your supposition. Thus you see how, from your assumption that the heavier body moves more rapidly than the lighter one, I infer that the heavier body moves more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/tns61.htm |title=Galileo on Aristotle and Acceleration  |accessdate=2008-05-24 }} &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the extract does not convey the elegance and power of the 'demonstration' terribly well, it is clear that it is a 'thought' experiment, rather than a practical one. Strange then, as Cohen says, that philosophers and scientists alike refuse to acknowledge either Galileo in particular, or the thought experiment technique in general for its pivotal role in both science and philosophy. (The exception proves the rule&amp;nbsp;— the iconoclastic philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], has also observed this methodological prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paul Feyerabend, 'Against Method', Verso (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Instead, many philosophers prefer to consider 'Thought Experiments' to be merely the use of a hypothetical [[scenario]] to help understand the way things are.

== Variety ==
Thought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]]. In philosophy, they have been used at least since [[classical antiquity]], some pre-dating [[Socrates]]. In law, they were well-known to [[Roman law]]yers quoted in the [[Pandects|Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pandects'' "every logical rule of law is capable of illumination from the law of the Pandects."&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].

==Origins and use of the literal term==
Johann Witt-Hansen established that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] was the first to use the Latin-German mixed term ''Gedankenexperiment'' (lit. thought experiment) circa 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen (1976). Although ''Experiment'' is a German word, it is derived from [[Latin]]. The synonym ''Versuch'' has purely [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] roots.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted was also the first to use its entirely German equivalent, ''Gedankenversuch'', in 1820.

Much later, [[Ernst Mach]] used the term ''Gedankenexperiment'' in a different way, to denote exclusively the ''imaginary'' conduct of a ''real'' experiment that would be subsequently performed as a ''real physical experiment'' by his students.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1883), The Science of Mechanics (6th edition, translated by Thomas J. McCormack), LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court, 1960.  pp. 32-41, 159-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical and mental experimentation could then be contrasted: Mach asked his students to provide him with explanations whenever the results from their subsequent, real, physical experiment differed from those of their prior, imaginary experiment.

The English term ''thought experiment'' was coined (as a [[calque]]) from Mach's ''Gedankenexperiment'', and it first appeared in the 1897 English translation of one of Mach’s papers.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1897), "On Thought Experiments", in ''Knowledge and Error'' (translated by Thomas J. McCormack and Paul Foulkes), Dordrecht Holland: Reidel, 1976, pp. 134-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its emergence, the activity of posing hypothetical questions that employed subjunctive reasoning had existed for a very long time (for both scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of categorizing it or speaking about it. This helps to explain the extremely wide and diverse range of the application of the term "thought experiment" once it had been introduced into English.

==Uses==
Thought experiments, which are well-structured, well-defined hypothetical questions that employ [[subjunctive]] reasoning ([[irrealis moods]]) – "What might happen (or, what might have happened) if . . . " – have been used to pose questions in philosophy at least since Greek antiquity, some pre-dating [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Nicholas Rescher|last=Rescher |first= N.|chapter=Thought Experiment in Pre-Socratic Philosophy|pages=31–41 |editor1-last=Horowitz  |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Massey |editor2-first=G.J.  |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003190/ |title=Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, (Savage)|year=1991 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences many thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th Century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo]].

In thought experiments we gain new information by rearranging or reorganizing already known empirical data in a new way and drawing new (a priori) inferences from them or by looking at these data from a different and unusual perspective. In Galileo’s thought experiment, for example, the rearrangement of empirical experience consists in the original idea of combining bodies of different weight.&lt;ref&gt;Brendal, Elke, "Intuition Pumps and the Proper Use of Thought Experiments". Dialectica. V.58, Issue 1, p 89–108, March   2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought experiments have been used in [[philosophy]] (especially [[ethics]]), [[physics]], and other fields (such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[social psychology]], [[law]], [[organizational studies]], [[marketing]], and [[epidemiology]]).  In law, the synonym "hypothetical" is frequently used for such experiments.

Regardless of their intended goal, all thought experiments display a patterned way of thinking that is designed to allow us to explain, predict and control events in a better and more productive way.

===Theoretical consequences===
In terms of their theoretical consequences, thought experiments generally:
* challenge (or even refute) a prevailing theory, often involving the device known as [[reductio ad absurdum]], (as in Galileo's original argument, a [[proof by contradiction]]),
* confirm a prevailing theory,
* establish a new theory, or
* simultaneously refute a prevailing theory and establish a new theory through a process of mutual exclusion

===Practical applications===
Thought experiments can produce some very important and different outlooks on previously unknown or unaccepted theories. However, they may make those theories themselves irrelevant, and could possibly create new problems that are just as difficult, or possibly more difficult to resolve.

In terms of their practical application, thought experiments are generally created to:
* challenge the prevailing [[status quo]] (which includes activities such as correcting [[misinformation]] (or misapprehension), identify flaws in the argument(s) presented, to  preserve (for the long-term) objectively established fact, and to refute  specific assertions that some particular thing is permissible, forbidden, known, believed, possible, or necessary);
* [[extrapolate]] beyond (or [[interpolate]] within) the boundaries of already established fact;
* [[predict]] and [[forecasting|forecast]] the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable future;
* explain the past;
* the [[retrodiction]], [[postdiction]] and [[hindcast]]ing of the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable past;
* facilitate decision making, choice and strategy selection;
* solve problems, and generate ideas;
* move current (often insoluble) problems into another, more helpful and more productive problem space (e.g.: [[functional fixedness]]);
* attribute causation, preventability, blame and responsibility for specific outcomes;
* assess [[culpability]] and [[compensatory damages]] in social and legal contexts;
* ensure the repeat of past success; or
* examine the extent to which past events might have occurred differently.
* ensure the (future) avoidance of past failures

==In science==
Scientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, "proxy" experiments prior to a real, "physical" experiment ([[Ernst Mach]] always argued that these '''''gedankenexperiments''''' were "a necessary precondition for physical experiment"). In these cases, the result of the "proxy" experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.

Scientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct ([[Carl Gustav Hempel]] labeled these sorts of experiment "''theoretical experiments-in-imagination''"), such as [[Einstein's thought experiments|Einstein's thought experiment]] of chasing a light beam, leading to [[special relativity]].  This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.

==Relation to real experiments==
The relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect ([[EPR paradox]]). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E.T. (1989).[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf  Clearing up the Mysteries], opening talk at the 8th International MAXENT Workshop, St John's College, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that  ''quantum mechanics should be described as "incomplete"''. [[Niels Bohr]] asserted a refutation of Einstein's analysis immediately, and his view prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P., Taylor, E.F. (1979/1989). ''An Introduction to Quantum Physics'', Van Nostrand Reinhold (International), London, {{ISBN|0-442-30770-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J.A, Zurek, W.H., editors (1983). ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;d'Espagnat, B. (2006). ''On Physics and Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0-691-11964-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the [[Bell inequalities]] published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by empirical fact (e.g. by the optical ''real experiments'' of  [[Alain Aspect]]).

Thus ''thought experiments'' belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to [[theoretical physics]], but often to [[theoretical philosophy]]. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has "the final decision on ''true'' or ''not true''", at least in physics.

==Causal reasoning==
The first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation
in time.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, 2004, pp.138-143.&lt;/ref&gt; They are either:
* ''Antefactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what might have happened prior to a specific, designated event, or
* ''Postfactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what may happen subsequent to (or consequent upon) a specific, designated event.

The second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to “the present
moment standpoint” of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:
* Their ''temporal direction'': are they past-oriented or future-oriented?
* Their ''temporal sense'':
:(a) in the case of past-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the past, or from the past to the present? or,
:(b) in the case of future-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the future, or from the future to the present?

== Seven types ==
[[File:The Prefactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Generally speaking, there are seven types of thought experiments in which one reasons from causes to effects, or effects to causes:&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates, 2004, pp.138-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefactual===
''Prefactual (before the fact) thought experiments'' — the term '''[[Defensive_pessimism#Prefactual_thinking|prefactual]]''' was coined by Lawrence J. Sanna in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Sanna, L.J., "Defensive Pessimism and Optimism: The Bitter-Sweet Influence of Mood on Performance and Prefactual and Counterfactual Thinking", ''Cognition and Emotion'', Vol.12, No.5, (September 1998), pp.635-665. (Sanna used the term ''prefactual'' to distinguish these sorts of thought experiment from both ''semifactuals'' and ''counterfactuals''.)&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask "What will be the outcome if event E occurs?"

===Counterfactual===
[[File:The Counterfactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a counterfactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Counterfactual (contrary to established fact) thought experiments'' — the term ''[[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s (1946) notion of a "contrary-to-fact conditional"&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, R.M., "The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional", ''Mind'', Vol.55, No.220, (October 1946), pp.289-307.&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the possible outcomes of a different past;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (''[[Shadows of the Mind|Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness]]'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford),1994, p.240) considers counterfactuals to be "things that might have happened, although they did not in fact happen".&lt;/ref&gt; and ask "What might have happened if A had happened instead of B?" (e.g., "If [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]  '''''had'''''  cooperated with each other, what would mathematics look like today?").&lt;ref&gt;In 1748, when defining causation, [[David Hume]] referred to a counterfactual case: "…we may define a cause to be an ''object, followed by another, and where all objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second''. Or in other words, ''where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed'' …" (Hume, D. (Beauchamp, T.L., ed.), ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1999, (7), p.146.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifactual===
[[File:The Semifactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a semifactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Semifactual thought experiments'' — the term ''semifactual'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman's original concept has been subsequently developed and expanded by (a) Daniel Cohen (Cohen, D., "Semifactuals, Even-Ifs, and Sufficiency", ''International Logic Review'', Vol.16, (1985), pp.102-111), (b) Stephen Barker (Barker, S., "''Even'', ''Still'' and Counterfactuals", ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', Vol.14, No.1, (February 1991), pp.1-38; Barker, S., "Counterfactuals, Probabilistic Counterfactuals and Causation", ''Mind'', Vol.108, No.431, (July 1999), pp.427-469), and (c) Rachel McCloy and Ruth Byrne (McCloy, R. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J., "Semifactual 'Even If' Thinking", ''Thinking and Reasoning'', Vol.8, No.1, (February 2002), pp.41-67).&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the extent to which things might have remained the same, despite there being a different past; and asks the question Even though X happened instead of E, would Y have still occurred? (e.g., Even if the goalie '''''had''''' moved left, rather than right, could he have intercepted a ball that was traveling at such a speed?).

Semifactual speculations are an important part of clinical medicine.

===Prediction===
[[File:Prediction, Forecasting and Nowcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of prediction, forecasting and nowcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[prediction]] attempts to project the circumstances of the present into the future. According to David Sarewitz and Roger Pielke (1999, p123), scientific prediction takes two forms:
:(1) “The elucidation of invariant — and therefore predictive — principles of nature”; and
:(2) “[Using] suites of observational data and sophisticated numerical models in an effort to foretell the behavior or evolution of complex phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;Sarewitz, D. &amp; Pielke, R., "Prediction in Science and Policy", ''Technology in Society'', Vol.21, No.2, (April 1999), pp.121-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they perform different social and scientific functions, the only difference between the qualitatively identical activities of ''predicting'', ''forecasting,'' and ''nowcasting'' is the distance of the speculated future from the present moment occupied by the user.&lt;ref&gt;Nowcasting (obviously based on forecasting) is also known as ''very-short-term forecasting''; thus, also indicating a ''very-short-term'', ''mid-range'', and ''long-range forecasting'' continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the activity of nowcasting, defined as “a detailed description of the current weather along with forecasts obtained by extrapolation up to 2 hours ahead”, is essentially concerned with describing the current state of affairs, it is common practice to extend the term “to cover very-short-range forecasting up to 12 hours ahead” (Browning, 1982, p.ix).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, K.A. (ed.), ''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, and Brown — Murphy, A.H. &amp; Brown, B.G., "Similarity and Analogical Reasoning: A Synthesis", pp.3-15 in Browning, K.A. (ed.),
''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982 — describe a large range of specific applications for meteorological nowcasting over wide range of user demands:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Agriculture: (a) wind and precipitation forecasts for effective seeding and spraying from aircraft; (b) precipitation forecasts to minimize damage to seedlings; (c) minimum temperature, dewpoint, cloud cover, and wind speed forecasts to protect crops from frost; (d) maximum temperature forecasts to reduce adverse effects of high temperatures on crops and livestock; (e) humidity and cloud cover forecasts to prevent fungal disease crop losses ; (f) hail forecasts to minimize damage to livestock and greenhouses; (g) precipitation, temperature, and dewpoint
forecasts to avoid during- and after-harvest losses due to crops rotting in the field; (h) precipitation forecasts to minimize losses in drying raisins; and (i) humidity forecasts to reduce costs and losses resulting from poor conditions for drying tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Construction: (a) precipitation and wind speed forecasts to avoid damage to finished work (e.g. concrete) and minimize costs of protecting exposed surfaces, structures, and work sites; and (b) precipitation, wind speed, and high/low temperature forecasts to schedule work in an efficient manner.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Energy: (a) temperature, humidity, wind, cloud, etc. forecasts to optimize procedures related to generation and distribution of electricity and gas; (b) forecasts of thunderstorms, strong winds, low temperatures, and freezing precipitation minimize damage to lines and equipment and
to schedule repairs.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Transportation: (a) ceiling height and visibility, winds and turbulence, and surface ice and snow forecasts minimize risk, maximize efficiency in pre-flight and in-flight decisions and other adjustments to weather-related fluctuations in traffic; (b) forecasts of wind speed and direction, as well as severe weather and icing conditions along flight paths facilitate optimal airline route planning; (c) forecasts of snowfall, precipitation, and other storm-related events allow truckers, motorists, and public transportation systems to avoid damage to weather-sensitive goods, select optimum routes, prevent accidents, minimize delays, and maximize revenues under conditions of adverse weather.&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Public Safety &amp; General Public: (a) rain, snow, wind, and temperature forecasts assist the general public in planning activities such as commuting, recreation, and shopping; (b) forecasts of temperature/humidity extremes (or significant changes) alert hospitals, clinics, and the public to weather conditions that may seriously aggravate certain health-related illnesses; (c) forecasts related to potentially dangerous or damaging natural events (e.g., tornados, severe thunderstorms, severe winds, storm surges, avalanches, precipitation, floods) minimize loss of life and property damage; and (d) forecasts of snowstorms, surface icing, visibility, and other events (e.g. floods) enable highway maintenance and traffic control organizations to take appropriate actions to reduce risks of traffic accidents and protect roads from damage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindcasting===
[[File:Hindcasting.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of hindcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[Backtesting#Hindcast|hindcasting]] involves running a forecast model after an event has happened in order to test whether the model's [[simulation]] is valid.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;Not only did their hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrodiction===
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[retrodiction]]'' (or ''postdiction'') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (e.g., [[reverse engineering]] and [[forensics]]).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which "past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) the produced them" and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] "involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes",&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Einhorn, H.J. &amp; Hogarth, R.M., "Prediction, Diagnosis, and Causal Thinking in Forecasting", ''Journal of Forecasting'', (January–March 1982), Vol.1, No.1, pp.23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between prediction and retrodiction could be characterized as:
::'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''
regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient.&lt;ref&gt;"…We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term “backward inference”). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, 'Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards' …"(Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1982, p.24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcasting===
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[backcasting]]'' — the term ''backcasting'' was coined by John Robinson in 1982&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson, J.B., "Energy Backcasting: A Proposed Method of Policy Analysis", ''Energy Policy'', Vol.10, No.4 (December 1982), pp.337-345; Robinson, J.B., "Unlearning and Backcasting: Rethinking Some of the Questions We Ask About the Future", ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', Vol.33, No.4, (July 1988), pp.325-338; Robinson, J., "Future Subjunctive: Backcasting as Social Learning", ''Futures'', Vol.35, No.8, (October 2003), pp.839-856.&lt;/ref&gt; — involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (Ducot, C. &amp; Lubben, G.J., "A Typology for Scenarios", ''Futures'', Vol.11, No.1, (February 1980), pp.51-57), and Bunn and Salo (Bunn, D.W. &amp; Salo, A.A., "Forecasting with scenarios", European Journal of Operational Research, Vol.68, No.3, (13 August 1993), pp.291-303).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving 'working backwards' from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;p.814, Dreborg, K.H., "Essence of Backcasting", ''Futures'', Vol.28, No.9, (November 1996), pp.813-828.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503:&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, L., "Towards a Sustainable Future, en route with Technology", pp.496-525 in Dutch Committee for Long-Term Environmental Policy (ed.), ''The Environment: Towards a Sustainable Future (Environment &amp; Policy, Volume 1)'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (Dortrecht), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==In philosophy==
In philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment.  (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.)  The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference.  The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.

For example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others.  Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action's consequences (See [[Consequentialism]]).  [[John Searle]] imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual.  Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist theory of mind]] is correct.

It is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits.  (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to "what we should say," or some such locution.)  A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared.  But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.

Other philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also.  In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.

For example, in the [[veil of ignorance]], [[John Rawls]] asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the [[state of nature]] to imagine the origins of government, as by [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], may also be considered a thought experiment. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] explored the possible ethical and religious implications of [[Abraham]]'s [[binding of Isaac]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' Similarly, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.

An early written thought experiment was [[Plato]]'s [[allegory of the cave]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Rep.'' vii, I–III, 514–518B.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historic thought experiment was [[Avicenna]]'s "[[Avicennism#Thought experiments on self-consciousness|Floating Man]]" thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] in order to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]], and the [[Substance theory|substantiality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility===
In many thought experiments, the scenario would be [[nomological possibility|nomologically possible]], or possible according to the laws of nature.  John Searle's [[Chinese room]] is nomologically possible.

Some thought experiments present scenarios that are not [[Subjunctive possibility|nomologically]] possible.  In his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], [[Hilary Putnam]] asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water.  It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as [[metaphysical possibility]].  It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.

In some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all.  [[David Chalmers]] says that we can imagine that there are [[philosophical zombie|zombies]], or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness.  This is supposed to show that [[physicalism]] is false.  However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable:  we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.

===Interactive thought experiments in digital environments===
{{External links|section|date=May 2018}}
The philosophical work of [[Stefano Gualeni]] focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-52178-1|location=Basingstoke (UK)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book [http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137521774 ''Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools''.]

Gualeni's argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|date=2016|title=Self-reflexive videogames: observations and corollaries on virtual worlds as philosophical artifacts|url=http://www.gamejournal.it/gualeni-self-reflexive-videogames/|journal=G A M E, The Italian Journal of Game Studies|volume=1, 5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like those of thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Among the most visible thought experiments designed by [[Stefano Gualeni]]:

* [[Braitenberg vehicle]]s (robotics, neural control and sensing systems) (some have been built)
* [[Doomsday argument]] ([[anthropic principle]])
* [[The Lady, or the Tiger?]] (human nature)&lt;ref&gt;While the problem presented in this short story's scenario is not unique, it is extremely unusual. Most thought experiments are intentionally (or, even, sometimes unintentionally) skewed towards the inevitable production of a particular solution to the problem posed; and this happens because of the way that the problem and the scenario are framed in the first place. In the case of ''The Lady, or the Tiger?'', the way that the story unfolds is so "end-neutral" that, at the finish, there is no "correct" solution to the problem. Therefore, all that one can do is to offer one's own innermost thoughts on how the account of human nature that has been presented might unfold ? according to one's own experience of human nature ? which is, obviously, the purpose of the entire exercise. The extent to which the story can provoke such an extremely wide range of (otherwise [[equipollent]]) predictions of the participants' subsequent behaviour is one of the reasons the story has been so popular over time.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34282">'''''Torah Umadda''''' ({{lang-he-n|תּוֹרָה וּמַדָּע}}, "Torah and secular knowledge") is a [[philosophy]] of [[Orthodox Judaism]] concerning the relationship between the [[secular]] world and [[Judaism]], and in particular between secular knowledge and Jewish religious knowledge. The resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism is referred to as '''Centrist Orthodoxy'''.

==History==
''Torah Umadda'' is closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]]. The actual philosophy underlying the combination of Torah and secular wisdom at Yeshiva University was variously articulated, first by [[Bernard Revel]], by his successors [[Samuel Belkin]] and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik]], and most recently, and formally, by [[Norman Lamm]]. Although its roots go back to 1886, it was only in 1946 that the University adopted "Torah Umadda" as its slogan. (In 2005, Yeshiva University president [[Richard Joel]] initiated a campaign to append the phrase "Bringing wisdom to life", as a "tag-line" to the university's motto.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2005/09/yus-new-tag-line.html Hirhurim.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Yeshiva University publishes the ''Torah Umadda Journal'' which "explores the complex relationships between Torah, the humanities, and the natural and social sciences", as well as studies on related topics in the ''Library of Jewish Law and Ethics'' (with Ktav Publishing House).

The phrase itself is thought to originate with [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]], who mentions "Torah u-Madda" in his [[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|''Yaarot Devash'']] in at least sixteen places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_brill.pdf Edah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This use of "Madda" as "secular knowledge" is, however, recent. In [[Rabbinic literature]], "secular knowledge" is usually&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azure.org.il/download/magazine/186az24_Hansel.pdf Azure.org]&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as ''chokhmah'' {{hebrew|חכמה}}. The first book in [[Maimonides]]' compendium of [[Halakha]], the [[Mishneh Torah]], is entitled "Madda" {{Hebrew|מדע}}  - there, though, the term refers to knowledge of the fundamentals of Judaism. "In the first book I will include all the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] that are [[Jewish principles of faith|principles]] of the law of Moses and that a man should know before all else, such as the [[divine simplicity|Unity of God]] and the prohibitions related to idolatry. And I have called this book ''Sefer ha Madda'' the Book of Knowledge."

Torah and Madda is also the doctrine of the Vilna Gaon ￼as stated in Sefer Kol Hator, that the torah is incomplete without knowledge of the 7 wisdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Kol Hator sha'ar Be'er shevah part 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Torah and secular knowledge===
In the view of ''Torah Umadda'', "Jewishness and Jewish faith ... and the universal concerns and preoccupations of humanity" are not "fundamentally inapposite"; Judaism and [[culture]] are, "in essence part of one continuum". Jewish knowledge and secular knowledge, ''Torah'' and ''Madda'', do not, therefore, require "substantive reconciliation" (Norman Lamm, ''Torah Umadda'' pp. 142–43); in fact, the study of Torah with other knowledge results in a heightened and enriched Judaism. As articulated by [[Rabbi]] [[Norman Lamm]]: 
{{quote|
"Torah, faith, religious learning on one side and Madda, science, worldly knowledge on the other, together offer us a more {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} and truer vision than either one set alone. Each set gives one view of the Creator as well as of His creation, and the other a different perspective that may not agree at all with the first ... Each alone is true, but only partially true; both together present the possibility of a larger truth."&lt;ref&gt; (Norman Lamm, ''Torah Umadda'', p. 236)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Synthesis===
Although ''Torah Umadda'' regards [[science]] and [[religion]] as separate, where the "wisdom of the world" maintains its own significance, it nevertheless conceives of a synthesis between the two realms. In this understanding, "synthesis does not refer to a logical unity of the theories of science, [[democracy]] and Judaism"; rather, the idea of synthesis has a [[psychology|psychological]] and a [[sociology|sociological]] meaning. Here, the "individual has absorbed the attitudes characteristic of science, democracy and Jewish life and responds appropriately in diverse relations and contexts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/ACF4B2B.pdf Yutorah.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

:We prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation. If we seek the blending of science and religion and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then it is not in the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that we hope to achieve the synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this conception, the realization of ''Torah Umadda'' may find "different legitimate expressions in each individual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html Yuweb.addr.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081945/http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html |date=2007-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Lamm explores six separate models of ''Torah Umadda'', including those presented by [[Maimonides]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. The philosophy recognizes the challenge this is likely to pose to its adherents, and posits a framework in which "the confrontation between Judaism and secular culture results in heightened creativity within Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040325184911/http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/features/q%26a29.htm Ohrtorahstone.org.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centrality of Torah===
Despite its acceptance of both Torah and secular knowledge and culture, ''Torah Umadda'' prioritizes a Torah outlook and Torah knowledge, and in its practice requires strict adherence to ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law). ''Torah Umadda'' demands "unquestioned allegiance to the primacy of Torah, and that the apprehension of all other intellectual disciplines must be rooted and viewed through the prism of Torah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html Yuweb.addr.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081945/http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html |date=2007-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Rabbi Lamm, "''Torah Umadda'' does not imply ... coequality. Torah remains the unchallenged and preeminent center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=Norman|editor1-last=Isaacs|editor1-first=Ronald H.|editor2-last=Olitzky|editor2-first=Kerry M.|title=Critical Documents of Jewish History: A Sourcebook|isbn=1568213921|page=304|url=http://modernjh.pbworks.com/f/Lamm-Comments+on+Centrist+Orthodoxy.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004030944/http://modernjh.pbworks.com/f/Lamm-Comments+on+Centrist+Orthodoxy.pdf|archive-date=4 October 2017|chapter=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamm|first1=Norman|title=SOME COMMENTS ON CENTRIST ORTHODOXY|journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Volume 22|date=1986|volume=Volume 22|page=5|url=http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2022/No.%203/Some%20Comments%20On.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2017|quote="For those of us in the Centrist camp, Torah Umadda does not imply the coequality of the two poles.

Torah remains the unchallenged and pre-eminent center of our lives, our community, our value system. But centrality is not the same as exclusivity..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that "''Torah Umadda'' can only be viable if it imposes strict limits on [[freedom of thought]] in areas that may challenge [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamental Jewish beliefs]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/TU1%5FParnes%2Epdf Yutorah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; As regards observance of Jewish law, "Not a single fundamental of Judaism has been disturbed by us, we adhere to the same ''ikkarim'' ([[Jewish principles of faith|principles of faith]]), we are loyal to the same Torah, we strive for the same study of Torah and observance of ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' that our parents and grandparents before us cherished throughout the generations."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lamm, ''Some Comments on Centrist Orthodoxy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other paradigms===
Another model of ''Torah Umadda'',&lt;ref name="Ziegler"&gt; Rabbi Ronnie Ziegler: [http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rav/rav13.htm Introduction To The Philosophy of Rav Soloveitchik: The Need for Action]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shatz"&gt;Dr. David Shatz: [http://www.yutorah.org/showShiur.cfm?shiurID=704651 Practical Endeavor and the Torah u-Madda Debate]&lt;/ref&gt; less emphasized in Modern Orthodox literature, de-stresses the intellectual role of Madda. Rather, to some degree, "the theories and methods of secular disciplines [can] be used to secure not ''intellectual'' ends, but ''practical'' ends in [daily life]." God's blessing to Adam and Eve "''Fill the land and conquer it''" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:28) is interpreted by Rav Soloveitchik (as well as [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and [[Isaac Breuer]]) as a positive ''mitzvah'' calling man to develop and improve God's world; this ''mitzvah'' of creative activity expresses the divine image in all branches of human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/halacha/trees |title=Pardes.org |access-date=2005-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313174156/http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/halacha/trees |archive-date=2005-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, secular knowledge enables the religious Jew "to fulfill the biblical mandate of "''Fill the land and conquer it''" ...  to carry out their responsibilities to others and, further, by increasing the modalities for improving human welfare, to expand the range of these responsibilities; and, finally, to fulfill the mandate of [[imitatio dei|''imitatio Dei'']]." &lt;!--who are these quotes from?--&gt; See further under [[Joseph Soloveitchik#Philosophy: Synthesis|Joseph Soloveitchik]]; [[Divine Providence#Modern Orthodox Judaism|Divine Providence]].

==Centrist Orthodoxy==
Centrist Orthodoxy is the dominant mode of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[United States]] and the [[western world]]; it is also influential in the Modern Orthodox movement in [[State of Israel|Israel]]. 

===Characteristics===
Centrist Orthodoxy's ''[[weltanschauung]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&amp;hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&amp;type=Document&amp;category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&amp;authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&amp;firstname=Norman&amp;lastname=Lamm&amp;pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&amp;authorid=285 Edah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Hashkafa]]'') is characterised by "education, moderation, and the centrality of the people of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&amp;hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&amp;type=Document&amp;category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&amp;authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&amp;firstname=Norman&amp;lastname=Lamm&amp;pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&amp;authorid=285 Edah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, differences between Centrist Orthodoxy and other Orthodox movements (both Haredi and Modern - e.g. [[Open Orthodoxy]]) result from the particular emphasis placed on each of these characteristics; see [[Modern_Orthodox_Judaism#Comparison with other movements|further discussion]] under Modern Orthodox Judaism.

====Education====
{{Further|Divine providence in Judaism}}
''Madda'' entails "worldly involvement" in addition to its intellectual component - and places a high value on contribution to general society. Adherents of Centrist Orthodoxy are thus well represented, proportionately, in the [[profession]]s and in [[academia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_waxman.pdf Edah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; - and to some extent in politics. Members of [[Haredi]] communities, by contrast, will typically not undertake any post [[high school]] secular education (except for specific exceptions for livelihood purposes), and will, in general, minimize involvement with the secular.

====Moderation====
For Centrist Orthodoxy, moderation "is the result neither of guile nor of indifference nor of prudence, it is a matter of sacred principle ... it is not the mindless application of the [[arithmetic mean]]... [rather] it is the earnest sober and intelligent assessment of each situation... [Thus], moderation issues from a broad weltanschauung rather than from [[tunnel vision]]." This moderation, "seeking what is allowed rather than forbidden", is manifest in three ways. Firstly, along with the Haredi community, the ideology demands adherence to the halakha; however it is not insistent that strictures (''chumras'') are [[Norm (sociology)|normative]], rather, these are a matter of personal choice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/diverse.cfm#Chumrah Edah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Haredi Judaism|3.1]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance|4.1]] under Modern Orthodox Judaism). Secondly, relative to the Haredi community - but less so than in non-orthodox communities - women are starting to play a public role within the community&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/8077/edition_id/153/format/html/displaystory.html Jewishsf.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://shma.com/feb01/sarna.htm |title=SHMA.com |access-date=2005-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120100006/http://shma.com/feb01/sarna.htm |archive-date=2005-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in roles other than strictly religious).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/OrthodoxJudaism.htm Myjewishlearning.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120105354/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/OrthodoxJudaism.htm |date=2005-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, the movement will engage with the broader Jewish community, as discussed below, and with the secular world, as opposed to the Haredi approach of minimizing such contact.

====Centrality of the People of Israel====
All Orthodox ideologies place a high value on ''ahavat yisrael'' (love of ones fellow Jews) and all regard the [[Land of Israel]] as holy - and residence there as a ''[[mitzvah]]''. However, for Centrist Orthodoxy, the "People of Israel", additionally, play a central role. The resulting difference, relative to other philosophies, manifests in two ways. Firstly, involvement with non-orthodox will extend beyond "[[Baal teshuva#Orthodox outreach organizations|outreach]]" - in which many Haredi organisations engage - to continued institutional relations and cooperation (despite the "deviationist violations of Torah and Halakha" of the non-orthodox). Secondly, Centrist Orthodoxy places a high [[nationalism|national]], as well as religious, significance on the [[State of Israel]]. Centrist Orthodox institutions and individuals are therefore [[Zionist]] in orientation, and rates of ''[[Aliyah]]'' (immigration to Israel) from this community are high relative to others;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=312146&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=16&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y Haaretz.com]&lt;/ref&gt; study in Israeli ''[[Hesder Yeshiva|Hesder Yeshivot]]'' is also common. Thus, although Centrist Orthodoxy and [[religious Zionist Movement|Religious Zionism]] are not identical, they share many of the same values and many of the same adherents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_47/ai_54600118#continue Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
The institutions of American Centrist Orthodoxy include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Centrist.html Ucalgary.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Yeshiva University]] and The [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] ("RIETS"), the main institution for the training and [[semicha|ordination]] of Orthodox congregational Rabbis in America.    
* The [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the central body of Centrist Rabbis. Its "[[Bet Din of America]]", long headed by Rabbi Soloveitchik, is a respected source of [[posek|Jewish legal decisions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm Rabbis.org]&lt;/ref&gt;   
* The [[Orthodox Union]] ("OU"; Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America) established in 1898, is largest union of American Orthodox congregations. Its activities include the administration and certification of [[kashrut]]; support for a broad range of religious educational institutions and projects; lobbying the American government on various issues of importance to religious Jews (and occasionally, on matters related to Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/about/ou.htm |title=OU.org |access-date=2005-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050803193643/http://www.ou.org/about/ou.htm |archive-date=2005-08-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also incorporates NCSY ([[National Conference of Synagogue Youth]]) which offers social, educational and outreach programming in hundreds of communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/NCSY/basic.htm OU.org]&lt;/ref&gt;   
* [[Young Israel]] (The National Council of Young Israel) founded in 1912, serves as the national coordinating agency for nearly 150 Orthodox congregations; the goal of NCYI is "to broaden the appeal of the traditional community synagogue as the central address for Jewish communal life by providing educational, religious, social, spiritual and communal programming".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngisrael.org/ Younisrael.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with ''Torah im Derech Eretz''==
:''See also under [[Azriel_Hildesheimer#Comparison with Samson Raphael Hirsch|Azriel Hildesheimer]], [[Modern_Orthodox_Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|below]].''

''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''—"Torah with worldly involvement"—is a philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] concerning the relationship between Torah Judaism and the modern world, first articulated by [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] in c. 1840.  In some senses ''Torah Umadda'' and ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' are similar. Both value the acquisition of secular knowledge coupled with adherence to [[halakha]]; both, additionally, emphasise [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Worldly involvement|worldly involvement]]. In fact, ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is sometimes put forward as one [[paradigm]] upon which ''Torah Umadda'' (and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]] in general) is based.

At the same time though, the two are distinct in terms of emphasis. Whereas ''Torah Umadda'' maintains two separate realms—religious and secular—and accents the idea of (psychological and sociological) synthesis, "Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination—for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson).

Another difference is that ''Torah Umadda'' does not disavow communal partnership with the non-Orthodox Jewish community, whereas for Rabbi Hirsch "''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]''" (the Halachic requirement to have no official ties with non-Orthodox communal institutions) was a defining characteristic of his community, and a major theme in his writings.

While these distinctions can seem subtle (particularly the first), they have manifested in markedly divergent religious attitudes and perspectives. In fact, [[Shimon Schwab]], leader of the [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)|"Breuers" community]] in Washington Heights, has been described as "spiritually very distant" from Torah Umaddah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note further, that given both of the above, some have proposed that today, followers of ''Torah Umadda'' in fact assume a "non-Hirschian position", resembling more closely that of Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Haredi Judaism===
Critics of ''Torah Umadda'', particularly within [[Haredi Judaism]], see the complementarity of Torah and secular knowledge proposed by the philosophy as suggesting that the Torah is not of itself whole or complete. In their view, Torah Umadda is thus premised on a flawed appreciation of Torah. Furthermore, they believe that Torah Umadda is problematic in that its synthesis allows for an "encroachment" of the [[scientific]] [[worldview]] on [[Jewish theology]]. Torah Umadda thus represents a dilution of the "pure sanctity" (''taharat hakodesh'') of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm Daat.ac.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasidic Judaism===
Criticism by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups includes an additional [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] dimension. Here, the doctrine of ''[[Tzimtzum]]'' is understood to imply that since the physical world in fact ''conceals'' the existence and nature of the [[Creator deity|creator]], study of the natural world will be unlikely to deepen one’s appreciation of God or understanding of Torah. 

An additional consideration arises in that the role of the Jew [[Olam HaZeh|in this world]] is understood, primarily, to be concerned with fulfillment of the Law and study of Torah: "[One should] live by the light of these three things: love of God, love of Israel, and love of Torah" ([[Baal Shem Tov]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/denominations/hasidic.htm Religionfacts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the study of secular ideas and devotion of time to secular activities not directly for the sake of Torah - or as is necessary for supporting oneself - may constitute "spiritually damaging behavior". The sciences in particular are considered problematic:
{{quote|
"Occupying oneself with the sciences of the nations of the world is… included in the category of engaging in inconsequential matters insofar as the sin of neglecting the Torah is concerned… Moreover, the impurity of science is greater than the impurity of idle speech… Thus this is forbidden unless one employs [this knowledge] as a useful instrument, viz., as a means of [earning a livelihood] with which to be able to serve God… or unless he knows how to apply them in the service of God or to his better understanding of His Torah [i.e., in the manner of] Maimonides and Nachmanides…"|[[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], ''[[Tanya]]'': ''Likutei Amarim, 8''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7887 Chabad.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Nachman of Breslov]], [http://www.breslovbooks.com/pdf/hebrew-eitzos-yisharos.pdf ''Etzot Yesharot: Moadim'']).}}

===Neo-Orthodoxy===
As [[#Relationship_with_Torah_im_Derech_Eretz|above]], critics within [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Neo-Orthodoxy: the "Breuer" communities|Neo-Orthodoxy]], the movement directly descended from [[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Hirsch’s]] [[Frankfurt]] community, claim that the ''equality'' between Torah and secular posited by ''Torah Umadda'' in fact results in a diminution in the status of Torah - and a misrepresentation of the teachings of Rabbi Hirsch: "even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tzemachdovid.org/gedolim/jo/tworld/rbreuer.html Tzemachdovid.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109103642/http://www.tzemachdovid.org/gedolim/jo/tworld/rbreuer.html |date=2005-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between the two approaches, though subtle, manifests in markedly divergent religious attitudes and perspectives; as above, [[Shimon Schwab]], second Rabbi of this community in the [[United States]], is described as being "spiritually very distant"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt; from Yeshiva University.

===Religious Zionism===
The philosophies of Torah Umadda and [[Religious Zionism]] are not in any direct conflict, and generally coexist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_47/ai_54600118#continue Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt; sharing both values and adherents. However, more conservative Religious Zionists differ with ''Torah Umadda'' in its approach to secular knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zionism-israel.com/ezine/religious_zionism.htm Zionism-israel.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, engagement with secular ideas and situations is permissible and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel. Here, then, secular knowledge is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. Thus, for example, in contrast to ''Torah Umadda'', the study of literature and the humanities is discouraged here, whereas the study of engineering or medicine (and with subsequent practice in Israel) is deemed to be valuable.

===Modern Orthodoxy===
Within the ''Torah Umadda'' camp itself,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_brill.pdf Edah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; there are those who question whether "the literature on ''Torah u-Madda'' with its [[Intellectual#Intellectualism|intellectually elitist]] bias fails to directly address the majority of its practitioners"; further, there are suggestions that "the very logic of the practice is far removed from the ideology" ("The community works with an ideology of Torah combined with a suburban logic of practice"). The contention here is that the "''Torah u-Madda'' suburbanite" does not in reality engage in secular studies in order to achieve the [[intellectual synthesis]] described above, but rather "view[s] a college degree as the gateway toward professional advancement." Thus, although ''Torah Umadda'' may allow students at Yeshiva University "to navigate the use of their college years", it may not provide a directly applicable theology for the contemporary Modern Orthodox family.

In ''[[The Crisis of Zionism]]'', [[Peter Beinart]] writes that while the motto of Yeshiva University is Torah Umaddah, many Modern Orthodox leaders have abandoned that intellectual openness "in favor of an insularity that bespeaks both fear and insularity: fear that Orthodox Judaism cannot survive a dialogue with the outside world and arrogance that the outside world can add nothing of value to the world of Torah."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=v0U1fjErMGkC&amp;pg=PT180&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ursuline Academy''' is a historic [[convent]] and former [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[school]] located at 2300 Central Avenue in [[Great Falls, Montana]], in the United States. Constructed by the [[Ursulines|Ursuline Sisters]], a Catholic [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institute]] for women, the building was complete in 1912. It was originally known as the '''Ursuline Academy Boarding and Day School''', a school for children age five to 12.

The building came to be known as '''Ursuline Centre''' in 1971. Ursuline sisters continued to live in the building, but rented out its classrooms and kitchen spaces as a retreat center and a meeting place. As of 2012, only one Ursuline sister continued to live at the site.

The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on September 26, 1991.

==Construction of the building==
[[File:St Peters Mission Montana - pre 1908.jpg|thumb|350px|left|View of St. Peter's Mission between 1896 and 1908. The Ursuline stone convent and school is center-left. The original wood frame girls' school is center-right and low (with bell tower).]]
In March 1860, [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests established [[St. Peter's Mission Church and Cemetery|St. Peter's Mission]] on the [[Sun River]] about {{convert|8|mi|km}} upriver from [[Fort Shaw]], Montana. They moved the mission {{convert|2|mi|km}} downstream in 1862, but this location proved difficult for agriculture. In April 1866 the mission moved again, this time to a position {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of Bird Tail Rock (which is {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of the modern town of [[Simms, Montana]]). The mission closed almost immediately due to hostility from the [[Piegan Blackfeet]], but reopened in 1874. The mission moved again in 1881 to Birch Creek (a point about {{convert|9|mi|km}} west-northwest of [[Cascade, Montana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harrod, p. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aarstad, p. 252, 318.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1884, the new (and founding) Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena]], [[Jean-Baptiste Brondel]], invited the Ursuline religious order to join the Jesuits at St. Peter's Mission and assist them in teaching converted Native Americans. Leader of the Toledo chapter, Mother Amadeus (Sarah Therese Dunne), led five Ursulines to St. Peter's in October. They quickly established a boarding school for girls (open to children of settlers and Native Americans). The Jesuits gave the [[nun]]s a farm to help them survive, and promised to pay them $200 a year to teach boys if more nuns could be brought to the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Schrems, p. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ursulines built a large stone building between 1882 and 1887 which served as their school and convent. The school later moved into a two-story wood frame building, and the sisters built a bakery, barn, corral, laundry, and workers' housing. The Ursulines—who believed in music and art training as well as education in reading, math, and science—also built a three-story opera house at St. Peter's in 1896.

In 1908, the wood frame Ursuline school at St. Peter's Mission burned to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Schrems, p. 104; Porter and Scott, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The stone convent/school burned in 1918, causing the abandonment of St. Peter's Mission. See: Porter and Scott, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ursulines decided to move the center of their activity to nearby Great Falls, which was founded in 1883.&lt;ref name="Aarstad"&gt;Aarstad, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters were strongly supported by Bishop [[Mathias Clement Lenihan|Mathias Lenihan]], who led the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Great Falls-Billings|Roman Catholic Diocese of Great Falls]] (which had formed in 1904).&lt;ref&gt;Porter and Scott, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Falls Townsite Company offered them any two city blocks. The Ursulines choose an area bordered by Central Avenue, 25th Street South, 2nd Avenue South, and 23rd Street South. The area was on a slight hill with a good view and relatively distant from the busy downtown commercial district.&lt;ref name="Aarstad" /&gt;

Mother Francis Siebert oversaw the design and construction of the new building, which was named Ursuline Academy. The city agreed to close a block of 1st Avenue South and 24th Street South to create a unified grounds for the Ursulines.&lt;ref name="PorterandScott42"&gt;Porter and Scott, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Noted local architect [[George H. Shanley]] designed the structure in a variation on the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] known as Collegiate Gothic Revival.&lt;ref name="Robison"&gt;Robison, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Shanley donated a portion of his fee to the sisters, while contributions from the community and loans paid for the building. The [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda Copper Company]], which owned the huge copper smelter in town, contributed the bricks.&lt;ref name="Kolstad"&gt;Kolstad, Polly. "Ursuline Centre: Take a Step Back In Time." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' December 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone was laid in September 1911.&lt;ref name="PorterScott44" /&gt; Construction by the local firm of Leighland Kleppe and Company began in October 1911,&lt;ref name="PorterScott44"&gt;Porter and Scott, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FederalWriters"&gt;Federal Writers' Project, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and a pulley system, powered by horses, hauled brick and mortar into the air to the workmen.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt; The school opened for students on September 3, 1912.&lt;ref name="PorterScott44" /&gt; Ursuline Academy was constructed on the northwest corner of the property. The north side of the structure was its main entrance. The eastern half of the property consisted of large gardens.&lt;ref name="PorterandScott42" /&gt;

Two rooms of note were furnished at the time Ursuline Academy was completed.  The first, the Green Parlor, was designed for entertaining guests, hosting [[Tea party|tea]]s, and special occasions. It was furnished with green rugs, upholstered furniture, and lightly tinted, translucent green window draperies. The room contained an 1840 harp made in France which was the property of Mother Angela Lincoln (a relative of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) and a [[Piano#Grand|baby grand]] piano manufactured by the [[Steinway]] company. The piano was the gift of a student, whose father gave it to her as a graduation present. The other room was the Bishop's Parlor, a private suite for the bishop and important visitors. The suite consisted of a sitting room, bedroom, and bath room. The sitting room was furnished with finely carved dark oak furniture and bookcases retrieved from St. Peter's Mission, and the bedroom with dressers made of cherry.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

==History of the building==
The Ursuline Academy originally was open only to girls. When the school opened, enrollment consisted of 40 boarders, 25 day students, and 30 part-time music students.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt; The Ursuline Sisters expanded their educational offerings in 1920, and created Ursuline High School. It was housed within the academy building. Rapid expansion in enrollment led to the construction of a detached gymnasium south of the western end of the building in 1925.&lt;ref name="Porter and Scott, p. 60"&gt;Porter and Scott, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The school began accepting boys in 1927.&lt;ref name="Robison" /&gt; An annex was built against the gymnasium to permit boarding of male students. Classes were strictly segregated, as were the playground and yards.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

1927 was also the year that the Ursuline Academy chapel was painted. The chapel is original to the building, and was blessed in 1912. The [[Stations of the Cross]] which hang on the walls were made in the 1890s, and the lectern originally used at St. Peter's Mission. Three large scenes, painted by Sister (later Mother) Raphael Schweda in 1927, hang behind the altar. Depicted are [[Saint Ursula]] leading a group of martyred virgins into heaven, and Saint [[Angela Merici]] (founder of the Ursuline order) surrounded by a group of young women. The third painting depicts a group of cherubs and angels. Female students at Ursuline Academy were used as models for the young women following Saint Ursula, and the faces of women in the paintins are recognizable as alumni of the school.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt; There are also eight stained glass windows at the front and along the sides of the chapel, and the altar is flanked by statues of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].&lt;ref name="Porter and Scott, p. 60"/&gt;

For five decades, the room on the fifth floor in the tower was used as an art studio. Mother Raphael used it as her classroom, and only art students were permitted access. Since the classroom lacked water, Mother Raphael carried buckets of water up to the room each day. (Mother Raphael also painted backdrops for plays at the [[Great Falls Civic Center]], and made vestments for Catholic priests in many area churches.)&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

The Columbus Hospital School of Nursing opened in the city in 1898, and during World War II it greatly expanded its enrollment to meet wartime needs. Students in the nursing school slept in the Ursuline building with alongside the boarding school students.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt; In 1950, Ursuline High School merged with two other Catholic high schools in the city to form [[Great Falls Central High School (1950)|Great Falls Central High School]]. This school opened on the northeast corner of the Ursuline property at 2400 Central Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22Great%20Falls%20Central%22&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Falls%20Central%22&amp;f=false "Parochial High School."] ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]].'' January 18, 1954, p. 63-64, accessed 2013-01-09; Small, p. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Ursuline Academy also operated a candy store on its premises (with sweets manufactured by one of the sisters).&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

Expansion of the Catholic educational system in the city of Great Falls in the 1950s and 1960s led to the creation of many more elementary and junior high schools with larger, modern facilities.  Enrollment at Ursuline Academy dropped steadily, and the elementary school closed in 1966. The high school closed in 1973, and the [[Great Falls Public Schools]] purchased the building in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic school system in the city of Great Falls did not have a high school after 1973 until [[Great Falls Central Catholic High School]] opened in the fall of 2001. The new GFCCHS was housed at the [[University of Great Falls]] until fall 2007, when it moved into its own building at 2800 18th Avenue South. See: Johnson, Peter. "Backers Offer Details of Proposed Great Falls Catholic High School." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' February 3, 2000; Radcliffe, Rosanne. "Two New High Schools Open Their Doors." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' July 30, 2000; Cates, Kristen. "Central Opens in New Facility." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the impending loss of the high school, Ursuline Academy's days as an educational institution came to a close. The institution changed its name to Ursuline Centre in 1971.&lt;ref name="UrsulineCentre"&gt;"Ursuline Centre a Great Falls Success Story." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ursuline sisters continued to live in the building (treating it as a retirement home), but the building changed its function. The sisters began renting the facility for meetings and retreats, using the dormitory space for guest sleeping quarters and the old school kitchens to provide food service.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Ginny. "Community Input Wanted for Possible Uses for Old Schools." ''The Missoulian.'' July 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; To continue the educational function of the Ursulines, a portion of the building was rented out as a day care center.&lt;ref name="Wilmot90"&gt;Wilmot, Paula. "Ursuline Centre Celebrates 90 Years." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' September 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Ursuline Centre Historical Foundation was formed as a nonprofit entity to accept grants on behalf of the Ursuline Centre, manage the building, and operate the retreat. The foundation also assists the religious order in maintaining the building. A capital campaign to make much-needed repairs on the building began in 1998, and by September 2002 had raised $1.3 million. Although the campaign's original goal was to eventually raise $1.5 million, rising costs led the campaign leaders to raise the goal to $2 million. The foundation initially repaired the roof and replaced the building's 501 windows.&lt;ref name="Wilmot90" /&gt; In 2006, the electrical and plumbing systems were upgraded.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

In 2010, the Ursulines entered into negotiations to transfer ownership of their building to the Ursuline Centre Historical Foundation. The Ursulines offered to sell the building outright to the foundation for $200,000, but the foundation declined. Although the foundation had the money to fund the purchase, the purchase would leave its funds nearly depleted—leaving nothing to continue making repairs. The building's exterior needed extensive conservation and maintenance work, and the fire-suppression system needed replacing. The foundation estimated this work would require $1 million. Although the sale fell through, the Ursulines agreed to give the foundation the right-of-first-refusal on any sale in the future. In addition, the Ursuline Order said it was eliminating its financial support of the retreat. To improve the center's financial viability, the Ursulines and foundation  considered turning the former nuns' quarters (which were in excellent condition) into a retirement home for women, and finding more groups willing to use the busy retreat on weekdays.&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Ursuline Sisters to Pass the Torch." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' October 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the building's 100th anniversary in September 2012, more than $3 million had been spent to renovate and restore the structure. Replacement of the [[boiler]] and the electrical system had occurred, and work on the exterior was proceeding. Talks between the Ursulines and the foundation continued, in an attempt to reach agreement on a way to transfer ownership of the structure to the nonprofit.&lt;ref name="UrsulineCentre" /&gt;

==About the building==
The Ursuline Academy is a four-story building with a five-story central tower, and is constructed of stone and brick.&lt;ref name="Wilmot90" /&gt; The facade is trimmed with terra cotta with impressions of geometric forms. Stepped parapets exist on the main tower and wings.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FederalWriters" /&gt; As originally constructed, the academy had {{convert|64000|sqft|m2}} of internal space.&lt;ref name="PorterScott44" /&gt; Eight gargoyles sit atop the central tower.&lt;ref name="PorterScott44" /&gt; According to the ''[[Great Falls Tribune]]'' in September 2012, they are thought to be the only working gargoyles in the entire state.&lt;ref name="UrsulineCentre" /&gt; The property on which the building sits is about 60 percent smaller than it originally was, due to the sale of the high school and its football field to the city in 1974.

Icons throughout the building were painted by Mother Raphael Schweda.&lt;ref name="Aarstad" /&gt; The chapel remains largely unaltered since its completion in 1927. Mother Raphael's fifth-floor classroom is now an art gallery featuring many of her works, which include portraits, religious images, and floral paintings.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

The building's Amadeus Library, named for Mother Amadeus, contains an extensive of collection of early- and mid-20th century books and musical instruments. It also houses the archives for the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Ursuline order.

The long second floor hallway is now known as the Heritage Gallery. Photographs of graduating classes, portraits of nuns and students, diplomas, and other memorabilia hang in this hallway. At the end of the hallway in a former girls' dormitory room is the Heritage Museum, which documents the history of the Ursulines in Montana and at Ursuline Academy. The museum also contains many Native American beadwork items and dresses donated to the Ursulines by tribes in Montana. Antique clocks, hand-carved chairs, and intricately detailed tables—many made by the sisters at St. Peter's Mission—are also housed in the museum. A painting of St. Peter's Mission by contemporary artist Ralph DeCamp also hangs in the room.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

[[Tubular bells|Chimes]], original to the building, also still exist on the second floor. Capable of being heard through the building, each sister had a different signal which could be played on the chimes to summon her to the central office. The chimes were also used to call the sisters to chapel, and for signalling the start and end of classes.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;

The Ursuline Academy's meeting and retreat center can accommodate up to 100 people in dormitory rooms on the third and fourth floors. Space exists for multiple groups to use the facility at one time. The center also has a kitchen and kitchen staff of four. A 260-seat auditorium with stage exists on the second floor.&lt;ref name="Kolstad" /&gt;  As of 2011, the Ursuline Academy also was home to a [[preschool]] and day-care center.&lt;ref name="UrsulineCentre" /&gt;

==Other buildings on the site==
The Ursuline Sisters partnered with the [[Sisters of Providence (Montreal)|Sisters of Providence]] in 1932 to establish Great Falls Junior College for Women (a two-year [[Higher education|post-secondary]] school) adjacent to the Ursuline Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Porter and Scott, p. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The college was built on the northeast corner of the property. But the financial distress caused by the [[Great Depression]] caused the building to lie unfinished for decades.&lt;ref name="PorterandScott42" /&gt; To accommodate the students, the college opened on September 8, 1932, in the Ursuline Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Small, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milestones"&gt;"University of Great Falls Reaches Pair of Milestones." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The college was diocesan, and not controlled by either religious order. The original enrollment was 14.&lt;ref name="Milestones" /&gt;

It became a coeducational college in 1937 known as Great Falls Junior College. By 1950, it had moved out of Ursuline Academy and was holding classes in the Old Columbus Hospital building at 1601 2nd Avenue North.&lt;ref name="Milestones" /&gt;

After a reorganization of the Ursulines in 1958, the sisters agreed that they could no longer support the college.&lt;ref&gt;Small, p. 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sisters of Providence established Great Falls Normal School, a college of education, in 1938. The Normal School merged with the Junior College in 1942 to form the Great Falls College of Education. The institution became the College of Great Falls in the early 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ursulines relinquished control of the junior college in 1960. The Sisters of Providence moved it to its present site between 20th and 23rd Streets South on 12th Street South. It is now known as the [[University of Great Falls]].

'''William Angus Knight''' (1836–1916) was a British writer, born at [[Mordington]], [[Scotland]], and educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  From 1876 to 1902 he was [[professor]] of moral philosophy in the [[University of St Andrews|University of St. Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=KNIGHT, William Angus|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the field of philosophy his work, editorial and other, includes his collection of ''Philosophical Classics for English Readers'' (15 volumes, 1880–90), some of which he wrote.  Although he wrote numerous publications, he is probably best known for his works on [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]].  His edition of ''Wordsworth's Works and Life'' (1881–89) is contained in 11 volumes.  He presented to the [[trustee]]s of [[Dove Cottage]], Grasmere, the poet's former home, all the editions of Wordsworth's poems which he possessed. He also corresponded with [[Robert Browning]] about [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], and on his retirement in 1905 he came to [[Florence]]'s Swiss-owned so-called [[English Cemetery, Florence|English Cemetery]] to plant the red rose at her tomb, which still flourishes, to honour women's learning, though the enamelled plaque celebrating that act has since been stolen. His portrait was presented to [[St Andrews University]] by the [[Ladies Literate in Arts]] whose admission he encouraged.

[[File:Lassa witch doctors.jpg|thumb|250px|Two [[Borno State|Lassa]] witch doctors]]

A '''witch doctor''' was originally a type of [[Alternative medicine|healer]] who treated ailments believed to be caused by [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Lugira, Aloysius Muzzanganda. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S79wsrvX_-MC&amp;pg=PA100 African Traditional Religion]'', p. 100 (Infobase Publishing, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The term witch doctor is sometimes used to refer to [[Alternative medicine|healer]]s, particularly in regions which use [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] rather than [[evidence-based medicine|contemporary medicine]]. In contemporary society, "witch doctor" is sometimes used derisively to refer to [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]] and [[Faith healing|faith healers]].{{Citation_Needed|date=May 2017}}

==Original meaning of the term==
In its original meaning, witch doctors were emphatically not witches themselves, but rather people who had remedies to protect others against witchcraft. Witchcraft-induced conditions were their area of expertise, as described in this 1858 news report from England:&lt;ref&gt;The Ipswich Journal (Ipswich, England), Saturday, September 25, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recourse was had by the girl's parents to a cunning man, named Burrell, residing at Copford, who has long borne the name of "The Wizard of the North:" but her case was of so peculiar a character as to baffle his skill to dissolve the spell, Application was next made to a witch doctor named Murrell, residing at Hadleigh, Essex, who undertook to effect a cure, giving a bottle of medication, for which he did not forget to charge 3s. 6d., and promising to pay a visit on Monday evening to the "old witch," Mrs. Mole, and put an end to her subtle arts...

... the news of the expected coming of the witch-doctor spread far and wide, and about eight o'clock there could not have been less than 200 people collected near the cottage of Mrs. Mole to witness the supernatural powers of the Hadleigh wizard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In Europe==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that the first record of the use of this term was in 1718, in Francis Hutchinson's work ''An Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft, with Observations upon Matters of Fact; Tending to Clear the Texts of the Sacred Scriptures, and Confute the Vulgar Errors about that Point.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft |last=Hutchinson |publisher=Printed for R. Knaplock and D. Midwinter |location=London |year=1718 |first=Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson used the phrase in a chapter defending a prisoner who was charged with witchcraft, by asserting that the "Witch-Doctor" himself was the one using sorcery: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The said Dorothy Durent, having been with a Witch-Doctor, acknowledges upon Oath, that by his Advice she hang'd up her Child's Blanket in the Chimney, found a Toad in it at Night, had put it into the Fire, and held it there tho' it made a great and horrible Noise, and flash'd like Gunpower, and went off like a Pistol, and then became invisible, and that by this the Prisoner was scorch'd and burn'd lamentably. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[Charles Mackay (author)|Charles Mackay]]'s book, ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]'', first published in 1841, attests to the practice of belief in witch doctors in England at the time.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the north of England, the superstition lingers to an almost inconceivable extent. Lancashire abounds with witch-doctors, a set of quacks, who pretend to cure diseases inflicted by the devil. The practices of these worthies may be judged of by the following case, reported in the "Hertford Reformer," of the 23rd of June, 1838. The witch-doctor alluded to is better known by the name of the cunning man, and has a large practice in the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham. According to the writer in "The Reformer," the dupe, whose name is not mentioned, had been for about two years afflicted with a painful abscess and had been prescribed for without relief by more than one medical gentleman. He was urged by some of his friends, not only in his own village but in neighbouring ones, to consult the witch-doctor, as they were convinced he was under some evil influence. He agreed and sent his wife to the cunning man, who lived in New Saint Swithin's, in Lincoln. She was informed by this ignorant impostor that her husband's disorder was an infliction of the devil, occasioned by his next-door neighbours, who had made use of certain charms for that purpose. From the description he gave of the process, it appears to be the same as that employed by Dr. Fian and Gellie Duncan, to work woe upon King James. He stated that the neighbours, instigated by a witch, whom he pointed out, took some wax, and moulded it before the fire into the form of her husband, as near as they could represent him; they then pierced the image with pins on all sides – repeated the Lord's Prayer backwards, and offered prayers to the devil that he would fix his stings into the person whom that figure represented, in like manner as they pierced it with pins. To counteract the effects of this diabolical process, the witch-doctor prescribed a certain medicine, and a charm to be worn next to the body, on that part where the disease principally lay. The patient was to repeat the 109th and 119th Psalms every day, or the cure would not be effectual. The fee which he claimed for this advice was a guinea.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A healing ceremony held in [[Worcester]], [[England]] on October 26, 2017, is a rare modern example of the practice in [[Europe]]. A sacred river blessing was conducted by a travelling witch doctor at the [[River Severn]] after rumours of a [[cholera]] risk. Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 was said to be present in the river due to migrating [[salmon]] which had consumed crustacean [[zooplankton]] carrying the [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barnett |first1=Christian |title=Witch doctor visits city to 'protect the river and the people of Worcester |url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/15628654.Witch_doctor_visits_city_to___39_protect_the_river_and_the_people_of_Worcester__39_/ |accessdate=18 August 2018 |publisher=Worcester News |date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Africa==
[[File:Shona witch doctor (Zimbabwe).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Shona people|Shona]] traditional healer, or [[n'anga]] ([[Zimbabwe]]).]] 
{{main|Sangoma}}
In southern Africa, traditional healers are known as ''[[sangoma]]s''. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that the first use of the term "witch doctor" to refer to African [[shaman]]s (i.e. [[Medicine man|medicine men]]) was in 1836 in a book by [[Robert Montgomery Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=History of Southern Africa comprising the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, Seychelles, &amp;c. |last=Martin |first=Robert Montgomery |publisher=J. Mortimer |location=London |year=1836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC News reported, on March 12, 2015, that, "More than 200 witchdoctors and traditional healers have been arrested in Tanzania in a crackdown on the murder of albino people. 
The killings have been driven by the belief – advanced by some witchdoctors – that the body parts have properties that confer wealth and good luck. According to the Red Cross, witchdoctors are prepared to pay $75,000 (£50,000) for a complete set of albino body parts. Nearly 80 albino Tanzanians have been killed since 2000, the UN says. The latest victims include a one-year-old albino boy, killed in north-western Tanzania. The government banned witchdoctors in January as part of its efforts to prevent further attacks and kidnappings targeting people with [[Albinism|albinism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tanzania albino murders: 'More than 200 witchdoctors' arrested|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31849531/|date=12 March 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Nepal and Northeastern India ==
{{Main|Jhākri}}
''Jhākri'' ({{lang-ne|झाक्री}}) is the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for [[shaman]]. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the [[Tamang people]] and the [[Magars]]; it is also used in the [[States and territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Sikkim]] and [[West Bengal]], which border [[Nepal]].

Jhākri shamanism is practiced among numerous [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] of Nepal and [[Northeast India]], including the [[Limbu people|Limbu]], [[Rai people|Rai]], [[Sunwar]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Tamang people|Tamang]], [[Gurung people|Gurung]], [[Magars]], [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Khas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gulia|2005||pp=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of [[spirit possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gulia|2005||p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vernacular words for ''jhākri'' are ''phedangbo'' in the [[Limbu language]], ''maangpa'' or ''nakchyong'' in [[Khambu]], and ''boongthing'' in [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]].

Jhākris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mun (religion)|Mun]], and [[Bön]] rites.

'''Ágnes Heller''' (born 12 May 1929) is a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] philosopher and lecturer. She was a core member of the Budapest School philosophical forum in the 1960s and later taught political theory for 25 years at the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]]. She lives, writes and lectures in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/opinion/politics/what-happened-to-hungary.html|title=What Happened to Hungary?|author=Agnes Heller|publisher=The New York Times|date=2018-09-16|accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life  and political development==

Ágnes Heller was raised in a middle-class{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Jewish]] family. During [[World War II]] her father used his legal training and knowledge of [[German language|German]] to help people get together the necessary paperwork to emigrate from [[Nazi]] Europe. In 1944, Heller's father was deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] where he died before the war ended. Heller and her mother managed to avoid deportation.

With regard to the influence of [[the Holocaust]] on her work, Heller has said:
:I was always interested in the question: How could this possibly happen? How can I understand this? And this experience of the holocaust was joined with my experience in the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime. This brought up very similar questions in my soul-search and world investigation: how could this happen? How could people do things like this? So I had to find out what morality is all about, what is the nature of good and evil, what can I do about crime, what can I figure out about the sources of morality and evil? That was the first inquiry. The other inquiry was a social question: what kind of world can produce this? What kind of world allows such things to happen? What is modernity all about? Can we expect redemption?&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Csaba Polony]], ''Left Curve Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Heller began to study physics and chemistry at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]]. She changed her focus to philosophy, however, when her boyfriend at the time urged her to listen to the lecture of the philosopher [[György Lukács]], on the intersections of philosophy and culture. She was immediately taken by how much his lecture addressed her concerns and interests in how to live in the modern world, especially after the experience of World War II and the Holocaust.

1947 was also the year that Heller joined the [[Hungarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] while at a Zionist work camp&lt;ref&gt;'We lived in community, we felt we belonged together. We needed neither money nor the rich ... I  didn't like the rich, today I am ashamed of it. I abominated the black market dealers, the dollar speculators, the men of rapacity and greed. No problem! I'd stay loyal for ever to the poor. So, crazy chick that I was, I joined the Communist party to be with the poor'. Cited [[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''Interesting Times,'',2002 p.137&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop her interest in Marxism. However, she felt that the Party was stifling the ability of its adherents to think freely due to the belief in [[Democratic centralism]] (total allegiance) to the Party. She was expelled from it for the first time in 1949, the year that [[Mátyás Rákosi]] came into power and ushered in the years of [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] rule.

==Scientific work==

===Early career in Hungary===
After 1953 and the installation of [[Imre Nagy]] as Prime Minister, Heller was able to safely undertake her doctoral studies under the supervision of [[Georg Lukács|Lukács]], and in 1955 she began to teach at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]].

===From the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 to the Prague Spring of 1968===
The [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was the most important political event of her life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist [[critical theory]] as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller's ideas that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] really means for the people is to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.

Lukács, Heller and other critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and [[socialism]] needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|Soviet Union]] in Hungary's future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of [[János Kádár]]: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian Academy]] as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). 
   
From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the "[[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]]", a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of practiced and theoretical socialism. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband [[Ferenc Fehér]], [[György Márkus]], [[Mihály Vajda]] and some other scholars with the looser connection to the school (such as [[András Hegedüs]], [[István Eörsi]], [[János Kis]] and [[György Bence]]).

Heller's work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to be the character of modern societies; [[liberation theory]] as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from "the bottom up," and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of "[[everyday life]]". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of [[aesthetics]] in ''The Concept of The Beautiful'' (1998), ''Time Is Out of Joint'' (2002), and ''Immortal Comedy'' (2005).

===Career in Hungary after the Prague Spring===
Until the events of the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], the Budapest School remained supportive of reformist attitudes towards socialism. After the invasion of Czechoslovakia by [[Warsaw Pact]] forces and the crushing of dissent, however, the School and Heller came to believe that the Eastern European regimes were entirely corrupted and that reformist theory was apologist. Heller explains in her interview with Polony that:

:the regime just could not tolerate any other opinion; that is what a totalitarian regime is. But a totalitarian regime cannot totalize entirely, it cannot dismiss pluralism; pluralism exists in the modern world, but it can outlaw pluralism. To outlaw pluralism means that the Party decided which kind of dissenting opinion was allowed. That is, you could not write something without it being allowed by the Party. But we had started to write and think independently and that was such a tremendous challenge against the way the whole system worked. They could not possibly tolerate not playing by the rules of the game. And we did not play by the rules of the game.

This view was completely incompatible with Kadar's view of Hungary's political future after the Revolution of 1956.{{citation needed |date=April 2011}}  According to her latest interview&lt;ref&gt;http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2010/34/41610.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the German newspaper [[Jungle World]], she thinks that political and criminal processes after 1956 were [[antisemitic]].

After Lukács' death in 1971, the School's members became victims of political persecution, were made unemployed through their dismissal from their university jobs, and were subjected to official surveillance and general harassment.{{citation needed |date=April 2011}} Rather than remain as dissidents, Heller and her husband the philosopher Ferenc Fehér, along with many other members of the core group of the School, chose exile in [[Australia]] in 1977.

===Career abroad===

Heller and Fehér encountered what they regarded as the sterility of local culture and lived in relative suburban obscurity close to [[La Trobe University]] in [[Melbourne]], and they assisted in the transformation of ''[[Thesis Eleven]]'' from a labourist journal to a leading Australian journal of social theory before its subsequent conversion to "American civilization" (Tormey 4–18)(Grumley 5–15).

As described by Tormey, Heller's mature thought during this time period is based on the tenets that can be attributed to her personal history and experience as a member of the Budapest School, focusing on the stress on the individual as agent; the hostility to the justification of the state of affairs by reference to non-moral or non-ethical criteria; the belief in "human substance" as the origin of everything that is good or worthwhile; and the hostility to forms of theorizing and political practice that deny equality, rationality and self-determination in the name of "our" interests and needs, however defined.

Heller and Fehér left Australia in 1986 to take up positions in [[The New School]] in [[New York City]], where Heller currently holds the position of [[Hannah Arendt]] Professor of Philosophy in the Graduate Studies Program. Her contribution to the field of philosophy has been recognized by the many awards that she has received (such as the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Philosophy, Bremen, 1995) and the Szechenyi National Prize in Hungary, 1995{{citation needed |date=April 2011}} and the various academic societies that she serves on, including the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 2006 she visited China for a week for the first time.

Heller currently researches and writes prolifically on ethics, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[aesthetics]], political theory, modernity, and the role of [[Central Europe]] in historical events.

In 2006, she was the recipient of the [[Sonning Prize]], in 2010 she received the [[Goethe Medal]].{{citation needed |date=April 2011}}

In 2010, Heller, with 26 other well known and successful Hungarian women, joined the campaign for a referendum for a female quota in the Hungarian legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nol.hu/archivum/20101105-noi_kvota__most_nepszavazassal_probalkoznak Női kvóta: népszavazással és meztelen férfiakkal próbálkoznak], [[Népszabadság]], 5 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heller continues to publish internationally renowned works, including republications of her previous works in English, all of which are internationally revered by scholars such as Lydia Goehr (on Heller's ''The Concept of the Beautiful''), Richard Wolin (on Heller's recent republication of ''A Theory of Feelings''), Dmitri Nikulin (on comedy and ethics), John Grumley (whose own work focuses on Heller in ''Agnes Heller: A Moralist in the Vortex of History''), John Rundell (on Heller's aesthetics and theory of modernity), Preben Kaarsholm (on Heller's ''A Short History of My Philosophy''), among others.

Heller is now Professor Emeritus at the New School for Social Research in New York. [http://newschool.edu/NSSR/faculty_phil.aspx] She continues to work actively both academically and politically around the globe. Recently she has spoken at the [[Imre Kertész]] College in Jena, Germany together with Polish sociologist, [[Zygmunt Bauman]] [http://www.imre-kertesz-kolleg.uni-jena.de/], at the Tübingen Book Fair in Germany speaking together with Former German Justice Minister, [[Herta Däubler-Gmelin]], [http://www.tagblatt.de/Home/nachrichten/kultur/regionale-kultur_artikel,-Agnes-Heller-mit-Daeubler-Gmelin-und-Wertheimer-im-Pfleghof-_arid,135796.html], and other venues worldwide.
