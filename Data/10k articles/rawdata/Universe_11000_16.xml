'''15,16-Dihydroxy-α-eleostearic acid''', or '''15,16-Dihydroxy-(9Z,11E,13E)-9,11,13-octadecatrienoic acid''', is an [[organic compound]] with formula {{chem|C|18|H|30|O|4}}, or H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-(-CH(OH)-)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(-CH=CH-)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-(-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-(C=O)OH.  It can be seen as derived from [[alpha-eleostearic acid|α-eleostearic acid]] by the replacement of two [[hydrogen]] atoms by two [[hydroxyl]] (OH) groups.

The compound is found in the pulp and seeds of [[bitter melon]]s (the fruits of ''Momordica charantia'').  It has been found to induce [[apoptosis]] in [[HL60]] [[leukemia]] cells [[in vitro]] at a concentration of 160 [[micromolar|μM]], although it is less potent in this regard than the unsubstituted α-eleostearic acid (also found in the seed oil).  While α-eleostearic acid has been found to prevent [[carcinogenesis]] in [[rat]]s, this derivative does not seem to have that effect.&lt;ref name="kob2008"&gt;Masuko Kobori, Mayumi Ohnishi-Kameyama, Yukari Akimoto, Chizuko Yukizaki and Mitsuru Yoshida (2008) ''α-Eleostearic Acid and Its Dihydroxy Derivative Are MajorApoptosis-Inducing Components of Bitter Gourd''. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, volume 56, issue 22, pages 10515–10520. {{doi|10.1021/jf8020877}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound can be extracted from the fruit with [[ethanol]], and is soluble in [[ethyl acetate]] but not in water or [[acetone]].

The '''1984 Balkan Bulgarian Tupolev Tu-134 crash''' occurred on 10 January 1984 when a [[Balkan Bulgarian Airlines]] [[Tupolev Tu-134]] airliner crashed on an international flight from [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport]] in [[Schönefeld]], [[East Germany]], to [[Sofia Airport]] in [[Sofia, Bulgaria|Sofia]], Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=50 Killed as Tupolev crashes at Sofia |day_of_week=Thursday |date=12 January 1984 |page_number=5 |issue=61736 |column= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All fifty on board were killed.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

While on approach to Sofia Airport in heavy snow, the crew failed to make visual contact with the ground as they descended below [[decision altitude]]. The crew attempted to overshoot for an altitude of {{convert|80|to|100|m|ft|sp=us}}, but the aircraft hit a power line and crashed {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the runway into a forest. The aircraft was destroyed with no survivors.

==Passengers==
Thirty-eight passengers and the crew were Bulgarians, the other seven on the flight were East Germans.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

After an initial uninterrupted shutdown over much of northern Europe from 15 to 23 April, airspace was closed intermittently in different parts of Europe in the following weeks, as the path of the ash cloud was tracked.

The eruption occurred beneath [[glacier|glacial ice]]. The cold water from the melting ice chilled the [[lava]] quickly, causing it to fragment into very small particles of glass ([[silica]]) and ash, which were carried into the [[Eruption column|eruption plume]]. The extremely fine ash particles and the large volume of steam from the glacial [[wikt:meltwater|meltwater]] sent an ash plume [[Volcanic ash#Aircraft|hazardous to aircraft]] rapidly high into the [[upper atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=Guardian9032564&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9032564 |title=Iceland's volcanic ash halts flights across Europe |work=The Guardian |date=15 April 2010|accessdate=17 April 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100423175956/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9032564| archivedate= 23 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence and location of the plume depended upon the state of the eruption and the winds.

== Background ==

[[File:Volcanic Lavender.jpg|thumb| Dust particles suspended in the atmosphere scatter light from the setting sun, generating 'volcanic lavenders' like this one over the flight path of [[Leeds-Bradford Airport]] in England during the aviation shutdown]]
The London [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre]] (VAAC) was responsible for providing information about the [[volcanic ash|ash plume]] to the relevant [[civil aviation authority|civil aviation authorities]] in the form of Volcanic Ash Advisories (VAA). On the basis of this, the authorities made decisions about when and where airspace should be closed due to the safety issues. Their decisions resulted in the cancellations of flights at airports across the world, not only in those countries where airspace was restricted. On 16 April 2010, 16,000 of Europe's usual 28,000 daily scheduled passenger flights were cancelled and on the following day 16,000 of the usual 22,000 flights were cancelled.&lt;ref name="VoA17April"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Disrupted-Air-Travel-in-Northern-Europe-for-Third-Full-Day-91209609.html|title=Disrupted Air Travel in Northern Europe for Third Full Day|last=Hennessy|first=Selah|date=17 April 2010|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420052257/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Disrupted-Air-Travel-in-Northern-Europe-for-Third-Full-Day-91209609.html| archivedate= 20 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 April 95,000 flights had been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8633892.stm "Ash cloud chaos: Airlines face huge task as ban ends"] BBC News, 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Before this, the severest restrictions to air travel in recent times were following the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States]] when all civil air traffic (not just scheduled) in US airspace, and to and from the United States, was grounded for three days.

==Jet engine tolerance to airborne particles==

In 1982, [[British Airways Flight 9]] flew through volcanic ash of [[Mount Galunggung]], [[Java]], Indonesia, causing all 4 engines to shut down. However, the crew restarted all but one of the engines and [[emergency landing|landed safely]]. Subsequently, there was an addition to the operations manuals, describing how to deal with volcanic ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2010/s2909102.htm |title=ABC News – Foreign Correspondent – May – transcript |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |accessdate=21 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622032848/http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2010/s2909102.htm| archivedate= 22 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland's authorities had been warning the airlines for several years, asking them to determine the density of ash that is safe for their jet engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2010/s2909102.htm |title=Iceland – World, Interrupted – Foreign Correspondent |publisher=ABC |accessdate=21 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622032848/http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2010/s2909102.htm| archivedate= 22 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But before the volcanic events of April 2010, aircraft engine manufacturers still had not defined specific particle levels above which engines were considered to be at risk.{{ref}} The general approach taken by airspace regulators was that if the ash concentration rose above zero, then the airspace was considered unsafe and was consequently closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18797-can-we-fly-safely-through-volcanic-ash.html |title=Can we fly safely through volcanic ash? – tech – 20 April 2010 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=21 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423054540/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18797-can-we-fly-safely-through-volcanic-ash.html |archivedate=23 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April eruption of Eyjafjallajökull caused enough economic difficulties that aircraft manufacturers were forced to define specific limits on how much ash is considered acceptable for a jet engine to ingest without damage. On 21 April, the [[Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] in conjunction with engine manufacturers, set new guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18802-engine-stripdowns-establish-safe-volcanic-ash-levels.html |title=Engine strip-downs establish safe volcanic ash levels – tech – 21 April 2010 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=21 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512180225/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18802-engine-stripdowns-establish-safe-volcanic-ash-levels.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed aircraft to fly when there are levels of volcanic ash between 200 and 2000 microgrammes of ash per cubic metre. These levels were declared by governments, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines not to have safety implications if appropriate maintenance and ash inspection procedures were followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8634276.stm Was the flight ban necessary?] BBC News, 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8654559.stm Volcano ash flight ban 'might have ended sooner'] BBC News, 3 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

From noon 18 May, the CAA further revised the safe limit upwards to 4 milligrams per cubic metre of air space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8685913.stm |title=Volcanic ash cloud restrictions lifted at UK airports |publisher=BBC News |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111013042117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8685913.stm| archivedate=13 October 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any airspace in which the ash density exceeds this limit is categorised as a [[no fly zone]].

To minimise the level of further disruption that this and other volcanic eruptions could cause, the [[Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] announced the creation of a new category of restricted airspace called a [[Time Limited Zone]] (TLZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/Letter%20to%20NSAs%20re%20Volcanic%20Ash-%20Creation%20of%20TLZ.pdf |title=Letter|accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522102951/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/Letter%20to%20NSAs%20re%20Volcanic%20Ash-%20Creation%20of%20TLZ.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airspace categorised as TLZ is similar to airspace experiencing severe weather in that the restrictions are expected to be of a short duration; however, the key difference with TLZ airspace is that airlines must produce certificates of compliance in order for their aircraft to enter these areas. [[Flybe]] was the first airline to conform to these regulations and their aircraft will be permitted to enter airspace in which the ash density is between 2&amp;nbsp;mg and 4&amp;nbsp;mg per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Volcano-Ash-New-Time-Limited-Zone-Introduced-To-Reduce-Flight-Restrictions-Due-To-Ash-Cloud/Article/201005315633952?f=rss |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713045639/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Volcano-Ash-New-Time-Limited-Zone-Introduced-To-Reduce-Flight-Restrictions-Due-To-Ash-Cloud/Article/201005315633952?f=rss |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=Volcano Ash: New Time Limited Zone Introduced To Reduce Flight Restrictions Due To Ash Cloud &amp;#124; UK News &amp;#124; Sky News |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=21 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under international regulations, all scheduled passenger flights operate under the [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) which requires clearance to be obtained from [[air traffic control]]. From 14 April onwards, the [[controlled airspace]] was closed in several European countries and no IFR clearances were granted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The airspace of Iceland itself was hardly disrupted in this period (although a change in the wind direction on 23 April caused the main airport to be closed).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

By 23 April, the restrictions were lifted over much of Europe through the introduction of new guidelines on volcanic ash density. After this date there were sporadic closures from time to time, notably in the UK, Ireland, and Iceland, but not a blanket shutdown.

On Monday, 19 April, the combination of heavy fog with a warning by [[Transport Canada]] and [[Nav Canada]] of a 30% risk of volcanic ash reaching [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] led to the cancellation of several flights scheduled to leave [[St. John's International Airport]], [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], and [[Deer Lake Regional Airport|Deer Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/04/18/nl-volcanic-ash-flights.html "Flights scrapped as Iceland ash heads to N.L."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421012120/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/04/18/nl-volcanic-ash-flights.html |date=21 April 2010 }} [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/national/201004/18/01-4271773-le-nuage-de-cendres-pourrait-atteindre-terre-neuve.php "Le nuage de cendres pourrait atteindre Terre-Neuve"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421033102/http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/national/201004/18/01-4271773-le-nuage-de-cendres-pourrait-atteindre-terre-neuve.php |date=21 April 2010 }} ''La Presse (Quebec)'', 18 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the heavy fog, it is unclear if the ash cloud warning was really the cause of the cancellations and delays in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and most flights returned to their normal schedule within the day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/797429--volcanic-ash-has-no-impact-on-east-coast-flights "Volcanic ash has no impact on East Coast flights"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422021007/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/797429--volcanic-ash-has-no-impact-on-east-coast-flights |date=22 April 2010 }} ''Toronto Star'', 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air Canada]] said their flights were "subject to some delays due to inclement weather, unrelated to ash cloud."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ash-cloud-fears-as-flights-delayed-in-canadian-airspace/article1539013/ "Volcanic cloud fears lift, Canadian airspace remains open"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722150508/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ash-cloud-fears-as-flights-delayed-in-canadian-airspace/article1539013/ |date=22 July 2010 }} ''The Globe and Mail'', 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, 20 April, two [[Air Canada Jazz]] flights between the [[Magdalen Islands]] and [[Quebec City]] cancelled stop-offs in [[Gaspé, Quebec|Gaspé]] because of ash over the [[Michel-Pouliot Gaspé Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/04/19/13643591-qmi.html Ash cloud won't hit Montreal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529020516/http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/04/19/13643591-qmi.html |date=29 May 2010 }} ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Most airspace started to close from 15 April. However, in the days following there were brief windows free of the cloud at different locations which were exploited to make a few aircraft movements. There then followed test flights and pressure grew to re-evaluate the criteria for safe levels of ash to fly through.

On 16 April a 30-minute break at [[Manchester]] allowed two flights to land, and one aircraft to be moved to Florida, empty (as there was no time for passengers to board).

On 17 April 2010, the president of German airline [[Air Berlin]], in an interview with the newspaper [[Bild|Bild am Sonntag]], stated that the risks for flights due to this volcanic haze were nonexistent, because the assessment was based only on a computer simulation produced by the [[VAAC]].

The vice president of the Dutch pilots union said "We are asking the authorities to really have a good look at the situation, because 100 per cent safety does not exist," Mr. Verhagen continued. "It's easy to close down air space because then it's perfectly safe, but at some time you have to resume flights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/18/european-airlines-send-test-flights-despite-ash/ EU: Half of regular flights may operate Monday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421001620/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/18/european-airlines-send-test-flights-despite-ash/ |date=21 April 2010 }} Washington Times, 18 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative transport routes===
[[File:Volcano causes queue at Bergen Station.jpg|thumb|Queue at [[Bergen Station]] as travelers wait to purchase train tickets from the [[Norwegian State Railways]]]]
Passengers destined for countries where airspace was closed had to switch to other modes of transport, possibly via airports still open in [[Portugal]], [[Morocco]], and [[Turkey]] to the east. Once inside Europe, many people tried to reach their final destination by train or road. People hired coaches, hire cars, and taxis while the train companies reported a large increase in passenger numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Coast Railway provides extra train services as travellers switch from the skies |url=http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/about-us/Press-Release/2008/EAST-COAST-RAILWAY-PROVIDES-EXTRA-TRAIN-SERVICES-AS-TRAVELLERS-SWITCH-FROM-THE-SKIES/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418205735/http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/about-us/Press-Release/2008/EAST-COAST-RAILWAY-PROVIDES-EXTRA-TRAIN-SERVICES-AS-TRAVELLERS-SWITCH-FROM-THE-SKIES/ |archivedate=18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurostar]] passenger trains were solidly booked, the [[Eurotunnel]] car-carrying trains which run through the [[Channel Tunnel]] were very busy, and additional services were scheduled. Travel conditions in France were compounded by an ongoing rail strike affecting long-distance trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/319022,extra-volcanic-ash-rail-strike-disrupt-french-holiday-travel.html |title=EXTRA: Volcanic ash, rail strike disrupt French holiday travel |publisher=Earth Times|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most UK and Irish ferry routes were exceptionally busy and coach operator [[Bus Éireann]] arranged extra [[Eurolines]] services between Ireland and England via ferry. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The websites Twitter and Facebook, as well as other sites like Roadsharing, were used to arrange alternative travel plans involving boats and ships, trains, and other forms of transportation such as cars, as well as to try to find rooms for the night in the cities where they were stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volcano-Stranded Travelers Turn to Social Media|url=http://gigaom.com/2010/04/17/volcano-stranded-travellers-turn-to-social-media/|publisher=The GigaOM Network|date=17 April 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420063447/http://gigaom.com/2010/04/17/volcano-stranded-travellers-turn-to-social-media/|archivedate=20 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to face-to-face business meetings, [[videoconferencing]] was also used by the European Union, governments, and companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelinsider.com/c/a/Cisco/Cisco-Iceland-Volcano-Boosts-Video-Conferencing-153040/ Cisco: Iceland Volcano Boosts Video Conferencing] Channelinsider, from Reuters, 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of airspace closure==
There was much criticism by airlines, which suffered large financial losses, of the airspace closures as unnecessary; however, the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU transport presidency]] disagreed, saying that "This situation is causing them important losses, but safety is paramount".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/iceland-volcano.478 EU disagrees with airlines' criticism over airspace closure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422113527/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/iceland-volcano.478 |date=22 April 2010 }} EU Business, 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military flying==
Some military aircraft which flew during the period of closure suffered engine damage, although no crashes were reported.

On 15 April, five [[Finnish Air Force]] [[F-18]] fighter jets on exercise flew into the ash cloud in northern Finland. Volcanic dust was found on the engines of three of the aircraft and a further inspection revealed extensive damage by molten glass deposits inside the combustion chamber of one of the engines. The engines were sent for disassembly and overhaul. As a result, all unnecessary military flights were cancelled except for identification flights to enforce sovereign airspace. Meanwhile, a [[BAE Hawk]] trainer with special equipment to sample the volcanic dust was being flown from the 41st squadron in [[Kauhava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoyle |first=Craig |accessdate=17 April 2010 |title=PICTURES: Finnish F-18 engine check reveals effects of volcanic dust |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/04/16/340727/pictures-finnish-f-18-engine-check-reveals-effects-of-volcanic.html|work=Flight International |date=16 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418033522/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/04/16/340727/pictures-finnish-f-18-engine-check-reveals-effects-of-volcanic.html| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/alueet/keski-suomi/2010/04/tuhka_vaurioitti_ilmavoimien_horneteja_1610459.html |title=Tuhka vaurioitti ilmavoimien Hornet-hävittäjiä &amp;#124; Keski-Suomi |publisher=yle.fi |accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100419132344/http://yle.fi/alueet/keski-suomi/2010/04/tuhka_vaurioitti_ilmavoimien_horneteja_1610459.html| archivedate= 19 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even short test flights with an F-18 revealed engine damage sufficient to destroy engines.&lt;ref name=GlassBuild&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE63I18820100419 |title=UPDATE 3-Glass build-up found in NATO F-16 engine-US official Keski-Suomi |publisher=Reuters |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |first=David |last=Brunnstrom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423081601/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE63I18820100419 |archivedate=23 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April, [[NATO]] reported finding molten glass in the engines of at least one [[F-16]], the result of flying through the ash cloud, leading to the scaling-down of U.S. military exercises.&lt;ref name=GlassBuild/&gt;

== Impacts of the disruption ==
{{Main|Effects of the April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption}}
The disruption accelerated the integration of the national air traffic control systems into the [[Single European Sky]] and the immediate creation of a crisis coordination group to handle future transportation disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/world/europe/05ash.html European Union Agrees to Accelerate Joint Control of Skies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109164701/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/world/europe/05ash.html |date=9 November 2016 }} New York Times, 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The ash indirectly affected [[Effects of the April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption#Cultural impacts|many scheduled cultural and sporting events]] because key participants were unable to attend, including the funeral of Polish president [[Lech Kaczyński]] in [[Kraków]] on 18&amp;nbsp;April 2010.  The funeral was to have been attended by 69&amp;nbsp;presidents, prime ministers, and other heads of states.  Almost half of these, including [[Barack Obama]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], [[Stephen Harper]], and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], were unable to travel to Poland because of the disrupted air traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/polska/kto-nie-przyjedzie-na-pogrzeb-glowy-panstw-odwoluja-wizyty,56858,1 |title=Pył wulkaniczny sprawia, że głowy państw odwołują wizyty – Wiadomości |publisher=Newsweek.pl |accessdate=18 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070910/http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/polska/kto-nie-przyjedzie-na-pogrzeb-glowy-panstw-odwoluja-wizyty,56858,1# |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gkxIpKRIMod1M5iJlnofIi4YQl4A|title=Ash stops Charles, Miliband attending Kaczynski funeral|agency=AFP|date=17 April 2010|accessdate=18 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420074658/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gkxIpKRIMod1M5iJlnofIi4YQl4A| archivedate= 20 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a wider impact on the economies of several countries. However, there were some environmental advantages arising from a saving of around 1.3 to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

'''Barium titanate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with [[chemical formula]] BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Barium titanate appears white as a powder and is transparent when prepared as large crystals.  It is a [[ferroelectric]] [[ceramic]] material that exhibits the [[photorefractive effect]] and [[piezoelectric]] properties.  It is used in [[capacitor]]s, [[electromechanical]] [[transducer]]s and [[nonlinear optic]]s.

==Structure==
{{Main|Perovskite (structure)}}
[[File:Perovskite.jpg|thumb|left|Structure of cubic BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The red spheres are oxide centres, blue are Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, and the green spheres are Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
The solid exists in one of five polymorphs depending on temperature. From high to low temperature, these crystal symmetries of the five polymorphs are [[Hexagonal lattice system|hexagonal]], [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]], [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]], [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]], and [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral]] [[crystal structure]]. All of these phases exhibit the [[ferroelectric effect]] apart from the cubic phase.  The high temperature cubic phase is easiest to describe, as it consists of regular corner-sharing octahedral TiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; units that define a cube with O vertices and Ti-O-Ti edges.  In the cubic phase, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is located at the center of the cube, with a nominal [[coordination number]] of 12.  Lower symmetry phases are stabilized at lower temperatures and involve movement of the Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to off-center position.  The remarkable properties of this material arise from the cooperative behavior of the Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Production and handling properties==
Barium titanate can be synthesized by the relatively simple [[Hydrothermal synthesis|sol–hydrothermal]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selvaraj |first1=M. |last2=Venkatachalapathy |first2=V. |last3=Mayandi |first3=J. |last4=Karazhanov |first4=S. |last5=Pearce |first5=J. M. |title=Preparation of meta-stable phases of barium titanate by Sol-hydrothermal method |journal=AIP Advances |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=117119 |url=https://www.academia.edu/18077811 |doi=10.1063/1.4935645|year=2015 |bibcode=2015AIPA....5k7119S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Barium titanate can also be manufactured by heating [[barium carbonate]] and [[titanium dioxide]].  The reaction proceeds via [[sintering#Liquid phase sintering|liquid phase sintering]]. Single crystals can be grown at around 1100&amp;nbsp;°C from molten [[potassium fluoride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Galasso | first1 = Francis S. | year = 1973 | title = Barium Titanate, BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| journal = Inorganic Syntheses | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 142–143 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132456.ch28 | isbn = 9780470132456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other materials are often added as [[doping (semiconductors)|dopants]], e.g., Sr to giveform solid solutions with [[strontium titanate]]. It reacts with [[nitrogen trichloride]] and produces a greenish or gray mixture; the [[ferroelectric]] properties of the mixture are still present in this form.

Much effort has been spent studying the relationship between particle morphology and its properties.  Fully dense nanocrystalline barium titanate has 40% higher [[permittivity]] than the same material prepared in classic ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/jp7112818| title=Effect of Microwave Frequency on Hydrothermal Synthesis of Nanocrystalline Tetragonal Barium Titanate| year=2008 |last=Nyutu |first=Edward K.| journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C| volume=112| pages=9659| last2=Chen| first2=Chun-Hu| last3=Dutta| first3=Prabir K.| last4=Suib| first4=Steven L.| issue=26| citeseerx=10.1.1.660.3769}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of inclusions of barium titanate to [[tin]] has been shown to produce a bulk material with a higher viscoelastic [[stiffness]] than that of diamonds. Barium titanate goes through two phase transitions that change the crystal shape and volume. This phase change leads to composites where the barium titanates have a negative bulk modulus ([[Young's modulus]]), meaning that when a force acts on the inclusions, there is displacement in the opposite direction, further stiffening the composite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1135837| year=2007 |last1=Jaglinski |first1=T. |last2=Kochmann |first2=D. |last3=Stone |first3=D. |last4=Lakes |first4=R.

Like many [[oxide]]s, barium titanate is insoluble in water but attacked by [[sulfuric acid]]. Its bulk room-temperature [[bandgap]] is 3.2 eV, but this increases to ~3.5 eV when the particle size is reduced from about 15 to 7&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=bandgap/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:BaTiO3 ferro domains.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning transmission electron microscopy]] of the ferroelastic domains that form in BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on cooling through the [[Curie temperature]]. The vertex point, where domain bundles meet, moves from the center in isometric crystals (top) to off-center in oblongs (bottom).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/16/3/036001| pmid = 27877812| title = Some current problems in perovskite nano-ferroelectrics and multiferroics: Kinetically-limited systems of finite lateral size| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 036001| year = 2015| last1 = Scott | first1 = J.

Barium titanate is a [[dielectric]] ceramic used in [[capacitor]]s, with dielectric constant values as high as 7,000. Over a narrow temperature range, values as high as 15,000 are possible; most common ceramic and polymer materials are less than 10, while others, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), have values between 20 and 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Design solutions for DC bias in multilayer ceramic capacitors|last = Waugh|first = Mark D|date = 2010|journal = Electronic Engineering Times|url=http://www.compel.ru/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mark-D.-Waugh.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[piezoelectric]] material used in [[microphone]]s and other [[transducer]]s. The spontaneous polarization of barium titanate single crystals at room temperature range between 0.15 C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in earlier studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.22.221| volume = 22| issue = 3| pages = 221–237| last = von Hippel| first = A.| title = Ferroelectricity, Domain Structure, and Phase Transitions of Barium Titanate| journal = Reviews of Modern Physics| date = 1950-07-01| bibcode=1950RvMP...22..221V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 0.26 C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in more recent publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.mseb.2008.11.046| issn = 0921-5107| volume = 161| issue = 1–3| pages = 50–54| last1 = Shieh| first1 = J.| last2 = Yeh| first2 = J.

The differences are related to the growth technique, with earlier [[flux method|flux grown]] crystals being less pure than current crystals grown with the [[Czochralski process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = base documentaire : TIB271DUO.| issue = ref. article : e1870| last = Godefroy| first = Geneviève| title = Ferroélectricité| journal = Techniques de l'Ingénieur Matériaux Pour l'Électronique et Dispositifs Associés| date = 1996| language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; which therefore have a larger spontaneous polarization and a higher Curie temperature.

As a [[piezoelectric]] material, it has been largely replaced by [[lead zirconate titanate]], also known as PZT. Polycrystalline barium titanate has a positive [[temperature coefficient]] of resistance, making it a useful material for [[thermistor]]s and self-regulating electric heating systems.

Barium titanate crystals find use in [[nonlinear optics]]. The material has high beam-coupling gain, and can be operated at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. It has the highest reflectivity of the materials used for self-pumped [[optical phase conjugation|phase conjugation]] (SPPC) applications. It can be used for continuous-wave [[four-wave mixing]] with milliwatt-range optical power. For photorefractive applications, barium titanate can be doped by various other elements, e.g. [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.redoptronics.com/Fe-LiNbO3-crystal.html| title = Fe:LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Crystal|work=redoptronics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thin film]]s of barium titanate display [[Electro-optic modulator|electrooptic modulation]] to frequencies over 40&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1364/OPEX.12.005962| title = Electrooptic modulation up to 40 GHz in a barium titanate thin film waveguide modulator| year = 2004 |last1=Tang |first1=Pingsheng |journal=Optics Express |volume=12 |issue=24 |pages=5962–7 |pmid=19488237 |last2=Towner |first2=D. |last3=Hamano |first3=T. |last4=Meier|first4=A. |last5=Wessels |first5=B.|bibcode=2004OExpr..12.5962T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties of barium titanate are used in some types of uncooled sensors for [[thermal camera]]s.

High purity barium titanate powder is reported to be a key component of new barium titanate capacitor energy storage systems for use in electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/barium-titanate.htm| accessdate=2009-06-06| title = Nanoparticle Compatibility: New Nanocomposite Processing Technique Creates More Powerful Capacitors|work=gatech.edu|date=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their elevated [[biocompatibility]], barium titanate [[nanoparticle]]s (BTNPs) have been recently employed as nanocarriers for [[drug delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi =10.1088/0957-4484/27/23/232001| pmid = 27145888  | issn = 09574484  | volume =27| issue = 23| pages =232001| last1 =Genchi | first1 = G.G.| last2 =Marino| first2 = A.| last3 =Rocca| first3 =A. | last4 =Mattoli | first4 = V. | last5= Ciofani| first5 = G.| title = Barium titanate nanoparticles: Promising multitasking vectors in nanomedicine | journal = Nanotechnology| date =5 May 2016| bibcode =2016Nanot..27w2001G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barioperovskite is a very rare natural analogue of BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, found as microinclusions in [[benitoite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| year = 2008|last1=Ma |first1=Chi |last2=Rossman |first2=George R. |title=Barioperovskite, BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a new mineral from the Benitoite Mine, California| volume = 93|issue=1 | pages = 154–157| journal = American Mineralogist| doi=10.2138/am.2008.2636|bibcode=2008AmMin..93..154M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computational modeling of metal-based phase diagrams, which dates back to the beginning of the previous century mainly by [[Johannes van Laar]] and to the modeling of [[regular solution]]s, has evolved in more recent years to the [[CALPHAD]] (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0ZDuCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=saxena+Thermodynamic+Data+on+Oxides+and+Silicates,+Springer,+New+York+(1993)|title=Thermodynamic Data, Models, and Phase Diagrams in Multicomponent Oxide Systems: An Assessment for Materials and Planetary Scientists Based on Calorimetric, Volumetric and Phase Equilibrium Data|last=Fabrichnaya|first=Olga|last2=Saxena|first2=Surendra K.|last3=Richet|first3=Pascal|last4=Westrum|first4=Edgar F.|date=2013-03-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783662105047|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been pioneered by American [[metallurgist]] Larry Kaufman since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;L Kaufman and H Bernstein, Computer Calculation of Phase Diagrams, Academic Press N Y (1970) {{ISBN|0-12-402050-X}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Saunders and P Miodownik, Calphad, Pergamon Materials Series, Vol 1 Ed.

==Current state==
Computational thermodynamics may be considered a part of [[materials informatics]] and is a cornerstone of the concepts behind the [[Materials Genome|materials genome]] project. While crystallographic databases are used mainly as a reference source, thermodynamic databases represent one of the earliest examples of informatics, as these databases were integrated into [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical computations]] to map phase stability in binary and ternary [[alloy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Thermodynamic Data on Oxides and Silicates : an Assessed Data Set Based on Thermochemistry and High Pressure Phase Equilibrium|last=K.|first=Saxena, Surendra|date=1993|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|others=Chatterjee, Nilanjan., Fei, Yingwei., Shen, Guoyin.|isbn=9783642783326|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=840299125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many concepts and software used in computational thermodynamics are credited to the SGTE Group, a [[consortium]] devoted to the development of thermodynamic databases; the open elements database is freely available&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crct.polymtl.ca/sgte/unary50.tdb{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the paper by Dinsdale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0364-5916(91)90030-N |title=SGTE data for pure elements |journal=Calphad |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=317–425 |year=1991 |last1=Dinsdale |first1=A.T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called "unary" system proves to be a common basis for the development of binary and multiple systems and is used by both commercial and open software in this field.

However, as stated in recent{{When|date=December 2017}} CALPHAD papers and meetings, such a Dinsdale/SGTE database will likely need to be corrected over time despite the utility in keeping a common base. In this case, most published assessments will likely have to be revised, similarly to rebuilding a house due to a severely broken foundation. This concept has also been depicted as an "inverted pyramid."&lt;ref&gt;http://web.micress.de/ICMEg1/presentations_pdfs/Hallstedt.pdf{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merely extending the current approach (limited to temperatures above room temperature) is a complex task.&lt;ref&gt;http://thermocalc.micress.de/proceedings/proceedings2015/tc2015_tumminello_public.pdf{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PyCalpahd, a [[Python (programming language)#Libraries|Python library]], was designed to facilitate simple computational thermodynamics calculation using [[Open-source software|open source code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5334/jors.140 |title=Pycalphad: CALPHAD-based Computational Thermodynamics in Python |journal=Journal of Open Research Software |volume=5 |year=2017 |last1=Otis |first1=Richard |last2=Liu |first2=Zi-Kui }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In complex systems, computational methods such as CALPHAD are employed to model thermodynamic properties for each phase and simulate multicomponent phase behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Computational thermodynamics : the CALPHAD method|last=L.|first=Lukas, H.|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Fries, Suzana G., Sundman, Bo.|isbn=978-0521868112|location=Cambridge|oclc=663969016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of CALPHAD to high pressures in some important applications, which are not restricted to one side of materials science like the [[Fe-C system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.09.044 |title=Experimental study and thermodynamic calculations of phase relations in the Fe–C system at high pressure |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=408 |pages=155–62 |year=2014 |last1=Fei |first1=Yingwei |last2=Brosh |first2=Eli |bibcode=2014E&amp;PSL.408..155F }}&lt;/ref&gt; confirms experimental results by using computational thermodynamic calculations of phase relations in the Fe–C system at high pressures.

Turchi AB INITIO AND CALPHAD THERMODYNAMICS OF  MATERIALS  https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/306920.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and operative computational thermodynamics databases. In the past, a simplified approach introduced by the early works of Larry Kaufman, based on [[Miedema's Model]], was employed to check the correctness of even the simplest [[binary number|binary]] systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4941">'''Coral calcium''' is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[calcium]] derived from [[fossil]]ized [[coral reef]]s (primarily from limestone and coastal deposits). It has been promoted as an alternative, but unsubstantiated, treatment or cure for a number of health conditions.

== Health claims ==
Coral calcium has been promoted as an [[alternative medicine|alternative]] treatment or cure for a number of health conditions, often as part of an [[alkaline diet]], by Robert Barefoot and others; Barefoot coauthored a book called ''The Calcium Factor,'' and marketed coral calcium supplements with infomercials.&lt;ref name="jaroff"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaroff|first1=Leon|title=Coral Calcium: A Barefoot Scam|url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,433084,00.html|work=Time|date=14 March 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605152023/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,433084,00.html|archivedate=5 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett|first1=Stephen|title=A Critical Look at Robert Barefoot and Coral Calcium|url=https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/coral.html|publisher=Quakcwatch|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about Barefoot by Leon Jaroff, "The monthly cost of the recommended dose of Barefoot's calcium tablets is some 15 times greater than that of the ordinary drug store variety." Jaroff called Barefoot's marketing of coral calcium "one of the more successful scams of our age" and "sheer nonsense," and labeled him a "huckster".&lt;ref name="jaroff"/&gt; 

There is no medical evidence to support these [[health claims]], and coral calcium has been identified by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] as a "Fake Cancer 'Cure' Consumers Should Avoid".&lt;ref name=FDA2&gt;{{cite web|title=187 Fake Cancer "Cures" Consumers Should Avoid|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/ucm171057.htm|publisher=FDA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115170816/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/ucm171057.htm|archivedate=15 November 2017|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Trade Commission]] prosecuted several individuals, including Barefoot, for making unsupported health claims about coral calcium,&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/06/trudeau.shtm | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] | date = 2003-06-10 | accessdate = 2009-01-15 | title = FTC Charges Marketers of Coral Calcium Supreme Dietary Supplement and a Pain-Relief Product With Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] has issued a consumer advisory regarding false and misleading marketing claims associated with coral calcium supplements.&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/news/alerts/coral/coral.htm|title=Consumer Advisory: Coral Calcium|publisher=[[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]|date=November 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018060615/http://nccam.nih.gov/health/alerts/coral/coral.htm|archivedate=18 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and environmental concerns==
Living coral reefs are endangered and cannot be harvested without significant damage to the ecosystem, and because of this, coral calcium is harvested by grinding up above-ground [[limestone]] deposits that were once part of a coral reef. Calcium from coral sources needs to be refined to remove pollutants of the source environment. It is marketed as a [[dietary supplement]], but its benefits over other calcium supplements are unproven and biologically unlikely,&lt;ref name=NCCAM/&gt; and several marketers have been found guilty of fraud and were ordered to pay $20.4 million and to refrain from making unsubstantiated claims in the future.&lt;ref name=FTC/&gt; Additionally, coral near [[Okinawa]] has absorbed relatively high amounts of lead and mercury, leading to concern that these unregulated supplements may be contaminated.&lt;ref name=JADA&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blumberg S |title=Is coral calcium a safe and effective supplement? |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=104 |issue=9 |pages=1335–6 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15354144 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2004.07.022 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[coral]] takes millennia to grow, leading to environmental concerns if harvesting of live coral becomes widespread.&lt;ref name=JADA/&gt;

Currently, an e-diesel variant is created by Audi research facility in partnership with a company named Sunfire. The fuel is created from [[carbon dioxide]], water, and electricity with a process powered by [[renewable energy]] sources to create a liquid [[energy carrier]] called '''blue crude''' (in contrast to regular [[crude oil]]) which is then refined to generate e-diesel. E-diesel is considered to be a [[carbon-neutral fuel]] as it does not extract new carbon and the energy sources to drive the process are from carbon-neutral sources. As of April 2015, an [[Audi A8]] driven by [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Minister of Education and Research]] in Germany is using the e-diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Ewan|title=Audi creates green 'e-diesel fuel of the future' using just carbon dioxide and water|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/audi-creates-green-e-diesel-fuel-future-using-just-carbon-dioxide-water-1498524|accessdate=29 April 2015|work=International Business Times|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McSpadden|first1=Kevin|title=Audi Just Invented Fuel Made From CO₂ and Water|url=http://time.com/3837814/audi-environmental-protection-green-energy-climate-change-cars/|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunfire, a [[clean technology]] company, operates a pilot plant in [[Dresden, Germany]]. The current process involves [[high-temperature electrolysis]] powered by electricity generated from [[renewable energy]] sources to split water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. The next two chemical processes to create a liquid [[energy carrier]] called blue crude are done at a temperature of {{Convert|220|C}} and a pressure of {{Convert|25|bar}}. In a conversion step, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to create [[syngas]] with water as byproduct. The syngas, which contains [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen, reacts to generate the blue crude.

The final step is also known as [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] which was first developed in 1925 by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. After the blue crude is produced, it can be refined to create e-diesel on site, saving the fuel and other infrastructure costs on crude transportation.&lt;ref name=greencarcongress/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German-made 'miracle' machine turns water into gasoline|url=http://rt.com/news/209619-sunfire-water-synthetic-fuel/|website=RT News|publisher=TV-Novosti|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, Sunfire has a capability to produce a limited amount of fuel at {{Convert|160|litres}} a day. There is a plan to increase the production to an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDonald|first1=Fiona|title=Audi has successfully made diesel fuel from carbon dioxide and water|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/audi-have-successfully-made-diesel-fuel-from-air-and-water|accessdate=29 April 2015|work=Science Alert|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audi also partners with a company named Climeworks which manufactures carbon dioxide capturing machines. Climeworks technologies can absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide which is chemically captured at the surface of a [[sorbent]] until it becomes saturated. At that point, the sorbent is introduced with {{Convert|95|°C}} heat in a [[desorption]] cycle to drive out the high-purity carbon dioxide that can be used during the conversion step of the blue crude generation process. The atmospheric carbon dioxide capturing process has 90% of energy demand in the form of low-temperature heat and the rest from electrical energy for pumping and control. The combined plant of Climeworks and Sunfire in Dresden became operational in November 2014.&lt;ref name=greencarcongress&gt;{{cite news|title=Audi in new e-fuels project: synthetic diesel from water, air-captured {{CO2}} and green electricity; "Blue Crude"|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/11/20141114-audibluecrude.html|accessdate=29 April 2015|work=Green Car Congress.|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plant on [[Herøya]] in Norway, producing 10 million liters per year, is being considered, as {{CO2}} from a fertilizer plant is readily available and electricity is relatively cheap in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/norsk-selskap-kan-bli-forst-i-verden-til-a-produsere-audis-vidunderdiesel/348424|title=Norsk selskap kan bli først i verden til å produsere Audis «vidunderdiesel»|work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]]|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===
As much as eighty percent of blue crude can be converted into e-diesel. The fuel contains no [[sulfur]] or [[aromatics]], and has a high [[cetane number]]. These properties allow it to be blended with typical fossil diesel and used as a replacement fuel in automobiles with [[diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref name=greencarcongress/&gt;

Audi also partners with a United States company, Joule, to develop Joule's ''Sunflow-D'' as e-diesel for Audi. Joule's plant in [[New Mexico]] involves the use of [[genetically modified]] microorganisms in bright sunlight to act as a [[catalyst]] for the conversion of carbon dioxide and salty water into [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=greencarcongress/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Transformative Production Platform for Liquid Fuel from the Sun|url=http://www.sae.org/events/gim/presentations/2013/glass_david.pdf|website=sae.org|publisher=Joule|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process can be modified for longer molecular chains to produce [[alkane]]s in order to create synthetic diesel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kacher|first1=Georg|title=CAR tech: Audi's miracle e-fuel (2013)|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/audi/car-tech-audis-miracle-e-fuel-2013/|accessdate=29 April 2015|work=Car Magazine|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joule and Audi partner on sustainable liquid transportation fuels|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/09/joule-audi-20120917.html|accessdate=7 May 2015|work=Green Car Congress|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audi e-diesel and e-ethanol|url=http://www.audi-technology-portal.de/en/mobility-for-the-future/audi-future-lab-mobility_en/audi-future-energies_en/audi-e-diesel-and-e-ethanol|publisher=Audi|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Tina|title=Buh-Bye, Corn Ethanol: Joule Makes The Same Thing From Recycled CO2|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2015/05/12/buh-bye-corn-ethanol-joule-makes-thing-recycled-co2/|website=CleanTechnica|publisher=Sustainable Enterprises Media, Inc.|accessdate=20 May 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joule Unlimited]] is the first company to patent a modified organism that continuously secretes hydrocarbon fuel. The organism is a [[Cyanobacteria|single-celled cyanobacterium]], also known as blue-green algae, although it is technically not an algae. It produces the fuel using photosynthesis, the same process that [[Plant|multi-cellular green plants]] use, to make sugars and other materials from water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=WALD|first1=MATTHEW L.|title=Biotech Company to Patent Fuel-Secreting Bacterium|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/science/earth/14fuel.html|accessdate=6 May 2015|agency=NYTimes.com|issue=September 14, 2010, on page B2 of the New York edition|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar initiatives==
There are other initiatives to create synthetic fuel from carbon dioxide and water, however they are not part of Audi's initiatives and the fuels are not called e-diesel. The [[water splitting]] methods vary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">The '''East of England Development Agency''' ('''EEDA''') was a [[non-departmental public body]] and the [[regional development agency]] for the [[East of England]] region of [[England]].

It came into operation on 1 April 1999 and assumed the regional powers of [[English Partnerships]], the [[Rural Development Commission]] and the [[SRB Challenge Fund]]. 

The total budget for 2005/06 was £140 million.&lt;ref&gt;EEDA - [http://www.eeda.org.uk/abouteeda/how.html EEDA's budget]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 many of the powers that were vested in the [[East of England Regional Assembly]] were passed to the EEDA and to local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eadt.co.uk/content/eadt/news/story.aspx?brand=EADOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=EADOnline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=IPED18%20Jul%202007%2000%3A25%3A08%3A060]&lt;/ref&gt;

The East of England Development Agency was abolished on 31 March 2012.  Part of its remit was assumed by the relevant [[Local Enterprise Partnership]] (LEP).  LEPs were introduced by the Government in 2010 and are local authority and business-led organisations designed to create jobs and increase private sector growth.

In [[electrical engineering]], '''treeing''' is an electrical pre-breakdown phenomenon in solid [[Insulator (electrical)|insulation]]. It is a damaging process due to [[partial discharge]]s and progresses through the stressed [[dielectric]] insulation,  in a path [[Lichtenberg figure|resembling the branches of a tree]]. Treeing of solid high-voltage cable insulation is a common breakdown mechanism and source of electrical faults in underground power cables.

==Other occurrences and causes==
Electrical treeing first occurs and propagates when a dry dielectric material is subjected to high and divergent [[electrical field]] stress over a long period of time. Electrical treeing is observed to originate at points where impurities, [[gas]] voids, mechanical defects, or conducting projections cause excessive [[electrical field]] stress within small regions of the dielectric. This can [[ion]]ize gases within voids inside the bulk dielectric, creating small [[electrical discharge]]s between the walls of the void. An impurity or defect may even result in the partial breakdown of the solid dielectric itself. [[Ultraviolet light]] and [[ozone]] from these [[partial discharge]]s (PD) then react with the nearby dielectric, decomposing and further degrading its insulating capability. [[Gas]]es are often liberated as the dielectric degrades, creating new voids and cracks. These defects further weaken the dielectric strength of the material, enhance the electrical stress, and accelerate the PD process.

===Water trees and electrical trees===
In the presence of water, a diffuse, partially conductive 3D plume-like structure, called a '''water tree''', may form within the polyethylene dielectric used in buried or water-immersed high voltage cables. The plume is known to consist of a dense network of extremely small water-filled channels which are defined by the native crystalline structure of the polymer. Individual channels are extremely difficult to see using optical magnification, so their study usually requires using a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM). Water trees begin as a microscopic region near a defect. They then grow under the continued presence of a high electrical field and water. Water trees may eventually grow to the point where they bridge the outer ground layer to the center high voltage conductor, at which point the stress redistributes across the insulation. Water trees are not generally a reliability concern unless they are able to initiate an electrical tree.  Another type of tree-like structure can form with or without the presence of water is called an '''electrical tree'''. It also forms within a polyethylene dielectric (as well as many other solid dielectrics). Electrical trees also originate where bulk or surface stress enhancements initiate dielectric breakdown in a small region of the insulation. This permanently damages the insulating material in that region. Further tree growth then occurs through as additional small electrical breakdown events (called [[partial discharge]]s). Electrical tree growth may be accelerated by rapid voltage changes, such as utility switching operations. Also, cables injected with high voltage DC may also develop electrical trees over time as electrical charges migrate into the dielectric nearest the HV conductor. The region of injected charge (called a [[space charge]]) amplifies the electrical field in the dielectric, stimulating further stress enhancement and the initiation of electrical trees as the site of pre-existing stress enhancements. Since the electrical tree itself is typically partially conducting, its presence also increases the electrical stress in the region between the tree and the opposite conductor. Unlike water trees, the individual channels of electrical trees are larger and more easily seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, 2D trees can occur along the surface of a highly stressed dielectric, or across a dielectric surface that has been contaminated by dust or mineral salts. Over time, these partially conductive trails can grow until they cause complete failure of the dielectric. Electrical tracking, sometimes called ''dry banding'', is a typical failure mechanism for electrical power insulators that are subjected to salt spray contamination along coastlines. The branching 2D and 3D patterns are sometimes called [[Lichtenberg figure]]s.

[[File:Tracking1.jpg|thumb|2D carbonized electrical trees (or tracking) across the surface of a polycarbonate plate that was part of a [[trigatron]]. These partially conducting paths ultimately led to premature breakdown and operational failure of the device]]
Electrical treeing or "Lichtenberg figures" also occur in high-voltage equipment just before breakdown. Following these Lichtenberg figures in the insulation during postmortem investigation of the broken down insulation can be most useful in finding the cause of breakdown. An experienced high-voltage engineer can see from the direction and the type of trees and their branches where the primary cause of the breakdown was situated and possibly find the cause. Broken-down transformers, high-voltage cables, bushings, and other equipment can usefully be investigated in this way; the insulation is unrolled (in the case of paper insulation) or sliced in thin slices (in the case of solid insulation systems), the results are sketched and photographed and form a useful archive of the breakdown process.

==Types of electrical trees==
Electrical trees can be further categorized depending on the different tree patterns. These include dendrites, branch type, bush type, spikes, strings, bow-ties and vented trees. The two most commonly found tree types are bow-tie trees and vented trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thue |first= William A. |title=Electrical Insulation in Power Systems |publisher= CRC |year=1997 |pages=255–256 |isbn=0-8247-0106-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bow-tie trees: Bow-tie trees are trees which start to grow from within the dielectric insulation and grow symmetrically outwards toward the electrodes. As the trees start within the insulation, they have no free supply of air which will enable continuous support of partial discharges. Thus, these trees have discontinuous growth, which is why the bow-tie trees usually do not grow long enough to fully bridge the entire insulation between the electrodes, therefore causing no failure in the insulation.

;Vented trees: Vented trees are trees which initiate at an electrode insulation interface and grow towards the opposite electrode. Having access to free air is a very important factor for the growth of the vented trees. These trees are able to grow continuously until they are long enough to bridge the electrodes, therefore causing failure in the insulation.

==Detection and location of electrical trees==
Electrical trees can be detected and located by means of [[partial discharge measurement]].

As the measurement values of this method allow no absolute interpretation, data collected during the procedure is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the test. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition (new, strongly aged, faulty) of the cable under test.

To measure the level of partial discharges, 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz or sometimes a sinusoidal 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz VLF ([[very low frequency]]) voltage may be used. The turn-on voltage, a major measurement criterion, can vary by over 100% between 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz measurements as compared to 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz VLF ([[very low frequency]])  Sinusoidal AC source at the power frequency (50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) as mandated by IEEE standards 48, 404, 386, and ICEA standards S-97-682, S-94-649 and S-108-720. Modern PD-detection systems employ digital signal processing software for analysis and display of measurement results.

An analysis of the PD signals collected during the measurement with the proper equipment can allow for the vast majority of location of insulation defects. Usually they are displayed in a partial discharge mapping format. Additional useful information about the device under test can be derived from a phase related depiction of the partial discharges.

A sufficient measurement report contains:
* '''Calibration pulse''' (in accordance with IEC 60270) and end detection
* '''Background noise''' of the measurement arrangement
* Partial discharge inception voltage '''PDIV'''
* Partial discharge level at '''1.7 Vo'''
* Partial discharge extinction voltage '''PDEV'''

The '''electrodeless plasma thruster''' is a [[spacecraft propulsion]] engine commercialized under the acronym "E-IMPAcT" for "Electrodeless-Ionization Magnetized Ponderomotive Acceleration Thruster" . It was created by Mr. Gregory Emsellem based on technology developed by French [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|Atomic Energy Commission]] scientist Dr [[Richard Geller (physicist)|Richard Geller]] and Dr. Terenzio Consoli, for high speed plasma beam production.

The [[electrode]]less [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] thruster is currently being developed and adapted to various spacecraft propulsion needs by [http://www.elwingcorp.com The Elwing Company].

== Operating principle ==

# [[Propellant]] is injected at the upstream side of the thruster body. In cases where the propellant used is not gaseous (e.g., [[alkali metal]]s) at the local temperature, the propellant must be vaporized.&lt;ref name="uspto"&gt;US Patent Office application: http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=7,461,502.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,461,502&amp;RS=PN/7,461,502&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gaseous propellant is ionized by one of the following methods:
#* bombarding the propellant with [[electron]]s emitted by a [[hot cathode]] or by an [[electron gun]].
#* a steady state [[electrical discharge]] between two electrodes.
#* applying an alternating electric field either via a [[Capacitively coupled plasma|capacitive discharge]] or an [[Inductively coupled plasma|inductive discharge]] or even a [[helicon discharge]].
#* [[electromagnetic wave]]s of various frequency from [[radio frequency]] up to [[gamma ray]]s, which is especially useful for solid propellant in which case the propellant can be simultaneously vaporized and ionized by a [[laser]] impulse.
#As the ionization stage is subjected to a steady [[magnetic field]], the ionization process can use one of the numerous resonances existing in magnetized plasma, such as [[ion cyclotron resonance]] (ICR), [[electron cyclotron resonance]] (ECR) or [[lower hybrid oscillation]], to produce a high density [[cold plasma]].
# The cold and dense plasma, produced by the ionization stage, then drifts toward the acceleration stage by diffusion across a region of higher magnetic field intensity.
# In the acceleration stage the propellant plasma is accelerated by magnetized [[ponderomotive force]] in an area where both non-uniform static magnetic fields and non-uniform high-frequency electromagnetic fields are applied simultaneously.

== Advantages ==

This thruster technology can deliver large thrust density as the acceleration process is not limited by plasma density through [[Hall Parameter]] or grid electrical screening.  Further, as the ponderomotive force accelerates all plasma species in the same direction, this thruster technology does not need any [[neutralizer]]. The fact that electrodeless plasma thruster is inherently multi-staged allows it to optimize both stages independently, or to throttle the thruster at constant power between higher [[specific impulse]] and higher [[thrust]]. The field of ponderomotive force is created by a non-uniform high frequency field and static magnetic field, thus it implies no grids nor contact between the plasma and any electrodes, hence it avoids most thruster erosion and spacecraft contamination issues.

== Applications ==

Propulsion systems based on electrodeless plasma thrusters seem ideally suited for orbit raising for large [[geostationary satellite]]s, and would also be able to perform [[orbital stationkeeping]], hence enabling important propellant mass savings. The ability of this technology to provide large thrust density also allows faster missions to the outer planets.

== Other research on the same phenomenon ==

The use of [[ponderomotive force]] to accelerate a plasma has recently been investigated from a theoretical point of view by [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]] scientists I. Y. Dodin, Y. Raitses and N. J. Fisch. &lt;!-- is this a reference to: http://htx.pppl.gov/publication/Journal/L.%20Dorf%20et%20al_RSI01255.pdf ?--&gt; &lt;ref name="pppl"&gt;Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory publications http://htx.pppl.gov/publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theoretical research has also been reported around the debated issue of the existence of a [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]] in such a thruster, even if such a double layer structure would be current-free, as both ions and electrons travel in the same direction at the same average terminal speed.  The existence of current free double layer is still debated among plasma physicists.

Temperature is a statistical quantity. The formal definition is T = dU/dS, the change in internal energy with respect to [[entropy]] holding volume and particle number constant. A practical definition comes from the fact that the atoms, molecules, or whatever particles in a system have an average kinetic energy. The average means to average over the kinetic energy of all the particles in a system.

If the [[velocity|velocities]] of a group of [[electron]]s, e.g., in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], follow a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution of the velocity vector|Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], then the '''electron temperature''' is defined as the [[temperature]] of that distribution. For other distributions, not assumed to be in equilibrium or have a temperature, two-thirds of the average energy is often referred to as the temperature, since for a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution with three [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], &lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = (3/2)\, k_\text{B} T&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of temperature is the [[kelvin]] (K), but using the above relation the electron temperature is often expressed in terms of the energy unit [[electronvolt]] (eV). Each kelvin (1&amp;nbsp;K) corresponds to 8.6173324(78)×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV; this factor is the ratio of the [[Boltzmann constant]] to the [[elementary charge]].  Each eV is equivalent to 11,605 [[kelvin]]s. It can be calculated by the relation &lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = k_\text{B} T&lt;/math&gt;.

The electron temperature of a plasma can be several orders of magnitude higher than the temperature of the neutral species or of the [[ion]]s. This is a result of two facts. Firstly, many [[plasma source]]s heat the electrons more strongly than the ions. Secondly, atoms and ions are much heavier than electrons, and energy transfer in a two-body [[collision]] is much more efficient if the masses are similar. Therefore, equilibration of the temperature happens very slowly, and is not achieved during the time range of the observation.

The '''Fiat Siena''' was a [[subcompact car|supermini]] produced by the Italian manufacturer [[Fiat]] between  1996 to 2017. It is the four-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] version of the [[Fiat Palio]], a [[supermini car]] especially designed for [[developing countries]]. It was introduced for the first time in South America, and was produced in various countries worldwide. Later, in 2002, a similar car based on the same platform was developed for the European market, the [[Fiat Albea]]. It replaced the Siena in these European markets, such as [[Poland]], where the original model was previously sold.

In 2012, Fiat released the second generation of the Siena, called the '''Fiat Grand Siena'''.

The Siena was one of the most popular saloons in Brazil, selling in over 800,000 units throughout 14 years of presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Grand Siena debutta in Brasile |language=Italian |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-grand-siena-al-debutto-sul-mercato-brasiliano |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218100348/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-grand-siena-al-debutto-sul-mercato-brasiliano |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-18 |publisher=Quattroruote.it |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the car was not marketed, after the flop of the predecessor [[Fiat Duna]].

=={{Anchor|178}}First generation (1996–2016)==

===1996–2000===
Launched in 1996, in Brazil, as the four-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] of the [[Fiat Palio]], codenamed Project 178, the Siena (pictured above) was made due to the important sales benchmark of hatchback models in developing countries. The range was made from Fiasa and Fire gasoline engines between 1.0&amp;nbsp;L and 1.6&amp;nbsp;L.

===2001–2003===
[[File:Siena.jpg|thumb|left|2001 Fiat Siena]]
[[File:Fiat Siena 02 China 2012-07-15.JPG|thumb|left|2001 Fiat Albea]]
In 2001, the model has the first facelift. The new design was made by the Italian design-guru [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. The facelift includes a new front and rear design, and a brand new interior. Also, new engines came as the 16-valve Fire engines 1.0&amp;nbsp;L 70 HP and the 1.2&amp;nbsp;L 82 HP. In Turkey and China the redesign Siena was introduced with a [[Continuously variable transmission|Speedgear]] semi-automatic gearbox. With this new design, the small car was finally able to fight for its place in the market, becoming a success in sales. Fiat had considered changing the name to Palio Sedan, due to the lack of interest on the previous Siena, and the solid sales of its biggest competitor, the [[Chevrolet Celta|Chevrolet Prisma]]. This idea was later discarded. Up to this point, the Fiat Siena was the only model belonging to the Palio family that had not been well accepted by the community. Therefore, Fiat gave special attention to the design of this model in particular, having its rear entirely redesigned.

[[File:BSB Flex cars 16 09 2008 Fiat with logo zoom.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Fiat Siena]]
A second facelift was presented in 2004. The designer was again [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. It has a new front, rear, and interior design. The 2004 Siena was the first [[Brazil]]ian [[compact car|compact]] 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] with four airbags (two at front and two side airbags), auto-dimming rear-view mirror, rain sensor and park assistance. These accessories, however, are very expensive for the Brazilian and most other South American markets, so they are generally not found in end-use vehicles. The engines range in South America from a 1.3 Fire 16-valve, a new 1.4 Fire 8-valve with 80 HP (the same of the latest [[Fiat Punto]], and a [[GM Family 1 engine#GM do Brazil|1.8 GM Powertrain]] 8-valve with {{convert|112|PS|kW|abbr=on}}, shared with the [[Chevrolet Corsa]]). The Siena EL was sold with 1.0 and 1.4 engines, both 8-valve units.

In Brazil, the top model has been equipped by Flexfuel version of the latter [[GM Family 1 engine#GM do Brazil|1.8 Powertrain]] 8-valve – gasoline and/or alcohol – reaching {{Convert|112|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with gasoline and {{Convert|114|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with alcohol at 5,500&amp;nbsp;rpm. In Mexico is sold as '''Palio Sedan''', first with the 1.6 16v Torque engine and later with the 1.8 GM Powertrain with {{convert|110|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

In Europe, the new model features the 2004 front and interior design and a 2001 rear design. The Albea, European version of the Siena, also gained the 1.3 [[Multijet]] [[diesel engine]], a second generation [[common rail]] [[turbocharged]] engine, developing {{convert|70|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

In 2008, Fiat unveiled the facelifted Siena. This fourth version of the model has a unique front design, which for the first time is different from the current Palio.

[[File:SAO 09 2008 Fiat Siena TetraFuel 2 views v1.jpg|thumb|2008 Fiat Siena Tetrafuel 1.4. Below is shown the CNG storage tanks in the trunk.]]

The new Siena follows the new Fiat 'family face', with double front lights and some chrome details in the grille, and around the fog lights. The rear lights are sharp and intregrated with the trunk and appeared to be inspired by models of [[Alfa Romeo]], like the 156 and 159.

The new Siena is in production at Betim (Brazil) and Córdoba (Argentina), with 1.0 8v, 1.4 8v, 1.4 8v TetraFuel, and 1.8 8v engines, flexible for the Brazilian market (capable of using gasoline and ethanol). The '''TetraFuel''' is the first [[multifuel]] car that can run as a [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flexi-fuel]] on pure [[gasoline]], or [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E25|E25]], or [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]]; or runs as a [[bi-fuel vehicle|bi-fuel]] with [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]]. As of 2011, the sportive version - Siena Sporting 1.6R 16v, equipped with Fiat's Dualogic automatic gearbox - were also in production, although Fiat announced that this variant won't be offered anymore from 2012. All the New Siena EL 1.0, EL 1.4 and many ELX versions circulating at Brazil were, actually, manufactured at Argentina, as Betim's factory is still producing only the more expensive versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiatpress.com.ar/noticia.detalle.php?n=578 Fiat Press (El Presidente argentino y el CEO de FCA anuncian Inversión de U$S 500 millones en la Planta de Córdoba para la producción de un modelo monoalocado 2016-04-05 15:44:12)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
It was produced in [[Brazil]] (Betim Plant) and [[Argentina]] (Ferreyra). In the past it was also produced in [[Turkey]] (Bursa), [[Poland]] (Tychy) &lt;small&gt;(1997–2001)&lt;/small&gt;, [[India]] (Pune) &lt;small&gt;(1999–2004)&lt;/small&gt;, [[South Africa]] (Rosslyn), [[China]] (Nanjing), [[Iran]] (Saveh), [[Morocco]] (Casablanca) and [[Vietnam]].

It has also been built under license in [[Nampo]], [[North Korea]] from 2002 to 2006, as the '''[[Pyeonghwa]] Hwiparam'''.&lt;ref name=WOC&gt;{{cite book | title = World of Cars 2006·2007 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | ref = WOC2006 | publisher = Media Connection Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 222 | year = 2006 | issn = 1734-2945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siena====
In November 2001, the [[Fiat Palio]] debuted on the Chinese market, with either the {{convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.2-liter or the {{convert|85|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.5-liter, followed by the Siena (effectively the large-wheelbase version, the [[Fiat Albea|Albea]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanjing Fiat Siena|url=http://data.auto.sina.com.cn/14|publisher=Auto.Sina.Com.Cn|accessdate=5 January 2014|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040535/http://data.auto.sina.com.cn/14|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2002, and the Palio Weekend in June 2003. The Siena and Weekend were not available with the smaller engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WOC2006|World of Cars 2006·2007]], p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perla====
[[File:Fiat Perla China 2012-08-09.JPG|thumb|right|Fiat Perla (China).]]
The [[Nanjing Automobile (Group) Corporation#Nanjing Fiat|Nanjing Fiat]] Perla, launched at the 2006 [[Auto Guangzhou]] Motor Show, is based on the [[Fiat Albea]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top10 slow-selling new models in China|url=http://www.at188.com/at188html/englishban/topten/177372.shtml|publisher=AT188.com|date=2007-07-26|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car's rear got a more profound facelift for the Chinese market. For example, the rear is longer and lower than the Siena. It has a new 1.7-liter gasoline engine, air conditioning, dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes, power steering, power windows, central locking, and many other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Perla high-speed stability test drive|url=http://news.mycar168.com/2007/02/41325.html|publisher=MyCar168.com|language=Chinese|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine has a maximum power output of {{convert|96|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a maximum torque of {{convert|140|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Perla test drive|url=http://www.iautos.cn/news/newscontent.asp?newsid=31520|publisher=Iautos.cn|language=Chinese|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; satisfying the Euro III emission standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Perla review|url=http://auto.enorth.com.cn/system/2007/11/13/002322219.shtml|publisher=Enorth.com.cn|language=Chinese|date=2007-11-13|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length is {{convert|4316|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width is {{convert|1705|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the height is {{convert|1480|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the wheelbase is {{convert|2439|mm|in||abbr=on}}, and the curb weight is {{convert|1260|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Perla review|url=http://www.pcauto.com.cn/teach/yc/dtgc/0609/401306.html|publisher=PCauto.com.cn|language=Chinese|date=2006-09-21|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Fiat withdrew from Nanjing in 2007 and SAIC took over, discontinuing the Fiat models, the Perla only had a very brief existence. Russia was meant to be the first country outside China to receive the Perla, but with the 1.4 L Fire 8v engine with {{convert|77|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the Speedgear transmission.

====Zotye====
In 2008, [[Zotye Auto]] purchased the tooling for the Palio and the Siena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Tycho | last = De Feyter | title = Zotye Z200 and Z200HB Listed &amp; Priced in China | url = http://www.carnewschina.com/2011/05/20/zotye-z200-and-z200hb-listed-priced-in-china/ | publisher = CarNewsChina.com | date = 2011-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011, launched its own restyled version of the car, the [[Zotye Z200]], which is produced in both hatchback and sedan form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chinacartimes.com/2011/03/21/zotye-z200s-on-their-way-in-sedan-and-hatch-form/ | author = Ash | title = Zotye Z200′s on their way in sedan and hatch form | date = 2011-03-21 | publisher = ChinaCarTimes | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028222626/http://www.chinacartimes.com/2011/03/21/zotye-z200s-on-their-way-in-sedan-and-hatch-form/ | archivedate = 2013-10-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now powered by a range of a 1.3-liter and a 1.5-liter gasoline engines, with four valves per cylinder and [[variable valve timing]], reportedly sourced from Mitsubishi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zotye.

===Safety rating===
The [[Fiat Albea]], a European version of the Siena, was tested in [[Russia]] according to the [[Euro NCAP]] latest standard, an offset frontal crash at {{convert|64|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. The Albea scored 8.5 points in the frontal test, equivalent to 3 stars. The tested vehicle was equipped with standard driver airbag and regular seatbelts.&lt;ref name="autoreview.ru"&gt;[http://www.autoreview.ru/archive/2007/08/crash_albea "Albea Crash Results"]. AutoReview Magazine, Russia. No 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fiat Perla, a Chinese version of the Fiat Albea, was tested in [[China]] by the China-NCAP in three different tests: a 100% front crash test with a wall (like the US NTHSA test), a 40% offset test (like the Euro NCAP), and a side crash test (like in the Euro NCAP). The Perla scored 8.06 points in the 100% frontal crash test, equivalent to 3 stars, 12.02 points in the 40% offset crash test, equivalent to 4 stars, and 10.96 points in the side crash test, equivalent to 3 stars. The average result was 31 points and 3 stars. The tested vehicle was equipped with standard driver and passenger airbags and regular seatbelts.&lt;ref name="c-ncap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-ncap.org/content/pzjg/Alcyc/pailang.htm |title=China-NCAP |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=C-NCAP.org |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304002025/http://www.c-ncap.org/content/pzjg/Alcyc/pailang.htm |archivedate=2009-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

The second generation of the Fiat Siena (Type 326) was unveiled in South America in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRODUCT EYE: Grand Siena answers Fiat Brazil challengers|url=http://www.just-auto.com/news/grand-siena-answers-fiat-brazil-challengers_id121841.aspx|website=Just Auto|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the '''Fiat Grand Siena''' name and since 2015 under the '''Dodge Vision''' name in Mexico,&lt;ref name="dodge.com.mx"&gt;http://www.dodge.com.mx/vision/2015/&lt;/ref&gt; as the production of the previous generation continues along the new version.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autodato.com/2015/02/dodge-vision-el-clon-del-fiat-grand-siena-se-muestra-en-detalle.html Auto dato (Dodge Vision El Clon del Fiat Grand Siena se muestra en detalle)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform of the new generation is derived from the new [[Fiat Palio|Palio]], but with a longer wheelbase. The exterior design is different from the new Palio and was inspired from the [[Fiat Bravo]], while the rear design was inspired from [[Fiat Linea]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The interior is the same used in the Palio, with specific details.

The Grand Siena is larger than its predecessor, but smaller than the [[Fiat Linea]] compact car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grand Siena 2013 |url=http://www.fiat.com.br/monte-seu-carro/conheca/197/GRAND+SIENA+2013 |publisher=Fiat Brazil |accessdate=2012-12-10 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126173421/http://www.fiat.com.br/monte-seu-carro/conheca/197/GRAND+SIENA+2013 |archivedate=2012-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is powered by a new Fiat E.torq 1.6-liter flexy fuel engine, that delivers around {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, or by the smaller 1.4 16V Fire EVO Tetrafuel engine with a maximum power of {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The new model weights less and has more legroom compared to its predecessor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The front suspension is composed by the same MacPherson system of the new Palio, but the rear suspension uses a new type of torsion beam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Production of Grand Siena started in 2012, at first at the Betim plant in Brazil. The Grand Siena is marketed in South America and Mexico (Since 2015 as Dodge Vision).&lt;ref name="dodge.com.mx"/&gt; In 2018 production of the engine 1.4 Fire Evo flex and 1.6 E.torQ flex end, the only engine avaible is the 1.0 Fire Evo flex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autossegredos.com.br/segredos/fiat-grand-siena-tem-producao-confirmada-ate-o-fim-de-2019/ Fiat Siena 1.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Frisian Solar Boat Challenge''' is a {{Convert|137|mi}} [[Electric boat#Types|solar boat]] race.

The race starts in [[Leeuwarden]], the capital of [[Friesland]], and follows the classic route of the [[Elfstedentocht|Eleven City Tour]]. Following the canals, rivers, and lakes, with the occasional portage, the race features 40 teams from eight countries, including Belgium, Germany, Great Britain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and one long-distance entry, a team from the Federal University of Rio in Brazil.

The race is divided into three classes: the A class is for one-seater boats, the B class is for two-seater boats, and the open or C class can have a crew of any amount. To keep the costs down, entries in the A and B class can borrow solar panels from the race's sponsors, Sharp and The Sun Factory. As of June 24, two Dutch teams appear to be competing for the prize, as the [[Delft University of Technology|Technical University of Delft]] (running in the C class) won the first stage, and preliminary results show the Hanze Solar Team (running in the A class) winning the second stage. The six-day race concludes back at its starting point in Leeuwarden.

'''Gemma Donna Louise D'Arcy''' was born in [[Cumbria]] in November 1983. She was briefly famous in Britain due to suffering [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]], extremely rare in children and hypothesised to have been caused by her family living in proximity to the [[Sellafield]] nuclear power plant.

She died in September 1990 after three [[bone marrow transplant]]s, aged six years and ten months. Her life was the subject of an ITV docu-drama ''Fighting for Gemma'' in 1993, detailing her family's attempts to bring a criminal case against [[BNFL]] for damages relating to her illness.

Her mother Susan later wrote a book, ''Still Fighting For Gemma'' in which she voiced her criticisms of British Nuclear Fuels and the nuclear industry in general.

In September 2014, G. Le Lay and others reported the deposition of a single atom thickness, ordered and two-dimensional multi-phase film by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] upon a [[gold]] surface in a [[crystal lattice]] with [[Miller indices]] (111). The structure was confirmed with [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM) revealing a nearly flat honeycomb structure.&lt;ref name=Lay2014&gt;{{Cite journal

Additional confirmation was obtained by spectroscopic measurement and [[density functional theory]] calculations. The development of high quality and nearly flat single atom films created speculation that germanene may replace [[graphene]] if not merely add an alternative to the novel properties of related nanomaterials.&lt;ref name=phys2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lay2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Atomically resolved STM images of germanene on Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt nanocrystals reveal a buckled honeycomb structure. This honeycomb lattice is composed of two hexagonal sublattices displaced by 0.2 Å in the vertical direction with respect to each other. The nearest-neighbor distance was found to be 2.5±0.1 Å, in close agreement with the Ge-Ge distance in germanene.

Based on STM observations and density functional theory calculations, formation of an apparently more distorted form of germanene has been reported on [[platinum]].&lt;ref name=Lay2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In October 2018, Junji Yuhara and others reported that germanene is easily prepared by a segregation metho, using a bare Ag thin film on a Ge substrate and achieved in situ its epitaxial growth.&lt;ref name="Postgraphene"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuhara|first=Junji|author2=Hiroki Shimazu|author3=Kouichi Ito|author4=Akio Ohta|author5=Masaaki Araidai|author6=Masashi Kurosawa|author7=Masashi Nakatake|author8=Guy Le Lay|date=2018|title=Germanene Epitaxial Growth by Segregation through Ag(111) Thin Films on Ge(111)|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b07006|journal=ACS Nano|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1021/acsnano.8b07006|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of germanene, akin to graphene and silicene, by a segregation method, is considered to be technically very important for the easy synthesis and transfer of this highly promising 2D electronic material.

'''Goldeneye Gas Platform''' is an unmanned and now abandoned offshore gas production [[oil platform|platform]] in [[North Sea]] block 14/29, in the South Halibut basin area of the outer [[Moray Firth]], 105&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[St Fergus Gas Plant]] in [[Scotland]]. The topsides were designed by SLP Engineering Ltd. Production was from five wells with well fluids separated by a single vertical separator vessel. Separated liquids were re-injected into the export gas stream without further treatment. Facilities were provided for the installation of a future produced water coalescer and flash drum.&lt;ref&gt;Process Flow Diagrams: Gas Production and Future Water Treatment &lt;/ref&gt; Gas was piped ashore to St Fergus under well pressure, without using compressors, where it was processed. It operated in {{convert|120|m}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quadrant 14 |url=https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/web_files/quad_maps/maps/Q14.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130405084002/https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/web_files/quad_maps/maps/Q14.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 April 2013 |work=UKCS Quadrant Map |publisher=Department of Energy and Climate Change |accessdate=5 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldeneye Gas Platform, United Kingdom|url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/goldeneye/|work=Industry Projects|publisher=offshore-technology.com|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldeneye takes flight|url=http://www.fwc.com/publications/tech_papers/files/Goldeneye.pdf|work=Process Engineering|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was discovered in 1996, production started in 2004. and the platform was abandoned in 2011.

[[File:Daniel Hernández Morillo - Perezosa (Idle Woman) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|388px|''[[Idle Woman]]'', painting by [[Daniel Hernández Morillo]] ]]
'''Idleness''' is a lack of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] or [[energy]]. In describing a person or machine, idle means the act of nothing or no work (for example: "John Smith is an idle person"). This is a person who spends his days doing nothing could be said to be "idly passing his days." (For example: Mary has been idle on her instant messenger account for hours.) A [[computer processor]] or [[communication circuit]] is described as idle when it is not being used by any [[computer program|program]], application or message. Similarly, an [[engine]] of an [[automobile]] may be described as idle when it is running only to sustain its running (not doing any useful [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]), this is also called the tickover (see [[idle (engine)|idle]]).

== Idleness as dependent upon cultural norms ==
Typically, when one describes a machine as idle, it is an objective statement regarding its current state. However, when used to describe a person, idle typically carries a negative [[connotation]], with the assumption that the person is wasting their time by doing nothing of value.

Such a view is reflected in the [[proverb]] "an idle mind is the devil's workshop". Also, the popular phrase "[[wikt:kill time#English|killing time]]" refers to idleness and can be defined as spending time doing nothing in particular in order that time seems to pass more quickly. These interpretations of idleness are not universal – they are more typically associated with Western cultures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Idleness was considered a [[disorderly conduct|disorderly offence]] in England punishable as a [[summary offense]].&lt;ref&gt;"ANOTHER branch of ſummary proceedings is that before juſtices of the peace, in order to inflict divers petty pecuniary mulcts, and corporal penalties, denounced by act of parliament for many diſorderly offences; ſuch as common ſwearing, drunkenneſs, vagrancy, idleneſs, and a vaſt variety of others, for which I muſt refer the ſtudent to the juſtice-books formerly cited, and which uſed to be formerly puniſhed by the verdict of a jury in the [[court-leet]]." [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Sir [[William Blackstone]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Involuntary enforced idleness is the punishment used for lazy or slacking workers in [[zero-hour contract]]s. Paid time off, which was introduced in the 20th century as a trade unionist reform, is now absent from an increasing number of job arrangements both as a money-saving mechanism and so that only work pays and thus reinforcing the stigma against idleness and enabling nature’s punishment of idleness in the form of destitution and starvation. Asking for holiday leave is now in the UK also frowned upon in traditional full-time contracts as it is taken to be a sign of lack of commitment and team spirit and as a propensity to laziness, and it is often punished, and is considered by most as a sackable offence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Books on idleness ==
[[File:Kannur Kerala, India.jpg|thumbnail|People idling in [[Kannur]], India.]]
The state of being idle is sometimes even celebrated with a few books on the subject of idleness. ''How to Be Idle'' by [[Tom Hodgkinson]] is one such example from an author who is also known for his magazine, "[[The Idler (1993)|''The Idler'']]", devoted to promoting its ethos of "idle living". [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays]]'' is another book that explores the virtues of being idle in the modern society.

[[Mark Slouka]] published an essay, "Quitting the Paint Factory: The Virtues of Idleness", hinting at a [[post-scarcity]] economy and linking conscious busyness with anti-democratic and [[fascist]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Slouka|Slouka, Mark]] (2004) [http://www.molvray.com/ebooks/Quitting_the_Paint_Factory_Mark_Slouka.html "Quitting the Paint Factory"] ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2426">In certain materials and under certain conditions, the boundaries between the grains are the weakest regions in the material. An '''intergranular fracture''' is a [[fracture]] that grows along the grain boundaries of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Norman E. Dowling, Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Fourth Edition, Pearson Education Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; In a wall of bricks it would correspond to a fracture that takes place in the mortar that keeps the bricks together. In metals with multiple [[crystal structure|lattice]] organizations, when one lattice ends and another begins, the fracture changes direction to follow the new grain. This results in a fairly jagged looking fracture with straight edges of the grain and shiny surface may be seen.

In ceramics, interganular fractures propagate through grain boundaries, producing smooth bumpy surfaces where grains can be easily identified.

Intergranular cracking is likely to occur if there is a hostile environmental influence.&lt;ref&gt;Norman E. Dowling, Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Fourth Edition, Pearson Education Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are several other processes that can lead to intergranular fracture:&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Hertzberg, Richard P. Vincim Jason L. Hertzbergy, Deformation and FRacture Mechanics of Engineering Materials, Fifth Edition, John Wiley and Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Microvoid nucleation and coalescence at inclusions or second phase particles located along grain boundaries.
* Grain boundary crack and cavity formations associated with elevated temperature stress rupture conditions.
* Decohesion between contiguous grains due to the presence of impurity elements at grain boundaries and in association with aggressive atmospheres such as gaseous hydrogen and liquid metals.
* Stress corrosion cracking processes associated with chemical dissolution along grain boundaries.
* Cyclic loading conditions
* When the material has an insufficient number of independent slip systems to accommodate plastic deformation between contiguous grains.

This is also known as intercrystalline fracture or grain-boundary separation.

This is to be distinguished from the more commonly seen [[Transgranular fracture]], where the crack grows through the material grains.

'''KAPSARC''', the abbreviation for the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, is located in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], where it began its activities in 2010. It is as an independent, non-profit institution that focuses on research in energy economics, policy, technology, and the environment. Its research areas include global energy markets and economics, energy efficiency and productivity, energy and environmental technologies, and carbon management. The organization has a multi-national research team.

It was established by King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] as an element of the broader theme of reform in the region and emphasizes the openness, equality, and diversity of gender, nationality, and backgrounds—in a manner similar to the [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]]. The Center has employees from over 20 nationalities, and its workforce is 40% women.

==History==

In July 2007, King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] called for the establishment of an independent center to conduct objective and scientific research in the field of energy. Interim management was given to [[Saudi Aramco]] in 2008 to plan the center’s mandate and facilities. The Center’s real existence started in 2012. The center started operating in 2013.

==Governance==

KAPSARC is an autonomous institution, financially and legally. It is funded by proceeds from its own endowment and only reports to an internationally composed Board of Trustees, consisting of six members, including the chairman, the president, and four independent members, who set policies and approve the strategic, operational, and financial plans of the Center. Members include His Excellency [[Muhammed Al-Jasser|Dr. Muhammad Al-Jasser]] and [[Keith O'Nions|Sir Keith O’Nions]]. US Secretary of Energy [[Ernest Moniz]] was a founding member of the Board of Trustees but had to step down to accept his  new role as Secretary of Energy

KAPSARC also has an International Advisory Council that advises on ongoing programs and research projects. It consists of several members of international stature, such as [[John Hamre]], [[Daniel Yergin]], [[George M. Whitesides]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapsarc.org/kapsarc/governance/Governance KAPSARC Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The KAPSARC campus on the northern edge of Ridyah contains both a Residential Campus (called the REC, located on the west side of the property) and a Research and Office Complex (called the ROC, located on the east side)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Campus section of KASPARC website|url=https://www.kapsarc.org/careers/|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Latina Nuclear Power Plant''' is a former [[nuclear power plant]] at [[Latina, Lazio]], Italy. Consisting of one 153&amp;nbsp;MWe [[Magnox]] reactor, it operated from 1963 until 1987.

Construction started in 1958. The first criticality occurred in December 1962, and the first connection to the distribution grid in May 1963. Commercial operation took place starting from January 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/htgr/abstracts/abst_iwggcr19_17.html Operating experience with the Latina Magnox reactor], Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant was originally rated at 210&amp;nbsp;MWe, but the danger of significant oxidation of mild steel components by the high temperature carbon dioxide coolant required (in 1969) a reduction in [[operating temperature]] from 390 to 360 [[Celsius|°C]], which reduced power by 24%, down to 160 MWe.

In 1985 its license was renewed to operate until at least 1992, but after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] it was shut down early in 1987.

The company was privatized by the Brazilian federal government in 1996 when it was bought by a consortium of [[Houston Industries]], AES Corp, and [[Électricité de France]] for US$1.7&amp;nbsp;billion. In 2006, 78.4% stake was bought by Rio Minas Energia Participações S.A.

== History ==
Electrical power infrastructure in Rio de Janeiro was originally developed in the first half of the 20th century by the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company, a company financed with foreign capital and legally domiciled in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].  After 1912, this company was part of the [[holding company]] Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company (usually known in Brazil simply as "Light"), which eventually changed its name to Brascan (for "Brasil" + "Canada").  In 1979, the company's Brazilian assets transferred to Brazilian ownership.  The Canadian company, which had in the meantime diversified to other areas, still exists under the name [[Brookfield Asset Management]].

'''Linoleic acid''' (LA), a carboxylic acid, is a [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]] [[omega-6 fatty acid]], an 18-carbon chain with two double bonds in [[Stereoisomerism#Cis-trans and E-Z isomerism|cis]] configuration. A shorthand [[Fatty acid#Nomenclature|notation]] like "18:2 (n-6)" or "18:2 ''cis''-9,12" may be used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlipid.org/fa/acid0001.htm|title=Fatty Acids|publisher=Cyber Lipid}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride ester; free fatty acids are typically low in foods.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2843518 | pmid=19400700 | doi=10.1146/annurev-nutr-080508-141108 | volume=29 | title=Is there a fatty acid taste? | year=2009 | journal=Annu. Rev. Nutr. | pages=305–27 | last1 = Mattes | first1 = RD}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very soluble in acetone, benzene, diethyl ether and ethanol.&lt;ref name="crc97"/&gt;

Linoleic acid belongs to one of the two [[essential fatty acid]]s, which means that the human body cannot synthesize it from other food components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burr, G.O., Burr, M.M. and Miller, E. | year = 1930 | title = On the nature and role of the fatty acids essential in nutrition | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 86 | issue = 587 | pages = 1–9 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/97/1/1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "linoleic" derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''linon'' ([[flax]]). ''Oleic'' means "of, relating to, or derived from oil of olive" or "of or relating to [[oleic acid]]" because saturating the omega-6 double bond produces oleic acid.

==In physiology==
LA is a [[Polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated]] [[fatty acid]] used in the biosynthesis of [[arachidonic acid]] (AA) and thus some [[prostaglandin]]s, [[leukotriene]]s (LTA, LTB, LTC), and [[thromboxane]] (TXA).  It is found in the lipids of [[cell membrane]]s.  It is abundant in many [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], fatty seeds ([[flax]] seeds, [[hemp]] seeds, [[poppy seed]]s, [[sesame]] seeds, etc.) and their derived [[vegetable oil]]s; comprising over half (by weight) of [[poppyseed oil|poppy seed]], [[safflower]], [[sunflower oil|sunflower]], [[corn oil|corn]], and [[soybean oil]]s.&lt;ref name="USDA"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |work=USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20 |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/ba/bhnrc/ndl |title=Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414070404/http://www.ars.usda.gov/ba/bhnrc/ndl |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LA is converted by various [[lipoxygenase]]s, [[cyclooxygenase]]s, certain [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes (the CYP [[monooxygenase]]s), and non-enzymatic [[autoxidation]] mechanisms to mono-[[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] products viz., [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] and [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]; these two hydroxy metabolites are enzymatically oxidized to their keto metabolites, 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid and 9-oxo-octadecdienoic acid.  Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, the CYP [[epoxygenase]]s, metabolize LA to epoxide products viz., its 12,13-epoxide, [[Vernolic acid]] and its 9,10-epoxide, [[Coronaric acid]].  All of these LA products have bioactivity and are implicated in human physiology and pathology as indicated in the cited linkages.

Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid that must be consumed for proper health.  A diet deficient in linoleate (the [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] form of the acid) causes mild skin scaling, hair loss,&lt;ref name=Cunnane&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cunnane S, Anderson M |title=Pure linoleate deficiency in the rat: influence on growth, accumulation of n-6 polyunsaturates, and (1-&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C) linoleate oxidation |journal=J Lipid Res |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=805–12 |date=1 April 1997|pmid=9144095| url = http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/38/4/805 |accessdate=2007-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and poor wound healing in rats.&lt;ref name=Ruthig&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ruthig DJ, Meckling-Gill KA|lastauthoramp=yes|date=1 October 1999| title=Both (n-3) and (n-6) fatty acids stimulate wound healing in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-6|journal= Journal of Nutrition|volume=129|issue=10|pages=1791–8| pmid= 10498749 |accessdate=2007-01-15 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/129/10/1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[oleic acid]], linoleic acid is released by [[cockroach]]es upon death which has the effect of preventing other roaches from entering the area.  This is similar to the mechanism found in ants and bees, which also release oleic acid upon death.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8232000/8232607.stm|title=Earth News: Ancient 'smell of death' revealed|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LA is associated with Ulcerative Colitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.badgut.org/information-centre/health-nutrition/the-role-of-fats-in-ulcerative-colitis/|title=Role of Fats in Ulcerative Colitis {{!}} Gastrointestinal Society|website=www.badgut.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2018}}

===Metabolism and eicosanoids===
[[File:Linoleic Acid Metabolism.gif]]

The first step in the metabolism of LA is performed by [[Fatty acid desaturase|Δ&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;desaturase]], which converts LA into [[gamma-Linolenic acid]] (GLA).

There is evidence suggesting that infants lack Δ&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;desaturase of their own, and must acquire it through breast milk. Studies show that breast-milk fed babies have higher concentrations of GLA than formula-fed babies, while formula-fed babies have elevated concentrations of LA.&lt;ref name="David F. Horrobin 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author = David F. Horrobin | year = 1993 | title = Fatty acid metabolism in health and disease: the role of Δ-6-desaturase | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 57 | pages = 732S–7S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLA is converted to [[dihomo-γ-linolenic acid]] (DGLA), which in turn is converted to arachidonic acid (AA). One of the possible fates of AA is to be transformed into a group of metabolites called [[eicosanoid]]s during the inflammatory response and during physical activity; eicosanoids are a class of [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine hormones]]. The three types of eicosanoids are prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. Eicosanoids produced from AA tend to ''promote'' (not cause) inflammation and ''promote'' growth during and after physical activity in healthy humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piomelli, Daniele |year=2000 |title=Arachidonic Acid |work=Neuropsychopharmacology: The Fifth Generation of Progress |url=http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000059/Default.htm |accessdate=2009-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715122827/http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000059/Default.htm |archivedate=15 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, both AA-derived thrombaxane and leukotriene&lt;sub&gt;B4&lt;/sub&gt; are proaggregatory and vasoconstrictive eicosanoids during inflammation. The oxidized metabolic products of linoleic acid, such as [[9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid]] and [[13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid]], have also been shown to activate [[TRPV1]], the [[capsaicin]] receptor, and through this might play a major role in [[hyperalgesia]] and [[allodynia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19843694 | year = 2009 | last1 = Patwardhan | first1 = AM | last2 = Scotland | first2 = PE | last3 = Akopian | first3 = AN | last4 = Hargreaves | first4 = KM | title = Activation of TRPV1 in the spinal cord by oxidized linoleic acid metabolites contributes to inflammatory hyperalgesia | volume = 106 | issue = 44 | pages = 18820–4 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0905415106 | pmc = 2764734 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| bibcode = 2009PNAS..10618820P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some suggested negative health effects related to this inflammation promoting function of linoleic acid as an [[omega-6 fatty acid]].

==Uses==

===Industrial uses===
Linoleic acid is used in making  quick-[[drying oil]]s, which are useful in [[oil paint]]s and [[varnish]]es. These applications exploit the easy reaction of the linoleic acid with oxygen in air, which leads to [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] and formation of a stable film called linoxyn.

Reduction of linoleic acid yields [[linoleyl alcohol]]. Linoleic acid is a [[surfactant]] with a critical micelle concentration of 1.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; M @ pH 7.5.

Linoleic acid has become increasingly popular in the beauty products industry because of its beneficial properties on the skin.  Research points to linoleic acid's anti-inflammatory, acne reductive, skin-lightening and moisture retentive properties when applied topically on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diezel|first1= W.E.|last2=Schulz|first2= E.|last3=Skanks|first3= M.|last4=Heise|first4= H.| year = 1993 | title = Plant oils: Topical application and anti-inflammatory effects (croton oil test) | journal = Dermatologische Monatsschrift | volume = 179 | page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Letawe |first1=C|last2=Boone |first2=M|last3=Pierard|first3= GE|date=March 1998 | title = Digital image analysis of the effect of topically applied linoleic acid on acne microcomedones | journal = Clinical &amp; Experimental Dermatology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–58| pmid = 9692305 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2230.1998.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=H|last2=Ryu |first2=A|last3=Hashimoto|first3= A|last4=Oka|first4= M|last5=Ichihashi|first5= M|date=March 1998 | title = Linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid lightens ultraviolet-induced hyperpigmentation of the skin.  | journal = Archives of dermatological research | volume = 290 | issue = 7 | pages = 375–381| pmid = 9749992 | doi = 10.1007/s004030050320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darmstadt|first1=GL|last2=Mao-Qiang|first2= M|last3=Chi|first3= E|last4=Saha|first4= SK|last5=Ziboh|first5= VA|last6=Black|first6= RE|last7=Santosham|first7= M|last8=Elias|first8= PM|year=2002|title=Impact of topical oils on the skin barrier: possible implications for neonatal health in developing countries |journal=Acta Paediatrica |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=546–554 | doi=10.1080/080352502753711678| pmid=12113324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in research===
Linoleic acid [[Lipid peroxidation|lipid radicals]] can be used to show the [[antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols]]. Experiments on linoleic acid subjected to [[2,2'-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride]] induced oxidation of linoleic acid; hence producing lipid radicals and then the use of different combinations of phenolics show that binary mixtures can lead to either a [[synergy|synergetic]] antioxidant effect or to an [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistic]] effect towards the lipid radicals. Research like this is useful in discovering which phenols prevent the [[autoxidation]] of lipids in vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11746-003-0812-z | title = Antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in 2,2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidation: Synergistic and antagonistic effects | year = 2003 | last1 = Peyrat-Maillard | first1 = M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">'''Load regulation''' is the capability to maintain a constant voltage (or current) level on the output channel of a [[power supply]] despite changes in the supply's load (such as a change in resistance value connected across the supply output).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Line and Load Regulation for Programmable DC Power Supplies and Precision DC Sources- Developer Zone - National Instruments|url=http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/3597}} 070618 ni.com ([[National Instruments|national instruments]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neets Module 06-Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14178/css/14178_143.htm}} 070618 tpub.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Load regulation of a constant-voltage source is defined by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Line and Load Regulation - Rantec|url=http://www.rantec.com/L2A_Prod/LowVoltage/LVAN/LVAN_HDMA105.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\%\text{Load Regulation} = 100\% \, \frac{V_{min-load} - V_{max-load}}{V_{nom-load}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;V_{max-load}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage at maximum load. The maximum load is the one that draws the greatest current, i.e. the lowest specified load resistance (never short circuit);
* &lt;math&gt;V_{min-load}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage at minimum load. The minimum load is the one that draws the least current, i.e. the highest specified load resistance (possibly open circuit for some types of linear supplies, usually limited by pass transistor minimum bias levels);
* &lt;math&gt;V_{nom-load}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage at the typical specified load.

For a constant-current supply, the above equation uses currents instead of voltages, and the maximum and minimum load values are when the largest and smallest specified voltage across the load are produced.

For switching power supplies, the primary source of regulation error is switching ripple, rather than control loop precision. In such cases, load regulation is defined without normalizing to voltage at nominal load and has the unit of volts, not a percentage.

&lt;math&gt;\text{Load Regulation}(V) = V_{min-load} - V_{max-load}&lt;/math&gt;

== Measurement ==

A simple way to manually measure load regulation is to connect three parallel load resistors to the power supply where two of the resistors, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are connected through switches while the other resistor, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is connected directly.  The values of the resistors are selected such that R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; gives the highest load resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives the nominal load resistance and either R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives the lowest load resistance.  A voltmeter is then connected in parallel to the resistors and the measured values of voltage for each load state can be used to calculate the load regulation as given in the equation above.

[[Programmable Load|Programmable loads]] are typically used to automate the measurement of load regulation.

The '''MS ''Oliva''''' was a [[bulk carrier]] launched in 2009. On 16 March 2011, due to the risky navigation of trying to achieve the minimal allowed clearance of Nightingale Island of 10&amp;nbsp;[[nautical mile|nmi]], and due to human error in navigation reducing the actual clearance to zero, the ship went aground off [[Nightingale Island]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], in the [[South Atlantic]], at 4&amp;nbsp;am while on a voyage from [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], [[Brazil]] to [[China]] with a cargo of [[soya beans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form 20-F for the year to December 31, 2010|year=2011|publisher=Dryships Inc|url=http://dryships.irwebpage.com/files/dryships20F2010.pdf|page=10|accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ship broke in two and was a total loss. All 22 crew were rescued. More than 800 tons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and coated some 20,000 [[northern rockhopper penguin]]s.  The remains of the ship have been left to be claimed by the ocean. There is an area of soya bean deposits and reduced sealife around the wreck due to the cargo of soya bean removing the oxygen from the water. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil Spill in South Atlantic Threatens Endangered Penguins|date=22 March 2011|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/science/earth/23spill.html|accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifeboat==
In February 2013, a lifeboat from the ''Oliva'' washed up on a beach in the [[Coorong National Park]] in south-east [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-06/shipwreck-lifeboat-washes-up-in-australia/4503618 Shipwreck lifeboat washes up in Australia], [[ABC News Online]], 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Images of ''Oliva'' with the lifeboat rails empty can be seen at the Tristan da Cunha [http://www.tristandc.com/newsmsoliva.php website of the grounding and recovery].
The lifeboat was later put on display adjacent to the former Cape Jaffa lighthouse in [[Kingston SE]], South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MS_Olivia_lifeboat_plaque.jpg|title=File:MS Olivia lifeboat plaque.jpg|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:MS Olivia lifeboat plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque in front of the lifeboat for MS Olivia which is now located adjacent to the former Cape Jaffa lighthouse in Kingston SE, South Australia.]]

'''Magnox''' is an [[alloy]]&amp;mdash;mainly of [[magnesium]] with small amounts of [[aluminium]] and other metals&amp;mdash;used in cladding unenriched [[uranium]] metal fuel with a non-oxidising covering to contain [[fission products]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s.
'''Magnox''' is short for '''Mag'''nesium '''n'''on-'''ox'''idising.
This material has the advantage of a low [[neutron capture]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]], but has two major disadvantages:
*It limits the maximum [[temperature]] (to about 360 [[Celsius]]), and hence the [[thermal efficiency]], of the plant.
*It reacts with water, preventing long-term storage of [[High level waste|spent fuel]] under water in [[spent fuel pool]]s.

The magnox alloy Al80 has a composition of 0.8% aluminium and 0.004% [[beryllium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1963JNuM....8..153H | title=Secondary recrystallisation in magnox AL 80 | journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials | volume=8 | page=153 | year=1963 | authors=Higgins, G.

'''Nghi Son Refinery''' is the second planned oil refinery in [[Vietnam]]. It would be located about {{convert|200|km}} south of [[Hanoi]] in [[Tinh Gia|Tinh Gia District]] of [[Thanh Hóa Province]].  Site-clearing for the project broke ground in 2008. Construction began on 23 October 2013, and refinery operations are targeted for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnam starts work on $9 bln refinery|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/index/pages/20131023-vietnam-starts-work-on-$9-bln-refinery.aspx|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planned capacity is {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, slightly greater than that of Vietnam's first [[Dung Quat refinery]].&lt;ref name=downstream1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The site-clearing phase entails the resettlement of 350&amp;nbsp;households with 1,500&amp;nbsp;people and the surface leveling of the area.

==Technical features==
Nghi Son refinery would have a designed capacity of 10&amp;nbsp;million tons of crude oil per year with possibility to increase the capacity to 20&amp;nbsp;million tons. It is expected to cost US$9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=downstream1/&gt;  The refinery project will also include petrochemical complex, energy facilities, pipeline and storage systems. In addition to [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], unleaded gasoline, [[kerosene]], [[jet fuel]], diesel and FO, the refinery is projected to produce [[bitumen]], [[propylene]] and BTX as a raw material for the petrochemical industry.&lt;ref name=downstream2/&gt;

The refinery will be supplied with crude oil imports from Kuwait.&lt;ref name=downstream2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The refinery is designed and built by a syndicate of EPC contractors including JGC Corporation and Chiyoda Corporation from Japan, GS Engineering &amp; Construction Corporation and SK Engineering &amp; Construction Co. from South Korea, Technip from France and Malaysia's Technip Geoproduction.&lt;ref name=downstream3&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of the construction costs will be financed through the [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation]]. According to Bloomberg, JGC won the [[Engineering, procurement and construction|EPC contract]] to build the refinery in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-13/jgc-group-wins-vietnam-refinery-contract-nikkei-says-update1-.html JGC Group Wins Vietnam Refinery Contract, Nikkei Says], www.bloomberg.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consortium==
The project is developed by a consortium of international companies. [[Petrovietnam]] holds 25.1%, [[Idemitsu Kosan]] and [[Kuwait Petroleum International]] each hold a 35.1% each, and [[Mitsui Chemicals]] has the remaining 4.7% of shares.&lt;ref name=downstream1/&gt; A contract to set up a joint venture was signed on 7 April 2008.&lt;ref name=vietnam1&gt;

'''Pha Taem National Park''' (Thai:อุทยานแห่งชาติผาแต้ม) is a [[List of national parks of Thailand|national park]] along the [[Mekong]] river in [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]] of [[Isan]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=DNP&gt;{{cite web|title=Pha Taem National Park|url=http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=19&amp;lg=2|website=Department of National Parks (DNP) Thailand|accessdate=16 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033134/http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=19&amp;lg=2|archivedate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phou Xieng Thong National Protected Area]] in Laos is on the opposite side of the river.

It is notable for its [[Dipterocarp]] forest cover and for extensive [[rock art]] on cliffs above the Mekong. The art is estimated to be 3,000 years old. The park also has several examples of [[mushroom rocks]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=884#axzz1kiqexxVp Pha Taem National Park - Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the largest flower field in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/ubon-ratchathani-province/pha-taem-national-park Pha Taem National Park - Lonely Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, Pha Taem National Park also a popular tourist destination for the received first sunshine of the New Year's every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideubon.com/2.0/go2ubon/2561/|title=อุบลฯ ชวนนักท่องเที่ยว “รับตะวันใหม่ก่อนใครในสยาม” ปี 2561 ที่ผาแต้ม|language=thai|work=Guideubon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=thai|work=Matichon|url=https://www.matichon.co.th/news/399313|title=อุบลฯชวนนักท่องเที่ยวขึ้นผาแต้ม “รับตะวันใหม่ก่อนใครในสยาม” วันปีใหม่ปี 60|date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phosphorescent.jpg|thumb|Phosphorescent, [[europium]]-doped [[strontium]] silicate-aluminate oxide powder under visible light, long-wave [[UV light]], and in total darkness]]

'''Phosphorescence''' is a type of [[photoluminescence]] related to [[fluorescence]]. Unlike fluorescence, a phosphorescent material does not immediately re-emit the radiation it absorbs.  The slower time scales of the re-emission are associated with "[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]" [[energy level|energy state]] transitions in [[quantum mechanics]]. As these transitions occur very slowly in certain materials, absorbed radiation is re-emitted at a lower intensity for up to several hours after the original excitation.

Everyday examples of phosphorescent materials are the glow-in-the-dark toys, stickers, paint, and clock dials that glow after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light.  Typically, the glow slowly fades out, sometimes within a few minutes or up to a few hours in a dark room.&lt;ref&gt;Karl A. Franz, Wolfgang G. Kehr, Alfred Siggel, Jürgen Wieczoreck, and Waldemar Adam "Luminescent Materials" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a15_519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of phosphorescent materials led to the [[Radioactive decay#History of discovery|discovery of radioactivity]] in 1896.

==Explanations==

===Simple===
[[File:JablonskiSimple.png|thumb|300px|[[Jablonski diagram]] of an energy scheme used to explain the difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence. The excitation of molecule A to its singlet excited state (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A*)is followed by intersystem crossing to the triplet state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;A) that relaxes to the ground state by phosphorescence.]]
In simple terms, phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released relatively slowly in the form of light. This is in some cases the mechanism used for "glow-in-the-dark" materials which are "charged" by exposure to light. Unlike the relatively swift reactions in fluorescence, such as those seen in a common fluorescent tube, phosphorescent materials "store" absorbed energy for a longer time, as the processes required to re-emit energy occur less often.

===Quantum mechanical===
[[File:Electronic Processes Involving Light.png|thumb|After an electron absorbs a photon of high energy, it may undergo vibrational relaxations and intersystem crossing to another spin state.  Again the system relaxes vibrationally in the new spin state and eventually emits light by phosphorescence.]]

Most photoluminescent events, in which a chemical substrate absorbs and then re-emits a [[photon]] of light, are fast, in the order of 10 [[nanosecond]]s. Light is absorbed and emitted at these fast time scales in cases where the energy of the photons involved matches the available energy states and allowed transitions of the substrate.  In the special case of phosphorescence, the electron which absorbed the photon (energy) undergoes an unusual [[intersystem crossing]] into an energy state of higher ''spin multiplicity'' (''see [[term symbol]]''), usually a [[triplet state]]. As a result, the excited electron can become trapped in the triplet state with only [[forbidden mechanism|"forbidden" transitions]] available to return to the lower energy singlet state. These transitions, although "forbidden", will still occur in quantum mechanics but are [[chemical kinetics|kinetically]] unfavored and thus progress at significantly slower time scales. Most phosphorescent compounds are still relatively fast emitters, with triplet lifetimes on the order of milliseconds. However, some compounds have triplet lifetimes up to minutes or even hours, allowing these substances to effectively store light energy in the form of very slowly degrading excited electron states. If the phosphorescent [[quantum yield]] is high, these substances will release significant amounts of light over long time scales, creating so-called "glow-in-the-dark" materials.

====Equation====
:&lt;math&gt;S_0 + h\nu \to S_1 \to T_1 \to S_0 + h\nu^\prime\ &lt;/math&gt;
where S is a [[singlet state|singlet]] and T a [[spin triplet|triplet]] whose subscripts denote states (0 is the ground state, and 1 the excited state). Transitions can also occur to higher energy levels, but the first excited state is denoted for simplicity.

==Chemiluminescence==
{{main article|Chemiluminescence}}
Some examples of glow-in-the-dark materials do not glow by phosphorescence. For example, [[glow sticks]] glow due to a [[Chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent]] process which is commonly mistaken for phosphorescence. In chemiluminescence, an excited state is created via a chemical reaction. The light emission tracks the kinetic progress of the underlying chemical reaction. The excited state will then transfer to a dye molecule, also known as a [[photoelectrochemical processes#Photosensitization|sensitizer]] or [[fluorophor]], and subsequently fluoresce back to the ground state.

==Materials==
Common pigments used in phosphorescent materials include [[zinc sulfide]] and [[strontium aluminate]]. Use of zinc sulfide for safety related products dates back to the 1930s. However, the development of strontium aluminate, with a luminance approximately 10 times greater than zinc sulfide, has relegated most zinc sulfide based products to the novelty category. Strontium aluminate based pigments are now used in exit signs, pathway marking, and other safety related signage.&lt;ref&gt;Zitoun, D.; Bernaud, L.; Manteghetti, A.

==Electron excitation==
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|210px|right| After absorbing energy, an electron may jump from the ground state to a higher energy excited state.]]

[[Electron excitation]] is the movement of an [[electron]] to a higher [[energy state]]. This can either be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the original electron absorbs the photon and gains all the photon's energy or by electrical [[Excited state|excitation]] (EE), where the original electron absorbs the energy of another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to move electrons to a higher [[energy band]]. When an excited electron falls back to a lower energy state again, it is called electron relaxation. This can be done by radiation of a photon or giving the energy to a third spectator particle as well.&lt;ref name=2-electron&gt;

In physics there is a specific technical definition for [[energy level]] which is often associated with an atom being excited to an [[excited state]]. The excited state, in general, is in relation to the [[ground state]], where the excited state is at a higher [[energy level]] than the ground state.

==Photoexcitation==
{{See also|Photoelectric effect}}

[[Photoexcitation]] is the mechanism of [[electron excitation]] by [[photon]] absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization. The absorption of the photon takes place in accordance with Planck's quantum theory.

Photoexcitation plays role in photoisomerization. Photoexcitation is exploited in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s, [[photochemistry]], [[luminescence]], optically [[laser pumping|pumped]] lasers, and in some [[photochromic]] applications.

==Photoisomerization==
[[File:Azobenzene isomerization.svg|thumb|Photoisomerization of azobenzene]]
In [[chemistry]], '''photoisomerization''' is [[molecule|molecular]] behavior in which structural change between [[isomer]]s is caused by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerization reactions exist. However, the word "photoisomerization" usually indicates a reversible process. Photoisomerizable molecules are already put to practical use, for instance, in [[pigment]]s for [[CD-RW|rewritable CDs]], [[DVD-RW|DVDs]], and [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. In addition, recent interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and molecular electronics.

Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are ''trans-cis'' (or 'E-'Z) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include [[stilbene]] and [[azobenzene]]. This type of compounds has a double [[chemical bond|bond]], and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include [[fulgide]] and [[diarylethene]]. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the [[Di-pi-methane rearrangement]].

==Photoionization==
{{See also|Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}}

[[Photoionization]] is the physical process in which an incident [[photon]] ejects one or more [[electron]]s from an [[atom]], [[ion]] or [[molecule]]. This is essentially the same process that occurs with the photoelectric effect with metals. In the case of a gas or single atoms, the term photoionization is more common.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ejected electrons, known as [[photoelectron]]s, carry information about their pre-ionized states. For example, a single electron can have a [[kinetic energy]] equal to the energy of the incident photon minus the [[electron binding energy]] of the state it left. Photons with energies less than the electron binding energy may be absorbed or [[scattering|scattered]] but will not photoionize the atom or ion.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

For example, to ionize [[hydrogen]], photons need an energy greater than 13.6 [[electronvolt]]s, which corresponds to a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometer|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For photons with greater energy than this, the energy of the emitted photoelectron is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; { mv^2 \over 2 } = h \nu - 13.6 eV&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the photon.

This formula defines the [[photoelectric effect]].

Not every photon which encounters an atom or ion will photoionize it. The probability of photoionization is related to the [[Photoionisation cross section|photoionization cross-section]], which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of infrared or visible light), [[non-perturbative]] phenomena such as ''barrier suppression ionization''&lt;ref&gt;

===Multi-photon ionization===
{{See also|Fluorescence spectroscopy| Fluorescence| Photoionization mode}}

Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing ''N'' photons depends on the laser-light intensity ''I'' as ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''N'' &lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of multi-photon ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom. The excess energy gives the released electron higher [[kinetic energy]] than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, the system will have multiple peaks in its [[photoelectron spectrum]] which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy.

In semiconductor physics the [[Photo-Dember]] effect (named after its discoverer H. Dember) consists in the formation of a charge [[dipole]] in the vicinity of a [[semiconductor]] surface after ultra-fast photo-generation of charge carriers. The dipole forms owing to the difference of mobilities (or diffusion constants) for holes and electrons which combined with the break of symmetry provided by the surface lead to an effective charge separation in the direction perpendicular to the surface.&lt;ref name=photodember&gt;

==Grotthuss–Draper law==
The '''Grotthuss–Draper law''' (also called the '''Principle of Photochemical Activation''') states that only that light which is absorbed by a system can bring about a photochemical change. Materials such as [[dye]]s and [[phosphor]]s must be able to absorb "light" at optical frequencies. This law provides a basis for [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]]. The law was first proposed in 1817 by [[Theodor Grotthuss]] and in 1842, independently, by [[John William Draper]].&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

This is considered to be one of the two basic laws of [[photochemistry]]. The second law is the [[Photoelectrochemical processes#Stark–Einstein law|Stark–Einstein law]], which says that primary chemical or physical reactions occur with each [[photon]] absorbed.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

==Stark–Einstein law==
The '''Stark–Einstein law''' is named after German-born physicists [[Johannes Stark]] and [[Albert Einstein]], who independently formulated the law between 1908 and 1913. It is also known as the '''photochemical equivalence law''' or '''photoequivalence law'''. In essence it says that every photon that is absorbed will cause a (primary) chemical or physical reaction.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw&gt;
{{Cite web
 |title=Photochemical equivalence law
 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/457732/photochemical-equivalence-law
 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]
 |accessdate=2009-11-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photon is a quantum of radiation, or one unit of radiation. Therefore, this is a single unit of EM radiation that is equal to Planck's constant (h) times the frequency of light. This quantity is symbolized by γ, hν, or ħω.

The photochemical equivalence law is also restated as follows: for every [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance that reacts, an equivalent mole of quanta of light are absorbed. The formula is:&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{mol} = N_A h \nu &lt;/math&gt;

where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]].

The photochemical equivalence law applies to the part of a light-induced reaction that is referred to as the primary process (i.e. [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[fluorescence]]).&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

In most photochemical reactions the primary process is usually followed by so-called secondary photochemical processes that are normal interactions between reactants not requiring absorption of light. As a result, such reactions do not appear to obey the one quantum–one molecule reactant relationship.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

The law is further restricted to conventional photochemical processes using light sources with moderate intensities; high-intensity light sources such as those used in [[flash photolysis]] and in laser experiments are known to cause so-called biphotonic processes; i.e., the absorption by a molecule of a substance of two photons of light.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

==Absorption==
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}

In [[physics]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of electromagnetic radiation is the way by which the [[energy]] of a [[photon]] is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. Thus, the electromagnetic energy is transformed to other forms of energy, for example, to heat. The absorption of light during [[wave propagation]] is often called [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]]. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions (usually, in [[optics]]), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through, and the [[Saturable absorption]] (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.

==Photosensitization==
[[Photosensitization]] is a process of transferring the [[energy]] of absorbed light. After absorption, the energy is transferred to the (chosen) [[reactant]]s. This is part of the work of [[photochemistry]] in general. In particular this process is commonly employed where reactions require light sources of certain [[wavelength]]s that are not readily available.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

For example, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] absorbs radiation at 1849 and 2537 [[angstrom]]s, and the source is often high-intensity [[arc lamp|mercury lamps]]. It is a commonly used sensitizer. When mercury vapor is mixed with [[ethylene]], and the compound is [[irradiated]] with a mercury lamp, this results in the photodecomposition of ethylene to acetylene. This occurs on absorption of light to yield excited state mercury atoms, which are able to transfer this energy to the ethylene molecules, and are in turn deactivated to their initial energy state.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

[[Cadmium]]; some of the [[noble gas]]es, for example [[xenon]]; [[zinc]]; [[benzophenone]]; and a large number of organic dyes, are also used as sensitizers.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization&gt;

[[Photosensitiser]]s are a key component of [[photodynamic therapy]] used to treat cancers.

==Sensitizer==
{{For|the particulate material used to create voids that aid in the initiation or propagation of an explosive's detonation wave|Explosive sensitiser}}

A '''sensitizer''' in [[chemiluminescence]] is a chemical compound, capable of [[light emission]] after it has received energy from a molecule, which became excited previously in the chemical reaction. A good example is this:

When an alkaline solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] and a concentrated solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are mixed, a reaction occurs:

:ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*(g) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*is excited oxygen&amp;nbsp;– meaning, one or more electrons in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule have been promoted to higher-energy [[molecular orbital]]s. Hence, oxygen produced by this chemical reaction somehow 'absorbed' the energy released by the reaction and became excited. This energy state is unstable, therefore it will return to the [[ground state]] by lowering its energy. It can do that in more than one way:

*it can react further, without any light emission
*it can lose energy without emission, for example, giving off heat to the surroundings or transferring energy to another molecule
*it can emit light

The intensity, duration and color of emitted light depend on [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetical]] factors. However, excited molecules are frequently less capable of light emission in terms of brightness and duration when compared to sensitizers. This is because sensitizers can store energy (that is, be excited) for longer periods of time than other excited molecules. The energy is stored through means of [[quantum vibration]], so sensitizers are usually compounds which either include systems of [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] rings or many conjugated double and triple [[covalent bond|bonds]] in their structure. Hence, if an excited molecule transfers its energy to a sensitizer thus exciting it, longer and easier to quantify light emission is often observed.

The color (that is, the [[wavelength]]), brightness and duration of emission depend upon the sensitizer used. Usually, for a certain chemical reaction, many different sensitizers can be used.

===List of some common sensitizers===
*[[Violanthrone]]
*[[Isoviolanthrone]]
*[[Fluorescein]]
*[[Rubrene]]
*[[9,10-Diphenylanthracene]]
*[[Tetracene]]
*[[13,13'-Dibenzantronile]]
*[[Levulinic acid|Levulinic Acid]]

==Fluorescence spectroscopy==
[[Fluorescence spectroscopy]] aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] which analyzes [[fluorescence]] from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually [[ultraviolet light]], that excites the electrons in [[molecules]] of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, [[visible light]]. A complementary technique is [[absorption spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sym-spectroscopy/&gt;

Devices that measure [[fluorescence]] are called [[fluorometer]]s or fluorimeters.

==Absorption spectroscopy==
[[Absorption spectroscopy]] refers to [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that measure the absorption of radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the [[absorption spectrum]]. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy&gt;

'''Portakar''' or '''navel stones''' ({{lang-hy|պորտաքար}}) are traditional ritual stones in Armenia. They are bound up with cult of the fertility goddess, called in ancient Armenia, like the cult of the goddess [[Anahit]].

== History ==
According to Armenian mythology, women who wished to become pregnant must lean their stomach against the stone. Candle lighting was part of the cult. If a woman became pregnant she should come back and make a mark at the stone.&lt;ref&gt;А.Е. Тер-Саркисянц // Армяне: история и этнокультурные традиции.//

At the height of the [[Cold War]], all international communications were either sent through [[undersea cables]] or bounced off the natural [[ionosphere]]. The [[Military of the United States|United States Military]] was concerned that the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] might cut those cables, forcing the unpredictable [[ionosphere]] to be the only means of communication with overseas forces.&lt;ref name="The Forgotten Cold War Plan That Put a Ring of Copper Around the Earth"/&gt;  So, a ring of 480,000,000&lt;ref&gt;

'''Protonium''' (symbol: Pn), also known as '''antiprotonic hydrogen''', is a type of [[exotic atom]] in which a [[proton]] (symbol: p) and an [[antiproton]] (symbol: {{overline|p}}) [[orbit]] each other.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since protonium is a [[bound state|bound system]] of a [[particle]] and its corresponding [[antiparticle]], it is an example of a type of [[exotic atom]] called an [[onium]].

Like all onia, protonium is a [[boson]] with all quantum numbers ([[baryon number]], [[flavour quantum number]]s, etc.) and [[electrical charge]] equal to 0.

==Production==
There are two known methods to generate protonium. One method involves violent particle collisions. The other method involves putting antiprotons and [[proton]]s into the same magnetic cage. The latter method was first used during the experiment [[ATHENA]] (ApparaTus for High precision Experiment on Neutral Antimatter) by [[Evandro Lodi Rizzini]]'s working group at the [[CERN]] laboratory in [[Geneva]] in 2002, but it was not until 2006 that scientists realized protonium was also generated during the experiment.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

Reactions involving a proton and an antiproton at high energies give rise to many-particle final states. In fact, such reactions are the basis of [[particle collider]]s such as the [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]]. Indirect searches for protonium at [[LEAR]] (Low Energy Antiproton Ring at [[CERN]]) have used antiprotons impinging on nuclei such as [[helium]], with unclear results. Very low energy collisions in the range of 10 [[Electronvolt|eV]] to 1 [[keV]] may lead to the formation of protonium.

==Studies==
Planned experiments will use traps as the source of low energy antiprotons. Such a beam would be allowed to impinge on atomic [[hydrogen]] targets, in the field of a laser, which is meant to excite the bound proton–antiproton pairs into an excited state of protonium with some efficiency (whose computation is an open theoretical problem). Unbound particles are rejected by bending them in a magnetic field. Since the protonium is uncharged, it will not be deflected by such a field. This undeflected protonium, if formed, would be allowed to traverse a meter of high vacuum, within which it is expected to decay via annihilation of the proton and antiproton. The decay products would give unmistakable signatures of the formation of protonium.

Theoretical studies of protonium have mainly used non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]]. These give predictions for the [[binding energy]] and [[mean lifetime|lifetime]] of the states. Computed lifetimes are in the range of 0.1 to 10 [[microsecond]]s. Unlike the [[Bohr atom|hydrogen atom]], in which the dominant interactions are due to the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb attraction]] of the electron and the proton, the constituents of protonium interact predominantly through the [[strong interaction]]. Thus multiparticle interactions involving [[meson]]s in intermediate states may be important. Hence the production and study of protonium would be of interest also for the understanding of [[internucleon force]]s.

'''SolarMagic''' is a subsidiary brand of [[Texas Instruments]], selling electronics for [[photovoltaic]] systems. It was established in 2008 as a subsidiary brand of [[National Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/ww/en/analog/solarmagic/index.shtml|title=National Semiconductor Enters Photovoltaic Market with Technology That Maximizes Solar Energy Production|date=30 June 2008}} National Semiconductor press release&lt;/ref&gt; The brand name was carried through when TI purchased National Semiconductor in 2011.

==Products==
The original '''SolarMagic''' device was a proprietary brand of [[power optimizer]], a device which isolates the output from each PV-module from the rest of the system, preventing loss of performance by a single module from effecting the rest of the array.  Because of the electronic characteristics of solar arrays, real-world conditions such as partial/temporary shading and irregular panel performance can lead to disproportionate and excessive losses of power output from the system. In one study, shading over a day of between 8% and 16% of the PV system surface area led to relative array power losses of between 35% and 40%.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R. "National Semiconductor protects solar panels from shadows", ElectronicsWeekly.com, 2009-03-05: Retrieved on 2009-03-10: http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2009/03/05/45608/national-semiconductor-protects-solar-panels-from-shadows.htm, ElectronicsWeekly.com, 2009-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[National Semiconductor]] advertisement claims that their power optimizer could recoup up to 57% {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}of the power lost as a result of these phenomena, real-world results typically ranged between 1% and 6% of overall system output improvement.

'''South Stream''' ({{lang-ru|Южный Поток}}, {{lang-bg|Южен поток}}, {{lang-sr|Јужни ток/Južni tok}}, {{lang-sl|Južni tok}}, {{lang-hu|Déli Áramlat}}, {{lang-it|Flusso Meridionale}}) was a pipeline project to transport natural gas of the [[Russian Federation]] through the [[Black Sea]] to [[Bulgaria]] and through [[Serbia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Slovenia]] further to [[Austria]]. 

The project created controversy due to non-compliance with  [[European Union]] competition and energy legislation, in particular the [[Third Energy Package]], which stipulates the separation of companies' generation and sale operations from their transmission networks.&lt;ref name=upstream280514&gt;

==History==
The South Stream pipeline project was announced on 23 June 2007, when the Chief Executive Officer of the Italian energy company [[Eni]] [[Paolo Scaroni]] and the Vice-Chairman of Russian [[Gazprom]] [[Alexander Medvedev]] signed in [[Rome]] a [[memorandum of understanding]] for construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref name= ener&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=10031 |title = Eni and Gazprom sign gas pipeline accord for EU |publisher = Energy Publisher |date = 2007-06-23 |accessdate = 2007-06-26 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181649/http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=10031 |archivedate = 28 September 2007 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 22 November 2007, Gazprom and Eni signed in [[Moscow]] an agreement on establishing a joint project company for the commissioning of the marketing and technical feasibility studies of the project.&lt;ref name=scandoil&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.scandoil.com/moxie-bm2/news/eni-and-gazprom-sign-the-agreement-for-the-south-s.shtml | title= Eni and Gazprom sign the agreement for the South Stream Project | newspaper=[[Scandinavian Oil-Gas Magazine]] | date=2007-11-23 | accessdate=2008-02-24}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The preliminary agreement between Russia and Bulgaria on Bulgaria's participation in the project was signed on 18 January 2008. It was agreed to set up an equally owned company to build and operate the Bulgarian section of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=AGI&gt;

Along with additional supplied to Turkey, Russian gas, according to Putin, “will be retargeted to other regions of the world, which will be achieved, among other things, through the promotion and accelerated implementation of projects involving liquefied natural gas.”  In 2015, the supply of Russian gas to Turkey will be raised by 3 billion cubic meters via the already operating Blue Stream pipeline. Later a new undersea pipeline to Turkey, with an annual capacity around 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) will be built. That will allow Turkey to resell Russian gas to Europe.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Implications==

===Nabucco pipeline project===
[[Image:Nabuccostream.png|thumb|Map of the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines.]]
The South Stream project was seen as a rival to the [[Nabucco pipeline]] project.&lt;ref name=downstream150509/&gt;  Some experts like Alan Riley from [[London City University]] were claiming that the South Stream pipeline is a political project to counter Nabucco and to expand Russian presence in the region.&lt;ref name=setimes2&gt;

===Conflict with Ukraine===
South Stream has been seen as diverting some gas transported through Ukraine, instead of providing a new source of gas for Europe.&lt;ref name=setimes2/&gt;  To avoid Ukraine's exclusive economic zone, the pipeline was re-routed through Turkish waters.&lt;ref name=bloomberg060809/&gt;

===Offer to Romano Prodi===
Before stepping down from the premiership, Italian Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]] received an offer from Gazprom to become the Chairman of South Stream AG. This move was compared with the appointment of the former Chancellor of Germany [[Gerhard Schröder]] to lead [[Nord Stream AG]], a consortium operating the [[Nord Stream]] pipeline.

[[File:Klim friends.jpg|thumb|A selection of spring-loaded camming devices of differing sizes.]]
[[File:Creeks Giving - Climbing in Indian Creek, Utah - 29.jpg|thumb|Climbers often carry a large number of cams on traditional climbs.]]
A '''spring-loaded camming device''' (also '''SLCD''', '''cam''' or '''friend''') is a piece of [[rock climbing]] or [[mountaineering]] [[Protection (climbing)|protection]] [[Climbing equipment|equipment]].  It consists of two, three, or four [[cam]]s mounted on a common [[axle]] or two adjacent axles, so that pulling on the axle forces the cams to spread farther apart. This is then attached to a [[sling (climbing equipment)|sling]] and [[carabiner]] at the end of the stem. The SLCD is used by pulling on the "trigger" (a small handle) so the cams retract together, then inserting it into a crack or pocket in the rock and releasing the trigger to allow the cams to expand. A pull on the rope, such as that generated by a climber falling, will cause a properly placed SLCD to convert the pulling force along the stem of the unit into outwards pressure on the rock, generating massive amounts of friction and preventing the removal of the unit from the rock.  Because of the large forces which are exerted on the rock when an SLCD is fallen on, it is very important that SLCDs are only placed in solid, strong rock.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book | edition = 7 | editor = Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas | title = [[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Vitaly Mikhaylovich Abalakov|Vitaly Abalakov]]'s invention of the Abalakov Cam was the first application to climbing of the principle of a cam to climbing equipment. His cams were sections cut out of a pulley wheel and bear a remarkable resemblance to today's TriCams. Because these shapes were eccentric, the intercept angle of the cam changed as the cam rotates and expands.

In 1973 [[Greg Lowe]] filed for a patent for a cam that used a cam with a "constant intercept" angle. Using a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=jpcXCRMyDGwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Abalakov+Cam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXxFIvj2Be&amp;sig=NclQwx6EWhLesuR2EMXHC_COVFs&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCrpWG6r3RAhWL2hoKHfeUACsQ6AEIVDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Abalakov%20Cam&amp;f=false|title=The Climbing Dictionary: Mountaineering Slang, Terms, Neologisms &amp; Lingo: An Illustrated Reference|author=Matt Samet|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-594-85503-0|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  shape resulted in a uniform angle between the rock and each lobe of the cam; this constant angle is designed to always provide the necessary friction to hold a cam in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/~mak25/research.html Duke SLCD research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025052215/http://www.duke.edu/~mak25/research.html |date=2008-10-25 }} retrieved (2009-08-05)&lt;/ref&gt; Designed so that a load produces a rotational force, the logarithmic cam shape allowed for a single device to fit securely in a range of crack sizes.

Modern SLCDs were invented by [[Ray Jardine]] in 1978 (US patent 4,184,657)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold under the brand name of "Friends". Ray designed a spring-loaded opposing multiple cam unit with a more stable 13.75 [[degree of arc|degree]] camming angle and an innovative triggering mechanism. (The term ''friend'' is now widely used by climbers to refer to SLCDs in general, but properly speaking it refers to the brand popularized by [[Mark Vallance]] and now manufactured by [[Wild Country (company)|Wild Country]].) Other popular brands include [[Black Diamond Equipment|Black Diamond]] [[Camalot]]s, Metolius Power Cams, DMM 4CUs, Trango FlexCams, and [[Aliens (climbing)|CCH Aliens]].

==Modern use==
[[File:Camalot_number_6.JPG|thumb|right|Use of a cam in a large crack]]
The invention of SLCDs revolutionized rock climbing because it meant that cam (aka protection) could be placed into parallel or flared cracks so as to prevent the climber hitting the ground if they fell. Furthermore, unlike [[piton]]s, SLCDs can be removed easily without causing damage to the rock, which made [[clean climbing]] (climbing without damaging the rock) practical on many more climbs. Since the invention of the Technical Friend (which replaces the original one-piece [[machining|machined]] alloy shaft with a [[brazing|brazed]] assembly incorporating a length of thick [[stainless-steel]] cable, which is better able to cope with loading over an edge), there has been a great deal of development of the SLCD by a variety of manufacturers. For example, the adoption of the dual axle design by Black Diamond, the invention of three-lobed camming units to fit smaller cracks, and the more recent invention of the Link Cam by Omega Pacific, a design that allows one SLCD to span an even larger range of crack sizes. SLCDs are sold in various sizes to fit a diverse range of cracks from about {{convert|6|-|300|mm|in|sigfig=1}} wide, though devices of below about {{convert|10|mm|in|sigfig=1}} or above about {{convert|100|mm|in|sigfig=1}} are not often seen.

Modern traditional climbers often climb with numerous and variously sized SLCDs to cover a wide range of crack sizes, often with multiples of the same size, depending on protection requirements of the climb.

[[File:Swinside (p4160146).jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Swinside]] stone circle, England]] 
[[File:Bryn Cader Faner stone circle - geograph.org.uk - 185579.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Bryn Cader Faner]], [[North Wales]]]]
A '''stone circle''' is a circular alignment of [[standing stone]]s. They are commonly found across Northern Europe and Great Britain and typically date from the [[Late Neolithic]] and [[Early Bronze Age]] eras, with most concentrations appearing from 3000 BC. The best known examples include those at the henge monument at [[Avebury]], the [[Rollright Stones]] and elements within the ring of standing stones at [[Stonehenge]]. 

Stone circles are usually grouped in terms of the shape and size of the stones, the span of their radius and their population within the local area. Although many theories have been advance to explain their use, usually around providing a setting for ceremony or ritual, there is no consensus among archaeologists as to their intended function. Their construction often involved considerable communal effort, including specialist tasks such as planning, quarrying, transportation, laying the foundation trenches, and final construction.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Colin. "Building the Great Stone Circles of the North". Windgather Press, 2013. pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Dates and archaeology==
The earliest known circles were erected around five thousand years ago during the [[Neolithic]] period. During the [[Middle Neolithic]] (c. 3700&amp;ndash;2500&amp;nbsp;BCE){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} stone circles began to appear in coastal and lowland areas towards the north of the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Langdale axe industry]] in the [[Lake District]] appears to have been an important early centre for circle building, perhaps because of its economic power.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Many had closely set stones, perhaps similar to the earth banks of [[henge]]s, others were made from unfounded boulders rather than standing stones.&lt;!--a couple of typical examples are needed--&gt;

The sites do not contain evidence of human dwelling. This suggests that stone circles were constructed for ceremonies. The variety of the stones excludes the possibility that they had astronomical observation purposes of any precision.

Sometimes a stone circle is found in association with a burial pit or burial chamber, but the great majority of these monuments have no such association.

==Variants==

===Recumbent stone circle===
[[File:Aquhorties Recumbent.jpg|thumb|[[Easter Aquhorthies]] recumbent stone circle near [[Inverurie]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland]]
[[File:Dunnideer Remnants of Recumbent Stone Circle.JPG|thumb|Dunnideer recumbent stone circle near [[Insch]], Aberdeenshire, Scotland]]

{{Main|Recumbent stone circle}}
Recumbent stone circles are a variation containing a single large stone placed on its side. The stones are often ordered by height, with the tallest being the portals, with gradually reducing heights around each side of the circle, down to the recumbent stone, which is the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1995 |isbn= |location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type is found throughout the British Isles and Brittany, with  71 examples in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Great Crowns of Stone: The Recumbent Stone Circles of Scotland |last=Welfare |first=Adam |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |year=2011 |isbn= |location=Edinburgh |page=271 |url=http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/rcahms_media/files/publications/great_crowns_of_stone.pdf#page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 20 in south west Ireland, including [[Drombeg stone circle]] near [[Rosscarbery]], Co. Cork. 

Scottish recumbent circles are usually flanked by the two largest of the standing stones immediately on either side. These are known as 'flankers'. The stones are commonly graded in height with the lowest stones being diametrically opposite to the tall flankers. It is fairly common for the circle to contain a [[ring cairn]] and cremation remains. 

Irish recumbent stone circles are found in Cork and Kerry. There are no tall flanking stones on either side of the recumbent stone. Instead, there are two tall stones at the side of the circle opposite the recumbent stone. These are known as 'portals' as they form an entrance into the circle. Often the portals are turned so that their flat sides face each other, rather than facing into the centre of the circle. 

===Concentric stone circle===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}

A concentric stone circle is a type of prehistoric monument consisting of a circular or oval arrangement of two or more stone circles set within one another. They were in use from the late Neolithic to the end of the early Bronze Age, and are found in England and Scotland.

Cobble pavements have been found in the centre of many examples. Connected features at some sites include central mounds, outlying standing stones, and avenues or circular banks on which the stones are set. Alternatively, they may be replicas of earlier [[timber circle]]s rebuilt in stone, especially the examples in [[Wessex]].

A funerary purpose is thought likely, especially by Burl who sees sites in Cumbria as being analogous to the [[Megalithic architectural elements#kerb|kerb]]s that surround some [[chamber tomb]]s.
Burials have been found at all excavated concentric stone circles: both inhumations and cremations, with the burnt remains either within an urn or placed directly in the earth.

Megalithic monuments are found in especially great number on the European [[Atlantic fringe]] and in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aubrey Burl |title=The Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalith.ukf.net/bigmap.htm |accessdate=2006-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928065024/http://www.megalith.ukf.net/bigmap.htm |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Isles===

There are approximately 1,300&amp;nbsp;stone circles in Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2000 |location=New Haven |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL5KcoqiOnoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Stone%20Circles%20of%20Britain%2C%20Ireland%20and%20Brittany&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French archaeologist Jean-Pierre Mohen in his book ''{{lang|fr|Le Monde des Megalithes}}'' has written that British Isles megalithism are "outstanding in the abundance of standing stones, and the variety of circular architectural complexes of which they formed a part ... strikingly original, they have no equivalent elsewhere in Europe – strongly supporting the argument that the builders were independent."

Although widely distributed across the island, the two main concentrations of stone circles in Ireland are in the [[County Cork|Cork]]/[[County Kerry|Kerry]] area and in mid-[[Ulster]]. The latter typically consist of larger amount of small stones, usually 03.m high, are often found in upland areas, and on sites that also contain a [[stone alignment]]. The Cork/Kerry circles tend to be more irregular in shape, and with larger, but fewer and more widely spaced, [[orthostat]]s around the axial stone.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (1997), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Europe===
On the European continent, there are several examples in [[Brittany]]: two on the island of [[Er Lannic]] and two more suggested at [[Carnac]]. The [[Petit Saint Bernard]] circle lies further afield, in the French Alps. There are several examples in the [[Alentejo]] region of Portugal, the oldest and most complete being the [[Almendres Cromlech]], near the regional capital of [[Évora]] and within its municipality. Many others have left behind them only the central [[Dolmen|Anta]] (as they are known in the Alentejo) sometimes as an altar but more often as a central burial structure, originally surrounded by megaliths that have only sparsely survived erosion and human activities.

These circles are also known as [[harrespil]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]], where villagers call them ''[[mairu]]-baratz'' or ''[[jentil]]-baratz'' that means "pagan garden (cemetery)", referring to [[Giant (mythology)|mythological giants]] of the pre-Christian era. No example has survived in a good state of preservation but like the Alentejo, the Basque Country is dotted with eroded and vandalized examples of many such structures.

===Horn of Africa===
Ancient stone circles are found throughout the [[Horn of Africa]]. [[Booco]] in northeastern [[Somalia]] contains a number of such old structures. Small stone circles here surround two enclosed platform monuments, which are set together. The circles of stone are believed to mark associated graves.&lt;ref name="Tpficss"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hussein Mohamed Adam |editor=Charles Lee Geshekter |title=The Proceedings of the First International Congress of Somali Studies – Somali Studies International Association |date=1992 |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn=0891306587 |pages=37, 40 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mM8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Emba Darho in the [[Ethiopian highlands|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean highlands]], two kinds of megalithic circles are found. The first type consists of single stone circles, whereas the second type comprises an inner circle enclosed within a larger circle (i.e. double stone circles).&lt;ref name="Verlag"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Institut für Afrikanistik und Aẗhiopistik – Universität Hamburg |title=Aethiopica: International Journal of Ethiopian Studies |volume=7-8 |date=2004 |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |page=27 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=0_svAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swill''' is food for animals in liquid or partly liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swill?s=t|title=the definition of swill|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used as an extremely derogatory label for any drink meant for human ingestion perceived as unpalatable or nearly so. 

==Pig swill==
'''Pig swill''', '''hog swill''', '''hogwash''' is kitchen refuse used to feed [[pig]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hogwash?s=t|title=the definition of hogwash|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically pig farmers arranged collection of swill, e.g. by means of '''swill bins'''. The grease was skimmed off the swill tanks and sold for further processing, while the remaining swill was processed into pig food.

During [[World War II]] collection of pig swill was a nationwide campaign in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1900s.org.uk/1940s50s-pig-food-collection.htm|title=Food scraps and pig swill: how Britain coped in and after WW2|website=www.1900s.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak]] it was thought that unprocessed pig swill was a key link in the chain of the infection, and it was banned in Great Britain. In 2003 the ban was expanded to the whole [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23769171 Should pig swill from waste food be back on the menu?], BBC, 20 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now significant research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/feeding-food-waste-to-pigs-could-save-vast-swathes-of-threatened-forest-and-savannah|title=Feeding food waste to pigs could save vast swathes of threatened forest and savannah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support from farmers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/farmers-back-reintroduction-on-swill-as-pig-feed-poll-finds.htm|title=Farmer back introduction of swill as pig feed, poll feeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a return to feeding swill to pigs, not only as a way to reduce pig feed costs but also to reduce demands on agricultural land for pig feed.

'''Thermophotonics''' (often abbreviated as '''TPX''') is a concept for generating usable power from heat which shares some features of [[thermophotovoltaic]] (TPV) power generation. ''Thermophotonics'' was first publicly proposed by solar photovoltaic researcher [[Martin Green (professor)|Martin Green]] in 2000.  However, no TPX device is known to have been demonstrated to date, apparently because of the stringent requirement on the emitter efficiency. 

A TPX system consists of a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) (though other types of emitters are conceivable), a [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cell, an [[optical coupling]] between the two, and an electronic control circuit. The LED is heated to a temperature higher than the PV temperature by an external heat source.  If no power is applied to the LED, the system functions much like a very inefficient TPV system, but if a forward bias is applied at some fraction of the bandgap potential, an increased number of electron-hole pairs (EHPs) will be thermally excited to the bandgap energy.  These EHPs can then recombine radiatively so that the LED emits light at a rate higher than the [[thermal radiation]] rate ("superthermal" emission). This light is then delivered to the cooler PV cell over the optical coupling and converted to electricity.

The control circuit presents a load to the PV cell (presumably at the [[maximum power point tracker|maximum power point]]) and converts this voltage to a voltage level that can be used to sustain the bias of the emitter.  Provided that the conversion efficiencies of electricity to light and light to electricity are sufficiently high, the power harnessed from the PV cell can exceed the power going into the bias circuit, and this small fraction of excess power (originating from the heat difference) can be utilized.  It is thus in some sense a [[photonic]] [[heat engine]].

Possible applications of thermophotonic generators include solar thermal electricity generation and utilization of [[waste heat]].  TPX systems may have the potential to generate power with useful levels of output at temperatures where only [[thermoelectric]] systems are now practical, but with higher efficiency.

A patent application for a thermophotonic generator using a vacuum gap with thickness on the order of a micrometer or less was published by the US Patent Office in 2009 and assigned to MTPV Corporation of Austin, Texas, USA. This proposed variant of the technology allows better thermal insulation because of the gap between the hot emitter and cold receiver, while maintaining relatively good optical coupling between them due to the gap's being small relative to the optical wavelength.

The '''Tororo–Opuyo–Lira High Voltage Power Line''' is a [[high voltage]] electricity power line, connecting the high voltage [[Electrical substation|substation]] at [[Tororo]], to another high voltage substation at [[Lira, Uganda |Lira]], in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web| date=29 January 2014 |url=http://www.uetcl.com/index.php/site-administrator/2014-01-29-09-43-25 |accessdate=3 January 2018 |location=Kampala |
publisher=[[Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited]] (UETCL) | author=UETCL | title=Projects Under Implementation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The 132kV power line, begins at the 132kV substation at [[Tororo]], in [[Tororo District]], in the [[Eastern Region, Uganda|Eastern Region]] of Uganda. The line travels in a northerly direction through [[Mbale]], to  the [[Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited]] high voltage substation at Opuyo, outside of [[Soroti]], in [[Soroti District]]. From there, it takes a general north-westerly course, through [[Dokolo District]], to end at [[Lira, Uganda|Lira]], in [[Lira District]], in the [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Region]] of Uganda, a total distance of approximately {{convert|264|km|0}}.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Overview==
The power line is the major electricity conduit to the Eastern Region of Uganda, with extension to Northern Uganda. It is a 132 kilo-Volt, double-circuit installation, that harnesses power from the hydroelectric power stations on the [[Victoria Nile]] and the thermal and solar power plants in Tororo and Soroti, for onward transmission to the east and north of country.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=3 January 2018 |first=Mudangha | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Rehabilitation-of--Tororo-Lira-power-transmission-lines-start/688334-1753716-lxua9fz/index.html |title=Rehabilitation of Tororo-Lira power transmission lines start | last=Kolyangha | date=21 April 2013 |
newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Prior to 2013, the power line was primarily constructed of wooden poles, which were vulnerable to lightning, wild fires and termite damage. In 2013, the [[government of Uganda]], using money borrowed from the [[African Development Bank]], began replacing the wooden poles with metal structures. The main objective is to improve the availability, quality and reliability of power supply.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt; [http://kalpatarupower.com/ Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited] (KPTL), based in [[India]], is the main contractor on this project.

An initial estimate of casualties, given by a Mexico City government official about two hours after the explosion, was of about five dead and 75 injured.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; By evening, the Mexican interior minister said that the death toll had risen to fourteen, with 80 injuries.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; {{As of|2013|02|01}}, the death toll stood at 33 and was expected to rise, according to a paramedic at the site.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; There were 12 men and 20 women who were confirmed to have died, along with 121 people injured, 52 of which remained in the hospital the day after the explosion.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21289850 |title=Mexico City blast: Hunt for survivors in Pemex building |publisher=BBC News |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E7HYHvnn?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21289850 |archivedate= 1 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 4 February, the death toll had risen to 37, with three more bodies uncovered and the death of an injured woman.&lt;ref name="la times"/&gt;

An estimated 500 rescuers&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; were working at the site through the day on 1 February 2013, including firefighters, military personnel, and Red Cross workers, aided by dogs and a crane.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Four helicopters were used to evacuate those injured, in addition to ambulances.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; While rescue operations were underway, police cordoned off the area around the office complex.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

On 4 February 2013, it was announced by Attorney-General [[Jesus Murillo Karam]] that the explosion was caused when a buildup of gas in the basement was ignited by a spark, from what was believed to be an electrical fault.&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; According to Murillo, the explosion had expanded outwards, consistent with a gas explosion, rather than remaining focused in one spot, as a bomb would have done, and none of the victims had injuries of the types associated with bombings.&lt;ref name="la times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-mexico-gas-blast-20130204,0,6289235.story |title=Mexico official says deadly Pemex blast caused by gas |work=Los Angeles Times |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EDIC8mli?url=http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-mexico-gas-blast-20130204%2C0%2C6289235.story |archivedate= 5 February 2013 |first=Tracy |last=Wilkinson |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers''' was a [[trade union international]] affiliated with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. It was often known by its French initials, ICPS (Union Internationale des Syndicats des Industries, Chimiques, du Petroles et Similares).

== History ==

The Union was established at a conference in [[Budapest]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] in March 1950 as the Trade Unions International of Chemical and Allied Workers. It changed its name in 1954 when it expanded its scope to include [[Oil industry|oil workers]]. It also represented workers in the [[glassware]], [[paper industry|paper]] and  [[ceramic]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100074996 Directory of World Federation of Trade Unions]'' Washington [[Office of International Labor Affairs]], December 1958 p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a Conference was held in [[Havana]] which merged [[Trade Unions International of Miners|Trade Unions International of Energy Workers]] (formerly known as the Trade Unions International of Miners) and [[Trade Union International of Metal and Engineering Workers]] to form the Trade Union International of Energy, Metal, Chemical, Oil and Allied Industries. This organization was reorganized again as the [[Trade Union International of Energy Workers (2007)|Trade Unions International of Energy Workers]] in 2007. This left the metal workers an opportunity create a new TUI the next year, [[Trade Union International of Workers in the Mining, the Metallurgy and the Metal Industries]].&lt;ref name="Project for Articles of Association"&gt;[http://www.tuimm.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ESTATUTUAK.pdf Project for Articles of Association] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="London p.342"&gt;''[[Europa World Year Book]]'' London; Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004 p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The TUI was governed by an international trade conference held every four years. The Conference drew up the groups program, made policy decisions and elected an administrative committee. The latter consisted of 25 members drawn from 20 countries and met once a year. The bureau, composed of the TUI president, vice-presidents, general secretary and secretaries met to ensure the fulfillment of the administrative committees decisions and a permanent secretariat oversaw day-to-day operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Percy Coldrick|Coldrick, A. Percy]] and [[Philip James Jones|Jones, Philip]]. ''The international directory of the trade union movement'' New York : Facts on File, [1978] p.179&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial Commissions were also set up to deal with specific issues. In 1978 there commissions on oil ([[drilling]], [[refining]], [[oil pipelines]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]]), chemicals-pharmaceuticals, [[paper board]], [[pulp (paper)|pulp]], [[cellulose]], [[rubber]], glass and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Coldrick and Jones p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 its headquarters were reported to be in [[Bucharest]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100074996 Directory of World Federation of Trade Unions]'' Washington [[Office of International Labor Affairs]], June 1955 p.49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 its headquarters was reported to be at 17 [[Sztalin ter]], [[Budapest]] [[Districts of Budapest|VI]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of World Federation of Trade Unions'' 1958 p.52&lt;/ref&gt; From 1978 to 1989 it was reported to be at 1415 Budapest, sometimes given the street name [[Benczur ut]] 45.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/dudeman5685_yahoo_WFTU The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985. ]'' Prague; Published by the WTFU in cooperation with PRACE Czechoslovak Trade Unions 1985 p.150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[John Coggins|Coggins, John]] ''Trade unions of the world 1989-1990'' Harlow : Longman, 1989 2nd ed. p.451&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 it was reported at EM26, H 1097.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Upham|Upham, Martin]] ''Trade unions of the world, 1992-1993.'' Harlow, Essex, U.K. : Longman ; Detroit, Mich. : Distributed exclusively in the U.S. and Canada by Gale Research Inc., 1991 p.558&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==

In 1958 the ICPS claimed membership in 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of World Federation of Trade Unions]'' December 1958 p.52&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it claimed 7 million members in 59 affiliated unions in 37 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Coldrick and Jones p.178&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 it claimed 13 million members in 100 affiliate in 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Coldrick and Jones p.180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.150&lt;/ref&gt;
