[[File:Alanus de Insulis (Alain de Lille). Woodcut. Wellcome V0000079.jpg|thumbnail|Alanus ab Insulis (Alain de Lille).]]
'''Alain de Lille''' (Latin: ''Alanus ab Insulis''; {{circa}} 1128{{snd}}1202/03) was a French theologian and poet. He was born in [[Lille]], some time before 1128. His exact date of death remains unclear as well, with most research pointing toward it being between 14 April 1202, and 5 April 1203.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zott|first=Lynn|title=Classical and Medieval Literature Criticism|year=2003|publisher=Gale|location=Farmington Hills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Little is known of his life, however it is clear that Alan entered the schools no earlier than the late 1140s; first attending the school at Paris, and then at [[Chartres]]. He probably studied under masters such as [[Peter Abelard]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], and [[Thierry of Chartres]]. This is known through the writings of [[John of Salisbury]], who is thought to have been a near exact contemporary student of Alan of Lille.&lt;ref name="auto1" &gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=G.R.|title=Alan of Lille: The Frontiers of Theology in the Later Twelfth Century|year=1983|publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest writings were probably written in the 1150s, and probably in Paris.&lt;ref name="auto2" &gt;{{cite book|last=Marenbon|first=John|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Education|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan spent many years teaching at the school in Paris and he attended the [[Third Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] in 1179. Though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach, he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in Paris, and taught there, as well as some time in southern France, into his old age. He afterwards inhabited [[Montpellier]] (he is sometimes called '''Alanus de Montepessulano'''), lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister, and finally retired to [[Cîteaux]], where he died in 1202.{{sfn|Alphandéry|1911}}

He had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge, more varied than profound, caused him to be called ''Doctor Universalis''. Many of Alan's writings are unable to be exactly dated, and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well. However, it does seem clear that his first notable work, ''[[Summa Quoniam Homines]]'', was completed somewhere between 1155 and 1165, with the most conclusive date being 1160, and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in Paris.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the [[Latin literature]] of the [[Middle Ages]]; one of these, the ''De planctu naturae'', is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity.  He created the allegory of grammatical "conjugation" which was to have its successors throughout the Middle Ages.  The ''Anticlaudianus'', a treatise on morals as [[Medieval allegory|allegory]], the form of which recalls the pamphlet of Claudian against Rufinus, is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity.{{sfn|Alphandéry|1911}}

==Theology and philosophy==

As a theologian Alain de Lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against the [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]].  His [[mysticism]], however, is far from being as absolute as that of the [[Victorines]].  In the ''Anticlaudianus'' he sums up as follows: Reason, guided by prudence, can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order; for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith.  This rule is completed in his treatise, ''Ars catholicae fidei'', as follows: Theology itself may be demonstrated by reason.  Alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle, and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the [[Creed]].  This bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal, and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection ([[axiom]], [[theorem]], [[corollary]], etc.) that gives his treatise its apparent originality.{{sfn|Alphandéry|1911}}

Alan's philosophy was a sort of mixture of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Neoplatonic]] philosophy. The Platonist seemed to outweigh the Aristotelian in Alan, but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much Aristotelian logic combined with [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] mathematics.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

==Works and attributions==
One of Alan's most notable works was one he modeled after [[Boethius]]’ ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', to which he gave the title ''[[De Planctu Naturae]]'', or ''The Plaint of Nature'', and which was most likely written in the late 1160s.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; In this work, Alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of God.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; He also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity, through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality, has defiled itself from nature and God. In ''[[Anticlaudianus]]'', another of his notable works, Alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man. She has only the ability to create a soulless body, and thus she is "persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul," and "the Seven Liberal Arts produce a chariot for her... the Five Senses are the horses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=James J.|title=Introduction to The Plaint of Nature|year=1980|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anticlaudianus'' was translated into French and German in the following century, and toward 1280 was re-worked into a musical anthology by [[Adam de la Bassée]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Creighton, ''Anticlaudien: A Thirteenth-Century French Adaptation'' (Washington: 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hughes, "The ''Ludus super Anticlaudianum'' of Adam de la Bassée". ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' 23"1 (1970), 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Alan's most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching, ''[[Ars Praedicandi]]'', or ''The Art of Preaching''. This work shows how Alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be "used as a practical manual" when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=G.R.|title=Introduction to The Art of Preaching|year=1981|publisher=Cistercian Publications|location=Kalamazoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan wrote three very large theological textbooks, one being his first work, ''[[Summa Quoniam Homines]]''. Another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus, is his ''[[De Fide Catholica]]'', dated somewhere between 1185 and 1200, Alan sets out to refute heretical views, specifically that of the [[Waldensians]] and [[Cathars]].&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; In his third theological textbook, ''[[Regulae Caelestis Iuris]]'', he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules; this was typical of the followers of [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], of which Alan could be associated.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Other than these theological textbooks, and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry, Alan of Lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects, primarily including [[Speculative Theology]], [[Theoretical Moral Theology]], [[Practical Moral Theology]], and various collections of poems.

Alain de Lille has often been confounded with other persons named Alain, in particular with another Alanus ([[Alain, bishop of Auxerre]]), Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury, Alain de Podio, etc.  Certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him, as well as some of their works: thus the ''Life of St Bernard'' should be ascribed to Alain of Auxerre and the ''Commentary upon Merlin'' to [[Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury|Alan of Tewkesbury]].  Alan of Lille was not the author of a ''Memoriale rerum difficilium'', published under his name, nor of ''[[Moralium dogma philosophorum]]'', nor of the satirical ''[[Apocalypse of Golias]]'' once attributed to him; and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the ''Dicta Alani de lapide philosophico'' really issued from his pen.  On the other hand, it now seems practically demonstrated that Alain de Lille was the author of the ''Ars catholicae fidei'' and the treatise ''Contra haereticos''.{{sfn|Alphandéry|1911}}

In his sermons on capital sins, Alain argued that [[sodomy]] and homicide are the most serious sins, since they call forth the wrath of God, which led to the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. His chief work on penance, the ''Liber poenitenitalis'' dedicated to [[Henry de Sully (died 1195)|Henry de Sully]], exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. Alain's identification of the sins against nature included [[bestiality]], [[masturbation]], oral and anal intercourse, [[incest]], [[adultery]] and rape. In addition to his battle against moral decay, Alan wrote a work against [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and Christian heretics dedicated to William VIII of [[Montpellier]].

'''Alex Grey''' (born November 29, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] [[visionary artist]], author, teacher, and [[Vajrayana]] practitioner. His body of work spans a variety of forms including [[performance art]], [[process art]], [[installation art]], [[sculpture]], [[visionary art]], and [[painting]]. Grey is a member of the [[Integral Institute]]. He is also on the board of advisors for the [[Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics]], and is the Chair of Wisdom University's Sacred Art Department. He and his wife Allyson Grey are the co-founders of [[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]] (CoSM), a non-profit church supporting Visionary Culture in [[Wappingers Falls, New York]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Alex Grey Painting 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Alex Grey painting.]]
Grey was born Alex Velzy in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on November 29, 1953, the middle child of a middle-class couple. His father was a [[graphic designer]] and encouraged his son's drawing ability. Young Alex would collect insects and dead animals from the suburban neighborhood and bury them in the back yard. The themes of death and transcendence weave throughout his artworks, from the earliest drawings to later performances, paintings and sculpture. He went to the [[Columbus College of Art and Design]] for two years (1971–73), then dropped out and painted billboards in Ohio for a year. Grey then attended the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] for one year, to study with the conceptual artist, Jay Jaroslav.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

At the Boston Museum School he met his wife, the artist Allyson Rymland Grey.&lt;ref name="MillerSFChron"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2008/03/24/findrelig.DTL |title= LSD Helped Forge Alex Grey's Spiritual, Artistic and Love Lives |author= David Ian Miller |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] "Finding My Religion" series |date= March 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period he had a series of [[entheogen]]ically induced mystical experiences that transformed his [[agnostic existentialism]] to a radical [[transcendentalism]]. The couple would trip together on [[LSD]]. Alex then spent five years at [[Harvard Medical School]] working in the Anatomy department studying the body and preparing cadavers for dissection.

==Career==
He also worked at Harvard's department of Mind/Body Medicine with Dr. [[Herbert Benson]] and Dr. Joan Borysenko, conducting scientific experiments to investigate subtle healing energies. Alex's anatomical training prepared him for painting the ''Sacred Mirrors'' (explained below) and for doing medical illustration. When doctors saw his ''Sacred Mirrors'', they asked him to do illustration work. Grey was an instructor in Artistic Anatomy and Figure Sculpture for ten years at [[New York University]], and now teaches courses in Visionary Art with Allyson at The Open Center in New York City;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencenter.org Opencenter.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naropa University]] in Boulder, Colorado; the California Institute of Integral Studies and the [[Omega Institute]] in Rhinebeck, New York.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Image:Alex Grey - COSM 4.jpg|thumb|200px|Inside the [[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors|Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]].]]
In 1972 Grey began a series of art actions that bear resemblance to [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], in that they present stages of a developing psyche. The approximately 50 performance rites, conducted over the past 30 years, move through transformations from an egocentric to more sociocentric and increasingly worldcentric and theocentric identity. The most recent performance was "WorldSpirit", a spoken word and musical collaboration with [[Kenji Williams]] which was released in 2004 as a DVD.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Grey's unique series of 21 life-sized paintings, the ''Sacred Mirrors'' (to be on display at the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in [[Wappinger, New York]]), takes the viewer on a journey toward their own divine nature by examining, in detail, the body, mind, and spirit. The ''Sacred Mirrors'' present the physical and subtle anatomy of an individual in the context of cosmic, biological and technological evolution. Begun in 1979, the series took ten years to complete. During this time Grey developed his depictions of the human body that "[[x-ray]]" the multiple layers of reality, and reveal the interplay of anatomical and spiritual forces. After painting the ''Sacred Mirrors'', he applied this multidimensional perspective to such [[archetypal]] human experiences as praying, meditation, kissing, copulating, pregnancy, birth, nursing and dying. More recent{{when|date=October 2018}} work explores the subject of consciousness from the perspective of "universal beings" whose bodies are grids of fire, eyes and infinite galactic swirls.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Image:Alex Grey - COSM 5.jpg|thumb|200px|A visitor appreciates a piece of art.]]
Holland Cotter, art critic for the ''New York Times'' wrote in 2002, "Alex Grey's art, with its New Age symbolism and medical-illustration finesse, might be described as psychedelic realism, a kind of clinical approach to cosmic consciousness. In it, the human figure is rendered transparently with X-ray or CAT-scan eyes, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescaline. Every bone, organ and vein is detailed in refulgent color; objects and space are knitted together in dense, decorative linear webs." &lt;ref&gt;Cotter, Holland, ''New York Times'', Alex Grey Tibet House review, October 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Grey's paintings have been featured in venues as diverse as the album art of [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[Meshuggah]], the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, the [[Discovery Channel]], [[Rave]] flyers and sheets of [[blotter acid]]. His work has been exhibited worldwide, including Feature Inc., [[Tibet House]], [[Stux Gallery]], [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]], The Outsider Art Fair and the [[New Museum]] in NYC, the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris, the [[Sao Paulo Biennial]] in Brazil.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Grey has been a keynote speaker at conferences worldwide  including Tokyo, Amsterdam, Basel, Barcelona and Manaus. The international psychedelic community has embraced Grey as an important "mapmaker" and spokesman for the visionary realm. In his compendium of psychedelic culture, Psychedelia (2012), Patrick Lundborg speaks of Grey's position: "First of all, Visionary Art would not be the active, promising field it is today without the appearance of Alex Grey on the scene. Born 1953, Alex Grey is the leading psychedelic artist of today, and also one of the foremost proponents of Visionary Art as a style. Via interviews, his own writings and the CoSM art journal, Grey has contributed to a historical perspective on the school..."&lt;ref&gt;Lundborg, Patrick, Psychedelia, An Ancient Culture, A Modern Way of Life, 2012, ''Lysergia'', pg 421&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A large [[Installation art|installation]] called ''Heart Net'' by Alex and his wife was displayed at Baltimore's [[American Visionary Art Museum]] in 1998-99. A mid-career retrospective of Grey's works was exhibited at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego|Museum of Contemporary Art]], San Diego in 1999. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, CoSM, a long-term exhibition of 50 works of transformative art by Grey opened in the Fall of 2004 in New York City and relocated to its present Hudson Valley location in 2009.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Publications==
The large format art book, ''Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey'' published by Inner Traditions in 1990, is still in print and has been translated into five languages and sold over 150 thousand copies. This book of paintings takes the viewer on a graphic journey through the physical, and spiritual anatomy of the self. From anatomically correct rendering of the body systems, Grey moves to the spiritual/energetic systems with such images as ''Universal Mind Lattice'', envisioning the sacred and esoteric symbolism of the body and the forces that define its living field of energy. Includes essays on the significance of Grey's work by Ken Wilber, the eminent transpersonal psychologist, and by the noted New York art critic, Carlo McCormick. Grey's philosophical text, ''The Mission of Art'', published by Shambhala in 1998, traces the evolution of human consciousness through art history, explores the role of an artist's intention and conscience, and reflects on the creative process as a spiritual path.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

''Transfigurations'' is Alex's second large-format monograph from Inner Traditions, containing over 300 color and black and white images of his work. ''Transfigurations'' explores Grey's well known portrayals of light bodies, performance works, relationship with his wife, Allyson Grey, and their quest to build a Chapel of Sacred Mirrors. [[Sounds True]] has released ''The Visionary Artist'', a CD of Grey's reflections on art as a spiritual practice. Grey co-edited the book, ''Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics'' (Chronicle Books, 2002, reprinted by Synergetic Press, 2015).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 2004 Grey published his collected works in ''Visions'', a limited-edition boxed set which contains a portfolio of new works along with his ''Sacred Mirrors'' and ''Transfigurations''. ''Net of Being'', released by Inner Traditions in 2012, explores how Alex Grey's visionary art is evolving the cultural body through icons of interconnectedness and a new symbology of the Networked Self. ''Net of Being'' contains spectacular photos of Grey's collaboration with the cult band Tool plus his worldwide live-painting performances, and offers Grey's reflections on how art evolves consciousness.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Personal life==
He lives in [[New York City]] and [[Wappingers Falls, New York|Wappinger, NY]], with his wife, painter Allyson Grey. Their daughter, actress [[Zena Grey]], lives in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alexgrey.com/bio/ Alex Grey biography at his website&lt;/ref&gt;{{third party inline|date=October 2018}}

==Films==
In ''ARTmind'' (2004) Grey explores the healing potential of [[sacred art]]. ''CoSM'' the movie, was released in 2006 and features Grey giving a tour of the ''[[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors|Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]]'' exhibition on display (2004-2009) in New York City. Grey appeared in the 2006 film ''Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within'', a documentary about rediscovering an [[Disenchantment|enchanted]] cosmos in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Mann, Rod (Director) |title=Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within |url=http://www.entheogen.tv/ |year=2006 |type=DVD video |publisher=Critical Mass Productions |accessdate=19 November 2012 |oclc=181630835 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111070217/http://www.entheogen.tv/ |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the film ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule, ''in which he talked about the importance of the substance DMT in the past and present world, as well as describing some of his personal experiences with the substance and how it influenced his painting.{{third party inline|date=October 2018}}

[[Image:Alex Grey Painting 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Alex Grey painting.]]
Grey's paintings can be described{{according to whom|date=October 2018}} as a blend of [[sacred art|sacred]], [[visionary art]] and [[postmodern art]]. He is best known for his paintings of glowing anatomical human bodies, images that “x-ray” the multiple layers of reality. His art is a complex integration of body, mind, and spirit. The Sacred Mirrors, a life-sized series of 21 paintings, took 10 years to complete, and examines in detail the physical and metaphysical anatomy of the individual. "The inner body is meticulously rendered - not just anatomically precise but crystalline in its clarity".&lt;ref name="Kuspit2000"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=x3WibfHqGZUC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=alex+grey's+mysticism|title= Alex Grey's Mysticism |author= Donald Kuspit |work= Redeeming Art: Critical Reveries |year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his paintings include detailed representations of the [[skeleton]], [[nervous system]], [[cardiovascular system]], and [[lymphatic system]]. Grey applies this multidimensional perspective to paint the universal human experience. His figures are shown in positions such as praying, meditating, kissing, copulating, pregnancy, birth and death. His work incorporates many religious symbols, including [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]s, [[chakras]], and [[icon]]s with [[Geometry|geometric]] [[shape]]s and [[tessellation]]s in [[nature|natural]], [[Industrialisation|industrial]], and [[multicultural]] situations. Grey's paintings are permeated with an intense and subtle light that is rare in art history. “It is the light that is sublime in Grey’s oeuvre - which is the most important innovation in religious light since the Baroque - and that makes the mundane beings in them seem sublime, in every realistic detail of their exquisite being”.&lt;ref name="Kuspit2000"/&gt; His highly detailed paintings are spiritual and scientific in equal measure, revealing his psychedelic, spiritual and super-natural view of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Grey has also made his own contribution to the [[philosophy of art]] in his book ''The Mission of Art'' (1998). Therein, he promotes the possibility of the [[Mysticism|mystical]] potential of art: he argues that the process of artistic creation can (and should) play a role in the enlightenment of the artist. For him, the process of artistic creation holds the potential of transcending the limitations of the mind and more fully expressing the divine spirit. He also believes that art can induce within the viewer an elevated state wherein spiritual states of being are attained.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In an interview with [[Ken Wilber]] for ''[[Integral Naked]]'', Grey described an experience of shared visionary mystical experience between himself and his wife, which led him to believe in [[spirituality]] and [[spiritual practice]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

'''Augustinian values''' refer to [[Value (ethics)|values]] which are [[Christian]] and which [[Augustine of Hippo]] has colored with his saintly life and deepened by his teaching. A "value" is a "good that contributes to the perfection of being (not having or doing)." "Christian values" are values based on the [[Gospel]] proclaimed by [[Christ]] and handed on to believers by the [[apostles]]. "Augustinian values" are "Christian values" which Augustine lived and taught in the conviction that such values contribute to the fulfillment of the Lord’s twofold commandment of love in the spirit of the [[Beatitudes]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Biofacticity''' is a philosophical concept that allows to identify a living [[Object (philosophy)|object]] as a so-called [[Biofact (philosophy)|biofact]], i.e. a semi-natural living entity which has been biotechnically interfered during its life-span such as [[transgenic]] plants or cloned organisms. In [[philosophy]], [[sociology]] and the [[arts]], a biofact stands in close relation to the anthropological concept of the human being a composite of [[nature]] and [[technology]]. Biofact was introduced to philosophy as a [[neologism]] in 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]] and fuses the words [[Artifact_(archaeology)|artifact]] and the prefix "bio". One of Karafyllis' thesis is that a technical change in living objects, i.e. an increase in biofacticity, will shift the anthropological concept of hybridity towards a technological self-definition of the human.

== Biofacticity vs. hybridity ==
Hybridity takes into account the anthropological fact that humans are hybrid with both natural and technical essences, making them designers with an individual "''Leib''," which is a term in phenomenology that denotes subjectivity of one's own [[Corporeal substance|corporeality]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tensions and Convergences: Technological And Aesthetic Transformations of Society|last=Heil|first=Reinhard|last2=Kaminski|first2=Andreas|last3=Stippak|first3=Marcus|last4=Unger|first4=Alexander|last5=Ziegler|first5=Marc|publisher=Transcript|year=2007|isbn=9783899425185|location=Bielefeld|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofacticity, on the other hand, is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] term that reflects upon the anthropological term of [[hybridity]]. The latter deals with the self-definition of subjects rather than objects. Hybridity, thus, is an anthropological concept particularly when used for philosophical purposes while biofacticity is an epistemological concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Today's Science and Technology: A German-Chinese Approach|last=Poser|first=Hans|last2=Li|first2=Wenchao|publisher=LIT Verlag Munster|year=2008|isbn=9783825813635|location=Berlin|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these concepts demonstrate the hybrid character of the human being as a growing and creative entity who acts in light of self-determined ends. Theorists cite that this view becomes a broad approach in understanding the idea of life not merely as a biological process or functions of the [[Gene|genetic]] code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Blue and Brown Books''''' are two sets of notes taken during lectures conducted by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] from 1933 to 1935. They were [[Mimeograph|mimeographed]] as two separated books, and a few copies were circulated in a restricted circle during Wittgenstein's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Grayling&gt;[[A. C. Grayling|Grayling, A. C.]], ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction'' (1988) Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0192854119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture notes from 1933–1934 were bound in blue cloth, and the notes dictated in 1934–1935 were bound in brown. [[Rush Rhees]] published these together for the first time in 1958 as ''Preliminary Studies for the "Philosophical Investigations"''.&lt;ref name=Rhees&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig, ''Preliminary Studies for the "Philosophical Investigations", Generally known as The Blue and Brown Books,'' (1958) Blackwell Publishers Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inchoate versions of many of the ideas that would later be more fully explored in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' are found there, so these offer textual evidence for the genesis of what became known as Wittgenstein's later philosophy.&lt;ref name=Grayling /&gt;

==The Blue Book==
''The Blue Book'' was dictated from 1933 to 1934, and contains certain themes unaddressed in Wittgenstein's later works, including deliberations on [[thinking]] as operating with signs. An early conception of what would later become known as [[language-games]] is present in the text, which represents the first period of Wittgenstein's thought after 1932, a method of [[Linguistic description|linguistic analysis]] which would later become [[ordinary language philosophy]].

While Wittgenstein in ''The Blue Book'' is not dogmatic nor systematic, he does provide arguments that point toward a more self-critical view of language. For example, he does not think that "understanding" and "explaining" are necessarily related. He suggests that when humans are learning a [[Language-game (philosophy)|language-game]] they are actually being trained to understand it. He writes: "If we are taught the meaning of the word 'yellow' by being given some sort of ostensive definition [in this case, ''ostensive'' means something like "denoting a way of defining by direct demonstration, e.g., by pointing"] (a rule of the usage of the word) this teaching can be looked at in two different ways: (a) The teaching is a drill. This drill causes us to associate a yellow image, yellow things, with the word 'yellow.' Thus when I gave the order 'Choose a yellow ball from this bag' the word 'yellow' might have brought up a yellow image, or a feeling of recognition when the person's eye fell on the yellow ball. The drill of teaching could in this case be said to have built up a psychical mechanism. This, however, would only be a hypothesis or else a metaphor. We could compare teaching with installing an electric connection between a switch and a bulb. The parallel to the connection going wrong or breaking down would then be what we call forgetting the explanation, or the meaning, of the word...[I]t is the hypothesis that the process of teaching should be needed in order to bring about these effects. It is conceivable, in this sense, that all the processes of understanding, obeying, etc., should have happened without the person ever having been taught the language; (b) The teaching may have supplied us with a rule which is itself involved in the processes of understanding, obeying, etc.: 'involved,' however, meaning that the expression of this rule forms part of these processes..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Blue and Brown Books: Preliminary Studies for the "Philosophical Investigations"|last = Wittgenstein|first = Ludwig|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|year = 1958|isbn = 0-06-090451-8|location = New York|pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the citation suggests, Wittgenstein views understanding a language-game as being mostly concerned with ''training'' (which he calls "drill[ing]" in the above citation). Having said that, Wittgenstein is not one to believe that even understanding a language-game can be reduced to one process; like the plethora of language-games available to human beings, there are also plethora of "understandings." For example, the "understanding" of a language may come about by the "drilling" of the association between the word "yellow" and a yellow-patch; or it may involve learning rules, like rules used in the game of chess. Moreover, Wittgenstein doesn't think that humans use language mechanically, as if following a calculus. He writes in ''The Blue Book'', "[I]n general we don't use language according to strict rules--it hasn't been taught us by means of strict rules, either."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Blue and Brown Books: Preliminary Studies for the "Philosophical Investigations"|last = Wittgenstein|first = Ludwig|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|year = 1958|isbn = 0-06-090451-8|location = New York|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein clarifies the problem of communicating using a human language when he discusses learning a language by "ostensive defining." For example, if one wanted to teach someone that a pencil was called a "pencil" and pointed to a pencil and said, "pencil," how does the listener know that what one is trying to convey is that the thing in front of me (e.g., the entire pencil) is called a "pencil"? Isn't it possible that the listener would associate "pencil" with "wood"? Maybe the listener would associate the word "pencil" with "round" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible "interpretations" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying "pencil" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Blue and Brown Books: Preliminary Studies for the "Philosophical Investigations"|last = Wittgenstein|first = Ludwig|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|year = 1958|isbn = 0-06-090451-8|location = New York|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Brown Book==
During the academic year 1934–1935, Wittgenstein dictated to [[Francis Skinner]] and [[Alice Ambrose]] a text of which three copies were typed and bound. Later it became known as ''The Brown Book''. Wittgenstein contemplated publishing and attempted a German revision, but ultimately abandoned the project as worthless.&lt;ref name=Rhees /&gt;

==Possible further book==
A further item called ''The Pink Book'' or ''The Yellow Book'' has been speculated to exist, and may be contained in an archive of papers that Wittgenstein posted to a friend of Skinner days after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/26/wittgenstein-lost-archive "Lost archive shows Wittgenstein in a new light"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the film ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', the name of the company designing the artificial intelligence is named 'Blue Book' after Wittgenstein's set of notes, and it is loosely modeled on [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/|title=Ex Machina|publisher=IMDB|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contributions to Philosophy''''' ({{lang-de|Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis}})) is a work by German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. It was first translated into English by [[Parvis Emad]] and [[Kenneth Maly]] and published by [[Indiana University Press]] in 1999 as ''Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)''. In 2012, a new translation was done by Richard Rojcewicz and Daniela Vallega-Neu and published by Indiana University Press as ''Contributions to Philosophy (Of the Event)''. Composed privately between 1936 and 1938, but not available to the public until it was published in Germany in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://think.hyperjeff.net/Heidegger |title=Quick reference guide to the English translations of Heidegger |publisher=Think.hyperjeff.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the work is thought to reflect "the turn" (''die [[Kehre]]'') in Heidegger's thought after ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927).

==Summary==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}In ''Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)'', Heidegger builds on the notions of earth and world, which he had previously introduced in "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]", and introduces the concept of "the last god". The result is a move away from the centrality of the phenomenological analyses of ''[[Dasein]]'', toward the grounding of ''Dasein'' as a historical decision of human beings. Earth can be understood as the condition of possibilities for the world; neither earth nor world can exist without the other, and are thus engaged in a constant and productive struggle or strife. This struggle exists in the crossing from the "first beginning" of [[Western thought]], which began with the [[ancient Greeks]] and determined the entire history of [[metaphysics]], to the "other beginning", which will move beyond metaphysics by properly and originally posing the question of the truth of being (''Sein''). In a parallel fashion, human beings counter god(s), and a space between these four points is opened up for the moment of "enowning", which grounds the "essential sway" of [[being]]. The up-welling of the present comes from the future before itself. This means that the being in the now changes the being of the future and thus our utilization of our{{Who|date=February 2015}} being in the past.

The "Preview" to ''Contributions'' lays out provisionally the unfolding of the work and the methodology, here centered on grounding "the essential swaying of be-ing" rather than on the existential analytic of ''[[Dasein]]'' put forward in ''Being and Time''. The work is organized into six "joinings", which reflect the crossing to the new or other beginning, and are each equally original in the shift from man as ''animal rationale'' to man as Dasein, and from the shift from thinking as representation to inceptual, or be-ing-historical, thinking:

# Echo: the constant interplay between being and be-ing as not granting, or self-sheltering. In this chapter, Heidegger discusses the necessary ills of machination, the gigantic, and calculation, which out of the history of metaphysics reduce the question of be-ing to the belief that all beings — the focus of metaphysics — are created, reproducible, and entirely explainable. This is "necessary" because it is always already a part of the history of the first beginning, and the only thing distressing enough to potentially lead to a more originary distress, which leads to the creative question of be-ing.
# Playing-Forth refers to the hermeneutical relationship between the first beginning and the other beginning, bringing to mind ''Being and Time'''s destruction of the [[history of ontology]]. Metaphysics is not to be defeated, but rather to be truly understood for the first time, an understanding that will ground this thinking in its history, and allow for the true question of philosophy to be raised.
# Leap: the posing of the question of be-ing is the leap. The leap does not know what it is leaping into or towards, but in leaping opens up the space for more originary thinking. Since da-sein ''is'' projecting-opening, the leap opens a site in which the essential swaying of be-ing may be grounded in thinking-saying. The leap may simply be an originary [[phenomenological reduction]]: the leap into a genuine shift in thinking, and a new beginning in the history of philosophy.
# Grounding
# The Ones to Come
# The Last God

'''''Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence''''' (1994) is a book on the [[philosophy of science]] by [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]].&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;David Miller (1994). ''Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence''. [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/642525.Critical_Rationalism Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=bh_yCgAAQBAJ&amp;=fnd&amp;pg=PR5=f=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false contents.] Open Court, Chicago and LaSalle, Illinois] {{ISBN|0-8126-9197-0}} {{ISBN|0-8126-9198-9}}]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book review]]s include those of [[John W. N. Watkins|John Watkins]] in the ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'' and Michael Redhead in ''Analytic Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;• [[John W. N. Watkins|John Watkins]] (1995). "Review: "''Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence'' by David Miller," ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', 46(4), p [https://www.jstor.org/stable/687902?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents p. 610]-616.&lt;br/&gt;• Michael Redhead (1997). "Miller, D., ''Critical Rationalism'': From Physics to Metaphysics,"  ''Analytic Philosophy'', 38(1), pp. 73–76. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0149.00054/abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;   The book seeks to restate and extend the [[epistemology]] of [[Karl Popper]], whose general philosophy has been termed '[[critical rationalism]]'.

The book attacks the use of "good reasons" in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, the case, which Miller calls "tediously familiar", is that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is [[ampliative]] and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more "supported" than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. [[begging the question]].&lt;ref&gt;David Miller (1994). ''Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence'', Chapter 3, "A Critique of Good Reasons."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniele Bolelli''' (born January 11, 1974) is an [[Italian American]] writer, [[university professor]], martial artist, and podcaster based in [[Southern California]]. He is the author of several books on [[philosophy]], and [[martial arts]], including ''On the Warrior's Path''.&lt;ref name=Path&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|title=On the warrior's path: philosophy, fighting, and martial arts mythology|date=2008|publisher=Blue Snake|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1583942192|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known for his writing since the 1990s in Italy and the early 2000s in the United States, Bolelli rose to greater public prominence in the 2010s, beginning with his appearances on popular podcasts such as ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]''.  He went on to create his own podcasts, and has hosted ''The Drunken Taoist'' since 2012 and ''History on Fire'' since 2015.

Bolelli holds M.As in [[American Indian Studies]] and [[history]] from [[UCLA]] and [[California State University, Long Beach]], and did [[postdoctoral research]] in history at [[Cardiff University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GQItalia(@GQItalia) |url=http://www.thehumanxp.com/episode-96-daniele-bolelli-discipline-surviving-challenges-martial-arts/ |title=Episode 96 – Daniele Bolelli – on Discipline, Surviving Challenges &amp; Martial Arts |website=The Human Experience Podcast |date=2017-06-05 |accessdate=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a professor, he has taught a wide variety of courses in [[the arts]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]] on topics including [[Native American history]] and [[Native American culture|culture]], [[Taoist philosophy]], and [[Ancient Rome]].  He teaches at [[California State University, Long Beach|CSULB]] and [[Santa Monica College]].

== Personal life ==
Bolelli was born in Milan, Italy, in a family of writers. His father, [[Franco Bolelli]], is an Italian philosopher. His mother, Gloria Mattioni, is the author of four books and a freelance journalist. After high school, Bolelli moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he began attending [[Santa Monica College]]. He later graduated from [[UCLA]] with a B.A. in Anthropology, and continued his graduate work at UCLA (in American Indian Studies), [[CSULB]] (History) and [[Cardiff University]] (History). He currently lives in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GQItalia(@GQItalia) |url=http://www.menstyle.it/cont/sport/sport/0902/0402/karate-simone-bolelli-un-nerd-gu.asp |title=Daniele Bolelli, un nerd guerriero .1 |website=MenStyle.it |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolelli's wife, Elizabeth Han, died a little over a year after giving birth to their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedrunkentaoist.com/episodes/episode-34-elizabeth-han|title=Elizabeth Han}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
When he was 20 years old, Bolelli co-authored his first book ''Mitologie Felici'', which was published in Italy. He later co-authored two more books in Italy ''Starship'', and ''Frontiere''.  
His first solo book,  ''La Tenera Arte del Guerriero'', was published when Bolelli was 22 years old. This work, which is a philosophical exploration of the martial arts, became popular in Italy even outside the confines of martial arts circles and it has been used as a textbook in several universities in the United States, Canada and Italy.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Bolelli later translated it into English and added three additional chapters; the end result was published in the United States in 2003 under the title ''On the Warrior's Path''. Two new chapters were later added for a second edition published in 2008.&lt;ref name=Path /&gt; A Russian edition of ''On the Warrior's Path'' was published in 2011, and an updated Italian edition was released in 2013.

He next wrote a book on comparative religions, which was published in Italy in 2011 under the title ''iGod: Istruzioni per l'Uso di una Religione Fai da Te'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bluesnakeblog.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/interview-with-daniele-bolelli-author-of-on-the-warriors-path-and-its-recent-second-edition/ |title=Interview with Daniele Bolelli, Author of On the Warrior’s Path and its recent Second Edition &amp;#124; Blue Snake Books |website=Bluesnakeblog.wordpress.com |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaar.it/ateismo/opere/daniele-bolelli-igod |title="iGod" Istruzioni per l'uso di una religione fai da te &amp;#124; Recensione |language=it |website=Uaar.it |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States in 2013 as ''Create Your Own Religion: a how-to book without instructions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|title=Create your own religion: a how-to book without instructions|date=2013|publisher=Disinformation|location=New York|isbn=978-1938875021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolelli's third book, ''50 Things You're Not Supposed To Know: Religion'', was published in the United States in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|title=50 things you're not supposed to know.|date=2011|publisher=Disinformation|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1934708699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|title=Believe It Or Not: 7 Facts You're Not Supposed To Know About Religion|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniele-bolelli/7-religion-facts_b_1211712.html|work=Huffington Post|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author profile - Daniele Bolelli|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/192827.Daniele_Bolelli|publisher=Goodreads Inc.|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolelli's fourth book, ''Not Afraid: On Fear, Heartbreak, Raising a Baby Girl, and Cage Fightin'' was published in 2015. It's an autobiographical tale on the theme of facing fear which discusses Bolelli's experiences in martial arts, the death of his wife, and his raising his daughter as a single parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Not-Afraid-Heartbreak-Raising-Fighting-ebook/dp/B0178VX08C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458344970&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bolelli|title=Not Afraid: On Fear, Heartbreak, Raising a Baby Girl, and Cage Fighting|first=Daniele|last=Bolelli|date=1 December 2015|publisher=Disinformation Books|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He says that the most influential thinkers to have affected his world view include [[Tom Robbins]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ikkyu Sojun]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Lao Tzu]], and [[Heraclitus]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Teaching career ==
Bolelli teaches courses at [[CSULB]] and [[Santa Monica College]]. Unlike most scholars who tend to specialize in one particular field of knowledge, Bolelli describes himself as taking a "[[renaissance man]] approach." This has led him to lecture for diverse departments including History, Social Sciences, American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, and World Arts and Cultures. The range of subjects he teaches include American Indian history and philosophy, history of the United States, world religions, history of ancient [[Rome]], history and philosophy of [[martial arts]], the ethnic experience in the United States, world history, and several courses on the relationship between cinema and history. Student feedback shows that Bolelli is a popular professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=87988|title=Daniele Bolelli at Santa Monica College - RateMyProfessors.com|website=Ratemyprofessors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=588136|title=Daniele Bolelli at California State University Long Beach - RateMyProfessors.com|website=Ratemyprofessors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martial arts ==
Bolelli has trained in several styles of martial arts including [[kung fu]] [[san soo]], [[taijiquan]], [[baguazhang]], [[xingyiquan]], [[shuai jiao]], submission [[wrestling]], [[Brazilian jiujitsu]], [[boxing]], and [[judo]]. He holds a seventh degree black belt in kung fu [[san soo]]{{spaced ndash}}a style that he has taught for several years at [[UCLA]]'s [[John Wooden|John Wooden Center]]. Bolelli also coached and fought professionally in [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Daniele-Bolelli-41858|title=Daniele|first=|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religious Disinformation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Disinformation|url=http://www.skepticality.com/religious-disinformation/|publisher=Audio interview in Skepticality, the official podcast of Skeptic Magazine and the Skeptics Society, released 31 January 2012|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His MMA role models are [[Genki Sudo]], [[Evan Tanner]], [[Rumina Sato]] and [[Kazushi Sakuraba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.net/forums/members/daniele-bolelli/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022012114/http://www.sherdog.net/forums/members/daniele-bolelli/ |archivedate=2010-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2014}} He also coaches and manages female MMA fighter Savannah Em.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fightchix.com/2016/11/23/wonder-woman-savannah-em/ |title=wonder woman: savannah em}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Savannah-Nahry-Em-242693|title=Savannah|first=|last=Em|website=Sherdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media and podcasting ==
Bolelli is the host of two popular podcasts: ''The Drunken Taoist''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedrunkentaoist.com/|title=The Drunken Taoist|website=thedrunkentaoist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''History on Fire''.&lt;ref name="History on Fire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyonfirepodcast.com/ |title=History on Fire |website=Historyonfirepodcast.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolelli began hosting ''The Drunken Taoist'' in October 2012 after appearing on popular podcasts including [[Adam Carolla]]'s, [[Joe Rogan]]'s, [[Duncan Trussell]]'s and [[Skepticality]], the official podcast of the Skeptic Society.&lt;ref name="Religious Disinformation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/daniele-bolelli/|title=Daniele Bolelli|website=Adamcarolla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/3881 |title=Joe Rogan |website=Blog.joerogan.net |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2UPuP5y4t8|title=Joe Rogan Experience #187 - Daniele Bolelli, Brian Redban|first=|last=TechShown|date=20 February 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His foray into podcasting followed his appearance in Spike TV's ''I Am Bruce Lee'' documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iambruceleemovie.com/|title=IAmBruceLeeMovie.com - Health &amp; Technology Inspired by BL|website=iambruceleemovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Jan. 24, 2012 interview about his book ''50 Things You’re Not Supposed to Know: Religion'', published in ''Wired'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=GeekDad|title=Interview with Daniele Bolelli|newspaper=Wired magazine|date=Jan 2012|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/interview-with-daniele-bolelli/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A little over a month after its debut, ''The Drunken Taoist'' was ranked number 1 in the world in the Philosophy section of iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.danielebolelli.com/2012/11/05/drunkent-taoist-podcast-thanks-much-support/ |title=Drunkent Taoist Podcast - Thank's again so much for your support! |website=Danielebolelli.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2014}} Bolelli explained the naming of the podcast in his interview with Taoism Network: Taoism forms the philosophical roots of his worldview. The 'drunken' part links to a type of consciousness that emphasises on instinct, a celebratory and egalitarian attitude, and his hero [[Ikkyu Sojun]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview of Daniele Bolelli - Taoism Network|url=http://taoism.goodeasy.info/network/article.php?id=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Bolelli released a sixteen-part lecture series about Taoist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielebolelli.com/downloads/taoist-lectures/|title=Taoist Lectures - Daniele Bolelli|website=Danielebolelli.com|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued to appear on various popular podcasts, including [[Mike Vallely]]'s ''The Mike V Show.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themikevshow.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222094413/http://themikevshow.com/ |archivedate=2015-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolelli began hosting ''History On Fire'' in 2015, which was included in iTunes' list for 'Best of 2015' podcasts in the "Recent Debut" category.&lt;ref name="History on Fire"/&gt; History on Fire was inspired by [[Dan Carlin]]'s ''Hardcore History'', and Carlin later appeared as a guest on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/history-on-fire/id1038514498|title=History on Fire Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyonfirepodcast.com/episodes/2017/4/28/episode-19-featuring-dan-carlin|title=Episode 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics of podcasts have included [[Oglala Lakota]] leader [[Crazy Horse]], U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the Italian artist [[Carravagio]], and the early 20th Century American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6230">[[Gilles Deleuze]], a French philosopher, and [[Félix Guattari]], a French psychoanalyst and political activist, wrote a number of works together (besides both having distinguished independent careers).

Their conjoint works were ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', ''Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature,'' and ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy]]''.

==''Capitalism and Schizophrenia''==

A two volume work, consisting of ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' was an influential success; and, with its critique of psychoanalytic conformity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisabeth Roudinesco]], ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 385 and 414&lt;/ref&gt; marked a significant step in the evolution of [[post-structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 236-8&lt;/ref&gt; Its emphasis on the nomadic nature of knowledge and identity, as seen for example in the authors' stress on the continuities between the human and the animal,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Boehrer, ''Shakespeare among the Animals'' (2002) p. 36 and p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human | year=2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; also places it among the formative texts of [[postmodernism]]. Stark and Laurie argue that ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' also "responded to the failures of Marxist revolutionary movements to purge themselves of the vices they were
seeking to overthrow, including prejudice, dogmatism, nationalism and hierarchies of power".&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Timothy and Stark, Hannah. 2012. "Reconsidering kinship: beyond the nuclear family with Deleuze and Guattari". Cultural Studies Review, vol. 18 no. 1, 20. URL: http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/csrj/article/view/1612&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] in his preface to the first volume called it "a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]] praised it for re-introducing the flux of history into the static world of [[structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K.Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 179-80&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's celebration of the [[pre-oedipal]] has also been seen as sketching a strategy for survival under the capitalism of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 214 and p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kafka==

Unhappy with the treatment of [[Franz Kafka]]’s work by scholars, Deleuze and Guattari wrote ''Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature'' in order to attack previous analyses of Kafka which they saw as limiting him either "by oedipalizing and relating him to mother-father narratives—or by trying to limit him to theological-metaphysical speculation to the detriment of all the political, ethical, and ideological dimensions that run through his work".&lt;ref&gt;Bensmaia, Reda. "Foreword: The Kafka Effect." Foreword. Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1975, their book sought to enter Kafka’s works through deliberately imprecise analytical modes such as flow and intensity,&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; without the unnecessary burden of the type of analysis that relates works to past or existing categories of genre, type, mode, or style. The latter sort of analysis is related to what Deleuze and Guattari would call the "Major" or dominant literature, out of which they see Kafka emerging as a voice of a marginalized, minority people re-appropriating the major language for his own purposes, and stressing collective forces over the individual "literary master".&lt;ref&gt;A. Parr, ''The Deleuze Dictionary'' (2005) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==

Deleuze and Guattari also wrote ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' together, in which, drawing from [[David Hume]], they construct a view of philosophy as both based on experience and a quasi-[[virtual world]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Alliez, ''Signature of the World'' (2004) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal/political==

Guattari has described how his collaboration with Deleuze arose out of the aftermath of the [[May 1968 events in France]], as well as the additional energy generated in his writings by the collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;F. Guattari, ''Chaosophy'' (1995) p. 27-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

In addition to criticisms of contemporary misapplications of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Gregg. 2006. Who's Afraid of Deleuze and Guattari? London: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical critiques have been made of Deleuze and Guattari's anti-Hegelianism&lt;ref&gt;Malabou, Catherine. 1996. "Who’s Afraid of Hegelian Wolves?" In Deleuze: A Critical Reader, edited by Paul Patton, 114-138. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and their "fraternal" imaginaries.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, Alice. 1985. Gynesis: Configurations of Woman and Modernity. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the relationship between [[anthropology]] and politics in [[Anti-Oedipus]], Timothy Laurie also notes that "Deleuze and Guattari fall back on a methodological dogma that aligns femininity with reproduction and masculinity with politics and/or the primordial ‘male bond.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Epistemology as Politics and the Double-Bind of Border Thinking: Lévi-Strauss, Deleuze and Guattari, Mignolo | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Portal: Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 1–20 | year= 2012 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2137504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discernment''' is the ability to obtain sharp [[perception]]s or to judge well (or the activity of so doing).  In the case of [[judgment]], discernment can be [[psychology|psychological]] or [[morality|moral]] in nature.  Within judgment, discernment 
involves going past the mere perception of something and making nuanced judgments about its properties or qualities.  Considered as a [[virtue]], a discerning individual is considered to possess [[wisdom]], and be of good judgement; especially so with regard to subject matter often overlooked by others.

==Christianity==
In [[Christianity]], the word may have several meanings. Discernment can describe the process of determining [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] in a situation or for one's life or identifying the true nature of a thing, such as discerning whether a thing is good or evil. In large part, it describes the interior search for an answer to the question of one's [[vocation]], namely, determining whether or not God is calling one to the [[married]] life, [[Celibacy|single life]], [[consecrated life]], [[ordained ministry]] or any other calling.

[[Discernment of Spirits]] is a term used in both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] (Evangelist) Christian theology to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence. 

&lt;br /&gt;

== Process of Discernment ==
The process of individual discernment has required tasks in order for good discernment. These tasks include taking time in making the decision, using both the head and heart, and assessing important values. Time is necessary to make a good choice, decisions made in a hurry are often not the best decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignition Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When time is available to assess the situation it improves the discernment process. When time allots the tentative decision can be revisited days later to make sure that the individual is satisfied with their choice after the discernment process. Making decisions with the head means to first reflect on the situation and emphasize the rational aspect of the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=Dennis|date=2009|title=Discerning Spiritual Discernment: Assessing Current Approaches for Understanding God’s Will|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Ministry|volume=7|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a decision that is ours it also requires the heart in which the individual makes based on feelings as well as rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignition Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Values in the discernment process are weighing options that decide what is most important to the individual. Every individuals value system is different which effects each individual discernment process.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignatian Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=Liguori, Missouri|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining values, using both the head and heart and taking sufficient time when making decision are the main steps for a successful discernment process.

Group discernment is a separate branch of discernment. In group discernment each individual must first undergo their own discernment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waaijman|first=Kees|date=2013|title=DISCERNMENT AND BIBLICAL SPIRITUALITY: AN OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RECENT RESEARCH|url=|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=32|pages=2-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual must keep in mind what is best for the group as a whole as well as the individual when making a decision. The same principles of values, using the head and heart, as well as giving the decision making process ample time all still apply in group discernment. Group discernment is different because it requires multiple people to have a unanimous decision in order to move forward forward. Group discernment requires discussion and persuasion between individuals to arrive at a decision.

== Christian Spiritual Discernment ==
Christian spiritual discernment can be separated from other types of discernment because every decision is to be made in accordance with God's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=Dennis|date=2009|title=Discerning Spiritual Discernment: Assessing Current Approaches for Understanding God’s Will|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Ministry|volume=7|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental definition for Christian discernment is a decision making process in which an individual makes a discovery that can lead to future action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kunz|first=Sandra|date=2011|title=Respecting the Boundaries of Knowledge: Teaching Christian Discernment with Humility and Dignity, a Response to Paul O. Ingram|url=|journal=Buddhist- Christian Studies|volume=|pages=177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of Christian spiritual discernment God guides the individual to help them arrive at the best decision. The way to arrive at the best decision in Christian spiritual discernment is to seek out internal external signs of God's action and then apply them to the decision at hand. Christian Discernment also has an emphasis on Jesus, and making decisions that align with those of Jesus within the New Testament.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The focus on God and Jesus when making decisions is what separates Christian discernment from secular discernment. Ignatius of Loyola is often regarded as the master of the discernment of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kees|first=Waaijman|date=2013|title=DISCERNMENT AND BIBLICAL SPIRITUALITY: AN OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RECENT RESEARCH|url=|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=32|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatian discernment comes from Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) when he created his own unique way of Catholic discernment. Ignatian discernment uses a series of Spiritual Exercises for discerning life choices and focuses on noticing God in all aspects of life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Wilkie|date=September 2010|title=The Ignatian Method: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction|volume=16|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiritual Exercises are designed to help people who are facing a major life decision. There are seven steps of discernment to be followed that include identifying the issue, taking time to pray about the choice, making a wholehearted decision, discussing the choice with a mentor and then finally trusting the decision made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Wilkie|date=September 2010|title=The Ignatian Method: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction|volume=16|pages=7-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ignatius was a religious man his discernment process can be applied to anyone independent of religion.

The '''duck test''' is a form of [[abductive reasoning]]. This is its usual expression: 
{{quote|If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably ''is'' a duck.}}
The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter [[wikt:abstruse|abstruse]], or even valid, arguments that something is not what it appears to be.

== History ==
[[Indiana]] poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] (1849–1916) may have coined the phrase when he wrote:
{{quote|When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heim|first=Michael |title=Exploring Indiana Highways  |pages=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7zds6xx7S0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22james+Riley%22+OR+%22James+Whitcomb+Riley%22+bird++duck&amp;num=100| isbn=978-0-9744358-3-1 | year=2007 | publisher=Exploring America's Highway}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common variation of the wording of the phrase may have originated much later with Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer of the [[United Auto Workers]], at a labor meeting in 1946 accusing a person of being a communist:

{{quote|I can’t prove you are a Communist. But when I see a bird that quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, has feathers and webbed feet and associates with ducks—I’m certainly going to assume that he ''is'' a duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee (WI) Sentinel|title=Communist Expose  The Case of the Duck|date=September 29, 1946|author=Sentinel, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was later popularized in the United States by [[Richard Cunningham Patterson Jr.]], [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States ambassador]] to [[Guatemala]] in 1950 during the [[Cold War]], who used the phrase when he accused the [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] government of being [[Communist]]. Patterson explained his reasoning as follows:

{{quote|Suppose you see a bird walking around in a farm yard. This bird has no label that says 'duck'. But the bird certainly looks like a duck. Also, he goes to the pond and you notice that he swims like a duck. Then he opens his beak and quacks like a duck. Well, by this time you have probably reached the conclusion that the bird is a duck, whether he's wearing a label or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|given=Richard H.|surname=Immerman|year=1982|title=The [[CIA]] in Guatemala: The Foreign Policy of Intervention|page=102|publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas Press]]|place=[[Austin, Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later references to the duck test include Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]]'s, who used the phrase in 1964 in reference to [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Joseph|last1=Denver|author2=Ethel Franklin Betts|year=1965|title=Cushing of Boston: A Candid Portrait|publisher=|place=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platt|first=Suzy |title=Respectfully quoted|publisher=[[Library of Congress]], Congressional Research Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Tu3bScwKKAC&amp;pg=PT267&amp;dq=%22when+I+see+a+bird+that+walks+like+a+duck+and+swims%22&amp;ei=eL3cSYazBJKqMpG_6bMO | isbn=978-0-88029-768-4}} ''"Attributed to Richard Cardinal Cushing. Everett Dirksen and Herbert V. Prochnow, Quotation Finder, p. 55 (1971). Unverified."''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Adams]] parodied this test in his book ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'':
{{quote|If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family [[Anatidae]] on our hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|title=Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A claimed recent application of the duck test was the denial of tax exempt "nonprofit" status to [[Blue Shield of California]].{{efn-ua|"In a startling blow to one of California's biggest health insurers, the state has revoked the tax-exempt status of Blue Shield of California, forcing the company to pay tens of millions of dollars in back taxes and unleashing a torrent of calls for it to return billions of dollars to customers. 
The tax board's action 'was an acknowledgment of what Blue Shield was already doing, or not doing,' said Anthony Wright, head of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group. 'And if it looks like a duck and talks like a duck, it should be taxed like a duck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=California drops hammer on Blue Shield tax-exempt status
|first1=Tracy |last1=Seipel |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_27749247/california-drops-hammer-blue-shield-tax-exempt-status |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=March 19, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Liskov Substitution Principle]] in computer science is sometimes expressed as a counter-example to the duck test:
{{quote|If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Derick|last=Bailey|title=SOLID Development Principles – In Motivational Pictures|url=http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2009/02/11/solid-development-principles-in-motivational-pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Sergey Lavrov]] used a version of the Duck Test in 2015 in response to allegations that Russian airstrikes in Syria were not targeting terrorist groups, primarily [[ISIS]], but rather West-supported groups such as the Free Syrian Army. When asked to elaborate his definition of 'terrorist groups', he replied:
{{quote|If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it's a terrorist, right?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melvin|first1=Don|last2=Cullinane|first2=Susannah|last3=Tawfeeq|first3=Mohammed|title=Russia's Lavrov on Syria targets: 'If it looks like a terrorist, walks like a terrorist ...'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/middleeast/russia-syria/|accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=CNN|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Elephant test==
{{See also|Blind men and an elephant|Elephant in the room|Seeing the elephant}}

&lt;!--[[Elephant test]] redirects directly here.--&gt;Similarly, the term '''''elephant test''''' refers to situations in which an idea or thing, "is hard to describe, but instantly recognizable when spotted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.ai/Edge-International-1130480.html Valuing and Judging Partners — Beyond the Elephant Test!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603040024/http://www.edge.ai/Edge-International-1130480.html |date=2013-06-03 }}, Edge International Review, Summer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in legal cases when there is an issue which may be open to interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;B.Wedderburn, The Worker and the Law (3rd ed, Harmondsworth, Penguin,1986), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Barnard, [http://www.jil.go.jp/english/events_and_information/documents/clls04_barnard2.pdf The Personal Scope of the Employment Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126221317/http://www.jil.go.jp//english/events_and_information/documents/clls04_barnard2.pdf |date=2013-01-26 }}, in T.Araki and S.Ouchi (eds), The Mechanism for establishing and Changing Terms and Conditions of Employment/The Scope of Labor Law and the Notion of Employees, The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training Report, 2004, vol.1, 131-136. &lt;/ref&gt; such as in the case of ''Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris'', when [[Lord Justice]] Stuart-Smith referred  to "the well known elephant test. It is difficult to describe, but you know it when you see it",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1671.html Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris]; EWCA Civ 1671 (4 November 1998) (at paragraph 17)&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Ivey v Genting Casinos'', when Lord Hughes (in discussing dishonesty) opined "like the elephant, it is characterised more by recognition when encountered than by definition."  ''Overruling'' in part [[R v Ghosh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2016-0213.html Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd t/a Crockfords]; [2017] UKSC 67 (25 Oct 2017) (at paragraph 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar incantation (used however as a rule of exclusion) was invoked by the concurring opinion of Justice [[Potter Stewart]] in ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]'', 378 U.S. 184 (1964), an obscenity case.  He stated that the Constitution protected all obscenity except "hard-core pornography". Stewart opined, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But [[I know it when I see it]], and the motion picture involved in this case is not that."

[[File:Resilience1.jpg|thumb|right|440px|alt=Temperate lake and Mulga woodland|&lt;center&gt;Lake and Mulga ecosystems with alternative stable states&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2002"/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

In [[ecology]], '''resilience''' is the capacity of an [[ecosystem]] to respond to a perturbation or [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] by resisting damage and recovering quickly. Such perturbations and disturbances can include [[stochastic]] events such as [[fires]], [[flooding]], [[windstorm]]s, insect population explosions, and human activities such as [[deforestation]], fracking of the ground for oil extraction,  pesticide sprayed in soil, and the [[Introduced species|introduction of exotic]] plant or animal species. Disturbances of sufficient [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] or duration can profoundly affect an ecosystem and may force an ecosystem to reach a [[Ecological threshold|threshold]] beyond which a different [[regime]] of processes and structures predominates.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2004"/&gt; Human activities that adversely affect ecosystem resilience such as [[loss of biodiversity|reduction of biodiversity]], [[exploitation of natural resources]], [[pollution]], [[land use]], and [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]] are increasingly causing [[regime shift]]s in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson et al 1998"/&gt; Interdisciplinary discourse on resilience now includes consideration of the interactions of humans and ecosystems via socio-ecological systems, and the need for shift from the [[maximum sustainable yield]] paradigm to [[environmental resource management]] which aims to build ecological resilience through "resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance".&lt;ref name="Walker, Holling et al 2004"/&gt;

==Definitions==
The concept of resilience in ecological systems was first introduced by the Canadian ecologist [[C.S. Holling]] &lt;ref Name="Holling 1973"/&gt; in order to describe the persistence of natural systems in the face of changes in ecosystem variables due to natural or anthropogenic causes. Resilience has been defined in two ways in ecological literature:
# as the time required for an ecosystem to return to an [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] or steady-state following a perturbation (which is also defined as stability by some authors). This definition of resilience is used in other fields such as physics and engineering, and hence has been termed ‘engineering resilience’ by Holling.&lt;ref name="Holling 1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunderson 2000"/&gt;
# as "the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks".&lt;ref name="Walker, Holling et al 2004"/&gt;

The second definition has been termed ‘ecological resilience’, and it presumes the existence of multiple stable states or regimes.&lt;ref name="Gunderson 2000"/&gt;

Some shallow temperate lakes can exist within either clear water regime, which provides many [[ecosystem services]], or a turbid water regime, which provides reduced ecosystem services and can produce [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|toxic algae blooms]].  The regime or state is dependent upon lake [[phosphorus|phosphorus cycles]], and either regime can be resilient dependent upon the lake's ecology and management.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2004" /&gt;

[[Acacia aneura|Mulga]] woodlands of Australia can exist in a grass-rich regime that  supports sheep herding, or a shrub-dominated regime of no value for sheep grazing. [[Regime shift]]s are driven by the interaction of [[fire]], [[herbivory]], and variable rainfall. Either state can be resilient dependent upon management.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2004" /&gt;

==Theory==
Ecologists [[Brian Walker (ecologist)|Brian Walker]], [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling]] and others describe four critical aspects of resilience: ''latitude'', ''resistance'', ''precariousness'', and ''[[panarchy]]''.

The first three can apply both to a whole system or the sub-systems that make it up.

# Latitude: the maximum amount a system can be changed before losing its ability to recover (before crossing a threshold which, if breached, makes recovery difficult or impossible).
# Resistance: the ease or difficulty of changing the system; how “resistant” it is to being changed.
# Precariousness: how close the current state of the system is to a limit or “threshold.”.&lt;ref name="Walker, Holling et al 2004" /&gt;
# Panarchy: the degree to which a certain hierarchical level of an ecosystem is influenced by other levels. For example, organisms living in communities that are in isolation from one another may be organized differently from the same type of organism living in a large continuous population, thus the community-level structure is influenced by population-level interactions.

Closely linked to resilience is ''[[adaptive capacity]]'', which is the property of an ecosystem that describes change in stability landscapes and resilience.&lt;ref name="Gunderson 2000" /&gt; Adaptive capacity in socio-ecological systems refers to the ability of humans to deal with change in their environment by observation, learning and altering their interactions.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2004" /&gt;

==Human impacts==
Resilience refers to ecosystem's stability and capability of tolerating disturbance and restoring itself.&amp;nbsp; If the disturbance is of sufficient magnitude or duration, a threshold may be reached where the ecosystem undergoes a [[regime shift]], possibly permanently. Sustainable use of environmental goods and services requires understanding and consideration of the resilience of the ecosystem and its limits. However, the elements which influence ecosystem resilience are complicated. For example, various elements such as the&amp;nbsp;[[water cycle]], fertility, [[biodiversity]], plant diversity and climate, interact fiercely and affect different systems.

There are many areas where human activity impacts upon and is also dependent upon the resilience of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems. These include agriculture, deforestation, pollution, mining, recreation, overfishing, dumping of waste into the sea and climate change.

===Agriculture===
[[Agriculture]] can be seen as a significant example which the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems should be considered. The organic matter (elements carbon and nitrogen) in soil, which is supposed to be recharged by multiple plants, is the main source of nutrients for crop growth.&lt;ref name="Tilman 1999" /&gt; At the same time, intensive agriculture practices in response to global food demand and shortages involves the removal of weeds and the application of fertilisers to increase food production. However, as a result of agricultural intensification and the application of herbicides to control weeds, fertilisers to accelerate and increase crop growth and pesticides to control insects, plant biodiversity is reduced as is the supply of organic matter to replenish soil nutrients and prevent run-off. This leads to a reduction in soil fertility and productivity.&lt;ref name="Tilman 1999"/&gt; More sustainable agricultural practices would take into account and estimate the resilience of the land and monitor and balance the input and output of organic matter.

===Deforestation===
The term [[deforestation]] has a meaning that covers crossing the threshold of forest's resilience and losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area.&lt;ref name="Davis and Holmgren 2000"/&gt; The larger the scale of damage, the more difficult it is for the forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance.

Deforestation also decreases biodiversity of both plant and animal life and can lead to an alteration of the climatic conditions of an entire area. Deforestation can also lead to species extinction, which can have a domino effect particularly when keystone species are removed or when a significant number of species is removed and their ecological function is lost.&lt;ref name="Peterson et al 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naik 2010" /&gt;

===Climate change===
{{Main article|Climate resilience}}
Climate resilience is generally defined as the capacity for a socio-ecological system to: (1) absorb stresses and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by climate change and (2) adapt, reorganize, and evolve into more desirable configurations that improve the sustainability of the system, leaving it better prepared for future climate change impacts.  Increasingly, [[global warming|climate change]] is threatening human communities around the world in a variety of ways such as rising sea levels, increasingly frequent large storms, tidal surges and flooding damage. One of the main results of climate change is rising sea water temperature which has a serious effect on coral reefs, through thermal-stress related [[coral bleaching]]. Between 1997-1998 the most significant worldwide coral bleaching event was recorded which corresponded with the [[El Nino]] Southern Oscillation, with significant damage to the coral reefs of the Western Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name="Obura 2005" /&gt;

===Overfishing===
It has been estimated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation that over 70% of the world’s [[fish stock]]s are either fully exploited or depleted which means [[overfishing]] threatens [[marine ecosystem]] resilience and this is mostly by rapid growth of fishing technology.&lt;ref name="YPTE 2010" /&gt; One of the negative effects on marine ecosystems is that over the last half-century the stocks of [[coastal fish]] have had a huge reduction as a result of overfishing for its economic benefits.&lt;ref name="Grinning Planet 2010 1" /&gt; [[Tuna|Blue fin tuna]] is at particular risk of extinction. Depletion of fish stocks results in lowered biodiversity and consequently imbalance in the food chain, and increased vulnerability to disease.

In addition to overfishing, coastal communities are suffering the impacts of growing numbers of large commercial [[fishing vessel]]s in causing reductions of small local fishing fleets. Many local lowland rivers which are sources of fresh water have become degraded because of the inflows of pollutants and sediments.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2009" /&gt;

===Dumping of waste into the sea===
Dumping both depends upon ecosystem resilience whilst threatening it. Dumping of sewage and other contaminants into the ocean is often undertaken for the dispersive nature of the oceans and adaptive nature and ability for marine life to process the [[marine debris]] and contaminants. However, waste dumping threatens marine ecosystems by poisoning marine life and [[eutrophication]].

====Poisoning marine life====
According to the International Maritime Organisation oil spills can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention recognized that most oil pollution resulted from routine shipboard operations such as the cleaning of cargo tanks.&amp;nbsp; In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply to wash the tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of oil and water into the sea. OILPOL 54&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended by means of an amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO. Meanwhile, IMO in 1965 set up a Subcommittee on Oil Pollution, under the auspices of its Maritime Safety committee, to address oil pollution issues.&lt;ref name="IMO 2010" /&gt;

The threat of oil spills to marine life is recognised by those likely to be responsible for the pollution, such as the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation:

The marine ecosystem is highly complex and natural fluctuations in species composition, abundance and distribution are a basic feature of its normal function. The extent of damage can therefore be difficult to detect against this background variability. Nevertheless, the key to understanding damage and its importance is whether spill effects result in a downturn in breeding success, productivity, diversity and the overall functioning of the system. Spills are not the only pressure on marine habitats; chronic urban and industrial contamination or the exploitation of the resources they provide are also serious threats.&lt;ref name="ITOPF 2010"/&gt;

====Eutrophication and algal blooms====
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution calls nutrient pollution the most widespread, chronic environmental problem in the coastal ocean. The discharges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients come from agriculture, waste disposal, coastal development, and fossil fuel use. Once nutrient pollution reaches the coastal zone, it stimulates harmful overgrowths of algae, which can have direct toxic effects and ultimately result in low-oxygen conditions. Certain types of algae are toxic. Overgrowths of these algae result in harmful [[algal blooms]], which are more colloquially referred to as "red tides" or "brown tides". Zooplankton eat the toxic algae and begin passing the toxins up the food chain, affecting edibles like clams, and ultimately working their way up to seabirds, marine mammals, and humans. The result can be illness and sometimes death.&lt;ref name="Grinning Planet 2010 2" /&gt;

==Sustainable development==

There is increasing awareness that a greater understanding and emphasis of ecosystem resilience is required to reach the goal of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker, Carpenter et al 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brand 2009"/&gt; A similar conclusion is drawn by Perman et al. who use resilience to describe one of 6 concepts of sustainability; "A sustainable state is one which satisfies minimum conditions for ecosystem resilience through time".&lt;ref name = "Perman et al"&gt;Perman, R, Ma, Y, McGilvray, J and M.Common. (2003). “Natural Resource and Environmental Economics”. Longman. 26, 52, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience science has been evolving over the past decade, expanding beyond ecology to reflect systems of thinking in fields such as [[economics]] and [[political science]]. And, as more and more people move into densely populated cities, using massive amounts of water, energy, and other resources, the need to combine these disciplines to consider the resilience of [[urban ecosystem]]s and cities is of paramount importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/12/ecological-and-urban-resilience/|title=Ecological and Urban Resilience|author=|date=12 October 2011|website=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic perspectives ===

The interdependence of ecological and social systems has gained renewed recognition since the late 1990s by academics including Berkes and Folke&lt;ref name = "Berkes and Folke"&gt;Berkes, F. and Folke, C., (ed Colding, J.) (1998). “Linking Social and Ecological Systems: Management practices and social mechanisms for building resilience”. [[Cambridge University Press]]: 1, 33, 429, 433.&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further in 2002 by Folke et al.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2002" /&gt; As the concept of sustainable development has evolved [[Circles of Sustainability|beyond the 3 pillars]] of sustainable development to place greater political emphasis on economic development. This is a movement which causes wide concern in environmental and social forums and which Clive Hamilton describes as "the growth fetish".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, C. (2010). “Requiem for a Species: Why we Resist the Truth about Climate Change”. Earthscan. 32, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of ecological resilience that is proposed is ultimately about averting our extinction as Walker cites Holling in his paper: "[..] "resilience is concerned with [measuring] the probabilities of extinction” (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;20)".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. (2007). “The Strange Evolution of Holling’s Resilience or The Resilience of Economics and the Eternal Return of Infinite Growth”. Submission to TfC e-Journal. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming more apparent in academic writing is the significance of the environment and resilience in sustainable development.  Folke et al state that the likelihood of sustaining development is raised by "Managing for resilience"&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2002" /&gt; whilst Perman et al. propose that safeguarding the environment to "deliver a set of services" should be a "necessary condition for an economy to be sustainable".&lt;ref name="Perman et al" /&gt;

=== The flaw of the free market ===

The challenge of applying the concept of ecological resilience to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making.  Resilience questions the [[free market]] model within which global markets operate. Inherent to the successful operation of a free market is specialisation which is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity.  This very act of specialisation weakens resilience by permitting systems to become accustomed to and dependent upon their prevailing conditions. In the event of unanticipated shocks; this dependency reduces the ability of the system to adapt to these changes.&lt;ref name="Folke, Carpenter et al 2002" /&gt; Correspondingly; Perman et al. note that; "Some economic activities appear to reduce resilience, so that the level of disturbance to which the ecosystem can be subjected to without parametric change taking place is reduced".&lt;ref name="Perman et al" /&gt;

=== Moving beyond sustainable development ===
Berkes and Folke table a set of principles to assist with "building resilience and sustainability" which consolidate approaches of [[adaptive management]], local knowledge-based management practices and conditions for institutional learning and self-organisation.&lt;ref name="Berkes and Folke" /&gt;

More recently, it has been suggested by Andrea Ross that the concept of sustainable development is no longer adequate in assisting policy development fit for today’s global challenges and objectives.  This is because the concept of sustainable development is "based on [[weak sustainability]]" which doesn’t take account of the reality of "limits to earth's resilience".&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ross A | year = 2008 | title = Modern Interpretations of Sustainable Development | url = | journal = Journal of Law and Society | volume = 36 | issue = 1| page = 32 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6478.2009.00455.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ross draws on the impact of [[climate change]] on the global agenda as a fundamental factor in the "shift towards ecological sustainability" as an alternative approach to that of sustainable development.&lt;ref name=Ross /&gt;

==In environmental policy==

Scientific research associated with resilience is beginning to play a role in influencing policy-making and subsequent environmental decision making.

This occurs in a number of ways:
*Observed resilience within specific ecosystems drives management practice. When resilience is observed to be low, or impact seems to be reaching the threshold, management response can be to alter human behavior to result in less adverse impact to the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2009"/&gt;
*Ecosystem resilience impacts upon the way that development is permitted/environmental decision making is undertaken, similar to the way that existing ecosystem health impacts upon what development is permitted. For instance, remnant vegetation in the states of Queensland and New South Wales are classified in terms of ecosystem health and abundance. Any impact that development has upon threatened ecosystems must consider the health and resilience of these ecosystems. This is governed by the ''Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995'' in New South Wales &lt;ref name="DECCW 2010 2"/&gt; and the ''Vegetation Management Act 1999'' in Queensland.&lt;ref name="DERM 2010"/&gt;
*International level initiatives aim at improving socio-ecological resilience worldwide through the cooperation and contributions of scientific and other experts. An example of such an initiative is the '''[[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]]''' &lt;ref name="MEA 2010"/&gt; whose objective is "to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for  human well-being and the  scientific basis for action needed to enhance  the conservation and sustainable  use of those systems and their  contribution to human well-being". Similarly, the '''[[United Nations Environment Programme]]''' &lt;ref name="UNEP 2010"/&gt; aim is "to provide leadership and  encourage partnership in caring for the  environment by inspiring,  informing, and enabling nations and peoples to  improve their quality of  life without compromising that of future  generations.

==Environmental management in legislation==
Ecological resilience and the thresholds by which resilience is defined are closely interrelated in the way that they influence environmental policy-making, legislation and subsequently environmental management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of environmental impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem resilience, some levels of environmental impact associated with development are made permissible by environmental policy-making and ensuing legislation.

Some examples of the consideration of ecosystem resilience within legislation include:
*''[[Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979]]'' (NSW) &lt;ref name="EPA Act 1979"/&gt; &amp;ndash; A key goal of the Environmental Assessment procedure is to determine whether proposed development will have a significant impact upon ecosystems.
*''[[Protection of the Environment (Operations) Act 1997]]'' (NSW) &lt;ref name="POEO Act 1997"/&gt; &amp;ndash; Pollution control is dependent upon keeping levels of pollutants emitted by industrial and other human activities below levels which would be harmful to the environment and its ecosystems. Environmental protection licenses are administered to maintain the environmental objectives of the POEO Act and breaches of license conditions can attract heavy penalties and in some cases criminal convictions.&lt;ref name="DECCW 2010 1"/&gt;
*''[[Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995]]'' (NSW) &lt;ref name="TSC Act 1995"/&gt; &amp;ndash; This Act seeks to protect threatened species while balancing it with development.

The '''Ethics in Government Act of 1978''' is a [[United States]] [[federal law]] that was passed in the wake of the Nixon [[Watergate scandal]] and the [[Saturday Night Massacre]]. It created mandatory, public disclosure of financial and employment history of public officials and their immediate families. It also created restrictions on [[lobbying]] efforts by public officials for a set period after leaving public office. Last, it created the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|U.S. Office of Independent Counsel]], tasked with investigating government officials.

==Title I==
Title I requires those in the public service sector to fill out financial disclosure forms which include the sources and amounts of income, gifts, reimbursements, the identity and approximate value of property held and liabilities owed, transactions in property, commodities, and securities, and certain financial interests of a spouse or dependent.

The report must then be filed to the appropriate state officer of his or her state, and the committee charged with issues of ethics in his or her respective house of Congress. The [[President of the United States|President]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], counsel appointed to the [[United States Department of Justice]], and nominees to positions that require [[United States Senate]] confirmation must file with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics.

People that must file reports include, but are not limited to: the President, Vice President, employees and officers of the [[Executive Branch]], [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], the Deputy Postmaster General, each Governor of the Board of Governors of the [[U.S. Postal Service]] and each officer or employee of the [[United States Postal Service]] or [[Postal Regulatory Commission]].

Disclosure must also be made available to the public shortly after they are submitted.

The [[Attorney General of the United States]] can bring charges against anyone who falsifies information in the reports.

==Title II==
Vote to repeal took place in 1989, and took effect January 1, 1991. This title originally governed financial disclosure by executive branch officials, but disclosure rules for all three branches were later consolidated into the first title.

==Title III==
Vote to repeal took place in 1989, and took effect January 1, 1991. This title originally governed financial disclosure by judicial branch officials, but disclosure rules for all three branches were later consolidated into the first title.

==Title IV==
Title IV created the [[Office of Government Ethics]]. The Office of Government Ethics' director is appointed by the President, and approved by the Senate. He or she is charged with providing direction on Executive Branch policies of disclosure, and collaborates with the Attorney General in investigations of ethics violations.

==Title V==
Title V restricts outside employment on people making above $120,000 a year with adjustment for location as of 2011. He or she cannot be employed by an "entity which provides professional services involving a fiduciary relationship", have his or her name used by that entity, work on the board of that entity, or teach without prior authorization by the appropriate government ethics department or figure.

It increased length of prohibition of lobbying work in front of the agency that he or she was employed by from one to two years.

Finally, it allows for judges to teach when not on active duty.

==Title VI==
Title VI amended Title 28 of the U.S. Code.  Title VI of The Act expired on June 30, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Independent Counsel Law |first=Jim |last=Mokhiber |publisher=[[PBS]] |date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been permanently replaced with Title 28 (CFR), Chapter VI, Part 600. 

It requires the Attorney General to investigate specific allegations of federal offenses by the President, Vice President, individuals at specified salary levels in the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Justice, any Assistant Attorney General, the Director and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, all such specified individuals who held office during the incumbency of the President or during the period the previous President held office, if such preceding President was of the same political party as the incumbent President, and any officer of the principal national campaign committee seeking the election or reelection of the President.

The Attorney General must decide if there is merit to the allegation within 90 days. If so, he or she must have a special prosecutor appointed who has all the power of the Department of Justice office except those specific to the Attorney General. The special prosecutor is chosen through a system wherein the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] appoints a panel of three judges from the [[U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals|Circuit Court of Appeals]], one of which must be from the [[District of Columbia]], who serve three-year terms and choose the special prosecutor. The special prosecutor has the authority to send any information to the [[United States Congress]] that he or she deems relevant and can provide counsel in issues that may call for impeachment of the person under investigation.

The special prosecutor can only be removed by impeachment and conviction by congress, or by the Attorney General for "substantial improprieties" or a physical or mental condition that affects performance.

The Department of Justice is required to suspend all investigations within the realm of the special prosecutor.

The Attorney General has the authority to declare anyone disqualified from participating in an investigation because of conflict of interest.

==Criticism==
{{Weasel|section|date=February 2017}}
Justice Antonin Scalia provided critiques of the Act, based on both Constitutional law and the potential for harm in practice, in his dissenting opinion in the case ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]''. Justice [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], a judicial conservative, noted that the [[U.S. Constitution]] granted consolidated power to enforce the law exclusively to the Executive Branch. The Act extended the power to initiate criminal investigation to the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the Senate, which Scalia viewed as a violation of the [[separation of powers]]. He believed that the House of Representatives' investigation through the use of a special prosecutor "[arose] out of a bitter power dispute between the President and the Legislative Branch".

Even some Congressmen who had voted for the Act criticized it privately, leading to speculation that "if it had been an anonymous vote, it would have been voted down two-to-one".&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1977/08/22/1977_08_22_070_TNY_CARDS_000317179|title=A Reporter at Large|last=Drew|first=Elizabeth|date=August 22, 1977|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill's most controversial feature among Congressmen was its limit on outside income, which could be no more than 15 percent of his public service income. This restriction applied only to "earned" income, while excluding investment income from stocks or bonds. About a half-dozen members of the House of Representatives reportedly would not speak to the Speaker of the House, [[Tip O'Neill]], because he pushed the Act through. Their claim was that the Act favored people with "unearned" wealth, people who already had it, over people with "earned" additional income, usually with a law practice on the side. Democratic Representative [[David R. Bowen]] of [[Mississippi]] called the ethics climate of the time a "witch-hunt".&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt;

Specific provisions of the Act have faced criticism as either too weak or too strong. The Special Prosecutor created by Title VI was empowered to pursue investigations with minimal evidence, and was required to pursue any accusation that the District Attorney could not disprove. It allowed for legal harassment of political opponents, even in cases that prosecutors stated they would have dropped in any other federal court.&lt;ref&gt;Eastland&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans{{Which|date=February 2017}} complained of abuse by Democrats during the Supreme Court case of ''Morrison v. Olson'', and Democrats later complained that Kenneth Starr's three and a half year investigation of President [[Bill Clinton]] in the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]] was motivated by partisanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenhouse |first=Linda |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/weekinreview/blank-check-ethics-in-government-the-price-of-good-intentions.html?scp=7&amp;sq=ethics%20in%20government%20act&amp;st=nyt |title=Blank Check; Ethics in Government: The Price of Good Intentions |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 1, 1998 |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Government Ethics created by Title IV has been criticized on the grounds that its limited budget, leadership and prestige are inadequate for the Office to function effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll 437&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics complain that public disclosure involves a violation of privacy which may deter good people from public service.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll 439&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; alternatively '''aetiology''' or '''ætiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiología'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitía'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logía]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|etiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==
{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}
In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Origin myth}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

'''Frame semantics''' is a theory of [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]] that extends his earlier [[case grammar]]. It relates [[natural language|linguistic]] [[semantics]] to encyclopedic knowledge.
The basic idea is that one cannot understand the meaning of a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one would not be able to understand the word "sell" without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between the money and the goods, the relations between the seller and the goods and the money, the relation between the buyer and the goods and the money and so on.

Thus, a word activates, or evokes, a frame of semantic knowledge relating to the specific concept to which it refers (or highlights, in frame semantic terminology).

A '''semantic frame''' is a collection of facts that specify "characteristic features, attributes, and functions of a denotatum, and its characteristic interactions with things necessarily or typically associated with it." &lt;ref&gt;Keith Alan (2001, p. 251), Natural Language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A semantic frame can also be defined as a [[Coherentism|coherent structure]] of related concepts that are related such that without knowledge of all of them, one does not have complete knowledge of any one; they are in that sense types of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]&lt;ref&gt; needed &lt;/ref&gt;. Frames are based on recurring experiences. So the commercial transaction frame is based on recurring experiences of commercial transactions.

Words not only highlight individual concepts, but also specify a certain perspective from which the frame is viewed. For example "sell" views the situation from the perspective of the seller and "buy" from the perspective of the buyer. This, according to Fillmore, explains the observed asymmetries in many [[lexical semantics|lexical relations]].

While originally only being applied to [[lexeme]]s, frame semantics has now been expanded to [[grammatical construction]]s and other larger and more complex linguistic units and has more or less been integrated into [[construction grammar]] as the main semantic principle. Semantic frames are also becoming used in [[information model]]ing, for example in [[Gellish]], especially in the form of 'definition models' and 'knowledge models'.

Frame semantics has much in common with the semantic principle of profiling from [[Ronald Langacker|Ronald W. Langacker]]'s [[Cognitive Grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cruse (2004, p. 137f.), Meaning in Language. An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics. Second Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-19-926306-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fruit of the Holy Spirit''' is a biblical term that sums up nine attributes of a person or community living in accord with the [[Holy Spirit]], according to chapter 5 of the [[Epistle to the Galatians]]: "But the fruit of the Spirit is [[love]], [[joy]], [[peace]], [[forbearance|patience]], [[kindness]], [[Good and evil|goodness]], [[faithfulness]], [[gentleness]], and [[self-control]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Galatians|5:22-23|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit is contrasted with the [[Galatians 5#Verses 19–21: Works of the Flesh|works of the flesh]] which immediately precede it in this chapter.

Catholic tradition follows the [[Vulgate]] version of Galatians in listing 12 fruits: charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity (kindness), goodness, longanimity (generosity), mildness (gentleness), faith, modesty, continency (self-control), and chastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Galatians|5:22-23|VULGATE}}: ''Fructus autem Spiritus est caritas, gaudium, pax, patientia, benignitas, bonitas, longanimitas, mansuetudo, fides, modestia, continentia, castitas. Adversus hujusmodi non est lex.''&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his work ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=F. L. |editor-last1=Cross |editor-first2=E. A. |editor-last2=Livingstone |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |date=1998 |isbn=0-19-211655-X |page=644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Commentary==
[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] pointed  that numbered among the fruits of the Holy Spirit are certain virtues, such as charity, meekness, faith, and chastity.&lt;ref name=Aquinas&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2070.htm Thomas Aquinas. ''Summa Theologica'', Second and Revised Edition, Fathers of the English Dominican Province, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] defined virtue as "a good habit consonant with our nature." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm Waldron, Martin Augustine. "Virtue." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 5 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Though traditionally discussed as nine attributes of the Fruit of the Spirit, the original Greek term translated as "fruit" is singular. Aquinas explained, "Consequently fruit is mentioned there in the singular, on account of its being generically one, though divided into many species which are spoken of as so many fruits."&lt;ref name=Aquinas/&gt; Augustine's commentary on Galatians 5:25-26, says, "the Apostle had no intention of teaching us how many [either [[Galatians 5#Verses 19–21: Works of the Flesh|works of the flesh]], or fruits of the Spirit] there are; but to show how the former should be avoided, and the latter sought after."&lt;ref name=Aquinas/&gt;

==Love (Greek: ''agape'', Latin: ''caritas'')==
{{Main|Agape}}
''Agape'' (love) denotes an undefeatable benevolence and unconquerable goodwill that always seeks the highest in others, no matter their behavior. It is a  love that gives freely without asking anything in return, and does not consider the worth of its object.  ''Agape'' is more a love by choice than ''philos,'' which is love by chance; and it refers to the will rather than the emotion.  ''Agape'' describes the unconditional love God has for the world. Paul describes love in 1 Corinthians 13:4–8:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from the [[New International Version]]: {{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians |13:4–8|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.}}

According to Strong's Greek Lexicon, the word ἀγάπη [G26] (Transliteration: agapē) means love, i.e. affection or benevolence; specially (plural) a love-feast:—(feast of) charity(-ably), dear, love.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G26]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pronunciation: ag-ah'-pay 
* Part of Speech: feminine noun
* Root Word (Etymology): From ἀγαπάω (G25)

Outline of Biblical Usage:
# affection, good will, love, benevolence, brotherly love
# love feasts
	
The Greek word ἀγάπη (agapē) occurs 117 times in 106 verses in the Greek concordance of the NASB.

==Joy (Greek: ''chara'', Latin: ''gaudium'')==
The joy referred to here is deeper than mere happiness, is rooted in God and comes from Him. Since it comes from God, it is more serene and stable than worldly happiness, which is merely emotional and lasts only for a time.

According to Strong's Greek Lexicon, the Greek word listed in the verse is χαρά (G5479), meaning 'joy', 'gladness', or 'a source of joy'. The Greek χαρά (chara) occurs 59 times in 57 verses in the Greek concordance of the NASB.
* Original Word: χαρά, ᾶς, ἡ  From χαίρω (G5463)
* Part of Speech: Noun, Feminine
* Transliteration: chara
* Phonetic Spelling: (khar-ah')

Joy (Noun and Verb), Joyfulness, Joyfully, Joyous:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"joy, delight" (akin to chairo, "to rejoice"), is found frequently in Matthew and Luke, and especially in John, once in Mark (Mar 4:16, RV, "joy," AV, "gladness"); it is absent from 1 Cor. (though the verb is used three times), but is frequent in 2 Cor., where the noun is used five times (for 2Cr 7:4, RV, see Note below), and the verb eight times, suggestive of the Apostle's relief in comparison with the circumstances of the 1st Epistle; in Col 1:11, AV, "joyfulness," RV, "joy." The word is sometimes used, by metonymy, of the occasion or cause of "joy," Luk 2:10 (lit., "I announce to you a great joy"); in 2Cr 1:15, in some mss., for charis, "benefit;" Phl 4:1, where the readers are called the Apostle's "joy;" so 1Th 2:19, 20; Hbr 12:2, of the object of Christ's "joy;" Jam 1:2, where it is connected with falling into trials; perhaps also in Mat 25:21, 23, where some regard it as signifying, concretely, the circumstances attending cooperation in the authority of the Lord.

Note: In Hbr 12:11, "joyous" represents the phrase meta, "with," followed by chara, lit., "with joy." So in Hbr 10:34, "joyfully;" in 2Cr 7:4 the noun is used with the Middle Voice of huperperisseuo, "to abound more exceedingly," and translated "(I overflow) with joy," RV (AV, "I am exceeding joyful").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G5479]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Peace (Greek: ''eirene'', Latin: ''pax'')==
The Greek word εἰρήνη (Strong's G1515)(eirēnē)(transliteration: i-ray'-nay), probably derived from a primary verb εἴρω eírō (to join), means peace (literally or figuratively); by implication, prosperity:—one, peace, quietness, rest, + set at one again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G1515 (Strong G1515)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The word "peace" comes from the Greek word ''eirene,'' the Greek equivalent for the Hebrew word ''shalom,'' which expresses the idea of ''wholeness, completeness, or tranquility in the soul that is unaffected by the outward circumstances or pressures.''  The word ''eirene'' strongly suggests the rule of order in place of chaos.''&lt;ref&gt;Renner, Rick. ''Sparkling Gems from the Greek.'', Teach All Nations, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9725454-7-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Greek εἰρήνη (eirēnē) occurs 92 times in 86 verses in the Greek concordance of the KJV. The KJV translates Strong's G1515 in the following manner: peace (89x), one (1x), rest (1x), quietness (1x). The outline of Biblical usage is as follows:
# a state of national tranquillity
## exemption from the rage and havoc of war
# peace between individuals, i.e. harmony, concord
# security, safety, prosperity, felicity, (because peace and harmony make and keep things safe and prosperous)
# of the Messiah's peace
## the way that leads to peace (salvation)
# of Christianity, the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and content with its earthly lot, of whatsoever sort that is
# the blessed state of devout and upright men after death

Jesus is described as the Prince of Peace, who brings peace to the hearts of those who desire it.  He says in John 14:27:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:27;&amp;version=KJV John 14:27]&lt;/ref&gt; "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid". In Matthew 5:9 he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:7;&amp;version=KJV Matthew 5:7]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patience (Greek: ''makrothumia'', Latin: ''longanimitas'')==

Generally the Greek world applied this word to a man who could avenge himself but did not. This word is often used in the Greek Scriptures in reference to God and his attitude to man.&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;[http://blog.adw.org/2013/01/a-brief-treatise-on-the-fruits-of-the-holy-spirit/ Pope, Charles. "A Brief Treatise on the Fruits of the Holy Spirit", Archdiocese of Washington, January 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Exodus 34:6 describes the Lord as "slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity."

[[Patience]], which in some translations is "longsuffering" or "endurance", is defined in Strong's by two Greek words, ''makrothumia'' and ''hupomone.''&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first, pronounced (mak-roth-oo-''mee''-ah) comes from ''makros'', "long", and ''thumos,'' "temper".  The word denotes lenience, forbearance, fortitude, patient endurance, longsuffering.  Also included in ''makrothumia'' is the ability to endure persecution and ill-treatment.  It describes a person who has the power to exercise revenge but instead exercises restraint. (Strong's #3115)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The latter, hupomone, (hoop-om-on-''ay'') is translated "endurance": Constancy, perseverance, continuance, bearing up, steadfastness, holding out, patient endurance.  The word combines ''hupo,'' "under", and ''mone,'' "to remain".  It describes the capacity to continue to bear up under difficult circumstances, not with a passive complacency, but with a hopeful fortitude that actively resists weariness and defeat, (Strong's #5281) with hupomone (Greek ὑπομονή) being further understood as that which would be "as opposed to cowardice or despondency"&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/3115.htm] Thayer's Greek Lexicon - STRONGS NT 3115: μακροθυμία&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"With lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%204:2;&amp;version=NKJV Eph4:2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kindness (Greek: ''chrestotes'', Latin: ''benignitas'')==

In Greek, old wine was called "chrestos" which meant that it was mellow or smooth.&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt; Christ used this word in Matthew 11:30, "For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."

In contrast, kindness is acting for the good of people regardless of what they do, properly, "useable, i.e. well-fit for use (for what is really needed); kindness that is also serviceable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/5544.htm] Strong's Greek Concordance 5544. chréstotés&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Strong's ''#5544:'' Kindness is goodness in action, sweetness of disposition, gentleness in dealing with others, benevolence, kindness, affability.  The word describes ''the ability to act for the welfare of those taxing your patience.''  The Holy Spirit removes abrasive qualities from the character of one under His control. (emphasis added)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word kindness comes from the Greek word ''chrestotes'' (khray-''stot''-ace), which meant to show kindness or to be friendly to others and often depicted rulers, governors, or people who were kind, mild, and benevolent to their subjects.  Anyone who demonstrated this quality of ''chrestotes'' was considered to be compassionate, considerate, sympathetic, humane, kind, or gentle.  The apostle Paul uses this word to depict God's incomprehensible kindness for people who are unsaved (see Romans 11:22;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2011:22;&amp;version=NKJV Romans 11:22]&lt;/ref&gt; Ephesians 2:7;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:7;&amp;version=NKJV Ephesians 2:7]&lt;/ref&gt; Titus 3:4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%203:4;&amp;version=NKJV Titus 3:4]&lt;/ref&gt;).

One scholar has noted that when the word ''chrestotes'' is applied to interpersonal relationships, it conveys the idea of being adaptable to others.  Rather than harshly require everyone else to adapt to his own needs and desires, when  ''chrestotes'' is working in a believer, he seeks to become adaptable to the needs of those who are around him.  (''Sparkling Gems from the Greek'', Rick Renner)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kindness is doing something and not expecting anything in return. Kindness is respect and helping others without waiting for someone to help one back. It implies kindness no matter what. We should live "in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Cor%206:6-7;&amp;version=NKJV 2Cor 6:6-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goodness (Greek: ''agathosune'', Latin: ''bonitas'')==
#The state or quality of being good
#Moral excellence; virtue;
#Kindly feeling, kindness, generosity,joy in being good
#The best part of anything; Essence; Strength;
#General character recognized in quality or conduct.

Popular English Bibles (e.g. NIV, NASB, NLT) translate the single Greek word ''chrestotes'' into two English words: kindness and goodness. "Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Thes%201:11;&amp;version=NKJV 2 Thessalonians 1:11 ]&lt;/ref&gt; "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%205:9;&amp;version=NKJV Ephesians 5:9]&lt;/ref&gt; with agathosune being "found only in Biblical and ecclesiastical writings, uprightness of heart and life"&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/19.htm] Strong's Greek Concordance 19. agathosune&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faithfulness (Greek: ''pistis'', Latin: ''fides'')==

The root of pistis&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/4102.htm] Strong's Greek Concordance 4102. pistis&lt;/ref&gt; ("faith") is peithô&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/3982.htm] Strong's Greek Concordance 3982. peithó&lt;/ref&gt; that is to persuade or be persuaded which supplies the core-meaning of faith as being "divine persuasion", received from God, and never generated by man. It is defined as the following: objectively, trustworthy; subjectively, trustful:—believe(-ing, -r), faithful(-ly), sure, true.&lt;ref name="blueletterbible.org"&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4103]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Greek: πιστός 
* Transliteration: pistos   
* Pronunciation: pē-sto's   
* Part of Speech: adjective   
* Root Word (Etymology): From πείθω

The Greek πιστός (pistos) occurs 67 times in 62 verses in the Greek concordance of the KJV: faithful (53x), believe (6x), believing (2x), true (2x), faithfully (1x), believer (1x), sure (1x).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Outline of Biblical Usage&lt;ref name="blueletterbible.org"/&gt;

* trusty, faithful 
** of persons who show themselves faithful in the transaction of business, the execution of commands, or the discharge of official duties 
** one who kept his plighted faith, worthy of trust 
** that can be relied on 
* easily persuaded 
** believing, confiding, trusting 
** in the NT one who trusts in God's promises 
** one who is convinced that Jesus has been raised from the dead 
** one who has become convinced that Jesus is the Messiah and author of salvation&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2025:1;&amp;version=NKJV Isaiah 25:1]&lt;/ref&gt; "I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith".{{Bibleref2c|Eph|3:16-17}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The writer of the [[Letter to the Hebrews]] describes it this way: "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2012:2;&amp;version=NKJV Heb 12:2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Gentleness (Greek: ''prautes'', Latin: ''modestia'')==

[[Gentleness]], in the Greek, ''prautes'', commonly known as meekness, which is "a ''divinely-balanced'' virtue that can only operate through faith (cf. {{bibleref2c|1 Tim|6:11}}; {{Bibleref2c|2 Tim|2:22-25}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/4240.htm] Strong's Greek Concordance 4240. prautés: gentleness&lt;/ref&gt;
. The ''New Spirit Filled Life Bible'' defines gentleness as &lt;blockquote&gt;"a disposition that is even-tempered, tranquil, balanced in spirit, unpretentious, and that has the passions under control. The word is best translated 'meekness,' not as an indication of weakness, but of power and strength under control. The person who possesses this quality pardons injuries, corrects faults, and rules his own spirit well".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	 	
"Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted".{{Bibleref2c|Gal|6:1}}
	 	
"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love".{{Bibleref2c|Eph|4:2}}

==Self-control (Greek: ''egkrateia'', Latin: ''continentia'')==

The Greek word used in Galatians 5:23 is "egkrateia", meaning "strong, having mastery, able to control one's thoughts and actions."&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rzp2N6kQOH4C&amp;pg=PT146&amp;dq=fruit+of+the+holy+spirit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sTFJVazFEo_5yQSS5oFA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=fruit%20of%20the%20holy%20spirit&amp;f=false Graham, Billy. "The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in Your Life", Thomas Nelson Inc, 2011] {{ISBN|9781418515690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"...make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love".{{Bibleref2c|2Peter|1:5-7|TNIV|2 Pet 1:5-7}}

'''Georges Hostelet''' (1875 – 1960) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] chemist, sociologist, mathematician, and philosopher. He was born in the municipality of [[Chimay]] in 1875. He attended the Royal Military Academy, and reached the rank of lieutenant. In 1897, he left the academy and enrolled in the University of Liège, where he received his doctorate in 1905. two years later, Hostelet began work with the [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay &amp; Cie]] Company as a chemical engineer and worked closely with Ernest Solvay. In 1911, he attended the [[Solvay Conference#First Conference|First Solvay Conference]], eventually becoming its last surviving participant.

Years later, Hostelet became opposed to the First World War. During the war, he worked alongside English nurse [[Edith Cavell]] and was imprisoned by the occupying German forces, later being released in 1917. In 1919, he accepted an offer from Solvay to become co-Director of the Solvay Institute of Sociology; a position he held until he left in 1922 when Solvay died. Hostelet left Belgium in 1925 as part of a Franco-Belgian mission to teach social sciences at the University of Cairo. He returned in 1931 and was appointed as a member of the International Statistical Institute in the Hague the following year. He continued teaching at the University of Antwerp until he retired in 1947. He died in 1960.

'''Margarita Ammann Martínez''', better known as '''Gretel Ammann''' (17 January 1947 in [[San Sebastián|Donostia]] – 2 May 2000 in [[Barcelona]]) was a Spanish philosopher, essayist, activist, radical feminist, and lesbian separatist. She was a pioneer of feminism in Barcelona.

== Early years and education ==
Margarita Ammann Martínez was born in Donostia. Her mother was Basque and her father was Austrian, a fugitive from Nazi Germany. When she was two years old, the family moved to Barcelona, the city where she lived the rest of her life. Since childhood, she was trained in different artistic disciplines, in writing, drawing, photography and music. Her baccalaureate and  elementary school studies occurred at the German school in Barcelona, where she created her first magazine, which was very critical of the school's policy, leading her to being asked to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gretel Ammann|url=http://www.caladona.org/centredocumentacio/gretel/biografia/biografia.html|website=www.caladona.org|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammann studied philosophy and literature at the  [[University of Barcelona]], University of Barcelona. In the first year, she organized a public reading of poems in which she  participated with her poetry and accompanying the recital on guitar with music composed by her. She also creates a student magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desconocidas y Fascinantes: Gretel Ammann con Isabel Franc y Dolors Majoral.|url=https://www.ivoox.com/desconocidas-fascinantes-gretel-ammann-isabel-franc-audios-mp3_rf_1266965_1.html|website=iVoox|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Ammann went to Paris for a year, where she studied at the [[Sorbonne]] and learned French. She found it easy to learn other languages, and spoke five of them correctly. After returning to Barcelona, she worked in various schools and academies before entering the ''Escola Tramuntana'', Escola Tramuntana in [[El Carmel]].

==Career==
=== Activist ===
Ammann's involvement with working families led her to settle in the same neighborhood where she worked, El Carmel, and to get involved in the neighborhood demands and those of the school.&lt;ref name="elperiodico.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Edición del Domingo 16 de Enero de 1983|url=http://archivo.elperiodico.com/ed/19830116/pag_017.html|accessdate=1 November 2017|work=archivo.elperiodico.com|agency=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=16 January 1983|pages=17|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working in a clandestine manner in different militant parties and collectives, in 1976, Ammann joined the 
[[Communist Movement of Catalonia]], which was [[Trotskyism]]-leaning. She was a committed and restless woman, who actively participated in movements in favor of peace and disarmament, ecology and human rights. She was, above all, an activist in the [[Feminism|movimiento feminista]] and a defender of women's rights. She was a leader in lesbian issues in Catalonia and in the rest of the Spain.

=== Feminist ===
A multifaceted woman with a lot of energy, during all her life she combined militancy and activism with her artistic side. From a very young age, she participated in the creation and promotion of women's groups and publications, most of them financed with her own money. In 1976, she participated in the first Jornadas Catalanas de la Mujer.&lt;ref name="Amiguet2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amiguet|first1=Teresa|title=I Jornades de la Dona Catalana|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/hemeroteca/20110527/54161600184/i-jornades-de-la-dona-catalana.html|accessdate=1 November 2017|work=La Vanguardia|date=27 May 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, she created the first musical group of women. In the following year, she presented her work "Feminism of Difference" at the 2nd Jornadas Estatales sobre la Mujer en Granada,&lt;ref name="Prades1979"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prades|first1=Joaquina|title=La sexualidad y la lucha de clases, temas clave en las jornadas feministas de Granada|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1979/12/13/espana/313887623_850215.html|accessdate=1 November 2017|work=EL PAÍS|agency=Ediciones El País|date=13 December 1979|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caladona.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sobre los conceptos utilizados en el feminismo|url=http://www.caladona.org/centredocumentacio/gretel/biografia/diferencia.pdf|website=caladona.org|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a starting point for the long discussion of feminism throughout the Spanish state that would take place in the following years.

In 1980, with three friends, Ammann opened the first Casa de la Dona on Cardenal Casanyes Street in Barcelona. This was the beginning of an intense feminist militancy. Ideologically, she defined herself as a [[Radical feminism|feminista radical]] y [[Separatist feminism|lesbiana separatista]].{{sfn|Elejabeitia|1987|p=6}} She translated and published the SCUM de Valerie Solanas manifesto, and participated in the Spanish version of the book "Our bodies, our lives" of the Boston women's collective (ed. Icaria). In 1981, she created "Amazonas" magazine, an exclusive publication of lesbian creation, and participated in the first television program on lesbianism broadcast by a public television for the entire country.

In 1984, Ammann founded the Center for Women's Studies "El Centro",&lt;ref name="www.caladona.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Centro de Estudio de la Mujer / Centre d'Estudis de la Dona8-034-7|url=http://www.caladona.org/centredocumentacio/gretel/biografia/centroem.pdf|website=caladona.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit association from which various entities and projects would emerge. Her most fruitful stage was developed in this space, participating and creating different initiatives of women, such as the Assembly of Independent Feminists of Barcelona, the Cultural Association of Women "La Nostra Illa", ''Gram Teatro de mujeres'', the first feminist summer school, and the "Amazonas" network that organized the First Lesbian Week in Barcelona in 1987, with European participation.

== Work ==
In 1989, Ammann created the magazine ''Laberint'', whose heading stated: "This magazine aims to open a debate from Radical Feminism and Separatist Lesbianism. For this, we contribute reflections, discussion, creations and information". There were 36 issues published, the last of them in 1999. Ammann intervened on behalf of all the demands of women's spaces, such as Ca la dona and the Francesca Bonmaison Women's Culture Center, as well as in the establishment of the Feminist Network of Catalonia. Most of Ammann's work was developed in conference, meetings, journals, and assemblies, and was not been published, or was published in what is called [[Grey literature|Literatura gris]], which does not use the usual channels of production and distribution. Upon her death in 2000, the Feminist Network published a compilation book of some of his texts, with the title "Escritos". Her file of feminist documentation was donated to the Documentation Center of Ca la Dona, by her companion of the last 18 years, Dolors Majoral.&lt;ref name="www.caladona.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caladona.org" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Heirin-ji'''|平林寺}} is a [[Rinzai]] temple of the [[Myoshin-ji]] branch located in [[Niiza, Saitama|Niiza city]], [[Saitama prefecture]], [[Japan]], a city just outside [[Tokyo]].

==History==
The temple was founded in [[Iwatsuki, Saitama]] in 1375 by Sekishitsu Zenkyū, who had served as the Abbot of [[Engaku-ji]], [[Tenryū-ji]] and [[Shōfuku-ji (Fukuoka)|Shōfuku-ji]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kotobank.jp/word/石室善玖&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the original temple was destroyed in 1590 during an attack on [[Iwatsuki Castle]] by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. 

It was rebuilt in 1603 by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and moved to Niiza city sixty years later. The temple grounds are situated in a [[forest]]ed area and is considered to be a national monument. Heirin-ji differs from other temples in the Tokyo area by having no temple markets nor public festivals held at the temple. 

The temple remains a training temple for monks, who can often be seen working in the grounds. The grounds of the temple preserve a stretch of the [[Musashino Terrace|Musashino]] woodlands. Animals such as [[raccoon dog]]s that are now not often seen in the city are found around the temple. The grounds also provide a roost for a large murder of [[Jungle Crow|Japanese crows]]. The gardens are notable for the [[maple tree]]s in autumn and the ''[[ume]]'' blossoms in early spring. The bell, with the ''ume'' blossom, was the inspiration for one of [[Toshi Yoshida]]'s wood block prints.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe, 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonagh&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henric Sanielevici''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈhenrik saniˈelevit͡ʃʲ}}, first name also '''Henri''', '''Henry''' or '''Enric''', last name also '''Sanielevich'''; September 21, 1875 – February 19, 1951) was a [[Romania]]n journalist and literary critic, also remembered for his work in [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], [[sociology]] and [[zoology]]. Initially a militant [[Socialism|socialist]] from the political-philosophical circle of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], he incorporated other influences and, in 1905, created his own literary review, ''Curentul Nou'' ("The New Trend"). Sanielevici and his friend [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] were among the founders of "[[Poporanism]]", a peasant-oriented and [[left-wing]] movement. However, Sanielevici soon detached himself from both [[Marxism]] and [[Agrarianism]], criticizing Romanian traditionalist literature, and prophesying a [[Neoclassicism]] for the working men. His heated polemic with the rival school of ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' journal isolated him from the other Poporanists, whom he eventually denounced as "[[Reactionary|reactionaries]]". More controversy surrounded his ambiguous attitudes during [[World War I]].

From 1920, Sanielevici was an isolated figure on the left, editing a new version of ''Curentul Nou'' and only affiliating with the popular daily ''[[Adevărul]]''. He moved away from literary theory and, following his anthropological speculations, revived [[Lamarckism]] and [[scientific racism]] to formulate his own racial-sociological system. Himself a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]], Sanielevici attempted to undermine the racial assumptions of [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologists and local [[Fascism|fascists]], but his own interpretations of natural history were universally ridiculed. Sanielevici placed [[human nutrition]] and [[mastication]] at the core of racial distinctions, and went on to stratify artistic temperaments into racial clusters.

The author faded into obscurity by the 1940s, when his work was vilified by the governing fascists, then expunged by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. His tracts were revisited with more sympathy after the 1960s, but reviewers generally describe Sanielevici as an eccentric and discountable contributor to [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Sanielevici was a native of [[Botoşani]] city, in the [[Romanian historical regions|historical region]] of [[Moldavia]]. His father, officially known as ''Leon Sanilevici'', was a trader, and his mother, Rebeca, a housewife.&lt;ref name="gc642"&gt;Călinescu, p.642&lt;/ref&gt; Both branches descended from prominent Jewish community leaders—Leon's father was a [[Rabbi]] of [[Craiova]] Jews, in southern Romania, while Rebeca was the daughter of Botoşani's own Rabbi—whose ancestors had settled in the [[Danubian Principalities]] to escape [[pogrom]]s in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; Almost all of Leon's other children grew up to become distinguished artists and intellectuals: [[Simion Sanielevici|Simion]], Jacques and Maximilian were mathematicians; [[Solomon Sanielevici|Solomon]] a painter; [[Iosif Sanielevici|Iosif]] an economist; Emil a zoologist.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.642-643. See also Georgescu-Roegen, p.5, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The family, whom literary historian [[George Călinescu]] describes as "utterly [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]]" into [[Romanian culture]],&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; was not in fact [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated]]: like most Romanian Jews of that era, Sanielevici was not granted citizenship at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2005), p.25; (2006), p.57-58&lt;/ref&gt; Although a self-declared [[Atheism|atheist]],&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Jicu, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=586&amp;editie=31 "H. Sanielevici, par lui même"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 30/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"&gt;Henric Sanielevici, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_new-critical-studies-1920.html "New Critical Studies, 1920. The programmatic article of ''The New Trend'', 1906 (excerpts)"], in ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}'', Nr. 29/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici later recommended the voluntary [[Christianization|mass baptism]] of Jews.&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; He grew up in a cosmopolitan neighborhood, alongside [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]];&lt;ref name="cmlabelle"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristina Manuk, [http://193.26.10.83/pdf/Ararat%2001%202009.pdf "Cu Henric Sanielevici în 'La Belle Époque': printre armeni, pe uliţa copilăriei..."], in ''[http://193.26.10.83/ Ararat. Publicaţia Uniunii Armenilor din România]'', Nr. 1/2009, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; the unfamiliar suffix ''-ici'', chosen by Henric's ancestors, misled some into believing that the family was of [[Serbs in Romania|Serb]] origin.&lt;ref name="ah1202"&gt;Hodoş, p.1202&lt;/ref&gt;

Henric spent most of his childhood between Botoşani and various rural localities in Moldavia, among them [[Răchiţi|Costeşti]], [[Dolhasca]] and [[Drăguşeni, Botoşani|Podriga]].&lt;ref name="gc641"&gt;Călinescu, p.641&lt;/ref&gt; The countryside, he was to recall in writing, shaped his vision of human nutrition as the source of physical and cultural differences: "Everywhere there were orchards, one to every homestead, and often with select fruit. [...] Fruit was falling on the ground in piles, without anyone even bothering to turn it into cider, at least. Countryside attics were full of huge piles, white and greenish, of peaches the size of apples [...]. Until fifteen years of age, I can only recall images of myself eating fruit all day long".&lt;ref name="gc641-642"&gt;Călinescu, p.641-642&lt;/ref&gt; The setting also inspired his naturalistic observations on poultry (he described Moldavian hens as particularly slender and prone to wade in still water), on wild birds, and even on spiders.&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt;

While he was still a student in Botoşani, the young man made his debut in the socialist press, founding and editing his own newspaper, the short-lived ''[[Proletarul (1892)|Proletarul]]''.&lt;ref name="hsunifi"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1003.html "Henric Sanielevici"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved May 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated high school in his home town, and took a degree in Letters and Philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt;

Henric Sanielevici is in the fourth row, third from the right; on his sides are poet [[Ion Păun-Pincio]] (right) and journalist [[Henric Streitman]]. [[Simion Sanielevici]] is same row, seventh from the right]]
Together with Simion, who was [[Politehnica University of Bucharest|Technical University]] student, he attended the [[Marxism|Marxist]] society of [[Bucharest]]'s Sotir Hall, led by [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], and joined the militant [[Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR).&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Kiriţescu]], "''O viaţă, o lume, o epocă'': Ani de ucenicie în mişcarea socialistă", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1977, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Especially after the PSDMR's creation, Henric gave weekly public lectures for the workers at Sotir, where he was known under the pseudonym ''Hasan''.&lt;ref&gt;I. Felea, "Din vremea cînd socialismul făcea primii paşi la 'Sotir' ", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', March 1968, p.5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The two brothers were contributors to ''[[Adevărul]]'', at the time a socialist daily edited by Gherea's pupil [[Constantin Mille]], and, around 1896, were also writing for its short-lived literary supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florentina Tone, [http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/scriitorii-de-la-adev-rul.html "Scriitorii de la ''Adevĕrul''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427072852/http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/scriitorii-de-la-adev-rul.html |date=2009-04-27 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Henric's articles were also published in other socialist and [[center-left]] papers: ''[[Lumea Nouă]]'', ''[[Munca]]'', ''Avântul'', and the [[Piteşti]] literary magazine ''Povestea Vorbei''.&lt;ref name="hsunifi"/&gt;

A main focus of Sanielevici's early work as a critic was defending Dobrogeanu-Gherea's [[Marxist literary criticism|Marxist literary theory]] against ''[[Junimea]]'', the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary society. Late in the 20th century, cultural historian [[Z. Ornea]] described how Sanielevici, [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], [[Traian Demetrescu]], [[Anton Bacalbaşa]], [[Emil Fagure]] and other "young socialists" took up the combat when Gherea remained silent, and responded with an "offensive" to the ''Junimist'' jibes.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.357-358&lt;/ref&gt; The leading ''Junimist'' theorist and cultural critic, [[Titu Maiorescu]], issued formal retorts, responding to specific points made by Sanielevici.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.51, 126, 127&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the "young socialist" militant also published articles in the ''Junimea'' magazine, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref name="hsunifi"/&gt; Additionally, he was a leading contributor to, and for a while editorial secretary of,&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2006), p.58, 59, 63&lt;/ref&gt; the eclectic journal ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', run by the ex-''Junimist'' philosopher [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]. It was there that he began a series of articles in defense of [[didacticism]], with which he established his reputation as a cultural journalist.&lt;ref name="el26"&gt;Lovinescu, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; ''Noua Revistă Română'' was also the place where, some years later, Sanielevici met and befriended fellow journalist [[Constantin Beldie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/dezvluirile_lui_constantin_beldie "Dezvăluirile lui Constantin Beldie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 46/2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Sanielevici was in the [[German Empire]], for an [[academic specialization]] in the field of Anthropology at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="aj(10)173"&gt;Jicu (2010), p.173&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, he was in [[Paris]], [[France]], where he spoke at the ''[[Société Anthropologique]]''. The topic of his dissertation challenged contemporary assumptions on [[physical anthropology]], primarily the theories of [[Sweden|Swedish]] physician [[Anton Nyström]]. Sanielevici spoke out against Nyström's belief that [[Cephalic index|"dolichocephalic" people]] were abnormal. Arguing that Nyström stood against "all anthropological data",&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1903), p.594&lt;/ref&gt; the Romanian suggested that the shape of one's skull was determined by [[mastication]]. The ''Société'' as a whole found his interpretation strange and unappealing.&lt;ref name="aj(10)173"/&gt; An influential racial theorist, [[Joseph Deniker]], also rejected the idea, and noted in particular Sanielevici's "strange and false" argument that the only naturally "brachycephalic" skulls were "[[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Joseph Deniker]], [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/psy_0003-5033_1904_num_11_1_3688 "Revue d'antropologie"], in ''[[L'Année Psychologique]]'', Vol. XI, 1904, p.520 (republished by [https://archive.is/20120908132757/http://www.persee.fr/web/support/soon_available ''Persée'' Scientific Journals])&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Curentul Nou'' beginnings===
Back home, Sanielevici found steady employment was as a schoolteacher, and he successively taught [[French language|French]] to high school students in [[Galaţi]], [[Ploieşti]], [[Târgovişte]] and Bucharest.&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; He also expanded on his activity in criticism, with the debut volumes ''Studii critice'' ("Critical Studies", [[Cartea Românească]] publishers, 1902)&lt;ref name="cvcultura145-146"&gt;Ciprian Vălcan, [http://www.uvvg.ro/socpol/docs/socpol_1_2009.pdf "The Romanian Culture: Inferiority Complexes, Modernization, Identity Problems"], in the [[Vasile Goldiş West University of Arad]] ''Societate şi Politică'', Nr. 1/2009, p.145-146&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Încercări critice'' ("Critical [[Essay]]s", 1903).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1012; Lovinescu, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; His focus was on questioning the established criteria of literary criticism. In particular, Sanielevici focused on the poem ''[[Mioriţa]]'', already recognized as a staple of [[Romanian folklore]], and made sarcastic comments about its subject matter.&lt;ref name="asiubire"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ştefănescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iubire_i_pedeaps "Iubire şi pedeapsă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Together with W. Majerczik, he published a [[German-language]] translation of the novella ''[[Sărmanul Dionis]]'' ("Poor Dionysus"), by Romania's [[national poet]], [[Mihai Eminescu]]. It saw print with the ''[[Bukarester Tagblatt]]'' company, in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} N. N. Muntean, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/7427/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1944_004_007.pdf "Bibliografia literară română în streinătate"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 7/1944, p.251 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Galaţi, Sanielevici made his name as the founder and editor of ''Curentul Nou'', a literary review which appeared from 1905 to 1906. As the PSDMR split into competing factions (1899), he and Garabet Ibrăileanu made some efforts to regroup the scattered socialist clubs around new ideals, with an emphasis on uplifting the peasantry—an ideology that came to be known as "[[Poporanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrăileanu was based in the larger city of [[Iaşi]], but Sanielevici found Galaţi more suitable a location for the Poporanist projects. In his view, Iaşi was home to a decaying Moldavian nobility, state-dependent and nationalistic, while his adoptive home was a "citadel of true democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Nastasă, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/cercet/Nastasa/SuveraniiUniversitatilorI.pdf ''"Suveranii" universităţilor româneşti. Mecanisme de selecţie şi promovare a elitei intelectuale''], Vol. I, [[Editura Limes]], Cluj-Napoca, 2007, p.292. {{ISBN|978-973-726-278-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters to Ibrăileanu, whereby he invited him and Poporanist theorist [[Constantin Stere]] to contribute, Sanielevici acknowledged that his journal was not afraid of radicalism: "I have grown tired of hypocrisy".&lt;ref&gt;Sighidim ''et al.'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

With the ''Curentul Nou'' project, Sanielevici concentrated his polemical stance on the [[right-wing]], [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] and conservative publications of the day, and primarily ridiculed the work of writers at ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' magazine. He candidly informed Ibrăileanu: "We have a grand work to accomplish, a work that will resonate throughout Romanian literary history, the work of bringing down a shameful current that has been clutching the country for these last 5 years".&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt; However, Sanielevici was also a sporadic contributor to the ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'' review, which was founded by historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] as the new version of ''Sămănătorul''.&lt;ref name="hsunifi"/&gt;

[[File:I. Botez, C. Stere, G. Ibraileanu.jpg|thumb|360px|From right: [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], [[Constantin Stere]] and their ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'' colleague Ion Botez, ca. 1905]]
In time, ''Curentul Nou'' identified itself with a new form of traditionalist, peasant-oriented, literature, as advocated by the formerly socialist "Poporanists". As noted by literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the Galaţi paper was a direct predecessor of the leading Poporanist monthly ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', founded at Iaşi in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.26. See also Cernat, p.29-32&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrăileanu approached both Sanielevici and Dobrogeanu-Gherea with offers to head the editorial staff, but both, in turn, refused his invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Iancu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/IANCUoct9.html "Înainte de toate, beletristica de calitate"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the other Poporanists were beginning to protest against the ''Curentul Nou'' branch: publicist Spiridon Popescu, who was Ibrăileanu's companion, threatened to quit if the "insane" Sanielevici and "the Jewish critic" Gherea were ever on board.&lt;ref&gt;Sighidim ''et al.'', p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici only began contributing there in 1908, and, in 1909, was made the editorial secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2006), p.63; Lovinescu, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; He was still mainly active in Galaţi, where, in early 1909, he joined a fundraising drive to complete a statue of Eminescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Letiţia Buruiană, [http://www.bvau.ro/docs/axislibri/AxisLibri4_fr.pdf "Statuia lui Mihai Eminescu de la Galaţi.

In his ''Curentul Nou'' period, Sanielevici focused his attention on the young novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], whose work he considered the main manifestation of ''Sămănătorism''. To his critic's dismissive remarks, Sadoveanu replied with a violent article in the political gazette ''[[Voinţa Naţională]]'': "I promise you a stern comeback, and do let me know if there is any clean spot on your body that may yet receive it."&lt;ref name="ajolupta"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Jicu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/JICUaug7.html "O luptă literară: H. Sanielevici despre Mihail Sadoveanu"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first fissures between Sanielevici and his Poporanist colleagues began to show at roughly the same time. Emerging as one of the Poporanist ideologues around 1905, Ibrăileanu defended Sadoveanu against Sanielevici's observations.&lt;ref name="cmlabelle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nmreviz"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/revizuirile_critice "Revizuirile critice"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msrdari91"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marin Simionescu-Râmniceanu]], [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/7211/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1906_005_004.pdf "Dărĭ de seamă.

Initially, Ibrăileanu attempted to mediate between the two rivals, advising moderation: Sadoveanu wrote to him to explain that "every bit of my soul" had been wounded, while Sanielevici announced that he was ready to defend himself with a revolver, should the "bandit" novelist come after him.&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt; Probably as a direct consequence of Sadoveanu's arrival at ''Viaţa Românească'', Sanielevici was sacked from his position on the editorial staff (September 1909).&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2005), p.26; (2006), p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the young critic did not take the matter to heart, and continued to treat Ibrăileanu with a mix of friendliness and superiority.&lt;ref name="cmlabelle"/&gt; They were still united by their disdain toward the ex-Poporanist columnist [[Ilarie Chendi]]. In 1910, one of Chendi's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] comments in the journal ''Cumpăna'', directed specifically at Sanielevici, sparked an anti-Chendi campaign in the ''Viaţa Românească'' pages.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2006), p.57-59, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910s and World War I controversy===
After a complicated process which involved a vote in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], Henric Sanieleveci received his [[naturalization]] in November 1910.&lt;ref name="vd(06)58"&gt;Durnea (2006), p.58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he made his return to Germany, where he attended additional lectures in Anthropology the [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen University]] and researched the ''[[Sammlung für Völkerkunde]]'' collections.&lt;ref name="aj(10)173-174"&gt;Jicu (2010), p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured in front of the [[Göttingen]] Anthropological Society, where he first aired his assumption that the "[[Nordic race]]" traced its origin to [[Pleistocene]]-era fishermen, and enlisted negative or ironic responses from his peers.&lt;ref name="aj(10)173"/&gt; In the hope of touching a more sympathetic audience, Sanielevici published the results of his research in the ''[[Anatomischer Anzeiger]]''.&lt;ref name="aj(10)173"/&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, despite having earned his citizenship, Sanielevici found that he could not enter the newly created [[Romanian Writers' Society]], which had a strictly [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2005), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The period however brought success to the other Sanielevici brothers: Simion took over the Chair of Mathematics at Bucharest University;&lt;ref name="matsimion"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/matematicianul-simion-sanielevici-8211.html "Matematicianul Simion Sanielevici – 40 de ani de la moarte"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', August 13, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Maximilian, turning to [[medical sociology]], pioneered [[social epidemiology]] in Moldavia,&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Ionescu, [http://www.jmpiasi.ro/2001/9%284%29/11.pdf "Beginnings of Social Medicine and Labour Medicine in Romania"], in the Iaşi Institute of Public Health ''Journal of Preventive Medicine'', Nr. 4/2001, p.96-97&lt;/ref&gt; and was later administrator of the insurance company ''Generala''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu-Roegen, p.5, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon, who was even employed as an illustrator by the Writers' Society,&lt;ref name="tapann5"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Tudor Arghezi]], [http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads/Biblioteca_Bucurestilor_2004_nr7.pdf "Anton Pann"], in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library ''Biblioteca Bucureştilor'', Nr. 7/2004, p.5.

Sanielevici was still an active Poporanist by the time of [[World War I]]. During Romania's neutrality period (1914–1916), he concentrated on his literary work and, in 1916, published the biographical essay volume ''Icoane fugare'' ("Passing Icons", second edition 1921), as well as a new work of literary criticism: ''Cercetări critice şi filosofice'' ("Critical and Philosophical Studies").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1012; Lovinescu, p.28. See also Vianu, Vol. I, p.412&lt;/ref&gt; Among these individual studies, one returned to ''Sărmanul Dionis'', tracing the links between Eminescu (otherwise a textbook ''Junimist'') and the international [[Romanticism]] of ca. 1820.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lmemnovalis59"&gt;{{ro icon}} Leonida Maniu, "Eminescu şi Novalis.

According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], the literary critic did not follow his Poporanist colleagues in political debates: while they remained firmly on the "[[Germanophile]]" side, which advocated an alliance with the [[Central Powers]], Sanielevici was "more interested in his own projects than in the course of events."&lt;ref name="lb129-130"&gt;Boia (2010), p.129-130&lt;/ref&gt; He was still courted by the most radical wing of the Germanophiles, represented by [[Tudor Arghezi]] of the newspaper ''Cronica''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mitchievici]], ''Decadenţă şi decadentism în contextul modernităţii româneşti şi europene'', [[Editura Curtea Veche]], Bucharest, 2011, p.339.  {{ISBN|978-606-588-133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in summer 1916, the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Bucharest protocol]] sealed Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], but the [[Romania in World War I|resulting defeats]] brought the occupation of southern Romania by the Central Powers. The military clashes impacted on the Sanielevici family: Solomon was killed in combat with the intruding armies.&lt;ref name="tapann5"/&gt;

Henric himself was one of the [[hostage]]s taken by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] after the taking of Bucharest. According to a fellow captive, he was one of several Jews on a multi-ethnic prisoners' convoy, deported to [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] under armed guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioan St. Paulian, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/foiadiecesana/1933/BCUCLUJ_FP_279423_1933_048_048.pdf "Sin sbuciumul vremurilor de jertfe şi biruinţă.

See also Sanielevici (1930), p.120: "the [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] priest from the capital, with whom I was interned in the time of the Germans".&lt;/ref&gt; A rumor circulated by his nationalist adversaries had it that Sanielevici irritated the occupiers with his critique of German interests in Romania. According to this account, he tried to justify himself to his captors by noting that "only in this [patriotic] way could he create himself a basis for his criticism among the Romanian people."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/taranoastra/1925/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1925_006_001.pdf "Evreii şi răsboiul României.

The accusations, publicized by the antisemitic journal ''Weltkampf'' (of the [[Militant League for German Culture]]), quoted from an anonymous author. According to them, the "cheeky" Sanielevici, known as ''V. Podriga'', had authored articles against Germany, before taking up assignments as a German [[agent of influence]] and proceeding to denounce his literary friends.&lt;ref name="hbfapte255"&gt;{{ro icon}} Horia Busuioc, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/9276/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1925_002_009.pdf "Fapte şi observaţiuni săptămânale"], in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 9/1925, p.255 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The same source acknowledged that Sanielevici was imprisoned by the occupiers, but attributed this to his "Jewish pride": according to his accusers, the Poporanist critic gave himself away when passages from the Podriga articles made it into his Germanophile pieces.&lt;ref name="hbfapte255"/&gt;

Once released from captivity, Sanielevici returned to occupied Bucharest, and, exposing himself to accusations of [[collaborationism]], began his contribution to ''Lumina'', a newspaper put out by Germanophile-Poporanist [[Constantin Stere]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p.105, 130&lt;/ref&gt; His articles there, Boia notes, were apolitical, but his correspondence of the time showed that he leaned toward the Germanophile camp.&lt;ref name="lb130"&gt;Boia (2010), p.130&lt;/ref&gt; This change occurred in mid 1918, after Romania agreed to a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace with the enemy]], when he resumed contacts with the Poporanists who had fled to Moldavia. In October 1918, believing that the turn of events had confirmed the Germanophiles' justness, and their leadership position in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], Sanielevici began working on a literary supplement for Stere's newspaper.&lt;ref name="lb130"/&gt;

The late switch in allegiance was, according to Boia, a "strange thing": Sanielevici entertained such prospects precisely as [[Armistice with Germany|German capitulation]] was occurring worldwide, and Romania was marking its return into the Entente camp.&lt;ref name="lb130"/&gt; For this reason, Boia includes Sanielevici among a group of Romanian intellectuals who seemed "confused by the war", changing sides at the most inauspicious moments.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p.122-130. The category, as delineated by Boia, also includes: [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]], [[Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion]], [[Camil Petrescu]], [[N. Porsenna]], [[Caton Theodorian]] and [[Ion Vinea]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Adevărul'' writer===
In 1920s [[Greater Romania]], Henric Sanielevici continued to publish works of literature and social science. In 1920, Bucharest's [[Editura Socec]] issued his ''Noi studii critice'' ("New Critical Studies") and ''Probleme sociale şi psihologice'' ("Social and Psychological Issues").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1012; Lovinescu, p.28. See also Jicu (2010), p.174, 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Sanielevici had turned against his socialist roots. As he wrote, "the West is not heading into socialism, but into a state of equilibrium between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the proletariat".&lt;ref name="vn&amp;al174"&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, he announced his break with Poporanism, relaunching ''Curentul Nou'' with a distinct cultural platform. Financially supported by Sanielevici, the new edition counted among its contributors the woman writer [[Constanţa Marino-Moscu]] and the philologist [[Giorge Pascu]].&lt;ref name="insemn20102"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/7396/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1920_015_006_007.pdf "Insemnări.

1921 deepened Sanielevici's conflict with the Poporanists, after he published at Socec the volume ''Poporanismul reacţionar'' ("[[Reactionary]] Poporanism").&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ggrasfoind7"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna88.pdf "Răsfoind presa (3)"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 88, May 2006, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1012; Crohmălniceanu, p.580, 585; Lovinescu, p.27, 28&lt;/ref&gt; For Sanielevici, Poporanism and its [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] successors were glorifying in the peasantry a "viscous" class, and believed that lower-class frustrations needed to be kept in check by the adoption of "limited absolutism".&lt;ref name="vn&amp;al174"/&gt;

Early in the 1920s, Sanielevici returned as a contributor to ''[[Adevărul]]'', while also printing his articles in its sister newspapers—''[[Dimineaţa]]'', ''[[Adevărul Literar şi Artistic]]''. He was for a while an editor for the latter gazette.&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"&gt;{{ro icon}} Doris Mironescu, [http://suplimentuldecultura.ro/index/continutArticolNrIdent/Cronica%20de%20carte/4490 "Şi cu Sanielevici ce facem?"], in ''Suplimentul de Cultură'', Nr. 214, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici also contributed to the ''Adevărul'' publishing company, translating, from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]]'s ''Vuelta del mundo de un novelista'' (as ''Călătoria unui romancier în jurul lumii'').&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Luminiţa Vleja, "Sobre los comienzos de las traducciones del español al rumano", in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2007, Tome 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the ''Adevărul'' group also published Sanielevici's new book of criticism, which, in its title, introduced his reference to "proletarian [[classicism]]" (''Clasicismul proletariatului'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1012. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.161; Hodoş, p.1202-1203; Lovinescu, p.28; Vianu, Vol. III, p.184, 186&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici's term referred to self-exiled Romanian writer [[Panait Istrati]], whose socialist-themed novels enjoyed breakthrough success in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1012; Hodoş, p.1202-1203&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanielevicis were heavily involved in supporting the newly emancipated Jewish community of Greater Romania. Iosif Sanielevici was a Jewish member of the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]] in the [[Romanian general election, 1922|1922 legislature]], and noted for his interventions in legislating medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Alina Cozma, [http://www.parlements.org/publications/congres_CIHAE_2006_Alina_Cozma.pdf "Parlementaires juifs dans les assemblées législatives de la Roumanie de l'entre-deux-guerres"], in Jean Garrigues, Éric Anceau, Frédéric Attal, Noëlline Castagnez, Noëlle Dauphin, Sabine Jansen, Olivier Tort (eds.), ''Actes du 57e congrès de la CIHAE: Assemblées et parlements dans le monde, du Moyen-Age à nos jours/Proceedings of the 57th ICHRPI Conference: Representative and Parliamentary Institutions in the World, from Middle Ages to Present Times'', [[National Assembly of France]], Paris, 2010, p.282, 283&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, ''Adevărul Literar şi Artistic'' published Henric Sanielevici's inquiry into the Jewish origins of [[Vasile Alecsandri]], the celebrated founder of 19th-century Moldavian Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.641, 994&lt;/ref&gt; A significant part of Sanielevici's press contributions was dedicated to uncovering the Jewish roots of some eminently Romanian authors: he claimed that all people by the name of ''Botez'' (literally, "baptism"), including poet [[Demostene Botez]], were converted Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru George]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1204&amp;editie=58 "Pentru o istorie a viitorului (XII)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 17/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanielevici's other works included the ''Alte cercetări critice şi filosofice'' ("Some More Critical and Philosophical Studies", Cartea Românească, 1925) and ''Probleme politice, literare şi sociale'' ("Political, Literary and Social Issues", Ancora publishers, ca. 1925).&lt;ref name="gc1012"&gt;Călinescu, p.1012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, he also printed his French-language work of [[paleoanthropology]]: ''La Vie des mammifères et des hommes fossiles déchiffrée à l'aide de l'anatomie'' ("The Life of Mammals and Fossilized Humans Deciphered Using [[Anatomy]]"). The next year, he returned with a work on comparative [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]], ''Noi probleme literare, politice, sociale'' ("New Literary, Political, Social Issues").&lt;ref name="mteugenism"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Turda, [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=2&amp;nr=376 "Eugenism şi biopolitică în România"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

With his ''Adevărul'' articles, Sanielevici continued to participate in the debates animating Romanian society. In March 1929, he wrote with skepticism about the Romanian [[prohibition]] lobby, but proposed the introduction of [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]] grape juice in lieu of [[Romanian wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Iuliu Scriban|Abbot Scriban]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/culturapoporului/1929/BCUCLUJ_FP_P1547_1929_009_0287.pdf "Cvas sau vin pasteurizat?"], in ''Cultura Poporului'', August 1, 1929, p.3 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, ''Adevărul'' company published two other titles: ''Literatură şi ştiinţă'' ("Literature and Science"), followed in 1935 by the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] tracts of ''În slujba Satanei?!...''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; ("In Service to [[Satan]]?!...", 2 vols.).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.642, 994, 1012.

During the early 1930s, Sanielevici repeatedly tried to receive a university-level appointment. He unsuccessfully ran against the Poporanist [[Paul Bujor]] for the Natural Science Chair at the [[University of Iaşi]],&lt;ref name="dhsurprizele"/&gt; where his brother Simion was (since 1920) Lecturer of Mechanics and Geometry.&lt;ref name="matsimion"/&gt; Frustrated in his ambition, and still obliged to make his living as a professor of French, Sanielevici began working on a ''[[List of Latin phrases: P#pro domo|pro domo]]'', borrowing its title from ''Sărmanul Dionis''.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt; Deploring the general state of affairs, the author complained that his tracts, although widely circulated among students, were not enough to earn him an academic promotion, and that he and his family were "starving" (Sanielevici also boasted that his books had sold over 35,000 copies in 15 years).&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;

===Final decades===
Some of Sanielevici's later scholarly work evidenced a focus on [[ethnography]], [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]]. As he himself noted, these themes preoccupied him during his work for ''Adevărul''. The articles, collected in ''Literatură şi ştiinţă'' volume, discussed Romanian ethnography back to the ancient tribes of [[Dacia]]: ''Arta ţăranului romîn este curat mediteraniană'' ("The Art of the Romanian Peasant Is Plainly [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]"), ''Rasa, limba şi cultura băştinaşilor Daciei'' ("The Race, Language and Culture of Dacia's Aboriginals"), ''Strămoşul nostru aurignacianul'' ("Our Ancestor, the [[Aurignacian]] Man").&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.84, 113, 117, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1930, ''Viaţa Românească'' published his lengthy essay linking the [[Dacians]], modern [[Romanian cuisine|Romanian food culture]] and the ecstatic rituals of 20th century sects in [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; With an article in ''Adevărul Literar şi Artistic'', he discussed the supposed links between the poem ''Mioriţa'' and the legendary Dacian prophet [[Zalmoxis]] (''Mioriţa sau patimile lui Zalmoxis'', that is "Mioriţa or the Passion of Zalmoxis").&lt;ref name="ob325-326"&gt;[[Octavian Buhociu]], ''Die rumänische Volkskultur und ihre Mythologie.

Henric Sanielevici survived [[World War II]], but was exposed to menacing scrutiny by the successive antisemitic and [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes (''see [[Romania in World War II]]''). As early as July 1940, the literary supplement of ''[[Universul]]'' daily nominated Sanielevici, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and many other Jewish authors as ones "who could never have contributed to our people's spiritual unity", calling for a boycott on their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ladmiss Andreescu, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/jspui/bitstream/123456789/19002/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_P3441_1940_049_0029.pdf "Iudeii în literatura noastră"], in ''[[Universul|Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 29/1940, p.2 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when many Jewish authors were officially banned, [[George Călinescu]] published his main work of literary history, which, despite reviewing Sanielevici with much irony,&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt; did not obey the order to obliterate Jewish contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restrişte]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-177.  {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fascist press retorted with aggressive comments, some of which depicted Călinescu as a secret admirer of Sanielevici's.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Norman Manea]], [http://arhiva.revistafamilia.ro/2006/9/manea.htm "Sertarele exilului 82 (Dialog epistolar cu Leon Volovici).

However, the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime was lenient on Sanielevici. In 1943, he was included in a special category of Jews who received, by dispensation, a re-naturalization as Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Lya Benjamin]], [http://www.idee.ro/holocaust/pdf/legislatia.pdf ''Starea juridică a evreilor şi implicaţiile cotidiene ale legislaţiei antievreieşti. 1940-1944''], p.3, at [http://www.idee.ro/ Idee Communication] (originally published in ''Reflecţii despre Holocaust.

The end of Antonescu's rule brought a relaxation of antisemitic measures, but, during the build-up to a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], Sanielevici was again disenfranchised.

====Beginnings====
[[File:Dezrobirea Muncitorilor (Lumea Nouă 11, 1895) MI aug73.jpg|thumb|270px|An allegory of workers' emancipation and [[social democracy]], published by [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]'s ''[[Lumea Nouă]]'' magazine (1895)]]
With his debut in professional criticism, Henric Sanielevici was the proponent of essentially [[Marxism|Marxist]] concepts, as adapted to Romanian life by philosopher [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]. According to Sanielevici's rival Călinescu, the ''Încercări critice'' author always remained committed to Gherea's [[dialectical materialism]] and "excessively ethical" [[Marxist humanism]], which had shaped the Romanian socialists' [[Didacticism|didactic literature]] even before his time.&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; Another scholar of the period, [[Tudor Vianu]], writes that Sanielevici started out as the main "continuator" of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's ideas on culture.&lt;ref name="tv(i)412"&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.412&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Curentul Nou'', the young critic followed the "Gherist" line, to which time added the influence of other [[Historicism|historicist]] or [[Determinism|deterministic]] thinkers, primarily direct borrowings from [[Hippolyte Taine]].&lt;ref&gt;Jicu (2010), p.173, 174, 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact and relevance of such ideas were investigated by several other academics. Adrian Jicu argues that the main influences on the Romanian author were [[Georg Brandes]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Gustave Lanson]] and [[Émile Hennequin]], in addition to Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Taine.&lt;ref name="aj(10)173"/&gt; Another author, Leonida Maniu, argues that, early on, Sanielevici was a [[Social determinism|social determinist]] wholly under Gherea's spell, including when it came to the "rigor and elementariness" of his deductions.&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; Similarly, critic Doris Mironescu sees Sanielevici's theories as having "deep roots in Gherea's socialism" and a foreign model in Taine's historicism, with only vague personal additions.&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt; According to Sanielevici's own account, what had been "idolatrous love" turned into "hatred and contempt" toward Gherea, and then toward [[historical materialism]].&lt;ref name="hhsantigher"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Henri H. Stahl]], [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/Sociologie/henri/11.htm "Capitolul IX. Curentele antigheriste"], in [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/Sociologie/henri/cuprins.htm ''Gânditori şi curente de istorie socială românească''], [[e-book]] version at the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Sociology; retrieved March 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanielevici's public profile and eccentricity created irritation and even scandal in his day, as summarized by writer and scholar [[Antonio Patraş]]: "[he was remembered as] an eccentric figure, a lampoonist with diverse preoccupations [...], sometimes perceived as an intelligent and cultured critic, but overall an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] with the exorbitant pretensions of an ''[[uomo universale]]'' and the insufferable airs of a decadent cleric, with a holier-than-thou attitude."&lt;ref name="apprintul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Antonio Patraş]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/iasii-lui-patras-printul-henric-intre-uitare-si-reabilitare-4591293/ "Prinţul Henric între uitare şi reabilitare"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', June 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While describing himself as the leading cultural factor of the nation, "one of the greatest creators ever produced by mankind", Sanielevici noted that he was struggling against "lightning and hailstorm" launched by his envious peers.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt; Moreover, he claimed, "there almost isn't one publicist, literato, politician" to have refrained from [[Plagiarism|plagiarizing]] his ideas.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;

In his profile of Sanielevici, [[Eugen Lovinescu]] mentions a "lampoonist's deformation and stylistic violence", "lucidity in expression" and many other talents, as well as a "noble", but misguided and distorted, passion for turning "crude material" into science.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "H. Sanielevici's style, much like his entire personality, suffers from a twofold shift in balance: firstly in the verbal violence and then in the morbid self-awareness."&lt;ref name="el28"&gt;Lovinescu, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; In his own retrospective work, Călinescu also proposed that Sanielevici was an essayist more than an actual critic, praising his texts as evidences of "great literary skill" ("gracious" works, with charmingly "voluptuous poetry", but also "bizarre" in content).&lt;ref name="gc641-642"/&gt; He remarked that, while Sanielevici could prove himself "a talented polemicist", the assessments he made displayed such "enormity" as to become "inoffensive".&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; Similarly, [[Z. Ornea]] discusses Sanielevici and his traditionalist rival [[Ilarie Chendi]] as "tested polemicists", "excellent at organizing and mapping out campaigns";&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.138&lt;/ref&gt; he notes however that Sanielevici was "haughty beyond measure", and all too imaginative.&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; In later overviews, Jicu found that Sanielevici was "[[Narcissism|narcissistic]]" and self-promoting, but not an ignorant,&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt; while Patraş, who concedes that Sanielevici came up with some new ideas of importance in literary analysis, judges him as one who alternated scientific endeavors with mere journalism.&lt;ref name="apprintul"/&gt;

====Neoclassicism and socialism====
According to authors such as Ornea and [[Constantin Ciopraga]], Henric Sanielevici was most productive and interesting as a literary theorist, and only so until ca. 1911.&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; At the time, Sanielevici's study of and contribution to [[Romanian literature]] sought to uphold the [[Classicism|Classical]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] models, reinterpreted by him through a socialist grid. He suggested that the dominating Neoclassical form promoted through ''[[Junimea]]'' was in actuality [[Neoromanticism]], and that the only true Neoclassical ''Junimist'' was a minor author, [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti]]—Maiorescu replied, "both [of Sanielevici's] assessments strike us as strange."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; In defining what he meant by "Classicism", Sanielevici continued to borrow from Maiorescu's ideal of "formal purity", but expanded it to mean narratives so restrained and so immersing "that we don't even pay attention to the words".&lt;ref&gt;Mironescu (2011), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Sanielevici ventured to state that his own writing was generally "more elegant" than Maiorescu's, and "precise" in the manner of 18th-century literati.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;

Against the ''Junimists'', Gherea's disciple was slowly visualizing an "optimistic" and "balanced" Classicism that was not aristocratic, but rather could belong to any social class "at the peak of its domination".&lt;ref name="dm(11)93-94"&gt;Mironescu (2011), p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; However, in discussing the delayed Romanticism of [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s work, Sanielevici spoke of "genius", and boasted having been the first to describe Eminescu as a poet of European proportions.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt; Leonida Maniu credits him with having been the first exegete to document Eminescu's kinship with [[German idealism]] and, in particular, with [[Novalis]]' "magic idealism".&lt;ref name="lmemnovalis59"/&gt; For Doris Mironescu, the work on ''Sărmanul Dionis'' remains one of Sanielevici's most commendable efforts.&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;

Like the ''Junimists'', Sanielevici took a critical view of the historical [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal movement]], and in particular of its founding myth, the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]]. His belief, described by political scientist Victor Rizescu as "interesting" and "intriguing", was that the Romanian liberals had not been responsible for [[modernization]], but, quite the contrary, had dedicated themselves to imposing an [[oligarchy]] over the economy and [[obscurantism]] over the national ideology.&lt;ref name="vr307-308"&gt;Rizescu, p.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; He described the liberal program of modernization as "the bitter fruits" of 1848, and suggested that Romanian conservatism was a complex, sometimes positive, phenomenon,&lt;ref name="tv(ii)311-312"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.311-312&lt;/ref&gt; "the harsh chiding of a parent saddened to see his child taking the wrong path".&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt; Sanielevici believed that criticism of ''Junimism'' as a German-imported ideology was "not entirely exact", proposing that Romanian conservatism and its [[Conservatism in Germany|German model]] shared a belief in "organic" rather than "revolutionary" [[nation-building]].&lt;ref name="tv(ii)311-312"/&gt; In his account, which became a standard of Romanian scholarship, ''Junimea'' happened because a portion of Romania's young intellectuals were exasperated by the continuous revolutionary mood of French politics, and looked into the steadier [[evolutionism]] proposed by German teachers.&lt;ref name="cvcultura145-146"/&gt; Critical of this perspective, Mironescu dismisses Sanielevici's view of the Wallachian 1848ers as "proletarian rage".&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;

In sociology, Sanielevici's own contribution rested on Maiorescu's early stance against "forms without concept" (or "forms without substance")—that is, vague elements of modernization hurriedly imposed on a still primitive society.&lt;ref name="vr307-308"/&gt; This affiliation notwithstanding, "forms without concept" was used by Sanielevici and other socialists against the very political core of ''Junimist'' ideology. Scholar [[Alexandru George]] notes the irony that Gherea and his "baroque" disciple were reviving a conservative concept in a Marxist context: "according to the so very slow evolutionism of ''Junimea'', [they themselves] represented a dangerous form without concept, [...] proving that ideas took precedence, and thus, that ideology took precedence over a society's 'needs', in what was a denial of Maiorescu's stance."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru George]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1586&amp;editie=73 "Între revizuire şi fixare (IV)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 36/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polemic with ''Sămănătorul''====
Sanielevici's early attacks focused on the literary school which promoted [[ethnic nationalism]] as the source of artistic truth, namely the magazine ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' and its editor [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Călinescu summarized the resulting conflict as follows: "It was against the nationalist tendentiousness that the intelligent Jewish man H. Sanielevici sought to promote a sort of Classicism, with his ''Curentul Nou'' magazine".&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; In his ''Curentul Nou'' manifesto of 1906, Sanielevici suggested that ''Sămănătorist'' culture was anti-Western retrogressive [[autarky]], comparing the ''Sămănătorists'' themselves to [[Americo-Liberian|Liberian mulattoes]] and [[Boxer Rebellion|Chinese Boxers]].&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt; Furthermore, he argued, Iorga and the others had never lived the lives of their peasant heroes, and had failed to understand the motivations of land laborers.&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt;

Beyond such rhetoric, Sanielevici rejected the traditionalism of ''Sămănătorul'' right-wingers not because of its didacticism, but because of its supposed inconsistencies. Researchers argue that he was simply prone to attack ''Sămănătorul'' "at any opportunity",&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; and was motivated by the wish to "counter Iorga".&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt; Overall, Eugen Lovinescu argues, his was a "sentimental deception", sparked by the revelation that Iorga's followers were all Neoromantics.&lt;ref name="el26"/&gt; Consequently, Sanielevici alleged that the ''Sămănătorist'' stories, about violent and promiscuous [[hajduk]]s, or about modern-day [[Adultery|adulterous]] affairs, set bad moral examples and were needlessly titillating.&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.641; Lovinescu, p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the heroic portrayals of hajduks and ancient warlords, as a glorification of the "barbaric past".&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; Politically, Sanielevici believed it was his patriotic duty to react against the "invasion of the peasants into the cultured layers [of society]".&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;

Around 1905, before he joined the Poporanists, [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] was the prime target of Sanielevici's anti-''Sămănătorism''. The Marxist critic was especially reductive when it came to Sadoveanu's "baroque" brand of [[literary naturalism]]: "not naturalism, but pure bestiality. Mr. Sadoveanu has the soul of a ''[[Wachtmeister]]''. When a ''Wachtmeister'' tells you that he 'has lived', it means that he has been to many drunken parties and has had many women".&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt; The first (amiable) split between Ibrăileanu and Sanielevici was about their different interpretations of Sadoveanu's stories. Outside commentators were perplexed by the obscure rationale of their debate. According to a 1906 column by writer [[Marin Simionescu-Râmniceanu]]: "That which Mr. Sanielevici finds to be poisonous for our society in Sadoveanu's work, Mr. Ibrăileanu will judge to be the absolute opposite. [...] Whatever ''Curentul Nou'' has said over one page, regarding Sadoveanu's work, is denied on the other. Wouldn't it then have been better not to have said it at all?"&lt;ref name="msrdari91"/&gt; Writing in 2003, literary historian [[Nicolae Manolescu]] suggested that the reason was entirely subjective: "It is practically impossible to comprehend for instance why H. Sanielevici found Sadoveanu's prose to be so violent in subject and primitive in style, while [...] Ibrăileanu and others readily viewed it as profoundly balanced and artistic in manner."&lt;ref name="nmreviz"/&gt; Jicu is inclined to believe that Sadoveanu was more the "collateral victim" of Sanielevici's attack on Iorga, and that Sanielevici was at his worst in assessing the quality of Sadovenian writings.&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt;

While battling Iorga's Neoromanticism, Sanielevici proposed a radical change of themes: he recommended a "religion" of balanced and moral life,&lt;ref name="el26"/&gt; with literary works about "regular and assiduous labor, the tranquil family life, honesty, economy, sobriety, diligent industry, and delicate sentiments".&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; As Mironescu writes, Sanielevici's Classicism was adverse to nostalgia, frustration and rebellion, and naturally focused on the materially secure social classes.&lt;ref name="dm(11)93-94"/&gt; In the early years, his sympathy went to the humanism, [[literary realism]] and [[economic determinism]] of young novelists coming in from [[Transylvania]], primarily [[Ioan Slavici]]—whose books show Romanian peasants holding their ground against [[feudalism]], then [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.641. See also Mironescu, p.93; Lovinescu, p.26, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Writing from within this trend, Simionescu-Râmniceanu ridiculed Sanielevici's moral agenda, and especially the advocacy of [[universal suffrage]] by literary means: "why not also for reforming municipal services in provincial towns, or for introducing soybean cultures in the villages?"&lt;ref name="msrdari91"/&gt; In 2009, Mironescu found the idea of a Transylvanian "peasant classicism" to be "freakish".&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;

In addition, Sanielevici demanded that Romanians revisit "the ancestral law" of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]], and noted that the spread of militant [[atheism]] was a positive development.&lt;ref name="hsnewcrplural"/&gt; Călinescu sees Sanielevici, and "any Jewish writer", as actually denouncing the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] component of ''Sămănătorist'' nationalism. Sanielevici, he argues, was attacking virility in literature precisely because it highlighted the "national preservation" of Romanians, and actually raising awareness about the promised [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]].&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; Călinescu also notes the controversy sparked once Sanielevici's exposed some leading voices of Romanian nationalism, beginning with [[Vasile Alecsandri]], as secret Jews: "[His] denunciation of various writers' foreignness shows subtle humor, pointing at the rickety nature of claims about one's ethnic novelty."&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; Călinescu's younger colleague [[Dumitru Micu]] issued a similar objection, arguing that the "megalomaniac" Sanielevici displayed a "cosmopolitan hatred for the nation's past" (an opinion in turn criticized by Jicu).&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt;

====Poporanism vs. "proletarian classicism"====
Henric Sanielevici's uncompromising rejection of Romanian liberalism was what separated him definitively from both Ibrăileanu and Lovinescu. Victor Rizescu argues that Sanielevici's scrutiny of the liberal mindset, answering to liberal theorists such as Lovinescu to [[Ştefan Zeletin]], reveals a minor voice in social and cultural analysis, but also a powerful exponent of democratic thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Rizescu, p.308, 316&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu describes Sanielevici as primarily a Poporanist ("albeit with intermittent enmities"), rating him the third figure of importance after "prophet" [[Constantin Stere]] and militant Ibrăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.23-26&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 20th century, he notes, Sanielevici was also the editorial voice of ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'' in its lengthy press debate with ''Junimist'' author [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]].&lt;ref name="el26"/&gt; Ibrăileanu himself acknowledged, in 1910, that Sanielevici was "an intelligent man, with a clear mind, an original way of thinking, [...] a subtle spirit and an elegant form", who helped Poporanism in its fight against "[[Decadent movement|decadence]]", and who discovered the talents of Brătescu-Voineşti.&lt;ref name="vd(06)58"/&gt; In his own analysis of the latter's work, Ibrăileanu even borrowed from Sanielevici, building on the idea of a readjusted Classicism.&lt;ref&gt;Mironescu (2011), p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 1920s, Sanielevici was rekindling Dobrogeanu-Gherea's polemic with his "[[reactionary]]" Poporanist students, and, according to Lovinescu, was right to do so.&lt;ref name="el27"&gt;Lovinescu, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; With Lovinescu, Zeletin, [[Vintilă Brătianu]] and some of the younger intellectuals, Sanielevici represented the minority current which supported and justified [[industrialization]] and [[Westernization]], against the self-preservation of agrarian lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_tradition-and-modernity-in-the-1920s-ch-IV.html "Tradition and Modernity in the 1920s (IV) (excerpts)"], in ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}'', Nr. 29/2007&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by Jicu: "The ''Curentul Nou'' editor [believed] that, after the war, the Romanian milieu had entered the era of those social changes that Poporanism was hindering. Hence the [[logical truth|logical necessity]] of discrediting it."&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; A 1920 notice in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' expressed support for the "temperamental erudite" in times of "social upheaval", when "few people understand him and many grumble about him."&lt;ref name="insemn20102"/&gt;

Lovinescu however remarks that Sanielevici was still committed to the core concept of Poporanism and ''Sămănătorul'', namely a "failure to differentiate between [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]]". In Lovinescu's account, Sanielevici considered himself a new Iorga, and a "missionary" among the mass of people: "aesthetically, he still endures as a Poporanist, albeit one with a different political ideology."&lt;ref name="el27"/&gt; As noted by Jicu, Sanielevici tellingly oscillated in his reviews of Sadoveanu's Poporanism. A while after the 1905 scandal, he admitted that Sadovenian novels showed an able author, but in 1921 returned to say: "[Sadoveanu] has since civilized himself, without gathering in talent".&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt;

Before 1930, Sanielevici also reached the conclusion that, after an era of realism, a new, "proletarian", form of moralizing classicism was emerging in prose. He believed that the novels of international vagabond [[Panait Istrati]], whom he described as vastly superior to Sadoveanu's naturalist works,&lt;ref name="ajolupta"/&gt; were an early proof of this change. Sanielevici's idea was received with sarcasm by T. Vianu, who replied: "Mr. H. Sanielevici, to whom, he informs us, we owe the 'shattering discovery' that realism is always succeeded by classicism, saw in Istrati's ''Oncle Anghel'' the affirmation of his theories and the dawn of a new era in moral health. Mr. Sanielevici's proclamation regarding Istrati came with the immolation of one hundred and fifty writers published in contemporary reviews, and this enormous sanguinary drive gave us the surprise of noting that classical moderation does not always keep company with the practice of temperance."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu also parted with Sanielevici's comments about the supposedly classical quietude and political [[reformism]] of Istrati and his protagonists: "Their moral is not social, because they are not sheltered by it and because they seek to escape its sanctions. [...] That Mr. H. Sanielevici was able to detect in this the representatives of qualified, almost bourgeois, workers is by now only an instructive example of how systemic prejudice may lead astray any particular judgment."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

As Istrati's apologete, Henric Sanielevici hoped to rescue proletarian works from the concentrated attacks of nationalists and traditionalists. According to writer Ioan Lascu, Iorga and [[Octavian Goga]] had thrown Istrati's novels into "the tough mixer of nationalist passions", while Sanielevici, "for all his critical servitude", was agitating for cultural openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioan Lascu, [http://revistaramuri.ro/index.php?id=782&amp;editie=34&amp;autor=de%20Ioan%20Lascu "Defăimarea lui Eminescu'], in ''[[Ramuri]]'', Nr. 4/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalist reviewer [[Ion Gorun]] reacted strongly against "''[[heimatlos]]''" Istrati's promotion from the left, denouncing Sanielevici as one of "our recent guests", the purveyor of "spiritual anarchy" and of "trumped-up critical nonsense".&lt;ref name="ah1202"/&gt; In the end, Sanielevici's argument failed to satisfy even his [[Social democracy|social democratic]] colleagues. Writing for the socialist newspaper ''[[Şantier]]'', militant journalist [[Lothar Rădăceanu]] strongly criticized the notion of "proletarian classicism". He contrarily asserted that Istrati was the portraitist of unsociable marginals, who had isolated himself from the [[working class]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanielevici's novel ideas on politics made it into his other essays. Besides its overall [[anti-fascism]], ''În slujba Satanei?!...'' features his criticism of other public figures, mainly [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] and Poporanist politicians. The language, Călinescu notes, is "inimitable".&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; Sanielevici accuses C. Stere of senility, judges Ibrăileanu a "weak critic", and dismisses ''Viaţa Românească'' columnist [[Mihai Ralea]], who "is very bad at coordinating"; he also describes the post-Poporanist [[National Peasants' Party]] as laughable when in government.&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; ''În slujba Satanei''{{'}}s other targets are foreign writers and critics whom Sanielevici disliked, from [[World government|world federalist]] author [[H. G. Wells]] to [[Modernist literature|modernist]] novelist [[André Gide]].&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt;

===Aspiring anthropologist===

====Lamarckist evolutionism====
A constant of Henric Sanielevici's career was provided by his perspective on [[anthropology]], which became his leading preoccupation in the [[interwar period]]. For Sanielevici, this came with a new [[epistemology]], which rated "orientation" (bridging [[logic]], [[dialectic]] and [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuition]]) above all other scientific faculties, prophesying a new stage in social science: the accurate description of deterministic relationships.&lt;ref name="aj(10)175"&gt;Jicu (2010), p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Messianism|Messianic]] language (provocatively so, according to Jicu), he stated: "I am he whom you announce is to come down through the ages. I created the science that is real, cleansed of all conventional lies: the science of causal reports and of laws that coordinate things occurring."&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt; The ''Curentul Nou'' editor also attempted to test his theories in [[political science]] and [[economics]], but, Doris Mironescu cautions, his efforts there should not be taken for granted.&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;

Sanielevici believed that he had revolutionized knowledge, describing himself as a [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] of biology&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhsurprizele"/&gt; and arguing that he had provided the world with the most accurate paradigm of [[human evolution]].&lt;ref name="aj(10)174"&gt;Jicu (2010), p.174&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ideas about the [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|inheritance of habits]],&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, p.438; Jicu (2010), p.174; Piveteau, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici deduced anthropology from [[zoology]]. According to him, [[Lamarckism]] was the only credible [[History of evolutionary thought|school of evolutionary thought]]; [[Darwinism]], [[Weismann barrier|Weismannism]], [[Mutationism]] and the [[Vitalism]] of [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch|H. Driesch]] were all sterile and irrelevant.&lt;ref name="hslavieplural"&gt;{{fr icon}} Henry Sanielevici, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_la-vie-des-mammiferes-et-des-hommes-fossiles.html "La Vie Des Mammifères Et Des Hommes Fossiles (excerpts)"], in ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}'', Nr. 28/2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, p.438; Piveteau, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing [[Anton Nyström]], the Romanian anthropologist reacted strongly against the anatomical theories put forth by [[Australia]]'s [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], whom he "damned to hell",&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; and derided the [[Phrenology|phrenological]] collections of [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] and [[Franz Joseph Gall]].&lt;ref name="aj(10)173-174"/&gt;

Some of his own essays offered novel explanations to the emergence of biological functions: in an early article for ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', he reportedly suggested that the purpose of [[Bird vocalization|bird singing]] was the prevention of [[asphyxia]].&lt;ref name="mejournal4"&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Journal II, 1957-1969'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago &amp; London, 1989, p.4.  {{ISBN|0-226-20413-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later came to the conclusion that the very evolution of mammals was made possible by the abundance or scarcity of food: the ancestors of such animals were [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] and [[viviparous]] reptiles, who evolved into lighter and more agile species while continuously searching for food sources; an exception was the proverbially slow-moving [[sloth]], whose feed, the [[slug]]s, was in abundance.&lt;ref name="hslavieplural"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piveteau, p.155-156&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici explained hair growth on mammals (humans included) as an adaptation to humidity, while differences in [[Human skin color|skin pigmentation]] reflected exclusively the nature of the soil and the specimen's own blood circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, p.438-440; Piveteau, p.156, 157. See also Sanielevici (1930), p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Such contributions were received with astonishment or derision by the scientific community, although, Călinescu writes, his "extravagances" show "incontestable intelligence and erudition."&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; Jicu notes that the theories he advanced were often "strong", "supported by hard work", "extremely inventive" and "not that strange as claimed", but that practice failed Sanielevici.&lt;ref&gt;Jicu (2010), p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lucian Boia]], he was "an erudite and a dreamer", with "a very personal approach" to social science,&lt;ref name="lb129-130"/&gt; while literary historian Dumitru Hîncu notes that Sanielevici's "involuntary humor" overshadows his "unquestionable culture".&lt;ref name="dhsurprizele"/&gt; Some commentators describe Sanielevici as spiritually related to the 19th-century liberal historian [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], and rate their overall approach to research as Romanian [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p.129; Călinescu, p.641, 642&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nutrition and human races====
[[File:Dryopithecus Fontani jaw.jpg|thumb|280px|''[[Dryopithecus]]'' jaw (1893 illustration to [[Jovan Žujović]]'s ''Kameno doba'')]]
Sanielevici's interest in the subject of race is steeped in his work as a literary critic, and expands on the theses of more mainstream determinism. This happened once Sanielevici discarded Gherea's Marxism and looked into [[environmental determinism]] to record "the laws that have governed the birth of literary production", explaining: "literary criticism led me to study anthropology. The path is, contrary to how one might think, short and straight."&lt;ref name="aj(10)174"/&gt; Gherea's method, he argued, was only applicable on a case by case basis, whereas "racial psycho-physiology" explained phenomena occurring at a universal scale.&lt;ref name="hhsantigher"/&gt; Accusing Gherea of having exaggerated and falsified Marxism, he tried to reconcile determinisms with the single formula: "[[Class struggle]] and racial psychology, those are the two factors of social evolution. The latter is more general and more important than the former."&lt;ref name="hhsantigher"/&gt;

Ciopraga notes that, in his "continuous agitation", Sanielevici reduced Taine's deterministic concept of "race, milieu and moment" to "climate and food".&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; Applying Lamarckism to the study of human character, Sanielevici also regarded [[physiognomy]] as a relevant clue to evolutionary history. The conclusion, called "surprising and ridiculous" by Jicu,&lt;ref name="aj(10)174"/&gt; was that one's writing style was influenced by race, diet, jawline and even eye color. Reviewing his colleague's ideas in a 1933 essay, Vianu noted: "In those studies where Mr. Sanielevici builds such considerations, literature effectively turns into a material reused into theories that surpass aesthetics."&lt;ref name="tv(i)412"/&gt; Ornea also notes that such "fixations" ruined Sanielevici's literary career, turning him into a "dilettante" of anthropology.&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt;

Sanielevici partly rejected, partly nuanced, the [[Historical race concepts|historical definitions of race]] and the tenets of [[scientific racism]]. Călinescu paraphrases his core idea: "races are affinities of an anthropological kind, reaching beyond the supposedly historical races."&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; Thus, the main criterion available for differentiation and classification of human races was [[human nutrition]]. Already in 1903, he argued that [[Mongols]], "the least mixed" people of the "yellow race", were "brachycephalic" because they consumed raw meat, and thus required stronger [[temporal muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1903), p.594-595&lt;/ref&gt; In ''La Vie des mammifères...'', Sanielevici postulated that racial clusters had emerged around [[staple food]]s, corresponding to regional patterns in the [[Paleolithic diet|Stone Age diet]]. In his account, a European [[megaflood]] had pushed ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' out of the canopy, replacing its diet with nuts, pushing it toward [[bipedalism]], and then turning it into modern man.&lt;ref name="hslavieplural"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piveteau, p.156-157&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian author distinguished five basic racial and dietary types, based on the archeological cultures and each created by its own foodstuff: [[Aurignacian]] (''[[allium]]'' plants, beans), [[Abbevillian|Chellean]] (nuts), [[Magdalenian]] (fish), [[Mousterian]] (snails, fruit) and [[Solutrean]] (meat, horses).&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hslavieplural"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.641. See also Jicu (2010), p.174-175; Sanielevici (1930), p.84, 112-113, 118-122&lt;/ref&gt; These types corresponded to the environmental divisions, respectively: warm [[steppe]], warm woods, [[tundra]], cool woods, cold steppe.&lt;ref&gt;Jicu (2010), p.174-175. See also Sanielevici (1930), p.118-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanielevici's grid rated the [[Tungusic peoples]] as Solutrean, and the modern-day [[Italian people]] as "grass"-eaters, proposing that the "impulsive" behavior of Jews was owed to a high [[nitrogen]] intake, from beans.&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; The [[Han Chinese]] were descendants of the Aurignacians, having a rice-based "rodent" diet, which strained their muscles to create the [[epicanthic fold]].&lt;ref name="hslavieplural"/&gt; [[Black people]] and their [[Spanish people|Spanish]] relatives, he conjectured, owed their darker skin to the intoxicating contact with [[laterite]]s, also responsible for "impulsiveness".&lt;ref name="gb440"&gt;Bohn, p.440&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916, Sanielevici's racial perspectives had incorporated definitions of race popular in early 20th-century scholarship. In this context, he argued that the "[[Nordic race]]" had created Classicism and [[epic poetry]], that didactic realism was an "[[Alpine race|Alpine]]" feature, and that "[[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]]" were at the source of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.412. See also Bohn, p.440; Sanielevici (1930), p.87, 116, 118, 119, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The book and theory were reviewed with much skepticism by the foreign scholars to whom they were addressed. ''[[L'Année Psychologique]]'' journal, which noted that Sanielevici was reviving the ideas of [[Napoleonic era]] naturalist [[Georges Cuvier]], concluded with irony: "One evidently needs a rich imagination such as [Sanielevici's] to pierce through the mysteries of paleontological life for animals and humans that have vanished for so long. The author, who has full confidence in his intuition to guide him, has no doubt as to the certitude of his convictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} H. P., [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/psy_0003-5033_1926_num_27_1_6336 "Analyses bibliographiques: III. Psychologie Comparée. Questions évolutives générales. Henry Sanielevici, ''La vie des mammifères et des hommes fossiles''. I."], in ''[[L'Année Psychologique]]'', Vol. XXVII, 1926, p.321 (republished by [https://archive.is/20120908132757/http://www.persee.fr/web/support/soon_available ''Persée'' Scientific Journals])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Piveteau]], the [[Vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate paleontologist]], wrote: "To me, it does not seem worth discussing this new biological theory at length. For sure [...] the reader will identify in it quite a few Lamarckian reminiscences; but [these] will be precisely the most annoying passages from Lamarck".&lt;ref&gt;Piveteau, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist Georges Bohn also asked rhetorically: "[Sanielevici's] excessive imagination, might it not also be the result of spiritual intoxication from the plants and the soil?"&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, p.440-441&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-racist racialism====
[[File:PSM V54 D360 Jewish types.jpg|thumb|250px|Purported "Jewish types". ''[[Popular Science]]'' illustration, 1898]]
The Romanian scholar sought to redefine the concept of a "[[Semitic race]]", which he described as fluid and independent of Jewishness. Overall, he found "Semitism" in any sexually driven, "[[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian]]", culture, and concluded that the "Mediterranean race" as a whole was Semitic.&lt;ref name="gc642; hs(30)passim"&gt;Călinescu, p.642; Sanielevici (1930), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The Semitic trait was, in his definition, the purest modern stage of the Aurignacian man.&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.84, 89-90, 112-115&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, after reading French archeologist [[Fernand Benoit]], Sanielevici concluded that the Aurignacian-Semitic-Dionysian connection was unaltered among the [[Berber people]] of [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.84-90, 118-119&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''În slujba Satanei?!...'', Sanielevici reacted against [[Nazism]], discussing Germany's [[racial antisemitism]], [[Aryan race]] doctrine and [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]]. The text suggested that [[Adolf Hitler]] was an [[Antichrist]],&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; and negatively quoted from [[Eugen Fischer]], the Nazi racial theorist, to show that Nazism had perverted earlier forms of [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p.27, 312&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on his own interpretation of "Semitic race" concepts, Sanielevici distinguished between the Jews, who belonged to several races, and the Semites, only some of whom were Jewish. The racial traits, he suggested, were hidden, recurrent and vague: the [[recessive]] characteristics made races divisible into "classes" and "subclasses".&lt;ref name="ltb312"&gt;Butaru, p.312&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanielevici illustrated his point with [[craniometry]], publishing comparative photographs of Jews and ethnically unrelated people ([[Russians]], [[French people|Frenchmen]], [[German people|Germans]]), concluding that their physical measurements were nearly identical.&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; He also included photographs of himself and his family, for whom he reused the concept of a "[[Dinaric race|Dinaric]]" race, with [[Western Asia]]n characteristics.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apprintul"/&gt; Concluding that his own personality was "Dinaric", and ethically driven, he also suggested that his son Ipolit (Hyppolyte), was not Dinaric, but "Dalic".&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; The latter category was Sanielevici's answer to the Aryan theory: a [[Master race|superior race]] found in [[Atlantic Europe]], the "Dalic" peoples stood above the "Dinarics" and the "Nordic" Germans—the Nordics being a "gregarious" and easily dominated human group.&lt;ref name="ltb312"/&gt;

The racial hierarchy implied by such contributions received contradictory, often negative comments from Sanielevici's peers. Călinescu argued that Sanielevici is in fact the voice of [[anti-racism]] in the Romanian context, and one who uses racist ideas against themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.641, 642&lt;/ref&gt; As a supporter of Semitic race theories, Călinescu also wrote that the photographic evidence was inconclusive, since a "[[Hebrews|Hebrew]] note" of character still set the Jews apart in all samples, including wherever Sanielevici referred to his family.&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; Historian of medicine Marius Turda notes that Sanielevici's pronouncements form part of a larger cultural phenomenon, under which racism and [[eugenics]] became fashionable, both within and without the Romanian [[far right]].&lt;ref name="mteugenism"/&gt; Although he defines Sanielevici as a "pro-racist", researcher Lucian Butaru notes that his ideas questioned the racist mindset of his contemporaries, in the same vein as the anti-racist ''Adevărul'' columnist Doctor Ygrec (Glicsman) and the conservative anti-fascism of philosopher [[P. P. Negulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; He considers Sanielevici's a "bizarre" racist discourse, like those of [[Alexandru Randa]] or [[Iordache Făcăoaru]], but separated from them by an enduring belief in democracy, and "less quoted because of [his Jewish] origin".&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p.311-312&lt;/ref&gt;

In his tracts, Sanielevici suggests that the [[Romanians|Romanian ethnicity]] and the Romanian Jewry are both racial conglomerates, not racial entities. He speaks about fundamental differences occurring between people from the distinct [[Romanian historical regions]]—[[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], Transylvania etc.—with many hybrid individuals straddling the supposed divides.&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; ''La Vie des mammifères...'' postulated that the Moldavians were Mousterian-Magdalenians originally feeding on fruit, fish and snails, whereas Wallachians (or, more restrictively, [[Muntenia]]ns) represented the Aurignacian-Solutrean mixture—horses in summer, and mainly onions in winter.&lt;ref name="gc641-642"/&gt; In later writings, he argued that the whole of Wallachia's population, as well as some Moldavians, fit in with the Semitic and Mediterranean prototype.&lt;ref name="gc642; hs(30)passim"/&gt;

In 1930, Sanielevici noted: "22 years ago I was the first to draw attention to the ''oriental'' [Sanielevici's italics] character of [[Art of Romania|Romanian peasant art]], into which is mirrored the oriental soul of the [[Thracians]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.116&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the "Dinaric" and "Alpine" subsets, well represented in Romania, ranked better than the "Nordic" people, if lower than the "Dalic".&lt;ref name="ltb312"/&gt; In Călinescu's interpretation, Sanielevici attributed to the natives of Transylvania some characteristics which were defining for Jews: "thus [he] fashions himself a Transylvanian and therefore more of a Romanian than the Romanians [from other regions]."&lt;ref name="gc641"/&gt; Applying his racial interpretation to Romanian writers, Sanielevici compared traditionalists [[Alexandru Vlahuţă]] and Sadoveanu: the dark-faced Vlahuţă, with his eyes "black as oil", was a "Mediterranean" and a Romantic, displaying the "hidden excitement and concentrated nature of a Spaniard"; Sadoveanu was blond and stocky, therefore "[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]" in appearance and "[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]" in psychology, but also of "Alpine impulsiveness".&lt;ref name="aj(10)175"/&gt;

====Religious and folkloric studies====
A corollary to his anthropological work, [[religious studies]] formed a distinct part of Sanielevici's research. Sanielevici believed his work in the field was as groundbreaking as his study of races: "The research I carried into the history of religions has plainly revealed to me some truths that nobody so far seems to have perceived."&lt;ref name="gc642"/&gt; A primary focus of his work was the differentiation between religious practice at a racial level: the "Semitic" or "Dionysian" religion grouped together the ancient worship of [[Osiris]], [[Sabazios]] and [[Attis]], the [[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysian]] and [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Berber mythology]], the [[Phallic saints]] and [[Waldensians|Waldesian lore]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.84-92, 100, 112-122&lt;/ref&gt; Sanielevici further argued that the [[fertility rite]]s and [[chthonic]] traditions shared between these religious cultures were polar opposites of "Nordic" beliefs in the [[Sky deity|sky gods]], and came from the intoxicating properties of the Aurignacian diet.&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.89-90, 112-115, 118-122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, basing himself on press reports, Henric Sanielevici turned his attention to the [[Messianism|Messianic]] movements of [[Bessarabia]], and in particular the [[Inochentist church]]. The latter had recently broken up with [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], forming a [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatic]] group with its own version of Christian lore. The Inochentists allegedly preached [[Mortification of the flesh|mortification]] and [[sacred prostitution]], reminding Sanielevici of the Orthodox sectarian activity depicted by [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] in his philosophical novels, and reviewed by him as a northernmost afterthought of Semitic-Dionysian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.91-115, 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

The period also witnessed Sanielevici's interest in [[Paleo-Balkan mythology]] and the [[origin of the Romanians]], the ancient [[Dacians]], and the supposed Dacian cult leader [[Zalmoxis]]. He traced a continuous "Dionysian"-type religious practice leading back to the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] ([[30th century BC]]), and suggested that there was a connection between [[Symbols and proto-writing of the Cucuteni–Trypillian culture|Cucuteni pottery markings]] and the [[geometric abstraction]] of modern folk art.&lt;ref name="hs(30)116-117"&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.116-118&lt;/ref&gt; In his interpretation, the latter was at once a local variant of [[Dionysus]] and the founder of Romanian [[hesychasm]].&lt;ref name="hs(30)116-117"/&gt;

Sanielevici believed to have also detected traces of Zalmoxian and Dionysian practice in various elements of [[Romanian folklore]], reading ''[[Mioriţa]]'' as a codified record of [[human sacrifice]] in Dacian times.&lt;ref name="ob325-326"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici (1930), p.118-119&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1901, he had dismissed ''Mioriţa'' as a crude and absurd poem, noting that its protagonists displayed a suicidal indifference to murder, "instead of calling the police". Literary historian [[Alex. Ştefănescu]] describes Sanielevici's comment as mere [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], "as if someone were to ask why [[King Lear]] won't book himself a hotel room".&lt;ref name="asiubire"/&gt; A transition was already evident in ''La Vie des mammifères...'', where Sanielevici suggests that ''Mioriţa'', like ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'', is a wonderful sample of "intoxicated", African-like, mentalities in the heart of Europe.&lt;ref name="gb440"/&gt; By 1930, Sanielevici had revised his own argument: his ''Mioriţa sau patimile lui Zalmoxis'' formed part of a resurgence in Dacian studies and essayistics. Writing in 2006, [[University of Turin]] academic Roberto Merlo includes it among a list of period works that focused in large part on Zalmoxis, with various interpretations to his story; other authors cited therein include [[Dan Botta]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Alexis Nour]], [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Theodor Speranţia]].&lt;ref name="rmtracia56-57"/&gt; As such, Sanielevici's final take on the poem described the shepherd's indifference as a ritualized [[initiation]] into death.&lt;ref name="gpmior63, 67"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Touched by controversy and repressed by both nationalists and communists, Sanielevici's work has been ignored by the general public in the decades after he died. Marxist sociologist [[Henri H. Stahl]] reports: "Sanielevici is an isolated dissident, read for only as long as a momentary interest lasted for his paradoxical polemics, then forgotten and in any case unable to group around him either disciples or offspring."&lt;ref name="hhsantigher"/&gt; Writing in 2009, Antonio Patraş noted that the sociologist had "sunk into oblivion even when alive, later to be literally buried into the darkness of [[totalitarianism]]".&lt;ref name="apprintul"/&gt; In 2010, Adrian Jicu described Sanielevici as "almost unknown", despite the "revolutionary" role he had in the "[[interdisciplinary]]" study of literature,&lt;ref&gt;Jicu (2010), p.172, 176&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the pains Sanielevici took to make himself memorable as a "Dinaric" racial specimen.&lt;ref name="ajhsmeme"/&gt;

Some noted figures in cultural history were still inspired by Sanielevici's works in various ways. One Poporanist author is believed to have been directly influenced by Sanielevici during the ''Curentul Nou'' years: [[Octav Botez]], later in life a disciple of Ibrăileanu.&lt;ref name="el28"/&gt; As a young man, philosopher and religious scholar Mircea Eliade was "captivated" by one of Sanielevici's studies,&lt;ref name="mejournal4"/&gt; and "read all Sanielevici's books."&lt;ref name="meautob93"&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Autobiography: 1907-1937, Journey East, Journey West'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago &amp; London, 1990, p.93.  {{ISBN|0-226-20407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, he shared this passion with his high school teacher, the philosopher and socialist theorist [[Alexandru Claudian]], who described Sanielevici as an anthropologist "of genius".&lt;ref name="meautob93"/&gt; Sanielevici's work was reviewed by [[Adrian Marino]], the aspiring literary historian, in his debut essay—published in 1939 by George Călinescu's paper ''[[Jurnalul Literar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie Rad, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/4c340d04059a8187_187.pdf "Publicistica de tinereţe a lui Adrian Marino"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 187, June 2010, p.11; Vasile Spiridon, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VSPIRIDONapr5.html "Adrian Marino - filă de dicţionar"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By then, another young author, [[Petre Pandrea]], was shedding light on Sanielevici's Marxist roots, and declaring himself inspired by the critique of "reactionary" Poporanism,&lt;ref name="ggrasfoind7"/&gt; but also deploring his rejection of "peasantist" politics.&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', p.42, 174-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian censorship was reversed later during communism, with a spell of relative [[liberalization]]. [[Constantin Ciopraga]] inaugurated this recovery in 1964, when ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' published his study of Sanielevici's literary essays.&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; In 1968, [[Editura pentru literatură]], a state-run company, reissued ''Cercetări critice şi filosofice'' with [[Z. Ornea]] as editor.&lt;ref name="lmemnovalis59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apprintul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mironescu (2011), p.93-94, 101; Jicu (2010), p.174, 176; Ornea (1998), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea (according to Jicu, the "most important" of Sanielevici revivalists) also wrote a Sanielevici [[monograph]], part of the volume ''Trei esteticieni'' ("Three Aestheticians").&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], new steps were taken to reclaim and reassess the less debated aspects of Sanielevici's contribution to culture. In 2009, Jicu published with [[Cartea Românească]] a new monograph, widely considered an attempt to rekindle interest in the critic-anthropologist: ''Dinastia Sanielevici. Prinţul Henric, între uitare şi reabilitare'' ("The Sanielevici Dynasty. Prince Henric, in between Oblivion and Rehabilitation").&lt;ref name="cmlabelle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apprintul"/&gt; However, according to Jicu, there are few other 21st-century works dealing with Sanielevici's contribution.&lt;ref name="ajuitarea"/&gt; Mironescu argues that Jicu's own effort missed the mark: Sanielevici, he argues, was "compromised" and "defeated" by his own "tastelessness" and "over-the-top verbal violence".&lt;ref name="dmcefacem"/&gt;

==Background and publication history==
[[File:Nisargadatta Maharaj.jpg|thumb|Nisargadatta Maharaj (1897 – 1981)]]

Nisargadatta Maharaj met his guru, [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]], in 1933. Siddharameshwar died two and half years later, and Nisargadatta continued to practice what his guru had taught him while running a small shop in Khetwadi locality in [[Girgaon]], Mumbai. In 1951, after receiving an inner revelation from his guru, he began to give initiations. He allowed devotees to gather twice a day for satsang, with meditation, bhajan-singing, and the answering of questions, continuing until his death on 8 September 1981, at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Life and Teachings | url = http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/Nisargadatta_Maharaj.html | accessdate = 2014-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Frydman]], a Jewish refugee from Warsaw, came to India in the late 1930s. Initially, he worked at the State Government Electric Factory in Bangalore. Later, influenced by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], he worked in [[Aundh State]] (the present [[Satara district]]) on the [[Aundh Experiment]] for local self-governance.&lt;ref&gt;Alter, Joseph S. ''Gandhi's Body''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-3556-2}}. ''p. 92''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter he took ''[[sannyas]]'' (renunciation). He was associated with Sri [[Ramana Maharshi]] and [[J. Krishnamurti]]. Eventually he became a disciple of [[Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]] in the early days of Nisargadatta's spiritual work in 1965. Frydman spoke Marathi and so became a translator of Nisargadatta's talks. He recorded and compiled the sessions, leading to the publication of ''I Am That''.&lt;ref name=chapter6/&gt;

Most of the conversations were in Marathi, but for the benefit of Westerners talks were often translated. Frydman:
″Whenever I was present the task would fall to me. Many of the questions put and answers given were so interesting and significant that a tape-recorder was brought in. While most of the tapes were of the regular Marathi-English variety, some were [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] scrambles of several Indian and European languages. Later, each tape was deciphered and translated into English″
.&lt;ref name="AmThat"&gt;''I Am That'', Translator´s note&lt;/ref&gt;

All the conversations were recorded at Nisargadatta's small tenement and later transcribed and translated by Frydman while the master was still unknown to the Western public. A Marathi version of the talks, verified by Nisargadatta, was published separately.&lt;ref name="AmThat" /&gt;

According to Nisargadatta, "Maurice (Frydman) told me, 'Everything that is said here is immediately lost, though it could be of a great benefit for those looking for truth. I would like to translate and publish your words so others might know them. And so, he wrote ''I Am That''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogaenzaragoza.com/?id=134 Yoga en Zaragoza, Estudios tradicionales] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the book's publication, Nisargadatta became very popular: hundreds of foreigners started flocking to his small tenement, and Nisargadatta once remarked: ″I used to have a quiet life but the book ''I Am That'' by Maurice has turned my house into a railway station platform.″
&lt;ref name=chapter6&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/97304328/6/Chapter-6-With-Nisargadatta-Maharaj |title=Chapter 6 With Nisargadatta Maharaj for Maurice Frydman- a Jnani and a Karma Yogi |year=2012|publisher=Dr Srinivasan Nenmeli|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Am That'' was initially rejected by the major publishers, so Frydman worked with a then small publisher, Chetana Publications. The book was first published in 1973 in two hardcover volumes. The revised and enlarged second edition was published in one volume in 1976. The first paperback was published in 1984. The book is now published in the USA and Canada by The Acorn Press.

==Structure==

The book comprises 101 sections, each corresponding to a particular conversation, averaging four pages each and cast in a question-and-answer format. Most deal with a single issue but some go from one subject to other, always in line with the spiritual quest. The second edition includes an epilogue, ''Nisarga Yoga,'' by Maurice Frydman.

Nisargadatta's teachings are grounded in the Advaita Vedanta interpretation of the Advaita idea [[Tat Tvam Asi]], literally "That Thou Art", (Tat = "Absolute", Tvam = "You", Asi = "are") meaning "You are (actually) Absolute" (who think otherwise). Nisargadatta also had a strong devotion to his own guru, and suggested the path of devotion, [[Bhakti yoga]], to some of his visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nisargadatta.org/pages/teaching_style_nisargadatta_maharaj.html |title=The Style of Teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj |publisher=Nisargadatta.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nisargadatta deviated from the formal [[Navnath Sampradaya]] lineage style of teaching by giving informal discourses for the benefit of Western devotees who did not have access to [[Dasbodh]] or other texts, and who were not familiar with Indian traditions and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner-quest.org/Ranjit_Interview.htm |title=RANJIT MAHARAJ &amp;#124; meeting siddharameshwar |publisher=Inner-quest.org |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that Nisargadatta´s style was direct, and even at times aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgodman.org/interviews/nis1.shtml |title=Remembering Nisargadatta Maharaj |publisher=Davidgodman.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He very rarely mentioned scriptures or quoted spiritual books. His teachings came from his own experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hur Guler |url=http://nisargadatta.net/Navnath_Sampradaya.html |title=Nisargadatta Maharaj |publisher=Nisargadatta.net |date=1971-09-05 |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127101611/http://www.nisargadatta.net/Navnath_Sampradaya.html |archivedate=January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nisarga Yoga ==
Nisargadatta taught what has been called ''Nisarga Yoga'' (Nisarga can be translated as “the natural state”). In ''I Am That'', Nisarga Yoga is defined as living life with “harmlessness,” “friendliness,” and “interest,” abiding in “spontaneous awareness” while being “conscious of effortless living.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/994000117|title=Living the life that you are : finding wholeness when you feel lost, isolated, and afraid|last=Nic,|first=Higham,|isbn=9781684030859|location=Oakland, CA|oclc=994000117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of this form of [[Yoga]] involves meditating on one’s sense of "I am" or "being" with the aim of reaching its ultimate source, which Nisargadatta called the Self.

==Main themes==

===Identification with the body===

According to Nisargadatta and others&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/teachings]{{Interlanguage link multi||}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main blockages to self-realization is identification with the body.

“Once you give up your identification with the body, then you are all the time the Self, or Atman, only. For this, no effort is required. You only have to realize that you are not the body”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/Nisargadatta_My_Recollections.html |title=Nisargadatta Maharaj-My Recollections |publisher=Enlightened-spirituality.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation on the "I am" Feeling===

A most suitable way to drop the identification with the body is to focus in the source of consciousness, the feeling “I am”, which is not the body, the thoughts or anything observable. According to the sage of [[Mumbai]] whatever happens happens because “I am”; even if you doubt that, you have to be there to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', Chapter 51&lt;/ref&gt; “Yes, sadhana (practice) consists in reminding oneself forcibly of one's pure 'being-ness', of not being anything in particular”.&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', Chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrender to the Truth===

“Empty yourself”, “surrender” or “give up everything” is the advice to many visitors. Whatever your path is it ends with complete surrender to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', Chapter 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', Chapter 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', Chapter 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual Knowledge===

Conceptual knowledge cannot help the student progress. According to [[David Godman]], Nisargadatta “would clench his fist, bang it on the floor and shout ‘Kalpana! Kalpana!’ which means ‘Concept! Concept!’ That would sometimes be the only answer the questioners would get. Maharaj was definitely not interested in massaging visitor’s concepts. He wanted people to drop them, not discuss them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgodman.org/interviews/nis2.shtml |title=Remembering Nisargadatta Maharaj |publisher=Davidgodman.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earnestness===

Throughout the book the master insists on earnest, zestful&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', chapters 31, 88...&lt;/ref&gt; work towards spiritual progress and final attainment, liberation or ''Moksha''; “Earnestness is the sign of maturity”.&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', chapter 101&lt;/ref&gt; “You may choose any way that suits you; your earnestness will determine the rate of progress”.&lt;ref&gt;''I Am That'', chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other teachers==

Nisargadatta does not quote other teachers in the book, but a few are mentioned by his visitors, [[Ramana Maharshi]] being the most significant.&lt;ref&gt;I Am That, chapters 70, 90, 96, 63...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes from ''I Am That''==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Give up all questions except one, "Who am I?" After all the only fact you are sure of is that you "are". The "I am" is certain, the "I am this" is not. Struggle to find out what you are in reality. &lt;small&gt; (Chapter 21; Who Am I?)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be content with what you are sure of. And the only thing you can be sure of is "I am". Stay with it and reject everything else. This is Yoga.&lt;small&gt; (Chapter 36; Killing Hurts the Killer not the Killed)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Love says: "I am everything". Wisdom says: "I am nothing". Between the two my life flows.&lt;small&gt; (Chapter 57; Beyond the Mind There is no Suffering)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To deal with things, knowledge of things is needed. To deal with people, you need insight, sympathy. To deal with yourself, you need nothing. Be what you are — conscious being — and don't stray away from yourself. &lt;small&gt; (Chapter 66; All Search for Happiness is Misery)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jan Chozen Bays''' (born 1945), is a [[Zen]] teacher, author, mindful eating educator, and [[pediatrician]] specializing in work with abused children.

==Biography==
Jan Chozen Bays was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 9, 1945, the day the US dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. She grew up in East Greenbush, New York and spent two years in Korea. She received her undergraduate degree at Swarthmore College and earned her medical degree at the University of California at San Diego, specializing in pediatrics. Bays is a nationally recognized expert on child abuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It was after Bays began practicing Zen in a group the included [[Joko Beck|Charlotte Joko Beck]], Anne Seisen Saunders, and Jerry Shishin Wick in San Diego. She eventually moved to the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]] to study with the Japanese Zen teacher [[Taizan Maezumi]] Roshi. She served as the physician at the Zen Center’s community medical clinic. She was a student of [[Taizan Maezumi|Maezumi]] from 1977 until his death in 1995. She received dharma transmission from him in 1983 becoming his 4th dharma heir and, after Joko Beck, the second woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With her husband Laren Hogen Bays, since 1985 she has been a teacher at the Zen Community of Oregon, a Zen center or [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title= Karma: Buddhism's most misunderstood concept  |url= http://www.amarillo.com/stories/011101/bel_karma.shtml|publisher= [[Amarillo Globe News]] | first= Nancy |last=Haught |date= January 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chozen and Hogen Bays are also co-founders and co-abbots of [[Great Vow Zen Monastery]] of [[Clatskanie, Oregon]], which opened in 2002.

Chozen is a pediatrician specializing in child abuse, founded a child abuse clinic in Portland (called CARES) and has lectured on the subject throughout the U.S. and internationally. She is the author of several books.  {{cite book|title=Opening the hand of thought: Foundations of Zen Buddhist Practice |author1=Kosho Uchiyama |author2=Thomas Wright |author3=Jisho Cary Warner |author4=Shohaku Okumura |year=2004|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=0861713575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition |author= James William Coleman|year= 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195152417}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bays founded Heart of Wisdom Zen Temple in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zendust.org/history|title=Zen Community of Oregon history {{!}} Zen Community of Oregon|website=www.zendust.org|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14732">{{Kyoto School}}

The {{nihongo|'''Kyoto School'''|京都学派|Kyōto-gakuha}} is the name given to the Japanese philosophical movement centered at [[Kyoto University]] that assimilated [[western philosophy]] and religious ideas and used them to reformulate religious and moral insights unique to the East Asian cultural tradition.&lt;ref name="D.S. Clarke 1991"&gt;D.S. Clarke, Jr. "Introduction" in ''Nishida Kitaro'' by Nishitani Keiji, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also used to describe postwar scholars who have taught at the same university, been influenced by the foundational thinkers of Kyoto school philosophy, and who have developed distinctive theories of Japanese uniqueness. To disambiguate the term, therefore, thinkers and writers covered by this second sense appear under [[The Kyoto University Research Centre for the Cultural Sciences]].

Beginning roughly in 1913 with [[Kitaro Nishida|Kitarō Nishida]], it survived the serious controversy it garnered after [[World War II]] to develop into a well-known and active movement. However, it is not a "school" of philosophy in the traditional sense of the phrase, such as with the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. Instead, the group of academics gathered around Kyoto University as a ''de facto'' meeting place. Its founder, Nishida, steadfastly encouraged independent thinking.

According to James Heisig, the name "Kyoto School" was first used in 1932 by a student of Nishida and [[Hajime Tanabe]]. [[Jun Tosaka]] (1900–45) considered himself to be part of the '[[Neo-Marxism|Marxist left-wing]]' of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Heisig 2001, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the media and academic institutions outside Japan began to use the term. By the 1970s it had become a universally accepted term.

==History==
[[Masao Abe]] writes in his introduction to a new English translation of Nishida's magnum opus that if one thinks of philosophy in terms of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] or [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]], then there is no philosophy taking place in Japan. But if it is instead thought of in the tradition carried out by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], then Japan has a rich philosophical history, composed of the great thinkers [[Kūkai]], [[Shinran]], [[Dōgen]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Abe, "Introduction" in ''An Inquiry into the Good,'' 1987, (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of philosophers involved with the Kyoto School in its nearly 100-year history is a diverse one. Members often come from very different social backgrounds. At the same time, in the heat of intellectual debate they did not hesitate to criticise each other's work.

The following criteria roughly characterize the features of this school:

#Teaching at Kyoto University or at a nearby affiliated school.
#Sharing some basic assumptions about using Asian thought in the framework of Western philosophical tradition.
#Introducing and rationally investigating the meaning of "[[nothingness]]" and its importance in the history of philosophical debate.
#Expanding on the philosophical vocabulary introduced by Nishida.

Generally, most were strongly influenced by the German philosophical tradition, especially the thought of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]. In addition, many employed their cultural resources in formulating their philosophy and bringing it to play to add to the philosophical enterprise.

While their work was not expressly religious it was informed significantly by it. For example, [[Hajime Tanabe|Tanabe]] and [[Keiji Nishitani]] wrote on [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]] and identified common elements between the religions.&lt;ref&gt;Tanabe in ''Philosophy as Metanoetics'' and ''Demonstratio of Christianity'', and Nishitani in ''Religion and Nothingness'' and ''On Buddhism''.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, some scholars classify the intellectual products of the school as "religious philosophy."

Although the group was fluid and largely informal, traditionally whoever occupied the Chair of the Department of Modern Philosophy at the University of Kyoto was considered its leader. Nishida was the first, from 1913 to 1928. Hajime Tanabe succeeded him until the mid-1930s. By this time, Nishitani had graduated from Kyoto University, studied with [[Martin Heidegger]] for two years in [[Germany]], and returned to a teaching post since 1928. From 1955 to 1963, Nishitani officially occupied the Chair. Since his departure, leadership of the school crumbled — turning the movement into a very [[decentralized]] group of philosophers with common beliefs and interests.

==Significance of its notable members==
The significance of the group continues to grow, especially in American departments of religion and philosophy. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a growing interest in [[Eastern philosophy#Syntheses of Eastern and Western philosophy|East/West dialogue]], especially inter-faith scholarship. [[Masao Abe]] traveled to both coasts of the [[United States]] on professorships and lectured to many groups on Buddhist-Christian relations.

Although [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] was closely connected to the Kyoto School and in some ways critical to the development of thought that occurred there — he personally knew Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani — he is not considered a true member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lee, "Review of ''The Buddha Eye: An Anthology of the Kyoto School,''" in ''The Journal of Asian Studies,'' Vol.42, No.4 (Aug.,1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitaro Nishida===
{{Main|Kitaro Nishida}}
Nishida, the school's founder, is most known for his groundbreaking work ''[[An Inquiry into the Good]]'' and later for his elucidation of the "logic of ''basho''" (Japanese: 場所; usually translated as "place," or the Greek τόπος ''topos''). This brought him fame outside Japan and contributed largely to the attention later paid to philosophers from the Kyoto School.

Nishida's work is notable for a few reasons. Chief among them is how much they are related to the German tradition of philosophy since [[Schopenhauer]]. The logic of basho is a non-dualistic 'concrete' logic, meant to overcome the inadequacy of the subject-object distinction essential to the subject logic of [[Aristotle]] and the [[predicate logic]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], through the affirmation of what he calls the 'absolutely contradictory self-identity' — a dynamic tension of opposites that, unlike the dialectical logic of Hegel, does not resolve in a synthesis. Rather, it defines its proper subject by maintaining the tension between affirmation and negation as opposite poles or perspectives.

Nishitani describes East Asian philosophy as something very different from what the Western tradition of [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] or [[David Hume|Hume]] would indicate.
{{Quote|It is 'intuitive and practical,' with its emphasis on religious aspects of experience not lending themselves readily to theoretical description. True wisdom is to be distinguished from intellectual understanding of the kind appropriate to the sciences. The 'appropriation' of Nishida's thought,...'embraces difficulties entirely different from those of intellectual understanding'...and those who 'pretend to understand much but do not really understand, no matter how much they intellectually understand' are the object of his scorn.&lt;ref name="D.S. Clarke 1991"/&gt;}}

Nishida wrote ''The Logic of Place and the Religious Worldview,'' developing more fully the religious implications of his work and philosophy through "Absolute Nothingness," which "contains its own absolute self-negation within itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kyoto-school/#NisTopAbsNot The Kyoto School (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By this Nishida means that while the divine is dynamically paradoxical, it should not be construed as [[pantheism]] or [[transtheism|transcendent theism]]. 

Nishitani and Abe spent much of their academic lives dedicated to this development of nothingness and the Absolute, leading on occasion to ''[[panentheism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Hajime Tanabe===
{{Main|Hajime Tanabe}}

===Keiji Nishitani===
{{Main|Keiji Nishitani}}
Nishitani, one of Nishida's main disciples, became the doyen in the [[post-war period]]. Nishitani's works, such as his ''[[Religion and Nothingness]]'', primarily dealt with the Western notion of [[nihilism]], inherited from [[Nietzsche]], and religious interpretation of [[nothingness]], as found in the Buddhist idea of [[sunyata]] and the specifically Zen Buddhist concept of [[mu (negative)|mu]].

==Criticism==

Today, there is a great deal of critical research into the school's role before and during the [[Second World War]].

Hajime Tanabe bears the greatest brunt of the criticism for bringing his work on the "Logic of Species" into Japanese politics, which was used to buttress the militarist project to formulate [[imperialist]] ideology and [[propaganda]]. Tanabe's notion is that the logical category of "species" and nation are equivalent, and each nation or "species" provides a fundamental set of characteristics which define and determine the lives and outlooks of those who participate in it.

'''Livskunst''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] word that could be translated into "Art of Living", in a context meaning "... living a good and simple life". A person living this way me be called a ''livskunstner''. Typical for a livskunstner is his or her ability to fully enjoy the simple pleasures of life, enjoying the gifts from Mother Nature, the sounds of the birds and the waterfall, the smell of fresh baked bread or similar simple experiences. The expression does not exclude people who enjoy champagne, caviar or posh music, but the term is still focused on the simple way of life.

'''Meher Baba''' (born '''Merwan Sheriar Irani'''; 25 February 1894 &amp;nbsp;– 31 January 1969) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] spiritual master who said he was the [[Meher Baba#Perfect Masters and the Avatar|Avatar]], God in human form.&lt;ref&gt;''Awakener Magazine'', Volume 9, Number 4, 1964, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Awakener Magazine'', Volume 4, Number 2, 1956, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 2324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baba (1987) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Awakener Magazine'', Volume 11, Number 1, 1966, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Merwan Sheriar Irani was born in 1894 in [[Pune]], India to [[Irani (India)|Irani]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] parents. His spiritual transformation began when he was 19 years old and lasted for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson, Tom &amp; Dorothy: ''Much Silence'', Meher Baba Foundation Australia, 1974, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he contacted five spiritual teachers before beginning his own mission and gathering his own disciples in early 1922, at the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989) pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

From 10 July 1925 to the end of his life, Meher Baba maintained silence, communicating by means of an alphabet board or by unique hand gestures.&lt;ref name="Religion, Macmillan Publishing Company 1995, p. 346"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', Macmillan Publishing Company, 1995, vol. 9, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haynes 1989 p. 2"&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baba (2007) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; With his ''[[Mandali (Meher Baba)|mandali]]'' (circle of disciples), he spent long periods in seclusion, during which time he often fasted. He also traveled widely, held public gatherings and engaged in works of charity with [[Leprosy|lepers]] and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Meher Baba made the first of many visits to the West, where he attracted followers.&lt;ref name="Kalchuri 1986 p. 1405ff"&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 1405ff&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout most of the 1940s, Meher Baba worked with a category of spiritual aspirants called ''[[Mast (Sufism)|masts]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Donkin (2001) p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; whom he said are entranced or spellbound by internal spiritual experiences. Starting in 1949, along with selected ''mandali'', he traveled incognito about India in an enigmatic and still largely unexplained period he called the "[[New Life (Meher Baba)|New Life]]".&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

After being injured as a passenger in two serious automobile accidents, one in the United States in 1952 and one in India in 1956, his ability to walk became severely limited.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962, he invited his Western followers to India for a mass ''[[Darśana|darshan]]'' called "The East–West Gathering".&lt;ref&gt;''Awakener Magazine'', Volume 9, Number 1–2, 1963, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned by an increasing use of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and other [[psychedelic drug]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/CU50.html|last=Brecher|first=Edward M|year=1972|title=How LSD was popularized|publisher=Consumer Reports/Drug Library|accessdate=14 July 2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966 Baba stated that they did not convey real benefits.&lt;ref name="drug-use"&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 6399ff&lt;/ref&gt; Despite deteriorating health, he continued what he called his "Universal Work", which included fasting and seclusion, until his death on 31 January 1969. His ''[[Samadhi (shrine)|samadhi]]'' (shrine/tomb) in [[Meherabad]], India, has become a place of international pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989)  p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba gave numerous teachings on the cause and purpose of life, including teaching [[reincarnation]] and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, that God is what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain God-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', 7th edition, 1987. p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught about the concept of [[Perfect Master (Meher Baba)|Perfect Master]]s, the [[Avatar]], and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called [[Involution (Meher Baba)|involution]]. His most important teachings are recorded in his principal books ''[[Discourses (Meher Baba)|Discourses]]'' and ''[[God Speaks]]''.

His legacy includes the Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust he established in India, a handful of centers for information and pilgrimage, as well as an influence on pop-culture artists and the introduction of common expressions such as "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Meher Baba's silence has remained a mysterious issue as much among his followers as with the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 407&amp;nbsp;– "Why he ceased to speak and write Baba has explained only vaguely, though much natural curiosity is aroused; the first question asked when people come to know about him or to see him is why he does it. That both silence and nonwriting are of great significance is certain; not surprisingly Baba does not explain. Silence is the answer to silence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Baba's Silent Semiotic Output'', José Sanjinés, ''Signs and Society'', Vol. 2, No. S1, Supplement 2014, The University of Chicago Press, p. S121&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and works ==
===Early life===
[[File:Meherwan irani.jpg|thumb|upright|Meher Baba (as Merwan Irani) at 16 years old in 1910]]

Meher Baba was an [[Irani (India)|Irani]]&lt;ref&gt;In an Indian context, an Irani is a member of one of two groups of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] of that subcontinent, the other being the [[Parsi people|Parsis]]. They are called Iranis by other Indians because they spoke an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]]. "Those who left Iran soon after the advent of Islam to escape persecution, reached the shores of Gujarat 1,373 years ago. Their descendants are the Parsis. While the Zoroastrians who migrated to India from Iran relatively recently — 19th century onwards — are called Irani Zoroastrians." (quote from Padmaja Shastri,TNN, ''[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-03-21/pune/28342387_1_parsis-zoroastrian-youth-association-irani-zoroastrians What sets Zoroastrian Iranis apart]'', The Times of India, 21 March 2004. Retrieved 11 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Pune]], India to a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] family.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe"&gt;Sutcliffe (2002); p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; His given name was Merwan Sheriar Irani. He was the second son of Sheriar Irani, a Persian Zoroastrian who had spent years wandering in search of spiritual experience before settling in Poona (now [[Pune]]), and Shireen Irani.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964), pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, he formed the Cosmopolitan Club, which was dedicated to remaining informed in world affairs and donating money to charity.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 186–188&lt;/ref&gt; He was a multi-instrumentalist and poet. Fluent in several languages, he was especially fond of the poetry of [[Hafez]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 190–192&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, he had no mystical inclinations or experiences, and was "[u]ntroubled as yet by a sense of his own destiny..."&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson, Tom &amp; Dorothy:''Much Silence'', Meher Baba Foundation Australia, 1974, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He was more interested in sports and was co-captain of his high school [[cricket]] team. At the age of 19, during his second year at [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|Deccan College]] in Pune, he met an ancient Muslim woman, locally revered as a saint, named [[Hazrat Babajan]], who kissed him on the forehead. The event affected him profoundly and left leaving him visibly dazed. He gave up his normal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; After that he contacted other spiritual figures, who, along with Babajan, he later said were the five "[[Perfect Master (Meher Baba)|Perfect Master]]s" of the age, namely [[Tajuddin Muhammad Badruddin|Tajuddin Baba]], [[Narayan Maharaj]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]], and [[Upasni Maharaj]].&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Upasni Maharaj, he later said, helped him to integrate his mystical experiences with normal consciousness, thus enabling him to function in the world without diminishing his experience of [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]].&lt;ref&gt;''Listen Humanity'', ed. D. E. Stevens, 1982. pp. 247–250&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1921, at the age of 27, after living for seven years with Upasni, Merwan began to attract a following of his own. His early followers gave him the name Meher Baba (Compassionate Father).&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Meher Baba and his followers established Manzil-e-Meem (House of the Master) in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]). There, Baba commenced his practice of demanding strict discipline and obedience from his disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964), pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Baba and his [[Mandali (Meher Baba)|mandali]] moved to an area a few miles outside [[Ahmednagar]] that he named [[Meherabad]] (Meher flourishing).&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ashram]] would become the center for his work. During the 1920s, Meher Baba opened a school, hospital and dispensary at Meherabad., all three free and open to all [[caste]]s and faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 1925 onwards, Meher Baba initiated a life-long period of self-imposed silence, which would last forty-four years, until the end of his life. He now communicated by use of chalk and slate, then by an alphabet board and later via self-styled hand gestures.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1927 he gave up writing with pen or pencil also.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s – First contact with the West===
In the 1930s, Meher Baba began a period of extensive world travel and took several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of Western disciples.&lt;ref name="Kalchuri 1986 p. 1405ff"/&gt; He traveled on a Persian passport because he had given up writing as well as speaking and would not sign the forms required by the British government of India.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 1249&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baba dictating.jpg|thumb|left|Meher Baba dictating a message to a disciple in 1936 using his alphabet board]]

On his first trip to England in 1931, he traveled on the ''[[SS Rajputana]]'', the same ship that was carrying [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was sailing to the second [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]] in London. Baba and Gandhi had three meetings onboard, one of which lasted for three hours.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The British press publicized these meetings,&lt;ref&gt;See articles from the Daily Herald, 4 April 1932 (quoted in Kalchuri (1986), p. 1573) and from Sunday Express, April 1932 (quoted in Purdom (1964), p. 99)&lt;/ref&gt; but an aide to Gandhi said, "You may say emphatically that Gandhi never asked Meher Baba for help or for spiritual or other advice."&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Rom: "God Is My Adventure", ''Faber &amp; Faber'', London, 1936. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 1932, Baba arrived in New York and provided the press with a 1000 word written statement, which was described by devotee [[Quentin Tod]] as his "Message to America". In it, Baba proclaimed himself "one with the infinite source of everything" and declared his intention to break his silence. "When I speak, my original message will be delivered to the world and it will have to be accepted." When asked about the Indo-British political situation he had no comment, but his followers explained that he had told Gandhi to abandon politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Mystic in New York'', [[Associated Press]], 20 May 1932, The Lowell Sun&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Meher Baba Hopes to Elevate People Here to "Infinite State" He Enjoys. He Will Establish Spiritual Retreat at Harmon, N.Y., and Seek to Break Religious Barriers |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0CE0DD163EE633A25755C2A9659C946394D6CF&amp;legacy=true |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, Meher Baba met with a number of celebrities and artists, amongst them [[Gary Cooper]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Boris Karloff]], [[Tom Mix]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Rom: "God Is My Adventure", ''Faber &amp; Faber'', London, 1936. p. 108 Available as a [https://books.google.com/books?id=_9DxiBTKdJsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=God+Is+My+Adventure+by+Rom+Landau Google book]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1932, [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] held a reception for Baba at [[Pickfair]] at which he delivered a message to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) pp. 103–105&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Meher Baba emerged as "one of the enthusiasms of the '30s".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood 1973 p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, after announcing that he would break his self-imposed silence in the [[Hollywood Bowl]], Baba changed his plans abruptly and boarded the ''[[RMS Empress of Canada (1920)|RMS Empress of Canada]]'' and sailed to Hong Kong without explanation. The Associated Press reported that "Baba had decided to postpone the word-fast breaking until next February because 'conditions are not yet ripe'."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, 13 July 1932 , as cited Kalchuri (1986), p. 1670&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to England in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 2040ff&lt;/ref&gt; but did not return to the United States again until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 1661–1668&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, Meher Baba invited a group of Western women to join him in India, where he arranged a series of trips throughout India and [[Sri Lanka]] (then known as Ceylon) that became known as the Blue Bus Tours. When the tour returned home, many newspapers treated their journey as an occasion for scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 2338–2421&lt;/ref&gt; Time Magazine's 1936 review of ''God is my Adventure'' describes the US's fascination with the "long-haired, silky-mustached Parsee named Shri Sadgaru [sic] Meher Baba" four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848514-4,00.html |title=Men, Masters &amp; Messiahs |work=|date=20 April 1936 |accessdate=26 June 2008|publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s – Masts and the New Life ===
[[File:Wayf 154.jpg|thumb|upright|Meher Baba with a [[Mast (Sufism)|mast]] in Bangalore, 1940]]

In the 1930s and 1940s, Meher Baba worked extensively with [[Mast (Sufism)|mast]]s, persons "intoxicated with God".&lt;ref&gt;Donkin (2001) p. vff&lt;/ref&gt; According to Baba, these individuals are disabled by their enchanting experience of the higher spiritual [[Involution (Meher Baba)|planes]]. Although outwardly masts may appear irrational or insane, Baba claimed that their spiritual status was elevated, and that by meeting with them he helped them to move forward spiritually while enlisting their aid in his spiritual work.&lt;ref&gt;Donkin (2001) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known of these masts, known as Mohammed Mast, lived at Meher Baba's encampment at Meherabad until his death in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trustmeher.com/message/mohd02.htm A Tribute to Mohammed Mast]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Baba began an enigmatic period that he called the [[New Life (Meher Baba)|New Life]]. Following a series of questions on their readiness to obey even the most difficult of his requests, Baba selected twenty companions to join him in a life of complete "hopelessness and helplessness".&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

He made provisions for those dependent on him, after which he and his companions otherwise gave up nearly all property and financial responsibilities. They traveled about India incognito while begging for food and carrying out Baba's instructions in accordance with a strict set of "conditions of the New Life". These included absolute acceptance of any circumstance and consistent good cheer in the face of any difficulty. Companions who failed to comply were sent away.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) pp. 163–176&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the New Life Meher Baba wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This New Life is endless, and even after my physical death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely for the sake of loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meher Baba ended the New Life in February 1952&lt;ref&gt;Purdom, (1964), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; and once again began a round of public appearances throughout India and the West.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 3762&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1950s – ''God Speaks'' and automobile accidents ===
In the 1950s, Baba established two centers outside of India, namely the [[Meher Spiritual Center]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] in the United States and [[Avatar's Abode]] near [[Brisbane]], Australia. He inaugurated the Meher Spiritual Center in April 1952. On 24 May 1952, en route from the Spiritual Center to Meher Mount in [[Ojai, California]], the car in which he was a passenger was struck head-on near [[Prague, Oklahoma]]. He and his companions were thrown from the vehicle and suffered many injuries. Baba's leg was severely broken and he sustained facial injuries which included a broken nose. The injured were treated at [[Duke University Hospital|Duke Hospital]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], after which they returned to Myrtle Beach to recuperate.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 3834–3840&lt;/ref&gt; While recuperating at Youpon Dunes, a home owned by Elizabeth Patterson, in Myrtle Beach, he worked on the charter for a group of Sufis, which he named [[Sufism Reoriented]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glimpses of the God-Man, Meher Baba'', vol. 3, by Bal Natu, Sheriar Press, 1982, pp. 64, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba began dictating his major book, ''[[God Speaks|God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose]]'', using an alphabet board in [[Dehradun]], August 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 4208&lt;/ref&gt;  In September of 1954, Meher Baba gave a men-only [[sahavas]] at Meherabad that later became known as the Three Incredible Weeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Incredible Weeks with Meher Baba: 11–30 September 1954'', by Charles Purdom &amp; Malcolm Schloss, Sheriar Press, 1979, pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Baba issued a declaration, "Meher Baba's Call", wherein he once again affirmed his Avatarhood "irrespective of the doubts and convictions" of others.&lt;ref&gt;Meher Baba: "Meher Baba's Call", Pamphlet, 12 September 1954&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this sahavas Meher Baba gave the completed manuscript of his book ''God Speaks'' to two members of [[Sufism Reoriented]], Ludwig H. Dimpfl and Don E. Stevens, for editing and publication in America.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 4551&lt;/ref&gt; The book was subsequently published by [[Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.|Dodd, Mead and Company]] the following year.

On 30 September 1954 Meher Baba gave his Final Declaration message, in which he made enigmatic predictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambppct.org/messages.php#final The Final Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1954, Meher Baba discarded his alphabet board and began using a unique set of hand gestures to communicate, which he used for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 4457, 4464&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 1956, outside [[Satara (city)|Satara]], India, the car in which Baba was being driven went out of control and a second serious automobile accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured [[pelvis]] and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's [[Mandali (Meher Baba)|mandali]], was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1986) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, Baba began to walk again after great effort, but from that point on he was in [[chronic pain|constant pain]] and was severely limited in his ability to move. During his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 5450&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, during his fifth visit to the US, Baba stayed at New York's [[Trump Park Avenue|Hotel Delmonico]] before traveling to the Meher Center at [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. In July he traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] and received friends and disciples at the home of Mrs. James Terry (Ivy) Duce,&lt;ref&gt;''Awakener Magazine'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 38–39 {{cite web |url=http://www.avatarmeherbaba.org/erics/heroines7c.html |title=Heroines of the Path, Part 7C |work= |accessdate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; wife of the vice-president of the [[Saudi Aramco|Arabian American Oil Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;''Man hasn't spoken in 31 years'', Big Spring Daily Herald, 30 June 1957 ''Note: this article identifies the visit as Meher Baba's 10th US visit, and places the planned date as July 1957, not 1956 as generally accepted.''&lt;/ref&gt; He then traveled to Meher Mount at [[Ojai, California]] before continuing on to Australia. His final visits to the United States and Australia were made in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 5457&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960s – Later years and message on drugs ===
In 1962, Baba gave one of his last public functions, a series of meetings he called ''The East-West Gathering.'' At these meetings, at which his western followers were invited to meet his Indian disciples, Baba gave [[Darśana|darshan]] to many thousands of people despite the physical strain this caused him.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 6000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s Baba became concerned with the drug culture in the West and began correspondences with several Western academics, including [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]], in which he discouraged the use of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs for spiritual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 6412ff&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Baba's responses to questions on drugs were published in a pamphlet titled ''[[God in a Pill?]]'' Meher Baba stated that drug use was spiritually damaging and that if enlightenment were possible through drugs then "God is not worthy of being God".&lt;ref&gt;''God in a Pill? Meher Baba on L.S.D. and The High Roads'', Sufism Reoriented, Inc. 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Meher Baba instructed his young Western disciples to spread this message; in doing so, they increased awareness of Meher Baba's teachings. In an interview with Frederick Chapman, a Harvard graduate and [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholar who met Baba during a year of study in India, Baba described [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] as "harmful physically, mentally and spiritually", and warned that "[its continued use] leads to madness or death".&lt;ref name=UPI07271967&gt;''Spiritual Leader Warning on LSD'', United Press International, 27 July 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

An anti-drug campaign was initiated by Baba lovers in the United States, Europe and Australia. The campaign was mostly futile,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, 'Something on an Inner Level,' Glow International Feb 1990, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; but won Baba new followers, and some of Baba's views found their way into academic debate on the merits and dangers of hallucinogens.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Moraczewski, 'Psychedelic Agents and Mysticism,' Psychosomantics Vol. 12:2 (1971), 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

From the East-West Gathering of 1962 onward, Baba's health deteriorated. Despite the physical toll it took on his body, he continued to undergo periods of seclusion and fasting.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989)  p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 1968, Baba completed a particularly taxing period of seclusion and stated that by then his work was "completed 100% to my satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;''Awakener Magazine'', Volume 13 Number 3-4, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He was by then using a wheelchair. Within a few months, his condition had worsened and he was bedridden, wracked by [[spasm|muscle spasms]] that had no clear medical origin. Despite the care of several doctors the spasms worsened.&lt;ref name="Kalchuri 1986 p. 6713"&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 6713&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and aftermath===
On 31 January 1969, Meher Baba died at his home in Meherazad.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7/2/14,&lt;/ref&gt; He conveyed by his last gestures, "Do not forget that I am God."&lt;ref name="Kalchuri 1986 p. 6713"/&gt; In time, his devotees called the anniversary of his death ''[[Amartithi]]'' (deathless day). Meher Baba's body [[Lying in state|lay in state]] at his [[Samadhi of Meher Baba|samadhi]] at [[Meherabad]]. Covered with roses, and cooled by ice, his body was kept available to the public for one week before its final burial.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 6735&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to his death, Meher Baba had made extensive preparations for a public [[Darśana|darshan]] program to be held in Poona. His mandali decided to proceed with the arrangements despite the absence of the host. Several thousand attended this "Last Darshan," including many hundreds from the United States, Europe, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;James Ivory, The Talk of the Town, "Jai Baba!", The New Yorker, 21 June 1969, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silence==
From 10 July 1925, until his death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent.&lt;ref name="Religion, Macmillan Publishing Company 1995, p. 346"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haynes 1989 p. 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 738 "Meher Baba had observed silence three times before, but the silence beginning July 10th, 1925, was to last until the end of his life."&lt;/ref&gt; He communicated first by using an alphabet board and later by unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, usually by his disciple Eruch Jessawala.&lt;ref name="purdom52"&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Meher Baba said that his silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Man's inability to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man has given way to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambppct.org/messages.php#u_message |title=The Universal Message |author=Meher Baba |publisher=Avatar Meher Baba Perpetual Public Charitable Trust |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pointingalphabet.jpg|thumb|From 1925 until 1954 Meher Baba communicated by pointing to letters on an alphabet board.]]

Meher Baba often signaled the moment "that he would 'break' his silence by speaking the 'Word' in every heart, thereby giving a spiritual push forward to all living things".&lt;ref&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I break My Silence, the impact of My Love will be universal and all life in creation will know, feel and receive of it. It will help every individual to break himself free from his own bondage in his own way. I am the Divine Beloved who loves you more than you can ever love yourself. The breaking of My Silence will help you to help yourself in knowing your real Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullman|first=Robert |author2=Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman |title=Mystics, Masters, Saints, and Sages|publisher=RedWheel / Weiser|year=2001|isbn=1-57324-507-0}}page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to him, the breaking of his silence would be a defining event in the spiritual evolution of the world.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I speak that Word, I shall lay the foundation for that which is to take place during the next seven hundred years.&lt;ref name="Haynes 1989 p.67"&gt;Haynes (1989) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On many occasions Meher Baba promised to break his silence with an audible word before he died,&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; often stating a specific time and place when this would occur,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Kalchuri (1986), pp. 900, 915, 5648, 5655, 5787, 5807, 6015, 6024, 6027, 6037, 6105, 6061, 6090, 6151, 6166, 6170, 6172, 6206, 6164, 6318, 6319, 6341, 6370,, 6425, 6532, 6548, 6579, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to all contemporary accounts, Meher Baba remained silent until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Two close disciples have reported hearing Baba speak or make sounds in the days preceding his death. In 1992, Eruch Jessawala, a close disciple of Meher Baba, recalled that "a few days before Meher Baba dropped his body [...]Meher Baba had covered his mouth with his hand and shouted with great intensity:...'Mmmmmmm!'" [''Glow International'', May 1992, pp. 13-18]. Similarly, [[Bhau Kalchuri]] recalled in 2001 "Baba actually spoke two words to Bhau: 'Yad rakh [remember this]!' and then gestured, 'I am not this body!'[...]'Although Baba's voice was feeble,' Bhau recalled, 'the sound was audible and clear, and its intensity and impact very, very forceful. It conveyed so great an impression, that my mind itself neither registered nor questioned the fact that Baba was speaking." [see {{cite book|last= Kalchuri |first=Bhau|title=Lord Meher|publisher=Meher Mownavani Publications|year=2005|edition=Second (India)|volume=Volume 8|page=4765}}] although this recollection contradicted his own earlier accounts [see Kalchuri (1986) p. 6710] and Kalchuri later clarified those recollections, saying that actual words had not been spoken [''Glow International'', Spring 2012, page 3].&lt;/ref&gt; His failure to break his silence disappointed some of his followers, while others regarded these broken promises as a test of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 1668&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his followers speculate that "the Word" will yet be "spoken" or that Meher Baba broke his silence in a spiritual rather than a physical way.&lt;ref name="Haynes 1989 p.67"/&gt;

Baba, for many years, asked his followers to undertake austerities on 10 July, the anniversary of the day his silence began, such as keeping silence, fasting and praying. In his final [[Silence Day]] request to his followers in 1968, he asked only that they keep silent.&lt;ref&gt;''Glimpses of the God-Man, Meher Baba'', vol. 6, by Bal Natu, Sheriar Foundation, 1994, p. 77 – "I want all my lovers to observe complete silence for twenty-four hours, from midnight of July 9th to midnight of July 10th, 1968."&lt;/ref&gt; Many  followers continue to celebrate Silence Day by keeping silence in his honor.

==Teachings==
Meher Baba's teachings can roughly be divided into two main categories: his metaphysics on the nature of the soul and the Universe, and practical advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His [[metaphysics]] is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, ''[[God Speaks]]''. It contains detailed statements on his [[cosmology]] and the purpose of life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in ''[[Discourses (Meher Baba)|Discourses]]'', although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying ''God Speaks''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambppct.org/library.php Avatar Meher Baba Trust Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''God Speaks''===
{{main|God Speaks}}
In ''God Speaks'', Meher Baba describes the journey of the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an ocean of infinite size.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks'', Revised 2nd edition, 1997, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Each soul, powered by the desire to become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks'', Revised 2nd edition, 1997, pp. 8–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Baba, each soul pursues conscious divinity by evolving, that is, experiencing itself in a succession of imagined forms through seven "kingdoms" of stone/metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird, animal, and human.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks'', Revised 2nd edition, 1997, pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt; The soul identifies itself with each successive form, becoming thus tied to illusion. During this evolution of forms, the power of thought increases, until in human form thought becomes infinite. Although in human form, the soul is capable of conscious divinity, all the impressions that it has gathered during evolution are illusory ones that create a barrier against the soul knowing itself. For this barrier to be overcome, further births in human form are needed in a process known as [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks'', Revised 2nd edition, 1997, pp. 31-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul will reach a stage where its previously gathered impressions grow thin or weak enough that it enters a final stage called [[Involution (Meher Baba)|involution]]. This stage also requires a series of human births, during which the soul begins an inner journey, by which it realizes its true identity as God. Baba breaks this inner journey of Realization into seven stages he called "planes." The process culminates, at the seventh plane, with [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]], at which the goal of life for the soul is reached.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks'', Revised 2nd edition, 1997, pp. 41–54&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Discourses''===
{{main|Discourses (Meher Baba)}}
The ''Discourses'' are a collection of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some of the most important topics treated are: [[Discourses (Meher Baba)#Sanskaras|sanskaras]] (mental impressions), [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, [[reincarnation]], [[karma]], violence and non-violence, [[meditation]], love, discipleship, and God-realization.&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', 7th edition, 1987, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, [[Layla and Majnun|Majnun and Layla]], show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', 7th edition, 1987, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Meher Baba offers many suggestions that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding as to why some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', 7th edition, 1987, pp. 5, 42, 46, 53, 62, 65, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Many chapters offer a better understanding of the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', 7th edition, 1987, pp. 26, 61, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perfect Masters and the Avatar ===
{{main|Perfect Master (Meher Baba)}}
Baba related that there are 56 incarnate God-realized souls on [[Earth]] at any given time. Of these souls there are always five who constitute the [[Perfect Master (Meher Baba)#The Five Perfect Masters|five Perfect Masters]] of their era.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 944&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the five Perfect Masters dies, according to Baba, another God-realized soul among the 56 would replaces him or her at once.&lt;ref&gt;Adriel, Jean.''Avatar: The Life Story of the Perfect Master, Meher Baba'' (1947), p. 49 , J. F. Rowny press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Avatar]], according to Baba, is a special Perfect Master, the first soul to achieve God-realization. This soul, the ''original'' Perfect Master, or Ancient One, never ceases to incarnate. Baba indicated that this particular soul personifies the state of God called [[Vishnu]] in [[Hinduism]] and [[Parvardigar]] in [[Sufism]], i.e. the sustainer or preserver state of God. The Avatar, in Baba's testimony, appears on Earth every 700–1400 years and is "brought down" into human form by the five Perfect Masters of the time to aid in the process of moving creation in its never-ending journey toward Godhood. Baba claimed that in other ages this role had been fulfilled by [[Zoroaster]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], and [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Path of Love'', by Meher Baba, Sheriar Press, US, 2000, p. 30.
(originally published in 1976 by Samuel Weiser, New York)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baba described the Avatar as "a gauge against which man can measure what he is and what he may become. He trues the standard of human values by interpreting them in terms of divinely human life."&lt;ref&gt;Meher Baba: "Discourses", ''Sufism Reoriented'', 6th ed., 1967. Vol III, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Meher Baba's followers accept his claim of avatarhood&lt;ref name=Choquette&gt;''New Religious Movements in the United States and Canada: A Critical Assessment and Annotated Bibliography''. Contributors: Diane Choquette – compiler. Publisher: Greenwood Press. Place of Publication: Westport, CT. Publication Year: 1985. Page Number: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is said to be "revered by millions around the world as the Avatar of the age and a God-realized being".&lt;ref name=UPI07271967 /&gt;

==Legacy==
Baba's travels and teachings left a legacy of followers and devotees worldwide.&lt;ref name="Religion, Macmillan Publishing Company 1995, p. 346"/&gt;

The Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust, established by Meher Baba in 1959, maintains his tomb and pilgrimage facilities, as well as a free school and dispensary, a [[cataract]] clinic, and a veterinary clinic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambppct.org/medical.php Medical facilities at the Trust] [http://www.ambppct.org/education.php Educational programs at the Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust follows the charter left for it by Meher Baba in his lifetime, but does not act as spiritual authority over groups. Likewise, the Trust does not engage in propaganda, promote creeds or dogmas, or seek converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambppct.org/arts.php Avatar Meher Baba Trust Website] "Meher Baba never wanted nor encouraged propaganda. The Trust does not, accordingly, work to promote creeds or dogmas, nor does it seek "converts"."&lt;/ref&gt; Baba discouraged evangelizing, stating, "I need no propaganda or publicity."&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Meher (1954): [http://www.avatarmeherbaba.org/erics/realwork.html "What Baba Means by Real Work"], Universal Spiritual League in America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, he encouraged his followers to "let your life itself be my message of love and truth to others"&lt;ref&gt;Luck, Irwin: "The Silent Master Meher Baba", 1967. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and to "spread my message of Love and Truth as far and wide as possible".&lt;ref&gt;Purdom (1964) p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of Meher Baba have no established rituals. Many do, however, perform practices of choice such as [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s, [[aarti]]s, prayers, music, plays, viewing films of Baba and so forth, but the choice is personal.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1977) pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus for followers is living a life Meher Baba would approve of, for example, refraining from the use of [[psychedelic drug]]s, including [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]],&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern Mysticism and the Resocialization of Drug Users: The Meher Baba Cult'', Thomas Robbins, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 8, No. 2 (Autumn, 1969), pp. 308–317&lt;/ref&gt; and trying to remember God with love.
[[File:Meher Baba Samadhi2.jpg|thumb|left|Meher Baba's tomb in Meherabad]]

Gatherings of Baba followers are generally informal. Special effort is made to gather together on [[Amartithi]], the anniversary of Baba's death, and on his birthday. Many Baba followers keep silent on 10 July ([[Silence Day]]), observing the request Baba frequently made of his followers during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) pp. 5476, 4933, 5609, 6465, 2294, 3179, 3864, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aarti]] is performed  morning and evening at [[Samadhi of Meher Baba|Baba's samadhi]] in India. Also at [[Meherabad]], his followers maintain Baba's practice of lighting a [[dhuni]] fire on the 12th of each month.

Although Baba had initially begun gaining public attention in the West as early as 1932 as the result of contacts with some celebrities of the time and from the rather disillusioned account of [[Paul Brunton]] (''A Search in Secret India'', 1934),&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, Paul, ''A Search in Secret India'', First published in England by Rider &amp; Co., London, (1934), First American publication, New York, S. Weiser, (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; he received further attention after his death through various mentions in western pop-culture.

[[Pete Townshend#Religion|Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]], who became a follower of Baba, dedicated his 1969 rock-opera ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' to Meher Baba in the record's [[gatefold]].&lt;ref&gt;"Tommy", The Who, Gatefold cover acknowledgements, 23 May 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The Who's 1971 song "[[Baba O'Riley]]" was named in part after Meher Baba,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite AV media notes|title=The Who: The Ultimate Collection|titlelink=The Ultimate_Collection (The_Who_album)|others=The Who|year=2002|pages=12|publisher=MCA Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Townshend recorded several Meher Baba tribute albums including ''[[Happy Birthday (Pete Townshend album)|Happy Birthday]]'',
''[[I Am (Pete Townshend album)|I Am]]'', ''[[Who Came First]]'', and ''[[With Love (Pete Townshend album)|With Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewho.info/PTAlbums.htm The Who - Pete Townshend Albums]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 [[Melanie Safka]] mentioned Baba in her song "[[Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)]]" with the lyrics "Meher Baba lives again".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/melanie+safka/candles+in+the+rain_20605400.html Lyric Freaks – Melanie Safka Candles In The Rain Lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s 1988 [[Grammy Award]]-winning song "[[Don't Worry, Be Happy]]" was inspired by a popular quote of Baba seen in numerous Baba posters and inspirational cards.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fessier, ''USA Weekend Magazine'', 21–23 October 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of Meher Baba's philosophy, as well as a character based on Baba but unnamed, have also frequently appeared in works of comic book writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]], including ''[[Doctor Fate]]'' and ''Seekers Into The Mystery''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmdematteis.com/2013/02/avatar-meher-baba-short-answer.html jmdematteis.com – Avatar Meher Baba: the Short Answer]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the feature film ''[[Nema Aviona za Zagreb]]'' premiered in the Netherlands with an exclusive interview with Meher Baba filmed in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyefilm.nl/nema-aviona-za-zagreb EYE film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228011936/http://www.eyefilm.nl/nema-aviona-za-zagreb |date=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview Baba explains the difference between [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]] and drug-induced hallucinations&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri (1986) p. 6531&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Draaiboek, Nema Aviona Za Zagreb, Een film van Louis van Gasteren, Eeen Spectrum Film Publicatie'', (2012), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; and the scene plays a pivotal role in the documentary's narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Seventy Fourth Family Letter, 1 September 1967, ''82 Family Letters'', Mani S. Irani, Sheriar Foundation, 1976. "The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension." (Louis van Gasteren to Meher Baba in 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayers are often derived from devotional prayer books, or consist of the recitation of the [[rosary]] (a "rosary novena"), or of short prayers through the day.  Novena prayers are customarily printed in small booklets, and the novena is often dedicated to a specific [[angel]], [[saint]], a specific Marian title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], or it invokes one of the personages of the [[Holy Trinity]]. In the Catholic tradition, much used novena prayers include doctrinal statements in addition to a personal petition. The doctrinal part of the prayers are studied by its ecclesiastical staff, like formal translations of Christian scripture, and officially declared to be free of doctrinal errors with ''[[Nihil obstat]]'' and ''[[Imprimatur]]''.&lt;ref name=wiseman251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Singer-Towns|title=The New American Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3MO0Ty95SwC&amp;pg=PP3|year=2005|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|isbn=978-0-88489-863-4|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Novenamgue.jpg|thumb|Novena likely has roots in ancient funeral-related rituals. Above: a group gathered for a novena to [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], most likely a mourning event (circa 1940). ]]
The word ''Novena'' is rooted in the Latin word for nine. The practice of the novena is based in early Christianity, where Masses were held for nine days with devotional prayers to someone who has died.&lt;ref name=kane96&gt;{{cite book|author=Paula Kane |editor=James M. O'Toole|title=Habits of Devotion: Catholic Religious Practice in Twentieth-century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=re7swvoBVQAC|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-7255-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice may trace its origins to an early [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom performed by families, consisting of nine days of mourning after the death of a loved one, followed by a feast, which originally prompted Catholic writers such as [[St. Augustine]], Pseudo-Alcuin and John Beleth to warn Christians not to emulate the custom.&lt;ref name=hilger&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11141b.htm  Hilgers, Joseph. "Novena." ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 20 Dec. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, members of [[Roman Catholic]] faith began to associate novena with Christian themes such as the nine months Jesus spent in the womb, the giving up of His spirit at the ninth hour, and the event which occurred in the ''Upper Room'' with [[Twelve Apostles]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] when they prayed for nine days until the [[Holy Spirit]] descended on the Feast of the [[Pentecost]]. In the [[New Testament]], this biblical event is often quoted from [[Acts of the Apostles]], 1:12 – 2:5. The Church Fathers also assigned special meaning to the number nine, seeing it as symbolic of imperfect man turning to God in prayer (due to its proximity with the number ten, symbolic of perfection and God).&lt;ref name="hilger"/&gt;

===Papal recognition===
The practice of novena grew by the Middle Ages to include pious prayers for nine days before a feast in honor of a saint identified on a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref name=kane96/&gt; By the 11th century, the novena practice had become a means in Christianity of praying to petition spiritual or personal favor through a saint, such as Virgin Mary. After the Reformation and Counter-reformation era, the Catholic Church formally approved novenas, in particular through the papal approvals of a large number of novenas by [[Pope Pius IX]].&lt;ref name=kane96/&gt;

[[File:Ostrabrama-prayer.jpg|thumb|240px|A group of women praying to ''[[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]]'' in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] for petitions. The leader is on the far left.]]
In the Roman Catholic Church, there are four recognized categories of novenas which belong to more than one of these categories:&lt;ref name=hilger/&gt;

* Mourning, or in anticipation of a Burial
* In anticipation of a Church Feast or ending in Vespers (often requires [[Church attendance]])
* Individual or Group Petition (Expiatory)
* Indulgence for the remission of Sins (often requires Sacrament of Confession or Church attendance)

By standard liturgical norms, novenas are performed in church, at home, or anywhere where solemn prayers are appropriate, though some indulgenced novenas require church attendance. Sometimes, a special candle or incense is lit at the beginning of the novena which burns during the nine days of prayer. The first chapter of the ''General Principles'' of [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]], #13 is often cited as a guideline regarding the implementations of public novenas.&lt;ref&gt;SacroSanctum Concillium. Chapter 1: Number: XIII. http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help - Baclaran copy. with Imprimatur.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, novena prayers typically include of a praise of the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ or saint, acknowledgment of the Christian doctrines, and a personal petition. Other than the petition, the rest of much used prayers used in a public setting is studied by the clergy and then approved to be free from doctrinal and moral errors. The approval is given in the form of an [[Imprimatur]], [[Nihil Obstat]], and [[Imprimi potest]]. These ecclesiastical approval are usually granted by a [[bishop]] or any ranking prelate for publication and approval.&lt;ref name=wiseman251&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Patrick Wiseman|title=The Dublin Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nf4IAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA251|year=1878|publisher=Burns and Oates|pages=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals===
[[File:NConsecrationImmaculateHeartMaryjf9999 12.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|The statues of Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary at a church consecration.]]
A novena is a ritualistic devotional worship where one or more Christian devotees make petitions, implore favors, or obtain graces by honoring the statue of [[Jesus Christ]], [[Virgin Mary]] or the saints of the faith who are believed to empower divine intervention.&lt;ref name="Anatolios2009p140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Carson|title=New Catholic Encyclopedia: Mos-Pat |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ4KAQAAMAAJ |edition=2nd|year=2003| publisher=Thomson/Gale|isbn=978-0-7876-4004-0|pages=465–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sosa | first=Juan J. | title=Illness and Healing in Hispanic Communities | journal=Liturgy | publisher=Routledge | volume=2 | issue=2 | year=1982 | pages=64–67 | doi=10.1080/04580638209408609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fenella Cannell – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Christianity, a Novena is "a supplicatory act of worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fenella Cannell|title=The Anthropology of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wO0pTd_UzlkC |year=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3646-4|pages=74 note 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian communities of Philippines and Latin America, novena traditions include devotional rituals in front of an altar, with nine levels where the Holy Cross is placed at the top.&lt;ref name=kuss163/&gt; These are lit up with candles, decorated with flowers and other ritual items. Additionally, the space may have many statues decorated, and these statues typically include those of Virgin Mary, Apostles and saints of regional significance. The first day, the votive candles are placed on level one, and with each day the candles are raised by one level towards the Holy Cross. Further, each day includes congregational prayers, hymn singing with music, private and public devotionals. Some novenas include, sometimes on the last day, community fiesta events over beverages, refreshments or processions.&lt;ref name=toole114&gt;{{cite book|author=James M.

Rosary Novena is linked to religious death rituals. Among the Filipino Catholic Christians, the Rosary Novena has been a prayer practice for nine days starting the day when someone dies, with formal funeral services timed to the ninth day.&lt;ref name="Nadeau2011p350"/&gt; Elsewhere, the day of funeral service or when the body is interred is timed to local customary practices, while the nine day novena is held at the home of the deceased as elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H.

==Regional practices==

===Africa===
Various denominations of Christianity in Africa have introduced regional novena practices that offer devotional prayers, clapping, waving, singing and shouting together in front of statues. However, some practices are unique to Africa. For example, the novena devotionalism in [[Ghana]] includes on each of the nine nights, after the loud prayers, the blood-covering of Jesus, where the devotees stain themselves considering it to be symbolism for the blood of Christ.&lt;ref name="Gifford1998p96"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gifford|title=African Christianity: Its Public Role |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwQo5KmRmWYC&amp;pg=PA96 |year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21204-7|pages=96–97 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the coastal West African Christian communities, novena is a means of petitioning God through worship and fasting, along with traditional rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Roy Moodley|editor2=Marguerite Lengyell|editor3=Rosa Wu|editor4=Uwe P.

{{Quote|
Their [Catholic clergy] healing sessions are theatric, hysterical, loud and really engaging to the extent that some people fall to the ground and others feel the power of God piercing through their bodies. Some of the strong willed Catholics have taken up Novena after Novena seeking divine intervention in a sickness or misfortune. In short, there is a great yearning and thirsting for a religion that delivers quick answers to people’s problems which range from misfortunes to dealing with illness and death.

===Europe and North America===
[[File:Teca padre pio - panoramio.jpg|thumb|240px|A woman praying to [[Padre Pio]] in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]], with petitions.]]
Devotional and paraliturgical novenas have been common in Europe as well as European settlers in North America. These have included public worship such as Mass and private praying with religious items such as a rosary and images particularly related to the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="OToole2004p1"/&gt; According to James M. O'Toole – a professor of History specializing in American Catholic history, the period between World War I and mid 1950s were the "heyday of American Catholic devotionalism".&lt;ref name="OToole2004p52"/&gt; This period witnessed novena devotionalism along with popularity of sodalities, confraternities, devotion to saints, meatless Fridays, holy cards, rosary, cross and eucharistic practices.&lt;ref name="OToole2004p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M.

The novena had strong roots in ethnic neighborhoods, and devotional worship had sociopolitical links, offered a sense of communal security through religious symbols in a period of uncertainty and fear.&lt;ref name="OToole2004p52"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M.

In [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]], novena practices continue. For example, novenas among the faithful in the [[Czech Republic]] include nine hour prayers dedicated to the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], where the devotee can plead personal urgent needs before the statue of the Christ Child if he or she wants to, and on May 27 every year, the statue is ceremoniously paraded through the streets of [[Prague]] with prayers and songs.&lt;ref name="Brockman2011p237"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norbert C.

In Catholic Ireland, states Gladys Ganiel – a professor of Religion, devotional practices such as novenas have been popular. The cultural acceptance of devotional worship has been historically high, and those Irish who themselves do not perform novenas, nevertheless respect those who do. Some of their Catholic ritual practices were repressed by the British state during the 18th and 19th centuries, but repression and criticism only increased the resolve of the Irish to persist in their ways of practicing their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladys Ganiel|title=Transforming Post-Catholic Ireland: Religious Practice in Late Modernity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AaeKCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-107438-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, annual novenas are observed in some regions such as in Montreal, Canada, where between March 10 and 19 the annual novena ends in a feast of Saint Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norbert C.

These novenas are prayers believed to create a contact between the saint and the devotee, and thereby invoke divine intervention in whatever problem or anxiety is important to the devotee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claude F.

===Latin America===
The novena has been an important part of Christianity in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], both among the native Indian communities who converted to Christianity under the colonial Spanish or Portuguese rule, as well as the diverse communities that formed anew from millions of slaves and indentured laborers brought to the Americas from different parts of Africa and Asia. The devotional prayers are dedicated to statues of Jesus Christ, Madonna and various saints. They are also a part of ''velorio'' (wake) after the death of someone, which includes nine nights of novena (''rezos de los nueve días'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Taylor|author2=Frederick I.

===India===
Novenas are still a common sight in India, especially in the state of [[Kerala]]. They are practised both by the Catholics ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Christians]] and [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Syro-Malankara Christians]]), and by the Orthodox Christians ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Malankara Orthodox Christians]] and [[Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church|Jacobite Orthodox Christians]]). Novenas are common to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mother Mary]] (recited every Saturday), [[Saint George]] (common by the Orthodox and recited every Wednesday), [[Jude the Apostle|Saint Jude]] and others.

In 19th century [[Melanesia]], the Christian clergy linked the end of epidemics such as the measles of 1860, and credited the survival of the communities after major disasters to the dedicated and great outburst of prayers to Christian icons, to "fervent novena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Douglas | first=Bronwen | title=Power, discourse and the appropriation of god: Christianity and subversion in a Melanesian context | journal=History and Anthropology | publisher=Routledge | volume=9 | issue=1 | year=1995 | pages=57–92 | doi=10.1080/02757206.1995.9960870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Black Madonna novenas in Luboc started after similar crediting by the Christian clergy that the island community survived after a severe epidemic of cholera because they made devotional prayers to the Virgin Mary (Madonna) during their time of suffering.&lt;ref name=brockman297/&gt;

'''Paul of Venice''' (or '''Paulus Venetus'''; 1369–1429) was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[scholastic philosopher]], [[theologian]], and [[Philosophical realism|realist]] [[logician]] and [[metaphysician]] of the [[Hermits of the Order of Saint Augustine]]. He was teacher to [[Paolo da Pergola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textmanuscripts.com/home/archives/archivesdescription.php?m%3D107 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613041248/http://www.textmanuscripts.com/home/archives/archivesdescription.php?m=107 |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Paul was born, according to the chroniclers of his order, at [[Udine]], about 1369 and died at [[Venice]] on June 15, 1429, as '''Paolo Nicoletti'''. He joined the [[Augustinians|Augustinian Order]] at around 1383, at the convent of [[Santo Stefano, Venice|Santo Stefano]] in Venice. In 1390 he is said to have been sent to [[Oxford]] for his studies in theology, but returned to [[Italy]], and finished his course at [[Padua]]. He lectured in the [[University at Padua]] during the first quarter of the fifteenth century.

Paul was one of the theologians called to [[Rome]] in 1427 by [[Pope Martin V]], to take cognizance of the charges brought against [[Bernardino of Siena|St. Bernardino of Siena]], occasioned by Bernardino's use of inscriptions of the name of Jesus in worship.

==Realism==
With regard to the [[problem of universals]] he adhered to [[Philosophical realism|realism]], since he maintained that universal essences are real entities.

==Works==
His writings show a wide knowledge and interest in the [[science|scientific]] problems of his time.

[[File:Friedens-Warte.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Die Friedens-Warte'', a German journal of the peace movement, issue #11, 1913]]
A '''peace movement''' is a [[social movement]] that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular [[war]] (or all wars), minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, and is often linked to the goal of achieving [[world peace]]. Means to achieve these ends include advocacy of [[pacifism]], [[non-violent resistance]], [[diplomacy]], [[boycott]]s, [[peace camp]]s, [[moral purchasing]], supporting [[anti-war]] political candidates, legislation to remove the profit from government contracts to the [[Military–industrial complex]], banning guns, creating [[open government]] and [[government transparency|transparency]] tools,  [[direct democracy]], supporting [[Whistleblowers]] who expose [[War crime|War-Crimes]] or conspiracies to create wars, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and national [[Interest group|political lobbying]] groups to create legislation. The political cooperative is an example of an organization that seeks to merge all peace movement organizations and green organizations, which may have some diverse goals, but all of whom have the common goal of peace and humane sustainability. A concern of some [[List of peace activists|peace activists]] is the challenge of attaining peace when those that oppose it often use violence as their means of communication and empowerment.

Some people refer to the global loose affiliation of activists and political interests as having a shared purpose and this constituting a single movement, "''the'' peace movement", an all encompassing "anti-war movement". Seen this way, the two are often indistinguishable and constitute a loose, responsive, event-driven collaboration between groups with motivations as diverse as [[humanism]], [[environmentalism]], [[veganism]], [[anti-racism]], [[feminism|anti-sexism]], [[decentralization]], [[hospitality service|hospitality]], [[ideology]], [[theology]], and [[faith]].

==The ideal of peace==

There are different ideas over what "peace" is (or should be), which results in a plurality of movements seeking diverse ideals of peace. Particularly, "anti-war" movements often have short-term goals, while peace movements advocate an ongoing life-style and proactive government policy.

It is often not clear whether a movement or a particular protest is against war in general, as in [[pacifism]], or against one's own government's participation in a war. Indeed, some observers feel that this lack of clarity or long term continuity has represented a key part of the strategy of those seeking to end a war, e.g., the [[Vietnam War]].

[[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Global protests against the U.S. invasion of Iraq]] in early 2003 are an example of a more specific, short term and loosely affiliated [[single-issue]] "movement" —with relatively scattered ideological priorities, ranging from absolutist [[pacifism]] to [[Islamism]] and [[Anti-Americanism]] (see [[Human shield action to Iraq]]). Nonetheless, some of those who are involved in several such short term movements and build up trust relationships with others within them, do tend to eventually join more global or long-term movements.

By contrast, some elements of the global peace movement seek to guarantee [[Human security|health security]] by ending war and assuring what they see as basic [[human rights]] including the right of all people to have access to air, water, food, shelter and [[universal health care|health care]]. A number of activists seek [[social justice]] in the form of equal protection under the law and equal opportunity under the law for groups that have previously been disenfranchised.

The Peace movement is primarily characterized by a belief that humans should not wage war on each other or engage in violent [[Ethnic war|ethnic cleansing]]s over language, race or [[natural resources]] or [[Ethical dilemma|ethical conflict]] over [[religion]] or [[ideology]]. Long-term opponents of war preparations are primarily characterized by a belief that [[Armed forces|military power]] is not the equivalent of [[justice]].

The Peace movement tends to oppose the proliferation of dangerous technologies and [[weapons of mass destruction]], in particular [[nuclear weapons]] and [[biological warfare]]. Moreover, many object to the export of weapons including hand-held [[machine guns]] and [[grenades]] by [[G7|leading economic nations]] to lesser developed nations. Some, like [[SIPRI]], have voiced special concern that [[artificial intelligence]], [[molecular engineering]], [[genetics]] and [[proteomics]] have even more vast destructive potential. Thus there is intersection between peace movement elements and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-Luddites]] or [[primitivism]], but also with the more mainstream technology critics such as the [[Green parties]], [[Greenpeace]] and the [[ecology movement]] they are part of.

It is one of several movements that led to the formation of [[Green party]] political associations in many democratic countries near the end of the 20th century. The peace movement has a very strong influence in some countries' green parties, such as in [[Germany]], perhaps reflecting that country's negative experiences with [[militarism]] in the [[History of Germany|20th century]].

==History==

===Peace and Truce of God ===
{{Main|Peace and Truce of God}}
The first mass peace movements in history were the [[Peace of God]] (''Pax Dei''), being first proclaimed in AD 989 at the Council of Charroux, and the [[Truce of God]] evolving out of it and being first proclaimed in 1027. The Peace of God originated as a response to increasing violence against monasteries in the aftermath of the fall of the Carolingian dynasty, spearheaded by bishops and "was promoted at a number of subsequent [church] councils, including important ones at Charroux (c. 989 and c. 1028), Narbonne (990), Limoges (994 and 1031), Poitiers (c. 1000), and Bourges (1038)". The Truce of God sought to restrain violence by limiting the number of days of the week and times of the year where the nobility were able to practice violence. These peace movements "set the foundations for modern European peace movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Peace of God |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Peace-of-God |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |author= Daniel Francis Callahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic peace churches===
[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg |thumb|right|[[Penn Treaty Park|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians. This treaty was never violated.]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]]. Foremost among them were the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Church of the Brethren]]. The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quaker Traditions of Pacifism and Nonviolence |url= http://events.stanford.edu/events/352/35227/ |author= Eric Roberts |publisher= Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment [[Conscientious objector|not to serve in the army and militia]] or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

=== 18th century ===
The 18th-century peace movements were products of two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical religious revival]] that had played an important part in the campaign for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. Representatives of the former, included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre'' (1756),&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp. 46-61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''Thoughts on Perpetual Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley,
pp.62-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was [[William Wilberforce]] who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the [[French Revolutionary War]] based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood.

===Peace movements===
During the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a [[reactionary]] role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-[[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4xr3PsdI8C&amp;dq=freemason+hall+1843+london+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Origins of War Prevention: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1730–1854|author=Ceadel, Martin|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press,|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Richard, Vanity Fair, 1880-09-04.jpg|thumb|"Peace". Caricature of [[Henry Richard]], a prominent advocate of pacifism in the mid-19th century.]]
The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the [[United States]] the first such movement was the [[New York Peace Society]], founded in 1815 by the theologian [[David Low Dodge]], and the [[Massachusetts Peace Society]]. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism to 1914 : an overview'' by Peter Brock. Toronto, Thistle Printing, 1994. (pp. 38-9).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]] (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]]. In the 1840s, British women formed "Olive Leaf Circles", groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820'', by [[Jill Liddington]]. London, Virago, 1989 {{ISBN|0-86068-688-4}} (pp. 14-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of [[Elihu Burritt]] and [[Henry Richard]], convened the first [[International Peace Congress]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace.html?id=JCgvvXUzu-oC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas|author=Cortright, David|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. [[Henry Richard|Richard]] became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the [[Great Power]]s in the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]], in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by [[1848 Revolution|social upheaval]], the first peace congress was held in [[Brussels]] in 1848 followed by [[Paris]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustave Moynier and the peace societies|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnaw.htm|publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|author=André Durand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Crimean War]], the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new [[working class]] [[socialism|socialist]] movements. In 1870, [[Randal Cremer]] formed the [[International Arbitration League|Workman's Peace Association]] in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist [[Frédéric Passy]] was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]. The [[National Peace Council]] was founded in after the 17th [[Universal Peace Congress]] in London (July August 1908).

===Nonviolent resistance===
[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], leader of the [[Indian independence movement]] and advocate of [[nonviolent resistance]].]]
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) of India was one of the most influential spokesman for peace and non-violence in the 20th century. ''[[Gandhism]]'' comprises the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted. Of central importance is nonviolent resistance.  M.M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematize wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Sankhdher, "Gandhism: A Political Interpretation", ''Gandhi Marg'' (1972) pp. 68–74&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandhi was strongly influenced by the pacifist ideas of Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In 1908 Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]],'' which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi and Tolstoy began a correspondence regarding practical and theological applications of non-violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=Murthy, B. Srinivasa |year= 1987|isbn=0-941910-03-2|url=http://bsmurthy.com/download/Mahatma_Gandhi_Leostoy_Letters_by_BSM.pdf|publisher=Long Beach Publications|location=Long Beach, California|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance.  However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, Martin Burgess |title=The origins of nonviolence: Tolstoy and Gandhi in their historical settings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0luAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 January 2012|year=1986|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-00414-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi was the first to apply the principle of nonviolence on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Asirvatham|first =Eddy|title =Political Theory|publisher=S.chand|isbn=81-219-0346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[nonviolence]] (''[[ahimsa]]'') and [[nonresistance]] has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''. Some of his other remarks were widely quoted, such as "There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for."&lt;ref&gt;James Geary, ''Geary's Guide to the World's Great Aphorists'' (2007) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi realized later that this level of nonviolence required incredible faith and courage, which he believed everyone did not possess. He therefore advised that everyone need not keep to nonviolence, especially if it were used as a cover for cowardice, saying, "where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence."&lt;ref name="Borman1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Borman|title=Gandhi and non-violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC&amp;pg=PA253|year=1986|publisher=SUNY Press|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faisal Devji, ''The Impossible Indian: Gandhi and the Temptation of Violence'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi came under political fire for his criticism of those who attempted to achieve independence through more violent means.  Gandhi responded,  "There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms [...] but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the [Hindu–Moslem riots] and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ Louis Fischer, ed. ''The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas''] 2002 (reprint edition) p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from [[Nazi Germany]]. He told the British people in 1940, "I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's passion: the life and legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih1VCqkUr4gC&amp;pg=PA197|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenge of World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]].]]
Although the onset of the [[First World War]] was generally greeted with enthusiastic patriotism across Europe, peace groups were still active in condemning the war. Many [[socialism|socialist]] groups and movements were [[antimilitarist]], arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the [[working class]] for the benefit of [[capitalism|capitalist]] elites.

[[File:Peace-Marcher.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|A World War I-era female peace protester.]]
In 1915 the [[League of Nations Society]] was formed by British [[liberalism|liberal]] leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the [[League to Enforce Peace]] was established in America to promote similar goals. [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the UK to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the [[League of Nations]] after the war.

Some of the many groups that protested against the war, as well as the traditional peace churches, were the [[Woman's Peace Party]] (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer [[Jane Addams]]), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915),&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/milit/intro.htm Pacifism vs. Patriotism in Women's Organizations in the 1920s] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20021108014655/http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/milit/intro.htm |date=2002-11-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Union Against Militarism]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and the [[American Friends Service Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132457/pg_2 Chatfield, Charles, “Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy” 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeannette Rankin]], the first woman elected to Congress, was another fierce advocate of pacifism, the only person to vote no to America's entrance into both World Wars.

===Interwar period===
The immense loss of life during the war, for what became regarded as futile reasons, caused a sea-change in public attitudes to militarism. Organisations formed in this period included the [[War Resisters' International]]&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'' by Scott H. Bennett. New York, Syracuse  University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8156-3028-X}}, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU). The [[League of Nations]] also convened several disarmament conferences in the inter-war period such as the [[Geneva Naval Conference|Geneva Conference]].

[[Image:Prats-de-Mollo Children's Home.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Refugees from the Spanish Civil War at the [[War Resisters' International]] children's refuge in the French Pyrenees.]]
Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, [[Death of a Hero]] by [[Richard Aldington]], [[Erich Remarque]]'s translated [[All Quiet on the Western Front]] and [[Beverley Nichols]]'s expose, ''Cry Havoc''. A debate at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]] established the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c5.html|title=Pacifism|publisher=[[University of Wellington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Civil War]] proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as [[War Resisters' International]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]) and individuals (such as [[José Brocca]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón|Amparo Poch]]). Shortly after the war ended, [[Simone Weil]], despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish ''[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]'', a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto.&lt;ref name = "NYB"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551|title= War and the Iliad|publisher=The New York Review of books|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as [[Richard B. Gregg]], devised plans for a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]] in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Nonviolence in America: a documentary history'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1966, (pps. 271-296).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. About half of the students assembled at the... - NARA - 532103.tif|thumb|200px|A peace strike rally at [[University of California]], Berkeley, April 1940.]]
With the start of [[World War II]], pacifist and anti-war sentiment declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled [[American Peace Mobilization]] reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], mainstream [[isolationist]] groups like the [[America First Committee]], declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that the necessity of defeating [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] was a unique circumstance where war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position ''relative pacifism''. [[H. G. Wells]], who had joked after the armistice ending [[World War I]] that the British had suffered more from the war than they would have from submission to [[Germany]], urged in 1941 a large-scale British offensive on the continent of Europe to combat Hitler and [[Nazism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Similarly [[Albert Einstein]] wrote: "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pp-einstein2.html Albert Einstein] at Peace Pledge Union, and but also discussed in detail in articles in Einstein, Albert (1954), ''Ideas and Opinions'', New York: Random House, {{ISBN|0-517-00393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village
of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P. Hallie, (1979)  New York: Harper &amp; Row, {{ISBN|0-06-011701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Trocmés were declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]].&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt;

Pacifists in the [[Third Reich]] were dealt with harshly; German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olaf Kullmann]], a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Socknat, pp. 402-3.&lt;/ref&gt; were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Solitary Witness: The Life and Death of Franz Jägerstätter]]'' by [[Gordon Zahn]]. Springfield, Illinois: Templegate Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87243-141-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were [[conscientious objectors]] and war [[tax resisters]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those [[draft dodgers|draft resisters]] who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

Since World War II, the peace movement has become widespread throughout the world, and its previously radical doctrines are now a part of mainstream political discourse.

===Anti-nuclear movement===
{{See also|History of the anti-nuclear movement|Anti-nuclear movement}}
[[Image:Operation Upshot-Knothole - Badger 001.jpg|thumb|A nuclear fireball lights up the night in a United States [[nuclear weapons test]].]]
Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.) ''The CND Story'', Alison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention.  In the meantime, Britain should halt the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons, end nuclear testing, not proceed with missile bases and not provide nuclear weapons to any other country.

The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] was organised by the CND and took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt; 
The formation of [[CND]] tapped widespread popular fear and opposition to nuclear weapons following the development of the first [[hydrogen bomb]], and in the late 1950s and early 1960s anti-nuclear marches attracted large followings, especially to the annual Aldermaston march at Easter.

Popular opposition to nuclear weapons produced a Labour Party resolution for unilateral nuclear disarmament at the 1960 Party Conference, but it was overturned the following year and did not appear on later agendas. This experience disillusioned many anti-nuclear protesters with the Labour Party, in whom they had previously put their hopes. Subsequently, there was a strong anti-parliamentary current in the British peace movement, and it has been argued that during the 1960s anarchism became as influential as socialism.

Two years after the formation of CND [[Bertrand Russell]], its president, resigned to form the Committee of 100, which was to undertake civil disobedience in the form of sit-down demonstrations in central London and at nuclear bases around the UK. Russell said that these were needed because the press had grown indifferent to CND and because large-scale direct action could force the government to change its policy.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, "Civil Disobedience", ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961&lt;/ref&gt; A hundred prominent people, many in the arts, put their names to the organisation. Very large numbers of demonstrators were essential to this strategy, but the violence of the police, the arrest and imprisonment of demonstrators, and pre-emptive arrests for conspiracy made support dwindle rapidly. Although several eminent people took part in sit-down demonstrations (including Russell, whose imprisonment at the age of 89 was widely reported) many of the 100 signatories were inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Myers, "Civil Disobedience and Organizational Change: The British Committee of 100", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 86, No. 1. (Mar., 1971), pp. 92–112&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Committee of 100 had a non-hierarchical structure and no formal membership, many local groups sprang up calling themselves [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]]. This helped the promulgation of civil disobedience but it produced policy confusion and, as the decade progressed, Committee of 100 groups engaged in actions on many social issues not directly related to war and peace.

[[Image:Women Strike for Peace NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Women Strike for Peace during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]]]
In the United States, in 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]]. It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=dagmar2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story |title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters |author=Woo, Elaine |date=January 30, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24wilson.html |title=Dagmar Wilson, Anti-Nuclear Leader, Dies at 94 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=January 23, 2011  |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to [[nuclear testing|nuclear-weapon testing]].

The peace movement began in the 1960s in the United States in opposition to U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. Some advocates within this movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from [[South Vietnam]].

The first U.S. anti-Vietnam protest was led in 1962 by [[Sam Marcy]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} founder of [[Workers World Party]], a demonstration whose importance was noted by [[Ho Chi Minh]] in an interview published in the [[National Guardian]] newspaper.

[[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Opposition to the Vietnam War]] tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism, [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] and, for those involved with the [[New Left]], [[capitalism]] itself, such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]. Others, such as [[Stephen Spiro]] opposed the war based on the theory of [[Just War]].

In 1965 the movement began to gain national prominence. Provocative actions by police and by protesters turned anti-war demonstrations in Chicago at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] into a riot. Explosive news reports of American [[military abuses]], such as the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre]], brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement bringing it to its height. The movement continued to prosper over the span of the conflict.

High-profile opposition to the Vietnam war turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion against the war. The protests gained momentum from the [[Civil Rights Movement]] that had organized to oppose [[Racial segregation|segregation]] laws, which had laid a foundation of theory and infrastructure on which the anti-war movement grew. Protests were fueled by a growing network of independently published newspapers (known as "underground papers") and the timely advent of large venue rock'n'roll festivals such as [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] and [[Grateful Dead]] shows, attracting younger people in search of generational togetherness. The movement progressed from college campuses to middle-class suburbs, government institutions, and [[labor unions]].

===Canada===
[[Agnes Macphail]], a Canadian pacifist, was the first woman to be elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Macphail objected to the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in 1931 on pacific grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Preston `Canada`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College` (University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Macphail was also the first Canadian woman delegate to the League of Nations, where she worked with the World Disarmament Committee. Although a pacifist, she voted for Canada to enter [[World War II]].

The [[Canadian Peace Congress]] (1949–1990) was a leading organizer in the peace movement for many years, particularly when it was under the leadership of [[James Gareth Endicott]] who was its president until 1971.

Currently, Canada has a diverse peace movement, with coalitions and networks in many cities, towns and regions. The largest cross-country umbrella coalition is the [[Canadian Peace Alliance]], whose 140 member groups include large city-based coalitions, small grassroots groups, national and local unions, faith, environmental, and student groups, with a combined membership of over 4 million Canadians. The Canadian Peace Alliance has been a leading voice, along with its member groups opposing the "War on Terror". In particular, the CPA opposes Canada's participation in the war in Afghanistan and Canadian complicity in what it views as misguided and destructive U.S. foreign policy.

Canada has also been home to a growing movement of Palestinian solidarity, marked by an increasing number of grassroots Jewish groups opposed to Israel's policies, in many cases likening them to Apartheid, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing.

===Germany===
During the Cold War (1947–89), the West German peace movement concentrated on  the abolition of nuclear technology, particularly weapons, from [[West Germany]] and Europe. Most activists stridently attacked both the United States and Soviet Union. Conservative critics repeatedly warned it was infiltrated by agents from the East German secret police, the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried von Bredow, "The Peace Movement in the Federal Republic of Germany," ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' (1982) 9#1 pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989, the cause of peace was espoused by [[Green parties]] across Europe.  It sometimes exercised significant influence over policy, e.g., as during 2002 when the [[German Greens]] influenced German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] to oppose involvement in Iraq. The Greens controlled of the German Foreign Ministry under [[Joschka Fischer]] (a Green and the single most popular politician in Germany at the time). Fischer sought to limit German involvement in the [[War on Terrorism]]; he joined with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] whose opposition in the [[UN Security Council]] was decisive in limiting support for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]].

===Israel===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
{{Main|Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis}}
The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] have existed since the inception of [[Zionism]], and especially since the 1948 formation of the state of [[Israel]], and the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. The mainstream peace movement in Israel is [[Peace Now]] (''Shalom Akhshav''), whose supporters tend to vote for the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]] or [[Meretz]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Peace Now]] was founded in the aftermath of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s historic visit to Jerusalem, when many people felt that the chance for peace might be missed. PM Begin acknowledged that the Peace Now rally in Tel Aviv at the eve of his departure for the [[Camp David]] Summit with Presidents Sadat and Carter—drawing a crowd of 100,000, the largest peace rally in Israel until then—had a part in his decision to withdraw from Sinai and dismantle Israeli settlements there. Peace Now supported Begin for a time, and hailed him as a peace-maker, but turned against him when withdrawal from Sinai was accompanied by an accelerated campaign of land confiscation and settlement building in the West Bank.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:settlements map eng.pdf|thumb|A map showing settlements in the [[West Bank]], produced by Peace Now.]]
Peace Now advocates a negotiated peace with the [[Palestinians]]. Originally this was worded vaguely, with no definition of who "the Palestinians" are and who represents them. Peace Now was quite tardy in joining the dialogue with the PLO, started by such groups as the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace and the [[Hadash]] communist party. Only in 1988 did Peace Now accept that the PLO is the body regarded by the Palestinians themselves as their representative.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During the first Intifada, Peace Now held numerous protests and rallies to protest the Israeli army and call for a negotiated withdrawal from the [[Palestinian territories]]. At the time Peace Now strongly targeted then for Defence Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] for his order to "break the bones of Palestinian stone-throwers". However, after Rabin became Prime Minister, signed the [[Oslo Agreement]] and shook [[Yasser Arafat]]'s hand on the White House lawn, Peace Now strongly supported him and mobilized public support for him. Peace Now had a central role in the November 4, 1995 rally after which Rabin was assassinated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Since then the annual Rabin memorial rallies, held every year at the beginning of November, have become the main event of the Israeli Peace Movement. While officially organized by the Rabin Family Foundation, Peace Now presence in these annual rallies is always conspicuous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Nowadays, Peace Now is especially known for its struggle against the expansion of settlement outposts on the West Bank.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Gush Shalom]], the Israeli Peace Bloc, is a radical movement to the left of Peace Now. In its present name and structure, Gush Shalom grew out of the ''Jewish-Arab Committee Against Deportations'', which protested the deportation without trial of 415 Palestinian Islamic activists to Lebanon in December 1992, and erected a protest tent in front of the prime minister's office in Jerusalem for two months—until the government consented to let the deportees return. Members then decided to continue as a general peace movement with a program strongly opposing the occupation and advocating the creation of an independent Palestine side-by-side with Israel in its pre-1967 borders ("The [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]") and with an undivided Jerusalem serving as the capital of both states.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

While existing under the name Gush Shalom only since 1992, this movement is in fact the lineal descendant of various groups, movements and action committees that espoused much the same program since 1967, and that occupied the same space on the political scene. In particular, Gush Shalom is the descendant of the ''Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace'' (ICIPP), which was founded in 1975. The ICIPP founders included: a group of dissidents from the Israeli establishment, among them were Major-General [[Mattityahu Peled]], who was member of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] General Staff during the 1967 Six Day War and after being dishcarged from the army in 1969 turned increasingly in the direction of the left; Dr. [[Ya'akov Arnon]], a well-known economist who headed the Zionist Federation in the Netherlands before coming to Israel in 1948, and was for many years director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Finance and afterwards chaired the Board of Directors of the Israeli Electricity Company; and [[Aryeh Eliav]], who was secretary-general of the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]] until he broke with the then PM [[Golda Meir]] over the issue of whether or not a Palestinian People existed and had national rights.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

These three and some two hundred more people became radicalised and came to the conclusion that "arrogance was a threat to Israel's future and that dialogue with the Palestinians must be opened."{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} They came together with a group of younger, grassroots peace activists who had been active against Israeli occupation since 1967. The bridge between the two groups was [[Uri Avnery]], a well known muckraking journalist who had been member of the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) between 1965 and 1973, at the head of his own radical one-man party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The main achievement of the ICIPP was the opening of dialogue with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), with the aim of convincing the Israelis of the need to talk and reach a peace deal with the Palestinians, and conversely making Palestinians aware of the need to talk to and eventually reach a deal with Israel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

At present, Gush Shalom activists are mainly involved in daily struggle at Palestinian villages that have their land confiscated by the [[West Bank barrier]], erected to stop suicide bombers. Gush activists are to be found, together with those of other Israeli movements like [[Ta'ayush]] and [[Anarchists Against the Wall]], joining the Palestinian villagers of [[Bil'in]] in the weekly protest marches held to protest confiscation of more than half of the village lands.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Although [[Gush Shalom]] earned itself respect among peace-seeking Israelis as well as in the [[United States]] and Europe, it is regarded by mainstream Israelis as a purely pro-Palestinian movement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

After the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|Gaza War]] in 2014, a group of Israeli women founded the [[Women Wage Peace]] movement with the goal of reaching a "bilaterally acceptable" political peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://womenwagepeace.org.il/en/mission-statement/|title=Mission Statement {{!}} Women Wage Peace|work=Women Wage Peace|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While based mainly in Israel, the movement has worked to build connections with Palestinians, reaching out to women and men of many different religions and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/these-israeli-women-marched-from-the-lebanese-border-to-jerusalem-heres-why/2016/10/19/a9b67618-b92c-4c7a-9ad8-d992477e7db1_story.html|title=These Israeli women marched from the Lebanese border to Jerusalem.

===United Kingdom===
From 1934 the [[Peace Pledge Union]] gained many adherents to its pledge, "I renounce war and will never support or sanction another." Its support diminished considerably with the outbreak of war in 1939, but it remained the focus of pacifism in the post-war years.

Post–World War II peace-movement efforts in the United Kingdom were initially focused on the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] and the rejection of [[imperialism]] by the United States and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. The [[anti-nuclear movement]] sought to "opt out" of the [[Cold War]] and rejected such ideas as "Britain's Little Independent Nuclear Deterrent" in part on the grounds that it (BLIND) was in contradiction even with MAD.

The VSC ([[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]]) led by [[Tariq Ali]] mounted several very large and violent demonstrations against the Vietnam war in 67/68 but the first anti Vietnam demonstration was at the American Embassy in London and took place in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''Comment Magazine''. (Communist) {{cite web |url=http://www.library.law.ua.edu/spcoll/findaids/murpaid/murpaid4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828050250/http://www.library.law.ua.edu/spcoll/findaids/murpaid/murpaid4.htm |archivedate=2012-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Not-in-my-name banner, Stop The War demo.JPG|thumb|left|StWC Placard]]
The peace movement was later associated with the [[Peace camp]] movement as [[British Labour party|Labour]] moved "more to the centre" under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. By early 2003, the peace and anti-war movement, mostly grouped together under the banner of the [[Stop the War Coalition]], was powerful enough to cause several of Blair's cabinet to resign, and hundreds of Labour Party MPs to vote against their government. Blair's motion to support militarily the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]] continued only due to support from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]]. [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Protests against the invasion of Iraq]] were particularly vocal in Britain. Polls suggested that without [[UN Security Council]] approval, the UK public was very much opposed to involvement, and over two million people protested in Hyde Park (the previous largest demonstration in the UK having had around 600,000).

The peace movement has seen 'pop-up' newspapers, pirate radio stations and plays over the years. 

The primary function of the National Peace Congress was to provide opportunities for consultation and joint activities between its affiliated members, to help create an informed public opinion on the issues of the day and to convey to the government of the day the views of the substantial section of British life represented by its affiliated membership. The NPC folded in 2000 to be replaced in 2001 by [[Network for Peace]], which was set up to continue the networking role of NPC.

===United States===

During the tail end of the [[Cold War]], U.S. peace activists largely concentrated on slowing the [[Nuclear arms race|superpower arms race]] in the belief that this would reduce the possibility of nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR. As the [[Reagan administration]] accelerated military spending and adopted a tough, challenging stance to the Russians, peace groups such as the [[Nuclear Freeze]] and Beyond War sought to educate the public on what they believed was the inherent riskiness and ruinous cost of this policy. Outreach to individual citizens in the Soviet Union and mass meetings, using then-new satellite link technology, were part of peacemaking activities in the 1980s. In 1981, [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] started the longest uninterrupted peace [[vigil]] in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=ColmanMcCarthy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/07/AR2009020701843.html|title=From Lafayette Square Lookout, He Made His War Protest Permanent|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 8, 2009|author=[[Colman McCarthy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined at [[President's Park#Lafayette Square|Lafayette Square]] by anti-nuclear activists [[Concepcion Picciotto]] and [[Ellen Thomas]].&lt;ref name=Oracles&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710053132/http://aje.me/HHwQcE The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Iraq's invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] began preparations for a mideast war. Peace activists were starting to find their groove just before the [[Gulf War]] was launched in February 1991, with well-attended rallies, especially on the west coast. However, the ground war was over in less than a week. A lopsided Allied victory and a media-incited wave of patriotic sentiment washed over the protest movement before it could develop traction.

During the 1990s, peacemakers' priorities included seeking a solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian impasse]], belated efforts at humanitarian assistance to war-torn regions such as Bosnia and Rwanda, and Iraq; American peace activists brought medicine into Iraq in defiance of U.S. law, in some cases enduring heavy fines and imprisonment in retaliation. Some of the principal groups involved were [[Voices in the Wilderness]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].

[[Image:NYC021503.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Protesters against the [[Iraq War]] in New York.]]
Before, during, and after the [[War in Iraq]] began, a concerted protest effort began in the United States. On [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]] a series of protests across the globe took place with events in approximately 800 cities. In March 2003, just before the U.S. and British Military led invasion of Iraq, a protest mobilization called "The World Says No to War" led to as many as 500,000 protestors in cities across the U.S. However, many protest organizations have persisted as the United States has maintained a military and corporate presence in Iraq.

U.S. activist groups including [[United for Peace and Justice]], [[Code Pink]] (Women Say No To War), [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], [[Military Families Speak Out]] (MFSO), [[Not In Our Name]], [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]], [[Veterans for Peace]], and [[The World Can't Wait]] continued to protest against the [[Iraq War]]. Methods of protest include rallies and marches, impeachment petitions, the staging of a war-crimes tribunal in New York (to investigate crimes and alleged abuses of power of the Bush administration), bringing Iraqi women to tour the U.S. and tell their side of the story, street theater and independent filmmaking, high-profile appearances by anti-war activists such as [[Scott Ritter]], [[Janis Karpinski]], and [[Dahr Jamail]], resisting military recruiting on college campuses, withholding tax monies, mass letter-writing to legislators and newspapers, blogging, music, and guerrilla theater. Independent media producers continue to broadcast, podcast and Web-host programs about the movement against the Iraq War.

Starting in 2005, [[opposition to military action against Iran]] started in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including the creation of the [[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran]]. By August 2007, fears of an imminent United States and/or [[Israel]]i attack on [[Iran]] had increased to the level that several [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Shirin Ebadi]] (Nobel Peace Prize 2003), [[Mairead Corrigan|Mairead Corrigan-Maguire]] and [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]] (joint Nobel Peace Prize 1976), [[Harold Pinter]] (Nobel Prize for Literature 2005) and [[Jody Williams]] (Nobel Peace Prize 1997), along with several [[anti-war]] groups, including The Israeli Committee for a Middle East Free from Atomic, Biological and Chemical Weapons, [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran|CASMII]], [[Code Pink]] and many others, warned about what they believed was the imminent risk of a "war of an unprecedented scale, this time against Iran", especially expressing concern that an attack on Iran using [[nuclear weapon]]s had "not been ruled out". They called for "the dispute about [[Iran's nuclear program]], to be resolved through peaceful means" and a call for [[Israel]], "as the only Middle Eastern state [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|suspected of possession of nuclear weapons]]", to join the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref name="ebadi_etal_nucfree_mideast"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =For a Middle East free of all Weapons of Mass Destruction | work =| publisher =[[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran]]| date = 2007-08-06| url =http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/2694 |format =| doi =| accessdate = 2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre C. Hohenberg''' (3 October 1934 – 15 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/54477.html|title=Pierre C. Hohenberg|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a French-American theoretical physicist, who worked primarily on [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?hohenbergp Biography from the APS]&lt;/ref&gt; Hohenberg studied at [[Harvard]], where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1956 and a master's degree in 1958 (after a stay during 1956/57 at [[École Normale Supérieure]]), and his doctorate in 1962.
From 1962-1963, he was at the [[Institute for Physical Problems]] in [[Moscow]], followed by a stay at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]].
From 1964 to 1995 he was at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill.
From 1985 to 1989, he was director of the department of theoretical physics and from 1989 to 1995 he was "Distinguished Member of Technical Staff".
From 1974 to 1977, he was also professor of theoretical physics at the [[Technische Universität München|TU München]], where he had previously been a 1972-1973 guest professor.
From 1995 to 2003 he was "Deputy Provost of Science and Technology" at [[Yale University]].
Subsequently, he was the Yale "Eugene Higgins Adjunct Professor of Physics and Applied Physics".
Hohenberg was additionally from 1963–1964 and again in 1988 guest professor in Paris and 1990-1991 as Lorentz-Professor in [[Leiden]].
In 2004 he became Senior Vice Provost of Research at [[New York University]], a position held until 2011, when he stepped down to join the Physics Department as Professor.
In 2012 he became Emeritus Professor of Physics at NYU.

Hohenberg was also politically active.
In 1983, he chaired the committee of the [[American Physical Society|APS]] for the freedom of scientists and in 1992-1993 on an APS committee for the support of scientists in the former Soviet Union. From 1984 to 1996, he was a member of the committee for human rights of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]]. Hohenberg was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (since 1985), the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (from 1989), the [[American Philosophical Society]] (since 2014) and the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]] (since 2016).
He received in 1990 the Fritz London Prize, in 1999 the [[Max Planck Medal]], and in 2003 the [[Lars Onsager Prize]] of the APS.

Hohenberg formulated in 1964 with [[Walter Kohn]] the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem in the course of his work on [[density functional theory]].
He became famous primarily for his investigations in the 1960s and 1970s in the theory of dynamic (i.e. temporally variable) critical phenomena close to phase transitions.
He collaborated thereby with [[Bertrand Halperin]], Shang-keng Ma and Eric Siggia in the application of [[renormalization]] methods.
Additionally, Hohenberg worked (with Swift) on hydrodynamic instabilities and on pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems with Michael Cross.
Independently of [[David Mermin|Mermin]] and [[Herbert Wagner (physicist)|Wagner]] he proved in 1967 the impossibility of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in one and two dimensions.
In collaboration with Richard Friedberg, he presented a new formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics based on the [[Consistent histories|consistent histories]] approach to the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

An accomplished continuous distance swimmer, Hohenberg in the second decade of the 21st century annually contested the artist/writer [[Richard Kostelanetz]] in a one-hour race at the NYU Coles pool until the pool was closed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">In [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], '''Planck's principle''' is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.

The reason for the name is the statements by [[Max Planck]]:&lt;ref&gt;Planck, Max K. (1950). Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers. New York: Philosophical library.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 33}}
{{quote|text=An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 97}}

Planck's quote has been used by [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and others to argue that [[scientific revolutions]] are arational, rather than spreading through "mere force of truth and fact".&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hull DL, Tessner PD, Diamond AM |title=Planck's Principle |journal=Science |date=17 November 1978 |volume=202 |issue=4369 |pages=717–23 |doi=10.1126/science.202.4369.717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Kuhn. ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. University of Chicago Press, 1970. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Feyrabend, in Criticism and the growth of knowledge, I. Lakatos and A. Musgrave, eds. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1970, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Azoulay, Christian Fons-Rosen, Joshua S. Graff Zivin: Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time? 2015, {{doi|10.3386/w21788}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as [[Darwinian]] rather than [[Lamarckian]] conceptual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John T. Blackmore |year=1978 |title=Is Planck's 'Principle' True? |journal=British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=347–349 |jstor=687097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether age influences the readiness to accept new ideas has been empirically criticised. In the case of acceptance of [[evolution]] in the years after Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' age was a minor factor.&lt;ref name="Hull"/&gt; Similarly, it was a weak factor in accepting [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. |title=Age and the Acceptance of Cliometrics |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=40 |issue=4 |date=December 1980 |jstor=2120004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radha Soami''', or Radhasoami Satsang, is a religious organization founded by [[Shiv Dayal Singh]] in 1861 on [[Basant Panchami]] Day in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|title=Radhasoami Reality: The Logic of a Modern Faith|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC|year= 1995|publisher =Princeton University Press|isbn= 0-691-01092-7|page=90 note 5}}, Quote: "The date of Swami Shiv Dayal's first public discourse is Basant Panchami Day, February 15 1861"&lt;/ref&gt; The nameless God beyond the gods is given a name: it is Radhasoami, according to those who follow the Agra branches of the movement.

The Radhasoamis, states Mark Juergensmeyer, are considered in Punjab as an offshoot of Sikhism&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer1995p7"/&gt; and can also be considered a part of [[Hinduism]] because they share their cultural outlook, some practices and theological concepts such as ''[[karma]]'', ''[[yoga]]'' (''[[shabd]]'') and ''[[guru]]''. However, they are also different from Hindus and [[Sikhs]] because they reject the concept of a sacred scripture, rituals such as ''[[Karah Parshad]]'' and pilgrimage gatherings and ceremonies. The Radhasoamis are a religious fellowship that accepts saints and living gurus from anywhere.&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer1995p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|title= Radhasoami Reality: The Logic of a Modern Faith|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC|year= 1995|publisher =Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01092-7|pages=7–8, 14–18, 23, 55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The movement started in Agra, its contemporaneous headquarters are in Agra, with parallel branches found in India and outside India.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer1995p7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis2002p590"/&gt; There are over 30 different Radhasoami groups in the world.&lt;ref name="Lewis2002p590"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R.

According to Pierluigi Zoccatelli, there were an estimated 3 million Radhasoami followers worldwide in 2004, with many subsects based on the Guru. Of these, the [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]] is the largest&lt;ref name="Lewis2002p590"/&gt; and it had 2 million followers.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2004"/&gt; Other subsects and movements influenced by Radhasoami include [[Divine Light Mission]], [[Eckankar]], [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]], [[Science of Spirituality]] and others.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierluigi Zoccatelli|editor=Peter Clarke|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2004|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-1-134-49970-0|pages=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these groups have tried to distance themselves from the other.&lt;ref name="Lewis2002p590"/&gt; Succession upon the death of previous guru has been a source of controversies and schism in the Radhasoami movement since the beginning.&lt;ref name="Lewis2002p590"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
According to Mark Juergensmeyer, the term "''Radhasoami''" is a vaishnava phrase for God (lit. "the lord [''Swami'' or ''Soami''] of ''Radha,'' the concert of ''Krishna''") despite the movement does not believe in an anthropomorphic God; however, so the term "''Radhasoami"'' mean the master of spiritual energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1048&amp;lpg=PA1048&amp;dq=%22vaishnava%22+radhasoami&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hgcjURB5v8&amp;sig=TxgFqDwc5HP016nxHEqUrhWSY6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiqsrGS1eTeAhUU2o8KHU2HA6cQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vaishnava%22%20radhasoami&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|last2=Roof|first2=Wade Clark|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761927297|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Agra branches viz. Dayalbagh, Soamibagh believe that ''Radhasoami'' is neither a phrase nor a derivative, but the supreme being itself in the form of sound (Dhwanyatmak) and light(Chaitanyam).

The writings of Swami Dayal use the term ''[[Satnam|Sat Nam]]'', rather than Radhasoami. The gurus and the tradition that followed him used the term Radhasoami during the initiation rites, meditation practices and as mutual greeting. This has led to the fellowship being commonly called Radha Soami.&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer1995p41"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC&amp;pg=PA41|title=Radhasoami Reality: The Logic of a Modern Faith|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01092-7|pages=41–42 with footnotes}}, Quote: "The word Radhasoami literally refers to Krishna as lord (swami) of his consort, Radha" (p. 41); "The Beas group translates Radhasoami as 'lord of the soul' (p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt; In some subtraditions of Radhasoami, states Lucy DuPertuis, the guru's charisma is considered as the "formless absolute", being in his presence is equivalent to experiencing the incarnation of the [[Satguru]], the guru is identified as the Radhasoami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=DuPertuis | first=Lucy | title=How People Recognize Charisma: The Case of Darshan in Radhasoami and Divine Light Mission | journal=Sociological Analysis | publisher=Oxford University Press | volume=47 | issue=2 | year=1986 | doi=10.2307/3711456 | pages=111-124}}, Quote: "Various branches of Radhasoami have argued about the incarnationalism of Satguru (Lane, 1981). Guru Maharaj Ji has accepted it and identifies with Krishna and other incarnations of Vishnu."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
{{double image|right|Ajaib e sirio.jpg|140|Sirio satsang.JPG|155|Radha Soami fellowships have featured gurus from many parts of the world.}}
To the Radhsoamis, six elements form the framework of their faith:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|title=Radhasoami Reality: The Logic of a Modern Faith|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC|year= 1995|publisher =Princeton University Press|isbn= 0-691-01092-7|pages=11–12, 40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a living ''guru'' (someone as locus of trust and truth), 
* ''[[bhajan]]'' (remembering ''Sat Nam'', other practices believed to be transformative), 
* ''[[satsang]]'' (fellowship, community), 
* ''[[selfless service|seva]]'' (serve others without expecting anything in return), 
* ''[[dera (organization)|dera]]'' (community organization, shrine), and 
* ''bhandara'' (large community gathering).

The Radha Soami Satsang believes that living gurus are necessary for a guided spiritual life.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; They do not install the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] or any other scriptures in their sanctum, as they consider it ritualistic. Instead, the guru sits in the sanctum with the ''satsang'' (group of Sikh faithfuls) and they listen to preachings from the Adi Granth and sing hymns together.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; They believe in social equality, forbid caste distinctions and have attracted [[Dalit]]s to their tradition. They are active outside India, and attracted converts to their movement.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Kristen Haar|author2= Sewa Singh Kalsi|title=Sikhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC | year=2009|publisher =Infobase Publishing| isbn=978-1-4381-0647-2|pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Radhasoami are strict vegetarians. They are active in charitable work such as providing free medical services and help to the needy. They do not believe in orthodox Sikh ritual practices such as covering one's head inside the temple or removing shoes, nor do they serve ''karah prasad'' (offering) at the end of prayers.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; Their basic practices include ''[[Surat Shabd Yoga]]'' (sound assisted meditation), initiation of disciple into the path by a living guru, obedience to the guru, a moral life that is defined by abstinence from meat, drugs, alcohol and sex outside marriage. They also believe that ''[[jivanmukti]]'' or inner liberation is possible during one's lifetime with guidance of the living guru.&lt;ref name="Lewis2002p590"/&gt;

'''Saint Sava''' ({{lang-sr|Свети Сава}} / ''Sveti Sava'', {{IPA-sh|sʋɛ̂ːtiː sǎːʋa|pron}}, 1174 – 14 January 1236), known as '''The Enlightener''', was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] prince and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monk, the first [[Archbishop]] of the [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church]], the founder of Serbian law, and a [[Foreign relations of Serbia|diplomat]]. Sava, born as '''Rastko''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Растко}}), was the youngest son of [[Serbian Grand Prince]] [[Stefan Nemanja]] (founder of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]]), and ruled the appanage of [[Zahumlje|Hum]] briefly in 1190–92. He then left for [[Mount Athos]] where he became a monk, with the name ''Sava'' (''[[Sabbas]]''). At Athos, he established the monastery of [[Hilandar]], which became one of the most important cultural and religious centres of the Serbian people. In 1219 he was recognized as the first Serbian Archbishop by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate]] exiled in [[Nicea]], and in the same year he authored the oldest known constitution of Serbia, ''[[Zakonopravilo]]'', thus securing full independence; both religious and political. Sava is regarded the founder of [[Serbian medieval literature]].

He is widely considered as one of the most important figures of [[Serbian history]]. Saint Sava is canonized and venerated by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], as its founder, on {{OldStyleDate|January 27||January 14}}. His life has been interpreted in many artistic works from the [[Middle Ages]] to modern times. He is the patron saint of Serbia, Serbs, and Serbian education. The [[Church of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]] is dedicated to him, built where the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] burnt his remains in 1594 during an uprising in which the Serbs used icons of Sava as their war flags; the church is one of the [[List of largest church buildings in the world|largest church buildings in the world]].

==Early life==
Rastko ({{lang|sr|Растко Немањић}}, {{IPA-sh|râstkɔ nɛ̌maɲitɕ|pron}}), a diminutive of ''[[Rastislav]]'',{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} was born in 1169 or 1174,{{Cref2|a|2}} in Gradina (modern [[Podgorica]], [[Montenegro]]). As the youngest son of Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]] and [[Anastasia of Serbia|Ana]], he was part of the first generation of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], alongside his brothers [[Vukan Nemanjić|Vukan]] and [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan]]. His biographers mention that he was born after a hiatus in the couple's childbearing and was therefore especially dear.{{sfn|Stanojević|1935|p=7}} At the Serbian court the brothers received a good education{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] tradition, which exercised great political, cultural and [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|religious influence]] in Serbia.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} He grew up in a time of great foreign relations activities in Serbia.{{sfn|Stanojević|1935|p=8}} Rastko showed himself serious and [[ascetic]]; as the youngest son, he was made Prince of Hum at an early age,{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} in ca. 1190.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=19}} Hum was a province between [[Neretva (river)|Neretva]] and [[Dubrovnik]] (''Ragusa'').{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} Having his own court with magnates (''velmože''), senior officials and selected local [[Medieval Serbian nobility|nobility]], the governance in Hum was not only an honorary title but constituted a practical school of state administration.{{sfn|Mošin|1979|p=103}} [[Teodosije the Hilandarian]] said that Rastko, as a ruler, was "mild and gentle, kind to everyone, loving the poor as few others, and very respecting of the monastic life".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} He showed no interested in fame, wealth, or the throne.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} The governance of Hum had previously been held by his uncle [[Miroslav of Hum|Miroslav]], who continued to hold at least the [[Lim river|Lim region]] with [[Bijelo Polje]] while Rastko held Hum.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=52}} After two years, in autumn 1192 or shortly afterwards, Rastko left Hum for [[Mount Athos]].{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} Miroslav may have continued as ruler of Hum after Rastko had left.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=20}} Athonite monks were frequent visitors to the Serbian court – lectures perhaps made him determined to leave.{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}}

==Mount Athos==
Upon arriving at Athos, he entered the Russian [[St. Panteleimon Monastery]] where he received the monastic name of ''Sava'' ([[Sabbas]]),{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} and according to tradition it was a Russian monk who was his spiritual guidance,{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} said to have had earlier guested the Serbian court with other Athonite monks.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} He then entered the Greek [[Vatopedi]] monastery, where he would stay for the next seven years, and became more closely acquainted with Greek theological and church-administrational literature.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1980|p=13}} His father tried to persuade him to return to Serbia, but he was determined, and replied "You have accomplished all that a Christian sovereign should do; come now and join me in the true Christian life".{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} His young years at Athos will have a significant influence on the formation of his personality, it was also here that he found models on the basis on which he would organize monastic and church life in Serbia.{{sfn|Obolensky|2004|p=144}}

Stefan Nemanja took his son's advice{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=218}} – he summoned an assembly at [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]] and [[abdicated]] on 25 March 1196, giving the throne to his middle son, [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} The next day, Nemanja and his wife Ana took monastic vows.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=38}} Nemanja took the monastic name ''Simeon'', and stayed in Studenica until leaving for Mount Athos in autumn 1197.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=30}} The arrival was greatly pleasing to Sava and the Athonite community, as Nemanja as a ruler had donated much to the community.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} The two, with consent of ''[[hegumen]]'' (monastery head) Theostyriktos of Vatopedi, went on a tour of Athos in late autumn 1197 in order for Simeon to familiarize with all of its churches and sacred places; they donated to numerous monasteries, and especially Karyes, Iviron and the Great Lavra.{{sfn|Živojinović|2000|p=110}}

When Sava guested the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] at Constantinople, he mentioned the neglected and abandoned [[Hilandar]], and asked him that he and his father be given the permit to restore the monastery and grant it to Vatopedi.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} The Emperor approved, and sent a special letter and much gold to his friend Stefan Nemanja (monk Simeon).{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} Sava then addressed the [[Protos (monastic office)|Protos]] of Athos, asking them to support the effort that the monastery of Hilandar becomes the haven of the Serb monks.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} All Athonite monasteries, except Vatopedi, accepted the proposal, and in July 1198 Emperor Alexios III authored a charter which revoked the earlier decision, and instead not only granted Hilandar, but also the other abandoned monasteries in Mileis, to Simeon and Sava, to be a haven and shelter for Serb monks in Athos.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} The restoration of Hilandar quickly began and Grand Prince Stefan sent money and other necessities, and issued the founding charter for Hilandar in 1199.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}}

Sava wrote a ''[[typikon]]'' (liturgical office order) for Hilandar, modeled on the typikon of the monastery of The Mother of God Euergetes in Constantinople.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} Besides Hilandar, Sava was the ''[[ktetor]]'' (sr. ''ktitor''; founder, donator) of the hermitage at [[Karyes (Athos)|Karyes]] (seat of Athos) for the monks who devoted themselves to solitude and prayer.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} In 1199, he authored the [[Karyes Typikon|typikon of Karyes]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} Along with the hermitage, he built the chapel dedicated to [[Sabbas the Sanctified]], whose name he received upon monastic vows.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} His father died on 13 February 1199.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=30}} In 1204, after 13 April, Sava received the rank of ''[[archimandrite]]''.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=6}}
 [[File:Sveti Sava miri zavađenu braću.jpg|thumb|Sava reconciling his quarreling brothers, [[Paja Jovanović]] (1901).]]
As Nemanja had earlier decided to give the rule to [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan]], and not the eldest, [[Vukan Nemanjić|Vukan]], in the meantime, back home, the latter began plotting against Stefan; he found an ally in Hungarian king [[Emeric, King of Hungary|Emeric]] with whom he banished Stefan to Bulgaria, and Vukan usurped the Serbian throne. Stefan returned to Serbia with an army in 1204, and pushed Vukan to [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]], his hereditary land.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=41–48}} After problems at Athos with Latin bishops and [[Boniface of Montferrat]] following the [[Fourth Crusade]], Sava returned to Serbia in the winter of 1205–06 or 1206–07, with the remains of his father which he relocated to his father's endowment, the [[Studenica monastery]], and then reconciled his quarreling brothers.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=79}} Sava saved the country from further political crisis by ending the dynastic fight.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=6}} Nemanja (Simeon) was canonized in 1206.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=5}}

==Enlightenment==
[[File:Sveti_Sava_blagosilja_Srpčad,_Uroš_Predić,_1921.jpg|thumb|left|Sava blessing Serb youth, [[Uroš Predić]] (1921).]]
Having spent 14 years in Mount Athos, Sava had extensive theological knowledge and spiritual power.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=39}} According to Sava's biography, he was asked to teach the court and people of Serbia the Christian laws and traditions and "in that way enwisen and educate".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} Sava then worked on the religious and cultural enlightenment of the Serbian people, educating in Christian morality, love and mercy, meanwhile also working on the church organization.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} Since his return in 1206, he became the ''[[hegumen]]'' of [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]], and as its elder, self-willed entered regulations on the independent status of that monastery in the Studenica Typikon.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=6}} He used the general chaos in which the Byzantine Empire found itself after the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|siege of Constantinople (1204)]] into the hands of the Crusaders, and the strained relations between the [[Despotate of Epirus]] (where the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]] was seated, which the Serbian Church was subordinated to) and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in [[Nicaea]], into his advantage.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=7}} The Studenica Typikon became a sort of ''[[lex specialis]]'', which allowed Studenica to have independent status ("Here, therefore, no one is to have authority, neither bishop nor any one else") in relation to the Bishopric of Raška and Archbishopric of Ohrid.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=7}} The canonization of Nemanja and the Studenica Typikon would be the first steps towards the future autocephaly of the Serbian Church and elevation of the Serbian ruler to king ten years later.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=8}}
 [[File:Свети Сава крунише свог брата Стефана Првовенчаног, by Anastas Jovanović.jpg|thumb|Crowning of Stefan, by [[Anastas Jovanović]].]]
In 1217, archimandrite Sava left Studenica and returned to Mount Athos. His departure has been interpreted by a part of the historians as a revolt against his brother Stefan accepting the royal crown from Rome.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} Stefan had just prior to this made a large switch in politics, marrying a Venetian noblewoman, and subsequently asked the Pope for a crown and moral support.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Трећи период, II, para. 21}} With the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]] (1204), Rome had considerably increased its power in the Balkans.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=8}} Stefan was crowned in [[Žiča]], and was now equal to the other kings, and was called "the First-Crowned King" of "all Serb lands".{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=9}} According to Ćorović, Stefan's politics were not well received in the country; Orthodox tradition had already taken grip, especially Sava rose against his brother, to whom he had up until then been a faithful companion; he was the main representative of Orthodoxy and Byzantine ecclesiastical culture in Serbia.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Трећи период, II, para. 22}} According to Zorić, though Sava left Serbia while talks were underway between Stefan and Rome (apparently due to disagreeing with Stefan's excessive reliance on Rome), he and his brother resumed their good relation after receiving the crown.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=9}} According to Mileusnić it is possible that Sava did not agree with everything in his brother's international politics, however, his departure for Athos may also be interpreted as a preparation for obtaining the autocephaly (independence) of the Serbian Archbishopric.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} His departure was planned, both Domentijan and Teodosije, Sava's biographers, stated that before leaving Studenica he appointed a new ''hegumen'' and "put the monastery in good, correct order, and enacted the new church constitution and monastic life order, to be held that way", after which he left Serbia.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}}

==Autocephaly and church organization==
The elevation of Serbia into a kingdom did not fully mark the independence of the country, according to that time's understanding, unless the same was achieved with its church.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=9}} Rulers of such countries, with church bodies subordinated to Constantinople, were viewed of as "rulers of lower status who stand under the top chief of the Orthodox Christian world – the Byzantine Emperor".{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=9}} Conditions in Serbia for [[autocephaly]] were largely met at the time, with a notable number of learned monks, regulated monastic life, stable church hierarchy, thus "its autocephaly, in a way, was only a question of time".{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=9}} It was important to Sava that the head of the Serbian church was appointed by Constantinople, and not Rome.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=9}}

On 15 August 1219, during the feast of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God]], Sava was consecrated by [[Patriarch Manuel I of Constantinople]] in [[Nicaea]] as the first Archbishop of the autocephalous (independent) Serbian Church.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} With the support of Emperor [[Theodore I Laskaris]] and "the Most Venerable Patriarch and the whole Constantinopolitan assembly" he received the blessing that Serbian archbishops receive consecration from their own bishops' assemblies without consenting with the Patriarch of Constantinople.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} Sava had thus secured the independence of the church; in the Middle Ages, the church was the supporter and important factor in state sovereignty, and political and national identity.{{sfn|Zorić|2006|p=6}}

From Nicaea, Archbishop Sava returned to Mount Athos, where he profusely donated to the monasteries.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} In Hilandar, he addressed the question of administration: "he taught the hegumen specially how to, in every virtue, show himself as an example to others; and the brothers, once again, he taught how to listen to everything the hegumen said with the fear of God", as witnessed by Teodosije.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} From Hilandar, Sava travelled to [[Thessaloniki]], to the monastery of Philokalos, where he stayed for some time as a guest of the Metropolitan of Thessaloniki, Constantine the Mesopotamian, with whom he was a great friend ever since his youth.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=40}} His stay was of great benefit as he transcribed many works on law needed for his church.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}}

Upon his return to Serbia, he was engaged in the organization of the Serbian church, especially regarding the structure of bishoprics, those that were situated on locales at the sensitive border with the Roman Catholic West.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} At the assembly in [[Žiča]] in 1219, Sava "chose, from his pupils, God-understanding and God-fearing and honorable men, who were able in managing by divine laws and by tradition of the [[Holy Apostles]], and keep the apparitions of the holy God-bearing fathers. And he consecrated them and made them bishops" (Domentijan).{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} Sava gave the newly appointed bishops law books and sent them to bishoprics in all parts of Serbia.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} It is unclear how many bishoprics he founded. The following bishoprics were under his administration: Zeta (''Zetska''), seated at Monastery of Holy Archangel Michael in [[Prevlaka]] near Kotor; Hum (''Humska''), seated at [[Monastery of the Holy Mother of God, Ston|Monastery of the Holy Mother of God]] in [[Ston]]; [[Dabar-Bosna]], seated at Monastery of St. Nicholas on the Lim; Moravica, seated at Monastery of St. Achillius in the Moravica region; Budimlja, seated at Monastery of St. George; Toplica, seated at Monastery of St. Nicholas in the Toplica region; Hvosno, seated at Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in the [[Hvosno]] region; Žiča, seated at [[Žiča]], the seat of the Church; Raška, seated at [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć|Monastery of Holy Apostles Peter and Paul]] in [[Peć]]; Lipljan, seated at [[Lipljan]]; Prizren, seated at [[Prizren]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} Among his bishops were [[Ilarion (medieval Serbian bishop)|Ilarion]] and [[Metodije (medieval Serbian bishop)|Metodije]]. In the same year Sava published ''[[Zakonopravilo]]'' (or "St. Sava's Nomocanon"), the first [[constitution]] of Serbia; thus the Serbs acquired both forms of independence: political and religious.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=118}}

The organizational work of Sava was very energetic, and above all, the new organization was given a clear national character. The Greek bishop at Prizren was replaced by a Serbian, his disciple. This was not the only feature of his fighting spirit. The determination of the seats of the newly established bishoprics were also performed with especially state-religious intention. The Archbishopric was seated in Žiča, the new endowment of King Stefan, further north of Ras (the capital) and Studenica, and not far from the Hungarian borders. The bishopric in Dabar on the Lim river was situated towards the border with Bosnia, to act on the Orthodox element there and suppress the [[Bosnian Church|Bogomil teaching]]. The bishopric of Zeta was located on the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula, [[Bay of Kotor]], out of real [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]] itself, and the bishopric of Hum in [[Ston]]; both of these were almost on the outskirts of the kingdom, obviously with the aim to combat the Catholic action which had spread especially from the Catholic dioceses of Kotor and Dubrovnik. In earlier times, also Orthodox monasteries were subjected to the supervision of the Catholic Archdiocese of Bar; after Sava's action that intercourse began to change in the opposite direction. After Sava's organization, Orthodoxy finally became the state religion of Serbia. Sava, in that respect, worked consistently and without any regard. The Bogomils had been prohibited already by his father, Nemanja, while Sava, as an Athonite Latinophobe, did his part all to prevent and weaken the influence of Catholicism. Through his clergy, which he directly influenced as an example and with teaching, Sava rose also the general cultural level of the whole people, striving to develop human virtues and a sense of civic duty. The Serbian state thought of the Nemanjić dynasty was created by Nemanja, physically, and intellectually by Sava.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Трећи период, II, para. 27}}

==First pilgrimage==
 [[File:Marsava.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mar Saba]], where Sava founded Serbian cells.]]
After the crowning of his nephew [[Stefan Radoslav|Radoslav]], the son of Stefan, Sava left the Serbian maritime in 1229 for a trip to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} He visited almost all the [[List of religious sites#Christianity|holy places]] and endowed them with valued gifts.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} The Patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Athanasius II of Jerusalem|Athanasius]], along with the rest of the prelates, and especially monks, warmly greeted and welcomed him.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}}&lt;!-- Sava asked Athanasios II, his host, and the Great Lavra fraternity, led by ''[[hegoumenos]]'' Nicholas, if he could purchase two monasteries in the [[Holy Land]]. His request was accepted and he was offered the monasteries of Saint John the Theologian on [[Mount Zion|Mount Sion]] and [[St. George's Monastery, Akona|St. George's Monastery]] on Akona - both to be inhabited by Serbian monks. --&gt; On the way back he visited [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and the Byzantine Emperor [[John Vatatzes]] (r. 1221–54), where he remained for several days. From there, he continued his journey to Mount Athos, Hilandar, and then via Thessaloniki to Serbia.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} While visiting [[Mar Saba]], he had been gifted the ''[[Trojeručica]]'' (the "Three-handed Theotokos"), an icon of [[Nursing Madonna]], and the [[crosier]] of [[Sabbas the Sanctified]], which he brought to Hilandar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ikona Presvete Bogorodice "Trojeručice"|work=Ikonopis|publisher=Hilandar|url=http://www.hilandar.info/strana_sr.php?strana_id=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short stay at Studenica, Sava embarked on a four-year trip throughout the lands where he confirmed the theological teachings, and delivered constitutions and customs of monastic life to be kept, as he had seen in Mount Athos, Palestine and Middle East.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}}

==Second pilgrimage and death==

After the throne change in 1234, when King Radoslav was succeeded by his brother [[Stefan Vladislav|Vladislav]], Archbishop Sava began his second trip to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} Prior to this, Sava had appointed his loyal pupil [[Arsenije Sremac]] as his successor to the throne of the Serbian Archbishopric.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} Domentijan says that Sava chose Arsenije through his "clairvoyance", with Teodosije stating further that he was chosen because Sava knew he was "evil-less and more just than others, prequalified in all, always fearing God and carefully keeps His commandments".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} This move was wise and deliberate; still in his lifetime he chose himself a worthy successor because he knew that the further fate of the Serbian Church largely depended on the personality of the successor.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}}

Sava began his trip from [[Budva]], then via [[Brindisi]] in Italy to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} On this road he experienced various bad events, such as an organized pirate attack in the rough [[Mediterranean Sea]], which however ended well.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} In Acre he stayed in his monastery dedicated to St. George, which he had earlier bought from the [[Latin Empire|Latins]], and then from there went to [[Jerusalem]], to the Monastery of St. John the Apostle, "which he, as soon as arriving, redeemed from the [[Saracens]], in his name".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} Sava had a prolonged stay in Jerusalem; he was again friendly and brotherly received by Patriarch Athanasius.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} From Jerusalem he went to [[Alexandria]], where he visited Patriarch Nicholas, with whom he exchanged gifts.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}}

After touring the sanctities in [[Egypt]], he returned to Jerusalem, from where he went to the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], where he spent the [[Lent]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} He returned briefly to Jerusalem, then went to [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]]ia, and from there across [[Armenia]] and the "Turkic lands" he went on the "Syrian Sea" and then returned on a ship to Antiochia.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} On the ship, Sava became sick, and was unable to eat.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} After a longer trip he arrived at Constantinople where he briefly stayed.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} Sava first wanted to return home via Mount Athos (according to Domentijan&lt;!-- По сведочењу Доментијана, Сава је имао жељу да се врати за Србију преко Свете Горе, али се „тако не изволи Светоме Духу, и не случи му се да тамо иде".--&gt;), but he instead decided to visit the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian capital]] at [[Veliko Tarnovo|Trnovo]], where he was warmly and friendly admitted by the Bulgarian Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (father-in-law of King Vladislav) and Bulgarian Patriarch Joakim.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=43}} As on all his destinations, he gave rich gifts to the churches and monasteries: "[he] gave also to the Bulgarian Patriarchate priestly honourable robes and golden books and candlesticks adorned with precious stones and pearls and other church vessels", as written by Teodosije.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=43–44}} Sava had after much work and many long trips arrived at Trnovo a tired and sick man.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}}&lt;!-- According to his ''Life'', he fell ill following the [[Divine Liturgy]] on the [[Feast of the Epiphany]], 12 January 1235.--&gt; When the sickness took a hold of him and he saw that the end was near, he sent part of his entourage to Serbia with the gifts and everything he had bought with his blessing to give "to his children".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} The [[eulogia]] consisted of four items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eulogiae Terrae Sanctae of St Sava of Serbia|author=Popović Danica|journal=Balcanica |year=2014 |volume=45 |issue= |pages=55–69|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0350-76531445055P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domentijan accounted that he died between Saturday and Sunday, most likely on {{OldStyleDateNY|14 January|27 January}} 1235.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}}
 [[File:SS.Forty Martyrs Church (Veliko Tarnovo) E3.jpg|thumb|Sava died ill on his way home from the Holy Land, on 12 January 1235, in Trnovo, Bulgaria.]]
Sava was respectfully buried at the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|Holy Forty Martyrs Church]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=136}} Sava's body was returned to Serbia after a series of requests,{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=136}} and was then buried in the [[Mileševa monastery]], built by Vladislav in 1234.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=136}} According to Teodosije, Archbishop Arsenije told Vladislav "It's neither nice nor pleasing, before God nor the people, leaving our father [Sava] gifted to us by the Christ. An equal to apostles – who made so many feats and countless efforts for the Serbian lands, decorating it with churches and the kingdom, the archbishopric and bishops, and all constitutions and laws – that his relics lie outside his fatherland and the seat of his church, in a foreign land".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} King Vladislav twice sent delegations to his father-in-law Asen, asking him to let the relics of Sava be transferred to the fatherland, but the Emperor was unappealing.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} Vladislav then personally visited him and finally got the approval, and brought the relics to Serbia.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} With the highest church- and state honours, the relics of Saint Sava were transferred from the Holy Forty Martyrs Church to [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]] on {{OldStyleDateNY|6 May|19 May}} 1237. "The King and the Archbishop, with the bishops and hegumens and many noblemen, all together, little and great, carried the Saint in much joy, with psalms and songs".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} Sava was canonized, and his relics were considered miraculous; his cult remained throughout the [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] and the [[Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman occupation]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=136}}

==Legacy and cult==

The Serb people built the cult of St. Sava based on the religious cult; many songs, tales and legends were created about his life, work, merit, goodness, fairness and wisdom.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=48}} His relics, according to [[Dimitrije Bogdanović]], "became a topic of national, political cult, focus of liberation thought, danger to foreign rule. Thus, they (the relics) were burnt, so that the source of insubordination in the people would not disappear".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=48}} The Serbian Orthodox Church venerates him on {{OldStyleDate|January 27||January 14}}.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=48}}

===Biographies===
The first, shorter, biography on St. Sava was written by his successor, Archbishop Arsenije.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} The transcript is preserved in a manuscript on [[parchment]] dating to the 13th or 14th century.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}}  [[Domentijan]] (ca. 1210–after 1264), an Athonite monk, wrote the ''Life of St. Sava'' in 1253.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} He gifted it to Serbian king [[Stefan Uroš I]] (r. 1243–76).{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} This biography describes Sava's life from his birth to his burial in Trnovo.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}}  [[Teodosije the Hilandarian|Teodosije]] (1246–1328), also an Athonite monk, wrote the ''Life of St. Sava'' at Hilandar at the end of the 13th century.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} He based it on Domentijan's biography, though, unlike the latter, of which narratives are of thoughtful and solemn rhetoric, Teodosije's biography is warmer, with features of a [[Hagiography|hagiographic narrative]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} Teodosije's description of events give the impression of a [[novel]], though it does not distort the historical course of events.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} Catholic bishop [[Ivan Mrnavić]], a contemporary of Serbian patriarch [[Pajsije]], published a biography of St. Sava in Latin, in Rome in 1630–31, which was later translated into Serbian by [[Veselin Čajkanović]] (1881–1946); this biography has many historical inaccuracies.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} There are many transcripts preserved of Domentijan's biography, and many more of Teodosije's.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} &lt;!--One transcript of Domentijan's biography dating to the 16th century is preserved in the [[Rila monastery]] in Bulgaria.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} --&gt;

===Relics===
The presence of the relics of St. Sava in Serbia had a church-religious and political significance, especially during the Ottoman period.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} No individual among the Serbs has been woven into the consciousness and being of the people as Saint Sava, from his time until the present day.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} In 1377, [[Banate of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban]] [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] was crowned King in the presence of Sava's relics.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} In 1448, ''vojvoda'' [[Stefan Vukčić Kosača]] of [[Zahumlje|Hum]] styled himself "herzog (duke) of Saint Sava".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} The cult collected all South Slavic peoples, especially the Orthodox Serbs, while his grave was also a pilgrim site for Catholics and Muslims.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44}} Foreign 16th-century writers, Jean Sesno (1547) and Catherine Zen (1550)&lt;!-- Жан Шесно (1547) и Катарин Зен (1550)--&gt; noted that Muslims respected the tomb of St. Sava, and feared him.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=44–45}} Benedicto Ramberti (1553) said that Turks and Jews gave more charity to Mileševa than the Serbs.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} &lt;!-- there is a note that Ivan Asen II saw monk Neofit healed at the place of Sava's empty grave following the return of relics to Serbia {{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} --&gt;

When the [[Uprising in Banat|Serbs in Banat rose up]] against the Ottomans in 1594, using the portrait of Saint Sava on their [[war flags]], the Ottomans retaliated by incinerating the relics of St. Sava on the [[Vračar plateau]] in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} Grand Vizier [[Koca Sinan Pasha]], the main commander of the Ottoman army, ordered for the relics to be brought from Mileševa to Belgrade, where he set them on fire on 27 April.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Шести период, V.}} Monk Nićifor of the [[Fenek monastery]] wrote that "there was great violence carried out against the clergy and devastation of monasteries".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} The Ottomans sought to symbolically and really, set fire to the Serb determination of freedom, which had become growingly noticeable.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Шести период, V.}} The event, however, sparked an increase in rebel activity, until the suppression of the uprising in 1595.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Шести период, V.}} It is believed that his [http://www.svetosavlje.org/svetinje/Mosti/rukasvSave.htm left hand was saved]; it is currently held at Mileševa.

The [[Church of Saint Sava]] was built near the place where his relics were burned. Its construction began in the 1930s and was completed in 2004. It is one of the largest churches in the world.

===Divine Services===
[[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|Divine Services]], ''službe'', were created in his honour following his burial. The earliest service date to the reign of king Vladislav, in which Saint Sava is mentioned along the killed monks on Sinai.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} In it, he is compared to the saints [[Sergius and Bacchus]], whose relics are held at the Mileševa monastery.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} In the service, he is called an [[wikt:illuminator|illuminator]] on earth, and the adoration of his icon is mentioned.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} There are two services dedicated to Saint Sava: one dedicated to his [[wikt:assumption|Assumption]] (death), and the second to the translation of his relics.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} Nikola and Radoslav wrote the service on the translation of his relics in ca. 1330.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} Other services dedicated to the translation were also compiled in 1599 by ''inok'' Georgije, and written by ''protohegumen'' Visarion of [[Zavala monastery|Zavala]] in 1659–60.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} These services were superseded by the use of Teodosije's service.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} The unknown author of the ''Service of the Assumption of Saint Sava'', a monk of Mileševa, speaks to him: "Father of Fathers – [of] clergy rules, wholewised model, virtue of monks, fortification of the church, lighthouse of love, seat of feelings, source of mercifulness, fire-inspired tongue, mouth of sweet words, a church vessel of God, intellectual heaven become – God-good hierarch of Christ".&lt;!--„Оче отаца - свештенства правило, целомудрија узор,монасима крепост, цркви утврђење, љубави светилник, престо осећања,источник (извор) милостиви, језик огњенонадахнути, уста слаткоречива,сасуд Божији, умни рај постаде - богоблажени јерарше Христов".--&gt;{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}}

There are many temples (''hramovi'') dedicated to St. Sava. As early as the beginning of the 14th century, Serbian Archbishop [[Nikodim I]] (s. 1316–1324) dedicated a church to him.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} [[Helena of Bulgaria]], the wife of Emperor [[Stefan Dušan]] (r. 1331–55), founded a chapel on the top of the tower in Karyes, dedicated to St. Simeon and St. Sava.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} One of the churches of [[St. Panteleimon Monastery|Rossikon]] on Mount Athos, as well as a church in Thessaloniki, are dedicated to him.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=46}} Churches throughout Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro are dedicated to him, as well as churches in [[Serb diaspora|diaspora communities]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|pp=46–47}}

===Visual arts===
&lt;!--Iconography--&gt;
There are close to no Serbian churches that do not have a depiction of St. Sava.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} He is most often depicted as a [[archiereus]] (''arhijerej'', main priest), or together with his father, St. Simeon.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} The most notable of his fresco depictions are located in the monasteries of [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]], [[Mileševa]], [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Peć]], [[Morača (monastery)|Morača]], [[Church of St. Achillius, Arilje|Arilje]], [[Sopoćani]], [[Visoki Dečani|Dečani]], [[Hilandar]], [[Bogorodica Ljeviška]], [[Psača]], [[Lesnovo monastery|Lesnovo]], [[Marko's Monastery]], [[Matejić]], [[Church of St. George, Staro Nagoričane|Nagoričano]], [[Nikita Monastery|Nikita]], [[Andrijaš Monastery|Andrijaš]], [[Bela Crkva Karanska|Bela Crkva]], [[Baljevac Church|Baljevac]], [[Pavlica Monastery|Pavlica]], [[Ljubostinja]], [[Manasija|Resava]], [[Koporin]], [[Prohor Pčinjski]], [[Rudenica]], Blagoveštenje and St. Nicholas in [[Ovčar-Kablar Gorge|Ovčar]], [[Ježevica]], [[Poganovo Monastery|Poganovo]] and others; he is depicted with the Nemanjić dynasty (''[[Nemanjić family tree (art)|loza Nemanjića]]'') in [[Visoki Dečani|Dečani]], Peć and [[Orahovica Monastery|Orahovica]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} The translation of his relics are illustrated in the church of the [[Gradac Monastery]], and in the [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć|Monastery of Peć]] (in the Bogorodica Odigitrije temple) the scene where Sava appoints his successor Arsenije is depicted.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} In the Church of St. George, also in the [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć|Monastery of Peć]], an assembly of Sava is depicted.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} Iconographer (''zograf'') [[Georgije Mitrofanović]] illustrated events from the ''Life of St. Sava'' in the dining room of [[Hilandar]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} "The Serbian miracle-workers" Sava and Simeon are depicted in the Archangel Sobor in [[Kremlin]], in Moscow.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}} In the chapel of the [[Rila Monastery]] in Bulgaria, the ''Life of St. Sava'' is depicted in eight compositions, and in the Athonite monastery of [[St. Panteleimon Monastery]] he is depicted as a monk.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=47}}

===Literature===
Many Serbian poets have written poetry dedicated to St. Sava. These include [[Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]]'s (1833–1904) ''Pod ikonom Svetog Save'' and ''Suze Svetog Save'', [[Vojislav Ilić]]'s (1860–1894) ''Sveti Sava'' and ''Srpkinjica'', [[Milorad Popović Šapčanin]]'s (1841–1895) ''Svetom Savi'', [[Aleksa Šantić]]'s (1868–1924) ''Pred ikonom Svetog Save'', ''Pepeo Svetog Save'', ''Sveti Sava na golgoti'', [[Vojislav Ilić Mlađi]]'s (1877–1944) ''Sveti Sava'', [[Nikolaj Velimirović]]'s (1881–1956) ''Svetitelju Savo'', ''Reči Svetog Save'' and ''Pesma Svetom Savi'', [[Milan Petrović (poet)|Milan Petrović]]'s (1902–1963) ''Sveti Sava'', [[Vasko Popa]]'s (1922–1991) ''St. Sava's Journey'', [[Momčilo Tešić]]'s (1911–1992) ''Svetom Savi'', [[Desanka Maksimović]]'s (1898–1993) ''Savin monolog'', [[Matija Bećković]]'s (b. 1939) ''Priča o Svetom Savi'', [[Mićo Jelić Grnović]]'s (b. 1942) ''Uspavanka'', and others.

==Works==
The earliest works of Sava were dedicated to ascetic and monastic life: the Karyes Typikon and Hilandar Typikon.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 12}} In their nature, they are Church law, based strictly on non-literary works, however, in them some moments came to expression of indirect importance for the establishment of an atmosphere in which Sava's original and in the narrow sense, literary works, came to exist.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 12}} In addition, characteristics of Sava's language and style come to light here, especially in those paragraphs which are his specific interpretations or independent supplements.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 12}}
[[File:Karyes Typicon and Sava's signature.jpg|thumb|[[Karyes Typikon]] with Sava's signature (1199).]]
* [[Karyes Typikon]], written for the Karyes cell in 1199. It is basically a translation from a standard Greek ascetic typikon. It became a model for Serbian solitary or eremitical monasticism also outside of Mount Athos.&lt;ref name=Bogdanovic-Karejski&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 13&lt;!--Карејски типик--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hilandar Typikon]], written for Hilandar in 1199. Compiled as a translation and adaptation of the introductory part of the Greek Euergetic typikon from Constantinople. Sava only used some parts of that typikon, adding his own, different regulations tailored to the needs of Hilandar. He and his father had donated to the Euergetide monastery, and Sava stayed there on his trips to Constantinople, seemingly, he liked the order and way of life in this monastery. This typikon was to become the general managing order for other Serbian monasteries (with small modifications, Sava wrote the Studenica Typikon in 1208).&lt;ref name=Bogdanovic-Hilandarski1&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 14&lt;!--Хиландарски типик--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hilandar Typikon contains regulations for the spiritual life in the monastery and organization of various services of the monastic community (''opštežića'').&lt;ref name=Bogdanovic-Hilandarski2&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 15&lt;!--Хиландарски типик--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of the Serbian church with united areas was set on a completely new basis. The activity of major monasteries developed; caretaking of missionary work was put under the duty of the proto-priests (''protopopovi''). Legal regulations of the Serbian Church was constituted with a code of a new, independent, compilation of Sava – the ''Nomocanon'' or ''Krmčija''; with this codification of Byzantine law, Serbia already at the beginning of the 13th century received a firm legal order and became a state of law, in which the rich Greek-Roman law heritage was built. With this, Sava made Serbia a country among the European and Mediterranean civilization.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 8}}
[[File:Savino Zakonopravilo - Ilovichki prepis, 1262.jpg|thumb|150px|right|1262 transcript of the ''[[Zakonopravilo]]'' (1220).]]
* Nomocanon (sr. ''[[Zakonopravilo]]'') or ''Krmčija'', most likely created in Thessaloniki in 1220, when Sava returned from Nicaea to Serbia, regarding the organization of the new, autocephalous Serbian church. It was a compilation of state ("civil") law and religious rules or canons, with interpretations of famous Byzantine canonists, who by themselves were a kind of source of law. As Byzantine nomocanons, with or without interpretation, the Serbian Nomocanon was a capital source and monument of law; in the medieval Serbian state, it was the source of the first order as a "[[Divine right of kings|divine right]]"; after it, legislations of Serbian rulers (including [[Dušan's Code]]) were created. Sava was the initiator of the creation of this compilation, while the translation was likely the work of various authors, older and contemporary to Sava. An important fact is that the choice of compilation in this nomocanon was unique: it is not preserved in Greek manuscript tradition. In the ecclesiastic term, it is very characteristic, due to its opposing of that period's views in effect on church-state relations in Byzantium, and restoring of some older conceptions with which the sovereignty of divine law is insisted on.&lt;ref name=Bogdanovic-Krmcija&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 17&lt;!--Крмчија--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His liturgical regulations include also ''Psaltir-holding laws'' (Ustav za držanje Psaltira), which he translated from Greek, or as possibly is the case with the Nomocanon, was only the initiatior and organizer, and supervisor of the translation.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 18}} A personal letter of his, written from Jerusalem to his disciple ''hegumen'' Spiridon in Studenica, shows Sava getting closer to literature. This is the first work of the epistolary genre that has been preserved in the old Serbian literature. Theologian Lazar Mirković (1885–1968) noted "With a lot of feeling and longing for the fatherland in a distant world and caring for things in the homeland, Sava wrote this letter to Spiridon, reporting about him and his entourage, of them falling ill on the road, how they donated to the Holy sites, where he intended to travel, and along with the letter he sent gifts: a cross, pleat, cloth and pebbles. The cross and pleat had laid on Christ's grave, and hence these gifts received greater value. Sava perhaps found the cloth in Jordan".{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 19}} The letter has been preserved in 14th-century copies held in the [[Velika Remeta monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Đuro Daničić|title=Poslanica Svetog Save arhiepiskopa srpskoga|year=1872|publisher=JAZU|url=https://archive.org/stream/pismosvetogasaveigumanuspiridonunet/Produced_by_convert-jpg-to-pdf.net#page/n0/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proper literary nature of Sava is however revealed only in his hagiographical and poetic compositions. Each in its genre, they stand at the beginning of the development of convenient literary genres in the independent Serbian literature.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 20}}

In the Hilandar Typikon, Sava included the ''Short Hagiography of St. Simeon Nemanja'', which tells of Simeon's life between his arrival at Hilandar and death. It was written immediately after his death, in 1199 or 1200. The developed hagiography on St. Simeon was written in the introduction of the Studenica Typikon (1208).&lt;ref name=Kratko&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 21&lt;!--Кратко житије светог Симеона Немање--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Life of St. Simeon|Hagiography of St. Simeon]], written in 1208 as a ''ktetor'' hagiography of the founder of Studenica.&lt;ref name=Kratko/&gt; It was made according to the rules of Byzantine literature.&lt;ref name=Kratko/&gt; The hagiography itself, biography of a saint, was one of the main prose genres in Byzantium.&lt;ref name=Kratko/&gt; Hagiographies were written to create or spread the cult of the saint, and communicated the qualities of and virtues of the person in question.&lt;ref name=Kratko/&gt; The work focused on the monastic character of Simeon, using biographical information as a subset to his renouncing of the throne, power and size in the world for the Kingdom of Heaven.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 24}} Simeon is portrayed as a dramatic example of renouncing earthly life, as a representative of basic evangelical teachings and foundations of these, especially of monastic spirituality.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 24}} His biographical pre-history (conquests and achievements) with praises are merged in the prelude, followed by his monastic feats and his death, ending with a prayer instead of praise.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 24}} The language is direct and simple, without excessive rhetorics, in which a close witness and companion, participant in the life of St. Simeon, is recognized (in Sava).{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 25}} Milan Kašanin noted that "no old biography of ours is that little pompous and that little rhetorical, and that warm and humane as Nemanja's biography".{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 25}}

Very few manuscripts of the works of St. Sava have survived.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Рукописи}} Apart from the Karyes Typikon, of which copy, a scroll, is today held at Hilandar, it is believed that there are no original manuscript (''authograph'') of St. Sava.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Рукописи}} The original of the Charter of Hilandar (1198) was lost in World War I.{{sfn|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Рукописи}}

Sava founded and reconstructed churches and monasteries wherever he stayed.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} While staying at Vatopedi, even before the arrival of his father (1197), he founded three chapels (''paraklisi'').{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} He had the monastery church covered in [[lead]], and was regarded the second ''ktetor'', also having donated highly valuable ecclesiastical art objects.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=41}} Together with his father he was the great, second ktetor of the monasteries of [[Iviron]], [[Great Lavra]] and churches in [[Karyes, Mount Athos|Karyes]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} The most important was [[Hilandar]], together with his father (1198).{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} He then founded the cell at Karyes, and in 1199 became ktetor of three more Authonite monasteries: [[Karakallou]], [[Xeropotamou]], and [[Philotheou]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} In 1197 he gave a large contribution to the Constantinopolitan monastery of the Holy Mother of God Euergetes, and did the same to Philokallou in Thessaloniki; "due to him also giving much gold for the erection of that monastery, the population there regard him the ktetor", according to Teodosije.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}}
 [[File:Sveti Sava, Mileševa.jpg|thumb|200px|Fresco in Mileševa.]]
Returning to Serbia in 1206, Sava continued his work. The Mother of God Church in Studenica was painted, and two hermitages near Studenica were endowed.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} His most important architectural work was the Home of the Holy Saviour, called Žiča, the first seat of the Serbian Archbishopric.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} In Peć he built the Church of the Holy Apostles, and he was also involved in the building of the [[Mileševa]] monastery.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} In [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], on [[Mount Sinai]], he founded the Monastery of St. John the Apostle, as a shelter for Serb pilgrims.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} Sava donated gold to many monasteries in Palestine, Thessaloniki, and especially Mount Athos.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}} His ktetor activity was an expression of deep devotion and sincere loyalty to Christian ideals.{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=42}}

Shaucha, or holistic purity of the body, is considered essential for health, happiness and general well-being. External purity is achieved through daily ablutions, while internal purity is cultivated through physical exercises, including asana (postures) and pranayama (breathing techniques). Along with daily ablutions to cleanse one's body, the concept of Shaucha suggests clean surrounding, along with fresh and clean food to purify the body.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Brown, The Yoga Bible, {{ISBN|978-1582972428}}, page 14-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Birch (2010), Beyond Power Yoga: 8 Levels of Practice for Body and Soul, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0684855264}}, pages 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of Saucha, such as letting toxins build in body are a source of impurity.&lt;ref name=kvr&gt;K. V. Raghupathi, Yoga for Peace, {{ISBN|978-8170174837}}, pages 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaucha goes beyond purity of body, and includes purity of speech and mind. Anger, hate, prejudice, greed, pride, fear, negative thoughts are a source of impurity of mind.&lt;ref name=kvr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kadetsky (2008), Modeling School, The Antioch Review, Vol. 66, No. 2, pp. 254-268&lt;/ref&gt; The impurities of the intellect are cleansed through the process of self-examination, or knowledge of self (''Adhyatma-Vidya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/print.php?itemid=1558 Hinduism's Restraints and Observances] Hinduism Today, K.N.

Saucha is included as one of five ''[[Niyamas]]'' in Yoga, that is activity that is recommended for spiritual development of an individual. Verse II.32 of Yogasutra lists the five ''niyamas''.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: शौच संतोष तपः स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः || Translation: Saucha (purity), Santosha (contentment), Tapah (meditation), Svādhyāya (continuous learning), and Isvarapranidhana (contemplation of one's origins, God, Self) are the niyamas; Michele Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, pages 125-134&lt;/ref&gt; In verse II.40, Patanjali describes outer purity, while verse II.41 discusses inner purity,&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; as follows:

Through cleanliness and purity of body and mind (Saucha, Shudhi)
comes a purification of the essence (sattva),

The Epic [[Mahabharata]] mentions the virtue of purity (''Saucha'') in numerous books. For example, in Book 14 Chapter 38, it lists ''Saucha'' as a high quality found in the liberated, happy and [[dharma|dharmic]] person,

Purity of speech comes from being truthful and through use of words that are not injurious, hurtful or distressing to others or self. Purity of thoughts comes from reflection, peace of mind, silence, calmness, gentleness and purity of being.&lt;ref name=gf&gt;Gavin Flood (2005), The Ascetic Self: Subjectivity, Memory and Tradition, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521604017}}, pages 77-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Purity of mind, speech and body has been one of the important virtues in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan (1922), The Hindu Dharma, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 33, No. 1, pp. 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stefano (or Stephen) Pace''' (1695&amp;ndash;1735) was a minor Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Unfortunately, very little is known about the private life of Pace. It seems that, in his youth, he might have been a student at the ''[[Studium Generale]]'' of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. It seems he was a diocesan priest. Whatever the case, it is certain that he was a member of the clerical branch of the [[Franciscan Order]] in [[Malta]]. No portrait of Pace has been discovered so far.

==Extant work==

===Composition===
Only one work of Stephen Pace is known. It is a work in three volumes, of which only one – the third – is still extant.

This third volume is titled '''''La Fisica''''' (Physics). However, its complete title is ''La Fisica De’ Peripatetici, Cartesiani, ed Atomisti al paragone della vera fisica d’Aristotele'' (The Physics of the [[Peripatetics]], [[Cartesians]], and [[Atomists]], as compared to the True Physics of [[Aristotle]]).

It might be guessed that the former two volumes would have dealt with [[metaphysics]] and perhaps [[logic]]. But this, of course, cannot be assertained.

In any case, it is interesting that this book (and presumably the other volumes as well) was published in Venice, at the publishing house of Lorenzo Basegio. This alone might attest to Pace’s foreign experience as well as his standing amongst foreigners.

The extant volume on physics is in Italian and was published in 1729. The other volumes of the set must have been similar, and published around that year too. ''La Fisica'' contains 522 pages.

===Content===
The volume is divided into seven Treatises, and each one is sub-divided into Chapters. The title of the book might give the impression that Pace deals with physics in the sense commonly understood, as general or particular physics. However, in fact the work is specifically about the physical qualities and characteristics of animals, specifically from the point of view of [[Aristotle]].

Pace takes pains to refuse the interpretations given by various other Aristotelian commentators or by philosophers in general. As promised, he includes in his refutation some [[Cartesians]], [[Atomists]], and also other [[Physicalists]].

His detailed analysis in the treatises, all dealing with animals, focuses on the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul; movement, reproduction and nutrition, and the nature and faculties of the sensitive soul and the rational souls. At the end of his work, Pace includes an illustration on the physical structure of the eye, and the brain.

===Appreciation===
It can only be imagined what the two former volumes of Pace’s trilogy dealt with. However, if the third extant volume is anything to go by with, they must have been enormously interesting from a philosophical point of view. Not only as regards content but surely also as regards intensity, extensiveness and depth. Especially if they dealt with metaphysics and logic.

Having said this, it is certain that much research is needed in order that the full value of Pace is recognised. It is a pity, for instance, that the first two volumes of his trilogy have not yet been located. These would surely contribute to a fuller understanding of his philosophy and his worth.

Furthermore, the dearth of information concerning Pace’s personal life is truly unfortunate. He was not part of the great monastic movements, and yet he seems to have been a considerable success, both locally and abroad. This alone must be a sign of his esteem and value. The discoveries to be made might well justify the effort.

'''''The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx''''' is a 1968 book about the philosopher [[Karl Marx]] by the political scientist [[Shlomo Avineri]]. Commentators have praised the book, which has become a classic.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
Avineri discusses the work of the philosopher Karl Marx, writing that he aims to do so without political bias and to take account of the rediscovery of early works by Marx, such as the ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', and the ''[[Grundrisse]]''. He argues that previous discussions of Marx have suffered from lack of awareness of these works. In addition, he discusses ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and explores the influence of the philosophers [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] on Marx.{{sfn|Avineri|1970|page=vii, 1, 3, 30}}

==Publication history==
''The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx'' was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 1968.{{sfn|Avineri|1970|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Academic journals===
''The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx'' received positive reviews from Gianfranco Poggi in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' and Herminio Martins in ''[[The Sociological Review]]''.{{sfn|Poggi|1968|page=463}}{{sfn|Martins|1970|pages=300–303}} The book was also reviewed by George L. Donaldson in the ''International Review of Modern Sociology''.{{sfn|Donaldson|1972|pages=284–285}}

Poggi described the book as a convincing attempt to "locate the essential elements of continuity or discontinuity" in Marx's thought and to correct misinterpretations of it. He credited Avineri with "a close and insightful reading of the whole body of the primary sources, aided by a selective and judicious reading of the secondary literature", and described his writing as "learned and at the same time limpid" and his treatment of Marx as "solidly grounded, fair, and enlightening." However, he criticized Avineri for devoting insufficient space to discussing ''Das Kapital'' and Marx's views on the nature of capitalist society, and for failing to address the work of the philosophers [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Galvano Della Volpe]], both of whom challenged the view of the continuity of Marx's thought and its relationship to Hegel accepted by Avineri, and dismissing the relevance of empirical testing of Marx's ideas.{{sfn|Poggi|1968|page=463}}

Martins described the book as a "very scholarly work" and an "important contribution to the Marx interpretation debate." Though observing that Avineri wrote in seeming ignorance of the work of Althusser, he still credited him with providing "probably the most scholarly and sympathetic attempt to present the whole of Marx's writings as belonging to one and the same universe of discourse, as constituting essentially one unified thought system." He credited Avineri with providing a close scholarly analysis of Marx's early texts, "illuminating extracts from the entire corpus of Marxian writing", and an excellent analysis of the formation of Marx's concepts. However, he criticized Avineri for neglecting the analysis of Marx by G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">In the [[philosophy of science]], [[observation]]s are said to be "'''theory‐laden'''" when they are affected by the
[[scientific theory|theoretical]] [[presupposition]]s held by the investigator. The thesis of theory‐ladenness is most strongly
associated with the late 1950s and early 1960s work of [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]], and was probably first put forth (at least implicitly) by [[Pierre Duhem]] about 50 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Bogen, Jim (2014): [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/ "Theory and Observation in Science"], In: Edward N. Zalta (ed.), ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Two forms of theory‐ladenness should be kept separate: (a) ''The semantic form'': the meaning of observational terms is
partially determined by theoretical presuppositions; (b) ''The perceptual form'': the theories held by the investigator, at a very basic cognitive level, impinge on the perceptions of the investigator. The former may be referred to as semantic and the latter as perceptual theory‐ladenness. 

In a book showing the theory-ladenness of psychiatric evidences, Massimiliano Aragona (''Il mito dei fatti'', 2009) distinguished three forms of theory-ladenness. The "weak form" was already affirmed by [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (it is weak because he maintains the idea of a theoretical progress directed to the truth of scientific theories). The "strong" form was sustained by Kuhn and Feyerabend, with their notion of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]]. 

However, Kuhn was a moderate relativist {{cn|date=August 2015}} and maintained the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] view that although reality is not directly knowable, it manifests itself "resisting" to our interpretations. On the contrary, Feyerabend completely reversed the relationship between observations and theories, introducing an "extra-strong" form of theory-ladenness in which "anything goes".{{cn|date=August 2015}}

W. F. Hegel]]'s Chair in Philosophy at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].  As a polymathic philosopher, working in a modern research university, Dilthey's research interests revolved around questions of [[scientific methodology]], historical evidence and history's status as a science.  He could be considered an [[empiricist]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans Peter Rickman, ''Wilhelm Dilthey, Pioneer of the Human Studies'', University of California Press, 1979, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[idealism]] prevalent in Germany at the time, but his account of what constitutes the empirical and experiential differs from [[British empiricism]] and [[positivism]] in its central [[epistemological]] and [[ontological]] assumptions, which are drawn from German [[German literature|literary]] and [[German philosophy|philosophical]] traditions.

==Life==
Dilthey was born in 1833 as the son of a [[Calvinism|Reformed]] pastor in the village of [[Biebrich (Wiesbaden)|Biebrich]] in the [[Duchy of Nassau]], now in [[Hesse]], Germany.  As a young man he followed family traditions by studying [[theology]] at [[Heidelberg University]], where his teachers included the young [[Kuno Fischer]].  He then moved to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and was taught by, amongst others, [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]] and [[August Boeckh]], both former pupils of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].  In January 1864,&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;Iris Därmann, ''Fremde Monde der Vernunft: die ethnologische Provokation der Philosophie'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2005, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; he received his doctorate from Berlin with a thesis in Latin on the Schleiermacher's ethics, and in June of the same year&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt; he also earned his [[habilitation]] with a thesis on [[moral consciousness]].  He became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at Berlin in 1865.

In 1859, he edited Schleiermacher's letters and soon after he was also commissioned to write a biography—the first volume of which was eventually published in 1870. In 1867 he took up a professorship at the [[University of Basel]], but later—in 1882—he returned to Berlin where he held the prestigious chair in philosophy at the University.

In 1874, he married Katherine Puttmann, and the couple had one son and two daughters.

He died in 1911.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Makkreel, Rudolf, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/dilthey/ "Wilhelm Dilthey"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Hermeneutics===
Dilthey took some of his inspiration from the works of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] on [[hermeneutics]], which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to [[German Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramberg, Bjørn and Gjesdal, Kristin, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/ "Hermeneutics," ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, as the author of a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds to the questions raised by [[Johann Gustav Droysen|Droysen]] and [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that 'scientific explanation of nature' (''erklären'') must be completed with a theory of how the world is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. To provide such a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the [[humanities]]—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.

The school of Romantic hermeneutics stressed that historically embedded interpreters—a "living" rather than a [[Cartesian dualism]] or "theoretical" subject—use 'understanding' and 'interpretation' (''Verstehen''), which combine individual-psychological and social-historical description and analysis, to gain a greater knowledge of texts and authors in their contexts.  However, Dilthey remains distinct from other German Romantics and life philosophers through his emphasis on “historicality.”  Dilthey understood man as a historical being.  However, history is not described in terms of an object of the past, but “a series of world views.”&lt;ref name="Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 117"&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Man cannot understand himself through reflection or introspection, but only through what “history can tell him…never in objective concepts but always only in the living experience which springs up out of the depths of his own being.”&lt;ref name="Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 117"/&gt;  Dilthey wants to emphasize the “intrinsic temporality of all understanding,” that man’s understanding is dependent on past worldviews, interpretations, and a shared world.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. pp. 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of interpretive inquiry established by Schleiermacher involved what Dilthey called the [[hermeneutic circle]]—the recurring movement between the implicit and the explicit, the particular and the whole. Schleiermacher saw the approaches to interpreting sacred scriptures (for example, the Pauline epistles) and Classical texts (e.g. [[Plato]]'s philosophy) as more specific forms of what he proposed as "general hermeneutics" (''allgemeine Hermeneutik''). Schleiermacher approached hermeneutics as the “art of understanding” and recognized both the importance of language, and the thoughts of an author, to interpreting a text.&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. “The Hermeneutics: Outline of the 1819 Lectures,” ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilthey saw understanding as the key for the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en'') in contrast with the natural sciences.  The natural sciences observe and explain nature, but the humanities understand human expressions of life.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  So long as a science is “accessible to us through a procedure based on the systematic relation between life, expression, and understanding” Dilthey considered it a part of the human sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Henri Bergson]], Dilthey's work influenced early twentieth-century ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' and ''[[Existentialism|Existenzphilosophie]]''.

Dilthey's students included [[Bernhard Groethuysen]], [[Hans Lipps]], [[Herman Nohl]], [[Theodor Litt]], [[Eduard Spranger]], [[Georg Misch]] and [[Erich Rothacker]]. Dilthey's philosophy also influenced the religious philosopher [[Martin Buber]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibb.de/buber-martin-religionswisenschaft.php Martin Buber] at http://dibb.de.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iep.utm.edu/buber/ Martin Buber (1878—1965)]." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved 2015-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilthey's works informed the early [[Martin Heidegger]]'s approach to hermeneutics in his early lecture courses, in which he developed a "hermeneutics of factical life," and in ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927). But Heidegger grew increasingly critical of Dilthey, arguing for a more radical "temporalization" of the possibilities of interpretation and human existence.

In ''Wahrheit und Methode'' (''[[Truth and Method]]'', 1960), [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], influenced by Heidegger, criticised Dilthey's approach to hermeneutics as both overly aesthetic and subjective as well as method-oriented and "positivistic." According to Gadamer, Dilthey's hermeneutics is insufficiently concerned with the ontological event of truth and inadequately considers the implications of how the interpreter and the interpreter's interpretations are not outside of tradition but occupy a particular position within it, i.e., have a temporal horizon.

===Psychology&lt;!--'Explanatory psychology', 'Explanative psychology', 'Descriptive psychology (Dilthey)', 'Analytic psychology (Dilthey)', and 'Structural psychology (Dilthey)' redirect here--&gt;===
Dilthey was interested in psychology. In his work ''Ideas Concerning a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology'' (''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', 1894),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/spdk/dilthey/wd-bezepsy1.html Full text online on gleichsatz.de].&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced a distinction between '''explanatory psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''erklärende Psychologie''; also '''explanative psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) and '''descriptive psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''beschreibende Psychologie''; also '''analytic psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, ''zergliedernde Psychologie''): in his terminology, explanatory psychology is the study of psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view, which involves their subordination to a system of causality, while descriptive psychology is a discipline that attempts to explicate how different mental processes converge in the "structural nexus of [[consciousness]]."&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

The distinction is based on the more general distinction between explanatory/explanative sciences (''erklärende Wissenschaften''), on the one hand, and descriptive/interpretive sciences (''beschreibende Wissenschaften'' or ''verstehende Wissenschaften'', that is, the sciences which are based on the ''[[Verstehen]]'' method), on the other—see [[#Distinction between natural sciences and human sciences|below]].

In his later work (''Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften'', 1910), he used the alternative term '''structural psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''Strukturpsychologie'') for descriptive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', Princeton University Press, 2002, pp. 16–7 and 38–9; Rudolf A. Makkreel, ''Dilthey: Philosopher of the Human Studies'', Princeton University Press, 1992, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
Dilthey was also interested in what some would call [[sociology]] in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. He objected to their [[dialectic]]al/[[evolution]]ist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of [[positivism]] was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good things to say about the [[neo-Kantian]] sociology of [[Georg Simmel]], with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;See Addenda to Vol. I of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' in Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''  trans. Ramon J. Betanoz, 'Appendix: Supplementary Material from the Manuscripts', 1988, pp. 3314–.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel himself was later an associate of [[Max Weber]], the primary founder of sociological [[antipositivism]]. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of [[antipositivism|nonpositivist ''verstehende'' sociology]] and the ''[[Verstehen]]'' method.

===Distinction between natural sciences and human sciences&lt;!--linked from the 'Psychology' section--&gt;===
A lifelong concern was to establish a proper theoretical and methodological foundation for the "human sciences" (e.g. history, law, literary criticism), distinct from, but equally "scientific" as, the "natural sciences" (e.g. physics, chemistry). He suggested that all human experience divides naturally into two parts: that of the surrounding natural world, in which "objective necessity" rules, and that of inner experience, characterized by "sovereignty of the will, responsibility for actions, a capacity to subject everything to thinking and to resist everything within the fortress of freedom of his/her own person".&lt;ref name=Einleitung&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften'', 1972, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilthey strongly rejected using a model formed exclusively from the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften''), and instead proposed developing a separate model for the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). His argument centered around the idea that in the natural sciences we seek to explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect, or the general and the particular; in contrast, in the human sciences, we seek to ''understand'' in terms of the relations of the part and the whole. In the social sciences we may also combine the two approaches, a point stressed by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. His principles, a general theory of understanding or comprehension (''[[Verstehen]]'') could, he asserted, be applied to all manner of interpretation ranging from ancient texts to art work, religious works, and even law. His interpretation of different theories of [[aesthetics]] in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was preliminary to his speculations concerning the form aesthetic theory would take in the twentieth century.

Both the natural and human sciences originate in the context or "nexus of life" (''Lebenszusammenhang''), a concept which influenced the phenomenological account of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''), but are differentiated in how they relate to their life-context. Whereas the natural sciences abstract away from it, it becomes the primary object of inquiry in the human sciences.

Dilthey defended his use of the term ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' (literally, "science of the mind" or "spiritual knowledge") by pointing out that other terms such as "social science" and "cultural sciences" are equally one-sided and that the human mind or spirit is the central phenomenon from which all others are derived and analyzable.&lt;ref name=Einleitung/&gt; For Dilthey, like Hegel, ''Geist'' ("mind" or "spirit") has a cultural rather than a social meaning. It is not an abstract intellectual principle or disembodied behavioral experience but refers to the individual's life in its concrete cultural-historical context.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Weltanschauungen===
In 1911, Dilthey developed a typology of the three basic ''[[Weltanschauung]]en'', or World-Views, which he considered to be "typical" (comparable to Max Weber's notion of "ideal types") and conflicting ways of conceiving of humanity's relation to [[Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Die Typen der Weltanschauung und ihre Ausbildung in den Metaphysischen Systemen'', Berlin: Reichl, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]], represented by [[Epicurean]]s of all times and places, humans see themselves as determined by nature
* in the Idealism of Freedom (or [[Subjective Idealism]]), represented by [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], humans are conscious of their separation from nature by their free will
* in [[Objective Idealism]], represented by [[G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Giordano Bruno]], humans are conscious of their harmony with nature.
This approach influenced [[Karl Jaspers]]' ''Psychology of Worldviews'' as well as [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s  ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]''.

===Comparison with the Neo-Kantians===
Dilthey's ideas should be examined in terms of his similarities and differences with [[Wilhelm Windelband]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]], members of the [[Baden School]] of [[Neo-Kantianism]]. Dilthey was not a Neo-Kantian, but had a profound knowledge of Immanuel Kant's philosophy, which deeply influenced his thinking. But whereas Neo-Kantianism was primarily interested in epistemology on the basis of Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Dilthey took Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' as his point of departure. An important debate between Dilthey and the Neo-Kantians concerned the "human" as opposed to "cultural" sciences, with the Neo-Kantians arguing for the exclusion of psychology from the cultural sciences and Dilthey for its inclusion as a human science.

==Editorial work==
In 1859, Dilthey was asked to complete the editing of Schleiermacher's letters.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

Dilthey also inaugurated the Academy edition (the ''Akademie-Ausgabe'' abbreviated as ''AA'' or ''Ak'') of Kant's writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'', [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]], Berlin, 1902–38) in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Notes and Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its first editor.

'''Émile Lasbax''' was a [[French philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] of the early 20th century.

== Biography ==
Lasbax was born in the [[commune]] of [[Rieumes]] ([[Haute-Garonne]]) of southwestern [[France]] in 1888. He completed his doctoral thesis, ''Le Problème du Mal'' [''The Problem of Evil''], at the [[University of Bordeaux]] under the supervision of [[Gaston Richard]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Clark, ''Prophets and Patrons: The French University and the Emergence of the Social Sciences'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), 224.&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught in the French [[lycée]] at [[Tarbes]] and [[Roanne]] until he was granted a professorship in [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]] in the Faculty of Letters at the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand]] in 1925. It is here that he would remain until his retirement in 1942. Lasbax was best known for being the successor to [[Gaston Richard]] as the director of the ''Revue Internationale de Sociologie'' [''International Review of Sociology''] in 1934 but was also a corresponding member of the ''Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie'' [''German Society for Sociology''] and also the ''Academy of Political Sciences'' at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Bernsdorf_232"&gt;Wilhelm Bernsdorf and Horst Knospe, ed., ''Internationales Soziologenlexikon'' [''Lexicon of International Sociology''] (Stuttgart: Ferdinand Enke Verlag, POB, 1980), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought ==
Lasbax's original work can largely be characterized as a synthesis of [[metaphysics]] and [[sociology]]. He saw the spiritual and material life of collective society as thoroughly intertwined and asserted that history was developmental such that its final state would yield a truly "human society."&lt;ref name="Bernsdorf_232"/&gt;

== Influences ==
Early on, Lasbax was heavily influenced by the work of [[Théodore Eugène César Ruyssen|Théodore Ruyssen]] who was, himself, an interpreter of [[Henri Bergson]]. Nevertheless, he drew from a wide variety of thinkers to develop his own original work. Such thinkers include [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Auguste Comte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Goossens, Review of ''La Dialectique et le Rythme de l'Univers (Cahiers de Synthèse Dialectique, I)'', by Émile Lasbax, ''Revue Néo-Scolastique de Philosophie'' 28 (1926): 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Þorsteinn Gylfason''' (12 August 1942&amp;nbsp;– 16 August 2005) was an [[Iceland]]ic philosopher, translator, musician and poet. Þorsteinn distinguished himself in Icelandic public life with his writings in newspapers, journals and publications.

== His life and accomplishments ==

=== Early life ===
Þorsteinn was born and raised in [[Reykjavík]], the capital of Iceland. His parents were Guðrún Vilmundardóttir and [[Gylfi Þorsteinsson Gíslason]], a university professor and government minister. He was the brother of [[Vilmundur Gylfason]], a politician, and [[Þorvaldur Gylfason]], an economist.

Þorsteinn graduated from the [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in 1961 and subsequently received a grant to study at [[Harvard University]]. He left Harvard with a B.A. degree in [[philosophy]], having studied under the tutelage of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. He returned home for graduate studies in Icelandic, and later attended the University of Munich and Magdalen College, Oxford from 1965 to 1971. At Oxford, he studied under [[Gilbert Ryle]] and befriended well-known characters from philosophical circles, such as [[Alfred Jules Ayer]]. This influence affected his work in philosophy to a considerable extent.

=== Career ===
Þorsteinn worked as an assistant professor at the [[University of Iceland]] from 1971, and was made full professor in 1989. He was visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[London School of Economics]].

Þorsteinn received a number of awards and acknowledgements for his works, amongst them the [[Þórbergur Þórðarson]] and National Icelandic Literature Prizes in 1997. In 1994, he was awarded the [[Knights Cross of the Icelandic Falcon]] by Icelandic president [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] for his contributions to Icelandic culture and academia.

=== Works ===
Þorsteinn wrote 12 books on philosophy and philology, including ''An Essay on Man'' (1970), ''An Essay on the World'' (1992), ''Thinking in Icelandic'' (1996) and ''Justice and Injustice'' (1998). He also published over 37 academic papers in various philosophical journals and composed poetry and lyrics, either with musical composer [[Atli Heimir Sveinsson]] or to the music of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Richard Wagner]].

His translations to Icelandic included ''[[On Liberty]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''Repetitions'', [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', all of whom were published by the [[Icelandic Literature Society]], for which he served as a series chief editor for almost two decades.

=== Philosophy ===
Þorsteinn's philosophical work was mostly in the philosophy of language and mind and political philosophy. His method and style of philosophy was very much rooted in the [[analytic tradition]], through influence from men such as [[W.V.O. Quine]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]]. He also found inspiration in the continental philosophers, especially from [[existentialism]] in the style of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], whose works he translated into Icelandic. Later on, his focus was on contemporary work by [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[John Rawls]], [[Philippa Foot]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[Richard Rorty]].

Þorsteinn's early works (''An Essay on Man'' in particular) are in the style of 20th century [[logical positivism]]—highly suspicious of esoteric Hegelian metaphysics. He later turned away from comprehensive theories to focus on specific problems. He considered himself an analytic philosopher insofar as "the ideas that have proven to be the most fruitful and inspiring, have been those of scholars generally considered to be 'analytic philosophers'. He usually said he was not much of a utilitarian neither in personal thinking nor politics and favoured deontology and virtue ethics.

His final words when describing himself as a philosopher were: "I believe that no philosophical theory can avoid paying the utmost heed to the natural sciences."

=== Death ===
Þorsteinn was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the stomach on 12 August 2005 and died four days later. His funeral took place in [[Reykjavík Cathedral]].
