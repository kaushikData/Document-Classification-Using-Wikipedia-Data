An '''Advanced Thermal Recycling (ATR) system''' (or '''ATR system''') is an advancement of existing [[energy-from-waste]] (EfW) technology. An ATR system converts [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) into either electricity or steam for district heating or industrial customers. The combustion bottom ash and the combustion fly ash, along with the air pollution control system fly ash, are treated to produce products that can be beneficially reused. Specifically, ATR systems consist of the following:	
* Solid waste combustion, boiler and combustion control system, [[energy recovery]] and air pollution control equipment;
* Combustion [[bottom ash]] and [[fly ash]] treatment systems that produce commercially reusable products; and
* An optional pre-processing system to recover recyclable materials contained in the MSW delivered to the facility before the MSW enters the thermal processing area of the facility.

== Application in Germany ==
As a result of the growing need to manage waste from throughout greater Hamburg, the first commercially operating ATR facility – the Müllverwertung Rugenberger Damm (MVR) in Hamburg, Germany – was commissioned in 1999. The [[German Green Party]] has endorsed the specific features of the MVR facility in its "Concept 2020" initiative to cease all landfilling of waste by 2020 as an essential part of an integrated waste management system achieving the highest standards in the EfW industry. No landfilling of unprocessed waste has been allowed in Germany since 2005, and all 27 countries in the European Community are required to adopt similar bans by 2020.

== ATR process description ==
Quality control occurs at the inception of the process. Overhead refuse cranes, which hold approximately 5 tons{{which|date=September 2014}} each, mix the waste in the bunker to create a homogeneous mixture. This is important for good combustion and low carbon content in the bottom ash by-product. These cranes then deliver the mixed waste into the feeding hopper which leads down onto highly engineered stoker grates which control the rate that waste travels through the boiler. The intense heat ignites the waste as it moves along the forward feeding grates until only the by-product bottom ash remains at the end of the grate. Each combustion line feeds a boiler that operates at a temperature above {{convert|1560|°F}} for 2 seconds. The temperature in the combustion zone is measured through acoustic monitoring.

Careful monitoring of the combustion process guarantees complete burning of the combustible material in an environmentally safe manner. A highly sophisticated computer controls the temperature, the grate speed, the amount of air used and all other aspects of the process that enables complete combustion and minimization of emissions to occur.

The maintenance of the furnace's high temperature is essential to rid the waste and the resulting combustion gases of complex organic compounds such as dioxin/[[furans]]. To prevent the reformulation of pollutants, fly ash is separated from the [[flue gas]] downstream of the [[super heater]]s to reduce the fly ash content, which could act as a [[catalyst]] in the critical reformulation temperature range of {{convert|600|to|400|°F|°C}}. At the exit of the boiler, the flue gas has been cooled down to a level of {{convert|340|°F}}.

'''''Converting waste heat to electricity.''''' As the waste is combusted, heat is released in the boiler. This heat is used to produce high-pressure, high-temperature, super-heated steam, which generates electrical energy when passed through a turbine-generator. The electricity is fed into the public power grid or can be sold directly to a customer. The steam can also be exported directly for use in district heating or industrial processes.

'''''Air pollution control.''''' Each unit has an independent air pollution control system. Flue gas cleaning begins in the boiler, where oxides of [[nitrogen]] are reduced by injecting [[ammonia]] water into the combustion chamber. Lightly loaded absorbents (activated carbon from the second bag house) are injected into the flue gas downstream of the first bag house to separate any contaminants that have reformed (such as organic compounds like [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and furans), any condensed heavy metals, salts and other gaseous contaminants, as well as residue fly ash.

The first bag house is an essential part of the air pollution control system insofar as it makes it possible to produce reusable by-products such as hydrochloric acid and gypsum from the consecutive air pollution control process steps. [[Acid gases]] are removed from the flue gases by passing through a two-stage scrubber to remove acid components, especially [[halogen]] compounds such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]. A counter flow neutral scrubber follows, using a lime slurry to remove sulphur oxides (SO2, SO3). The pollutant gases are either dissolved in water droplets (acids) or bound as calcium salts (SO2, SO3) and thereby are successfully removed from the flue gas. A second bag house acts as a polishing filter to capture any remaining [[aerosols]], [[organic compounds]] and heavy metals, which thereby are reduced to levels usually below detection.

'''''Converting combustion residue to marketable byproducts.''''' The ATR process produces other marketable products in addition to energy. Following combustion, the material left consists of the non-combustible components of the waste and the inert materials produced during combustion. This is known as slag or bottom ash. The bottom ash is washed to eliminate soluble salts. Iron scrap and non-ferrous metals such as aluminium, copper and brass are separated and sold in secondary metals markets The bottom ash is then screened, crushed and sold for use as a construction material comparable to aggregate mined from a quarry or made from processed demolition waste.

[[Gypsum]] is created when the oxides of sulphur (SO2 and SO3) are separated by the single stage scrubber. It is purified, then sold to the construction industry.

The acid scrubbing process in the flue gas treatment system also produces a raw hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a concentration of 10%-12%. The acid is distilled (rectified) to yield commercial grade (30% concentration) hydrochloric acid.

'''''Fly Ash Treatment.''''' Fly ash, which is separated in the boiler and baghouses and constitutes up to 5% by weight of the combusted MSW, is treated to recover metals and minerals for reuse, resulting in an overall ATR process landfill diversion rate of approximately 98.5%.

== Advantages of ATR ==
ATR systems offer flue gas cleanup and emissions performance that meet or exceed the strictest clean air laws in the United States and the European Union. Emissions from an ATR plant contain fewer metals, dioxins and conventional pollutants than other EfW approaches.

ATR systems increase a facility’s “diversion rate” – the percentage of materials coming into plants that are destroyed or converted to energy and useful byproducts. The majority of EfW plants in the US, after incineration and recovery of some metals, combine both bottom ash and fly ash (20-25% of MSW input by weight) and send it to a landfill. ATR systems, by contrast, landfill less than 2 percent of a plant’s MSW input; all remaining MSW is converted into either energy or usable products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9328">'''Backcasting''' is a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect that specified future to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Page 12. The Soft Path for Water in a Nutshell (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B. Brooks. A joint publication of Friends of the Earth Canada and the [[POLIS Project on Ecological Governance]]. [[University of Victoria]], Victoria BC.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John B. Robinson from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1990"&gt;Robinson, John B. 1990. Futures under glass: a recipe for people who hate to predict ''Futures'', vol. 22, issue 8, pp. 820–842.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental question of backcasting asks: "if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?"&lt;ref&gt;Tinker, J. 1996. From 'Introduction' ix-xv. Life in 2030: Exploring a Sustainable Future for Canada, edited by J.B. Robinson et al. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 5. Environmental Change and Challenge : A Canadian Perspective by Philip Dearden, Bruce Mitchell. {{ISBN|0-19-541014-9}} / 9780195410143 / 0-19-541014-9. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[forecasting]] involves predicting the future based on current trend analysis, backcasting approaches the challenge of discussing the future from the opposite direction; it is "a method in which the future desired conditions are envisioned and steps are then defined to attain those conditions, rather than taking steps that are merely a continuation of present methods extrapolated into the future".&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg &amp; Robèrt (2000), p.294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In statistics and data analysis, backcasting can be considered to be the opposite of forecasting; thus:
* ''forecasting'' involves the prediction of the future (''unknown'') values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]] based on ''known'' values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]].
* ''backcasting'' involves the prediction of the ''unknown'' values of the independent variables that '''''might''''' have existed, in order to explain the ''known'' values of the dependent variable.&lt;ref name="Stan Development Team"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stan Development Team |date=2014-07-20 |title=Stan Modeling Language: User's Guide and Reference Manual |url=http://mc-stan.org/manual.html |location=pg. 39 |publisher=Stan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backcasting vs. Forecasting ==
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Backcasting, a term first coined by John Robinson in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson (1982, 1988, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (1980), and Bunn and Salo (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving "working backwards" from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;Derborg (1996), p.814.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503):
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==Practical applications==
Backcasting is increasingly used in urban planning and resource management of water and energy. It was used by [[Peter Gleick]] and colleagues at the [[Pacific Institute]] in a 1995 study on California water policy, as an alternative to traditional California water planning approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P.H., P. Loh, S.V. Gomez, J. Morrison. 1995. California Water 2020: A Sustainable Vision. Pacific Institute, Oakland, California (May 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Capital Regional District]] Water Services, which services the greater [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] area in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], committed to backcasting to the year 2050 as a formal element of all future strategic water planning initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crd.bc.ca/minutes/wateradvisorycommitt_/2006_/dec12/dec12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is a key component of the [[soft energy path]], a concept developed by [[Amory Lovins]] after the shock of the [[1973 energy crisis]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" published in Foreign Affairs, in October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting from Sustainability Principles, or [[System conditions of sustainability]] is a key concept of the '[[Strategic sustainable development|Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development]]' pioneered by [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]], founder of [[The Natural Step]], an international nonprofit organization dedicated to applied research for sustainability, in cooperation with a global academic [http://www.alliance-ssd.org Alliance for Strategic Sustainable Development ] which links universities which cooperate with businesses, and other NGOs. It has been refined and tested by peer-review and application within businesses (widely known examples are: Interface, Nike, Whistler).

Backcasting is used in climate reconstruction or cosmology to determine the conditions (i.e., values of unknown independent variables) that existed in the distant past based on ''known'' (more accurately estimated) values of past dependent variables.&lt;ref name="Stan Development Team"/&gt;

'''Blinding''' is a type of [[physical punishment]] which results in complete or nearly complete [[Visual impairment|loss of vision]]. It has been used as an act of [[revenge]] and [[torture]].&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goes|first1=Frank Joseph|title=The Eye in History|date=2013|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=9350902745|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment has been used since [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]]; [[Greek mythology]] makes several references to blinding as divine punishment, which reflects human practice.

In the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many other historical societies, blinding was accomplished by gouging out the eyes, sometimes using a hot poker, and by pouring a boiling substance, such as vinegar, on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawler|first1=Jennifer|title=Encyclopedia of the Byzantine Empire|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=1476609292|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==

===In mythology and religious law===
[[Oedipus]], who gouged out his own eyes after accidentally fulfilling the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Martha L.|title=The Staff of Oedipus: Transforming Disability in Ancient Greece|date=2003|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472113399|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]], [[Samson]] was blinded upon his capture by the [[Philistines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartsock|first1=Chad|title=Sight and Blindness in Luke-Acts: The Use of Physical Features in Characterization|date=2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004165355|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] were often blinded as a penalty for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearman|first1=Tory Vandeventer|title=Women and Disability in Medieval Literature|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0230117562|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[St. Lucy]]'s torturers tore out her eyes.

Blinding survives as a form of penalty in the modern era, especially as part of the [[sharia]] law. In 2003, a [[Pakistan]]i court sentenced a man to be blinded after he subjected his fiancee to an [[Acid throwing|acid attack]] resulting in loss of vision. The man who blinded [[Ameneh Bahrami]] in an [[acid attack]] was sentenced to blinding by an [[Iran]]ian court in 2009; Bahrami eventually pardoned the attacker.&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

===In history===
In the Middle Ages, blinding was used as a penalty for treachery or as a means of rendering a political opponent unable to rule and lead an army in war.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Michael|title=The Death of Kings: Royal Deaths in Medieval England|date=2007|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1852855851|pages=37, 89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[William the Conqueror]] used blinding as a punishment for rebellion to replace the [[death penalty]] in his laws for [[Kingdom of England|England]].

Blinding was a punishment for killing a [[Hart (deer)|hart]] or [[hind (deer)|hind]] in a [[royal forest]].

[[Henry I of England]] blinded [[William, Count of Mortain]], who had fought against him at [[Battle of Tinchebray|Tinchebray]] in 1106. He also ordered blinding and [[castration]] as a punishment for thieves.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;

In 1014, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Basil II]] had 99 of every 100 captured [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] blinded, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their commander.&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

[[Béla II of Hungary|Bela II of Hungary]] and his father was blinded by [[Coloman, King of Hungary]].

The '''''Caracazo''''', or '''''sacudón''''', is the name given to the wave of protests, riots, looting, shootings and massacres&lt;ref name = "Reuters"&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN21321293 | publisher = Reuters | title=Venezuela exhumes unnamed dead in riot investigation | date=22 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that began on 27 February 1989 in [[Venezuela]]'s capital, [[Caracas]], and the surrounding towns. The weeklong clashes resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, thousands by some accounts, mostly at the hands of security forces and the military.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN, VENEZUELA: Wound Still Gaping 20 Years after ‘Caracazo’, By Humberto Márquez, CARACAS, Feb 27 2009 (IPS),http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/02/venezuela-wound-still-gaping-20-years-after-lsquocaracazorsquo/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[[Amnesty International]], March 1990, Reports of Arbitrary Killings and Torture:, February/March 1989 , AI Index: AMR 53/02/90, https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr53/002/1991/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The riots and the protests began mainly in response to the government's economic reforms and the resulting increase in the price of gasoline and transportation.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Caracazo'' is the name of the city followed by the [[Spanish nouns#Other suffixes|''-azo'' suffix]], which denotes a violent knock. Its translation could therefore be "the Caracas smash" or "the big one in Caracas". The name was inspired by the ''[[Bogotazo]]'', a massive riot in neighboring [[Colombia]] in 1948, which played a pivotal role in that country's history. ''Sacudón'' is from ''sacudir'' (to shake) and means something along the lines of "the day that shook the country" (see [[Spanish nouns#Other suffixes|Spanish nouns: Other suffixes]]).

The words are pronounced {{IPA-es|kaɾaˈkaso|}} and {{IPA-es|sakuˈðon|}}, respectively.

==Background==
A fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s caused an economic crisis to take hold in Venezuela, and the country had accrued significant levels of debt. Nevertheless, the administration of the [[political left|left]]-leaning President [[Jaime Lusinchi]] was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barcelona Centre for International Affairs]], Jaime Lusinchi, (Spanish) http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusinchi's political party, the [[Democratic Action]], was able to remain in power following the 1988 election of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] as president. Pérez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing [[neoliberal]] economic reforms recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The program, called ''El Gran Viraje'' (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the ''paquete'' (the "package"), was contrary to statements made during Pérez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as "a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing."&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040189,00.html Carlos Andrés Pérez, Obituary], Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures taken by Pérez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the elimination of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} When the subsidy was eliminated, gasoline prices rose by as much as 100% and so the costs of public transportation rose by 30%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Weeks before the outbreak of rioting, Carlos Andrés Pérez was inaugurated on 2 February 1989. During the "lavish ceremony", [[Fidel Castro]] and other Cuban personnel entered Venezuela for the event. With Cuba recently entering its [[Special Period]], experiencing economic difficulties as a result of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Perestroika]], Castro allegedly sought to establish an ally in Venezuela so Cuba could also enjoy funds oil profits. The group of Cubans allegedly established a headquarters at the nearly finished Eurobuilding Hotel in Caracas and after the event, Venezuelan intelligence reported that less Cuban personnel departed from Venezuela than arrived. Cuban sleeper agents then allegedly waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.&lt;ref name="DELFINcoro"/&gt;

==Protests and rioting==
[[File:Caracazo looting 2.png|250px|thumb|right|Looters running through the streets with stolen goods]]
The protests and rioting began on the morning of February 27, 1989, in [[Guarenas]], a town in [[Miranda State]] about {{convert|30|km}} east of Caracas, by the steep increase in public transportation prices.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IACtHR&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/C/58-ing.html El Caracazo Case, Judgment of 11 November 1999], Inter-American Court of Human Rights, accessed 1 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The protests and rioting quickly spread to the capital and other towns across the country. A lack of timely intervention by authorities - some police were under orders not to take action - led to the Metropolitan Police quickly being overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; Despite initial debate within the government over how to manage the situation, a heavyhanded approach was implemented, with a [[state of emergency]] and [[martial law]] being imposed.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;

On February 28, Pérez suspended a number of articles of the Constitution, including Article 60 (right to individual liberty and security), Article 62 (inviolability of the home), Article 66 (freedom of expression), Article 71 (right to gather publicly and privately), and Article 115 (right to peaceful protest).&lt;ref name=Crisp&gt;Crisp, Brian F. (1998), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA150 Presidential Decree Authority in Venezuela]", in John M. Carey and Matthew Soberg Shugart (eds, 1998), ''Executive decree authority'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. p150&lt;/ref&gt; The rights were not completely restored until March 22, and in the interim, there was no official decree or resolution to define how government authority would be exercised in the absence of those constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=Crisp/&gt;

[[File:Caracazo fire.png|250px|thumb|left|Smoke billowing from fires throughout Caracas]] 
[[File:Caracazo riot 2.png|250px|thumb|right|Large crowds of people gather during the rioting]]

By the time authorities encountered the scenes of rioting, citizens began firing weapons at officers, with ensuing firefights resulted in many bystanders being killed by "bullets from army troops and from sniping protesters".&lt;ref name="GAZ5"&gt;{{cite news|title=Riots leave Venezuela short of coffins; Up to 700 reported dead while hospitals say most of the injured were shot: B1|work=[[Montreal Gazette|The Gazette]]|date=5 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; In many poor areas, citizens destroyed their own local commercial facilities, with food markets so damaged that their food distribution system was ruined.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt; Much of the rioters destroyed properties indiscriminately, with no motives related to initial protests.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], tactics used by security forces included "disappearances," the use of torture, and extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; As part of the government's security forces, members of [[Hugo Chávez]]'s [[MBR-200]] allegedly participated in the crackdown.&lt;ref name=NELSON&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Brian A.|title=The silence and the scorpion: the coup against Chávez and the making of modern Venezuela|date=2009|publisher=Nation Books|location=New York|isbn=1568584180|page=24|edition=online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chávez himself was sick that day with the [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hugo Chávez: Oil, Politics, and the Challenge to the U.S.|last = Kozloff|first = Nikolas|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 9781403984098|location = |pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As tensions eased, troops began to sweep through neighborhoods collecting appliances and cash registers, telling citizens that if they provided a certificate of purchase, the items would be returned.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt;

The initial official pronouncements said 276 people had died&lt;ref name=IACtHR/&gt; but many estimates put the number at above 2,000.&lt;ref name=Crisp2&gt;Crisp, Brian F. (1998), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA150 Presidential Decree Authority in Venezuela]", in John M. Carey and Matthew Soberg Shugart (eds, 1998), ''Executive decree authority'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. p157&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of coffins were reported and many Venezuelans had to line up at government food distribution centers since markets were destroyed by rioters.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt; Insurance estimates of damage caused during the rioting were $90 million CAD ($120 million 2017 USD).&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt;

==Aftermath and consequences==
On March 3, 1989, Pérez spoke with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]]. President Bush offered President Pérez a US$450 million emergency loan. Pérez thanked Bush and asked him to support a change in debt policy toward Latin America: "I want to tell you if there is no change in [international] debt policy then whatever we may do here may be useless."&lt;ref name="bushlibrary.tamu.edu"&gt;Bush Presidential Library, 3 March 1989, Memcons and Telcons, http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/research/pdfs/memcons_telcons/1989-03-03--Perez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez told Bush that he had sent him a letter several days earlier and that he would appreciate it if he would read it.&lt;ref name="bushlibrary.tamu.edu"/&gt;

===Political instability===
The clearest consequence of the ''Caracazo'' was political instability. The following February, the army was called to contain similar riots in [[Puerto La Cruz]] and [[Barcelona, Venezuela|Barcelona]] and again in June, when rising of transportation costs ended in riots in [[Maracaibo]] and other cities. The reforms were modified.

The MBR-200 repudiated the Caracazo and accelerated its preparation for a [[coup d'état]] against the Perez government.&lt;ref name=HELLINGER&gt;{{Cite book|title = Comparative Politics of Latin America: Democracy at Last?|last = Hellinger|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 9781134070077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 there were two attempted coups in [[Venezuelan coup attempt of 1992|February and November]]. Pérez was later accused of corruption and removed from the presidency. Chávez, a MBR-200 leader and an organiser of one of the coups, was found guilty of sedition and incarcerated. However, he was subsequently pardoned by Pérez's successor, [[Rafael Caldera]], and he went on to be elected president after the latter. Chavez later explained that after the event, "the members of the MBR 200 realized we had passed the point of no return and we had to take up arms. We could not continue to defend a murderous regime."&lt;ref name=HELLINGER/&gt;

===Investigations===
[[File:Caracazo military response.png|250px|thumb|right|Military response to the rioting.]]
In 1998, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] condemned the government's action and referred the case to the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]. In 1999, the Court heard the case and found that the government had committed violations of [[human rights]], including extrajudicial killings. The Venezuelan government, by then headed by Chávez, did not contest the findings of the case and accepted full responsibility for the government's actions.&lt;ref name=IACtHR/&gt;

In August 2009, Defense Minister [[Italo del Valle Alliegro]] was charged in relation to the ''Caracazo''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[BBC]]'', 18 July 2009, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8157088.stm Former Venezuela minister charged]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the Supreme Court overturned an appeal court ruling, which had declared the case covered by a [[statute of limitations]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Latin American Herald Tribune]]'', 2 August 2010, [http://laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=361489&amp;CategoryId=10717 Venezuela’s Ex-Defense Chief May Face Charges for ‘89 Repression]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Causal body''' - originally '''''Karana-Sarira''''' - is a [[Yoga|Yogic]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] concept that was adopted and modified by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and from the latter made its way into the general [[New Age]] movement and contemporary western [[esotericism]]. It generally refers to the highest or innermost body that veils the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]] or true [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Three Bodies Doctrine}}
{{See also|Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñānas|l1=Ālayavijñānas}}

''Karana sarira'' or the causal body is the cause{{sfn|Sharma|2006|p=193}} or seed of the subtle body and the gross body. It has no other function than being the seed of the subtle and the gross body.{{sfn|Bahder|Bahder|2013}} It is ''nirvikalpa [[Rūpa|rupam]]'', "undifferentiated form".{{sfn|Bahder|Bahder|2013}} It originates with ''[[Advaita vedanta#Avidyā|avidya]]'', "ignorance" or "nescience" of the real identity of the atman, instead giving birth to the notion of ''[[jiva]]-bhuta''.

[[Swami Sivananda]] characterizes the causal body as "The beginningless ignorance that is indescribable".&lt;ref group=web name="BV" /&gt; [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]], the guru of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], also describes the causal body as characterized by "emptiness", "ignorance" and "darkness".{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}} In the search for the "I am", this is a state where there is nothing to hold on to anymore.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|name="kenosis"|Compare [[kenosis]] and Juan de la Cross' ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]''.}}

[[Ramanuja]] concludes that it is at this stage that consummation of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] with the [[Paramatman]] is reached and the search of the highest [[Purusa]] i.e. of [[Ishvara]] ends.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=155–168}} 

According to other philosophical schools the causal body is not the ''atman'', because it also has a beginning and an end and is subject to modification.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Tattva Bodha of Adi Shankara Part 2|author=Dr. S. Yegnasubramanian|url=http://svbf.org/journal/vol3no4/bodha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], not seeking a personal god, goes beyond ''Anandamaya Kosha'' in search of the transcendent [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=155–168}}

The Indian tradition identifies it with the ''[[Anandamaya kosha]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="BV"&gt;[http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=774 Divine life Society, ''Bases of Vedanta'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the deep sleep state, as mentioned in the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], where ''buddhi'' becomes dormant and all concepts of time fail, although there differences between these three descriptions.

==Theosophy==
In [[Blavatsky]]'s synthesis of [[eastern philosophy]] with western [[esotericism]], the union of the higher [[Manas (Theosophy)|Manas]] with the [[Buddhi (Theosophy)|Buddhi]] (i.e. the essential nature of the fifth, along with the sixth, of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]]) is referred to as the Causal Body (Blavatsky, ''Key to Theosophy'', pp.&amp;nbsp;121, 174). This higher principle is contrasted with the lower, the ''[[Kama-Manas]]'', which is the seat of lower passions.
In the Theosophy of [[Annie Besant]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]], the "Causal Body" refers not to the "Buddhi-Manas" but to Blavatsky's "Higher Manas" alone. This is also referred to as the "Higher Mental", "Abstract Mind" (as opposed to Lower Mental or "Concrete Mind"), or "Causal Body". It is considered the highest [[subtle body]], beyond even the [[mental body]]. As with all the vehicles of consciousness, the Causal Body is associated with an objective or cosmic plane, in this case the [[Causal plane]]. A detailed definition of the Causal Body, is provided by A. E. Powell, who has brought together information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

==Samael Aun Weor==
In the tradition of [[Samael Aun Weor]] it is taught that most people have only incarnated a fraction of the causal body or human soul. This fraction is known as the Essence or the [[Buddha-nature|Buddhata]], which in humanity is bottled up in the psychological aggregates that constitute the ego. Samael Aun Weor states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the various aggregates that are within ourselves represent different volitional impulses. There are, therefore, several wills within our psyche which fight against each other. The intellectual animal doesn’t have any autonomous, independent and unitotal will. There is no unity in the intellectual animal’s willpower. But when a man has created his Body of Conscious Will [causal body], he has individual willpower he can work with in the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The way to create the causal body is by working in the "Forge of Cyclops", that is, [[Sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|sexual alchemy]] between husband and wife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">A '''Clearing murder''' was a revenge killing of a known and popular [[Denmark|Dane]] in the last part of the German [[occupation of Denmark]] during World War II. When a [[Nazi Germany|German]] or Danish soldier or [[informant]] was killed by the [[Danish resistance movement]], the [[Peter group]] performed one or more clearing murder.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], at some time in the latter half of 1944,  ordered that 10 civilians be killed each time a German soldier was killed by civilians. In Denmark, this was modified so that only one civilian was shot for one German soldier.

The first clearing murder was of famous author and priest [[Kaj Munk]] January 4, 1944. Subsequently, several doctors were murdered, including a senior consultant in [[Vejle]] and four doctors in [[Odense]]. In all, it is estimated that around one hundred people were killed in clearing murders.

Usually the clearing murders were done as street shooting in order to increase the [[terrorism|terror]] impact of [[fear]] and uncertainty in the general population. The aim was to turn the population against the Danish resistance movement. Doctors were especially vulnerable to clearing murders since they were out to look after the sick at any time of day.

The Germans demanded the Danish newspapers to print articles linking resistance killings and clearing murders next to each other on the same page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">In [[mathematics]], especially [[differential geometry]], the '''cotangent bundle''' of a [[smooth manifold]] is the [[vector bundle]] of all the [[cotangent space]]s at every point in the manifold. It may be described also as the [[dual bundle]] to the [[tangent bundle]].

== The cotangent sheaf ==
{{main|Cotangent sheaf}}

[[Smooth function|Smooth]] [[Fiber bundle|sections]] of the cotangent bundle are differential [[one-form]]s.

=== Definition of the cotangent sheaf ===
Let ''M'' be a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]] and let ''M''&amp;times;''M'' be the [[Cartesian product]] of ''M'' with itself.  The [[diagonal mapping]] &amp;Delta; sends a point ''p'' in ''M'' to the point (''p'',''p'') of ''M''&amp;times;''M''.  The image of &amp;Delta; is called the diagonal.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[germ (mathematics)|germs]] of smooth functions on ''M''&amp;times;''M'' which vanish on the diagonal.  Then the quotient sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2&lt;/math&gt; consists of equivalence classes of functions which vanish on the diagonal modulo higher order terms.  The cotangent sheaf is the [[inverse image functor|pullback]] of this sheaf to ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma T^*M=\Delta^*\left(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Taylor's theorem]], this is a [[locally free sheaf]] of modules with respect to the sheaf of germs of smooth functions of ''M''.  Thus it defines a [[vector bundle]] on ''M'':  the '''cotangent bundle'''.

See also: [[bundle of principal parts]] (which generalizes the above constructions to higher orders.)

=== Contravariance in manifolds ===

A smooth morphism &lt;math&gt; \phi\colon M\to N&lt;/math&gt; of manifolds, induces a [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\phi^*T^*N&lt;/math&gt; on ''M''. There is an [[Pullback (differential geometry)#Pullback of cotangent vectors and 1-forms|induced map]] of vector bundles &lt;math&gt;\phi^*(T^*N)\to T^*M&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
Given a smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; embedded into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the vanishing locus of a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, we can define the cotangent bundle of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x,dx) \in T^*\mathbb{R}^n:f(x) = 0; df(x) = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
For example, consider the 3-sphere given by the vanishing locus of &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we can compute a presentation of its cotangent bundle as the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z,w,dx,dy,dz,dw) \in T^*(\mathbb{R}^4): x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1, 2xdx + 2ydy + 2zdz + 2wdw = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

== The cotangent bundle as phase space ==

Since the cotangent bundle ''X''=''T''*''M'' is a [[vector bundle]], it can be regarded as a manifold in its own right.  Because of the manner in which the definition of ''T''*''M'' relates to the [[differential topology]] of the base space ''M'', ''X'' possesses a canonical one-form &amp;theta; (also [[tautological one-form]] or [[symplectic potential]]).  The [[exterior derivative]] of &amp;theta; is a [[symplectic form|symplectic 2-form]], out of which a non-degenerate [[volume form]] can be built for ''X''.  For example, as a result ''X'' is always an [[orientable]] manifold (meaning that the tangent bundle of ''X'' is an orientable vector bundle). A special set of [[coordinates]] can be defined on the cotangent bundle; these are called the [[canonical coordinates]]. Because cotangent bundles can be thought of as [[symplectic manifold]]s, any real function on the cotangent bundle can be interpreted to be a [[symplectic vector space|Hamiltonian]]; thus the cotangent bundle can be understood to be a [[phase space]] on which [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] plays out.

=== The tautological one-form ===
{{main|Tautological one-form}}

The cotangent bundle carries a tautological one-form &amp;theta; also known as the ''Poincaré'' ''1''-form or ''Liouville'' ''1''-form. (The form is also known as the ''canonical one-form'', although this can sometimes lead to confusion.) This means that if we regard ''T''*''M'' as a manifold in its own right, there is a canonical [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the vector bundle ''T''*(''T''*''M'') over ''T''*''M''.

This section can be constructed in several ways.  The most elementary method is to use local coordinates.  Suppose that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; are local coordinates on the base manifold ''M''.  In terms of these base coordinates, there are fibre coordinates ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:  a one-form at a particular point of ''T''*''M'' has the form ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Einstein summation convention]] implied).  So the manifold ''T''*''M'' itself carries local coordinates (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) where the ''x'' are coordinates on the base and the ''p'' are coordinates in the fibre.  The canonical one-form is given in these coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(x,p)}=\sum_{{\mathfrak i}=1}^n p_i \, dx^i.&lt;/math&gt;

Intrinsically, the value of the canonical one-form in each fixed point of ''T*M'' is given as a [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]].  Specifically, suppose that {{nowrap|&amp;pi; : ''T*M'' &amp;rarr; ''M''}} is the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] of the bundle. Taking a point in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;*''M'' is the same as choosing of a point ''x'' in ''M'' and a one-form &amp;omega; at ''x'', and the tautological one-form &amp;theta; assigns to the point (''x'', &amp;omega;) the value

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(x,\omega)}=\pi^*\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for a vector ''v'' in the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle, the application of the tautological one-form &amp;theta; to ''v'' at (''x'', &amp;omega;) is computed by projecting ''v'' into the tangent bundle at ''x'' using {{nowrap|''d''&amp;pi; : ''TT''*''M'' &amp;rarr; ''TM''}} and applying &amp;omega; to this projection.  Note that the tautological one-form is not a pullback of a one-form on the base ''M''.

=== Symplectic form ===

The cotangent bundle has a canonical [[symplectic form|symplectic 2-form]] on it, as an [[exterior derivative]] of the [[tautological one-form|tautological one-form]], the [[symplectic potential]]. Proving that this form is, indeed, symplectic can be done by noting that being symplectic is a local property: since the cotangent bundle is locally trivial, this definition need only be checked on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. But there the one form defined is the sum of &lt;math&gt;y_i\,dx_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the differential is the canonical symplectic form, the sum of &lt;math&gt;dy_i \land dx_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Phase space ===

If the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of possible positions in a [[dynamical system]], then the cotangent bundle &lt;math&gt;\!\,T^{*}\!M&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as the set of possible ''positions'' and ''momenta''. For example, this is a way to describe the [[phase space]] of a pendulum. The state of the pendulum is determined by its position (an angle) and its momentum (or equivalently, its velocity, since its mass is not changing). The entire state space ''looks like'' a cylinder. The cylinder is the cotangent bundle of the circle. The above symplectic construction, along with an appropriate [[energy]] function, gives a complete determination of the physics of system. See [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] for more information, and the article on [[geodesic flow]] for an explicit construction of the Hamiltonian equations of motion.

'''Defeatism''' is the acceptance of defeat without struggle, often with negative connotations. It can be linked to [[pessimism]] in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defeatism. Retrieved 2014-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The term ''defeatism'' commonly is used in politics as a descriptor for an ideological stance that considers co-operation with the opposition party. In the military context, in wartime, and especially at the front, ''defeatism'' is synonymous with [[treason]].

Under military law, a soldier can be accused of being defeatist if he refuses to fight by voicing doubt of the ideological validity of national policy; thus, existential questions such as “Is the war already lost?” and “Is the fight worth the effort?” are defeatism that connote advocacy of an alternative end-to-the war other than military victory.

During [[World War II]], [[Adolf Hitler]] unexpectedly dismissed many generals for defeatism. During the last year of war, the German [[Volksgerichtshof|people's court]] executed many people accused of defeatist talks or acts and their names were announced weekly in a pink colored poster pasted on billboards around the country.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Koch: ''In the Name of the Volk: Political Justice in Hitler's Germany''. I.B. Tauris, 1997. {{ISBN|1860641741}} pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary defeatism ==
[[Revolutionary defeatism]] is a related idea, made most prominent by [[Vladimir Lenin]], that establishes that the [[proletariat]] cannot win or gain in a capitalist war. Instead, according to Lenin, the true enemy of the proletariat is the imperialist leaders who send their lower classes into battle. Workers would gain more from their own nations’ defeats, he argued, if the war could be turned into civil war and then international revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard (1977) ''Lenin For Beginners'', p. 118.

The '''dematerialization''' of a product literally means less, or better yet, no material is used to deliver the same level of functionality to the user. Sharing, borrowing and the organization of group services that facilitate and cater for communities needs could alleviate the requirement of [[ownership]] of many products.

In his book ‘'In the Bubble: designing in a complex world'’, John Thakara states that "the average consumer power tool is used for ten minutes in its entire life - but it takes hundreds of times its own weight to [[manufacture]] such an object”. A [[product service system]] with shared tools could simply offer access to them when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World

|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-262-20157-7 |page=18-19
| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift from a reliance on [[Product (business)|products]] to [[Service (economics)|services]] is the process of dematerialization. Digital music distribution systems, car clubs, bike hire schemes and laundry services are all examples of dematerialization.

'''Dia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/Faq|title=Dia Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is [[free and open source software|free and open source]] general-purpose diagramming software, developed originally by Alexander Larsson. Dia uses a controlled [[single document interface]] (SDI) similar to [[GIMP]] and [[Inkscape]].

== Features ==
Dia has a modular design with several shape packages available for different needs: [[flowchart]], [[Computer network diagram|network diagram]]s, [[circuit diagram]]s, and more. It does not restrict symbols and connectors from various categories from being placed together.

Dia has special objects to help draw [[entity-relationship model]]s (obsoleted [http://tedia2sql.tigris.org/ tedia2sql] or newer [https://metacpan.org/module/Parse::Dia::SQL parsediasql] can be used to create the SQL DDL), [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) diagrams, [[flowchart]]s, network diagrams, and simple electrical circuits. It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] files, using a subset of [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) to draw the shape.

Dia loads and saves diagrams in a custom XML format which is, by default, [[gzip]]ped to save space. It can print large diagrams spanning multiple pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.openhub.net/p/dia/links |title=Dia |work=ohloh |publisher=Geeknet, Inc. |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be scripted using the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].

== Exports ==
Dia can export diagrams to various formats including the following:
* [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] (Encapsulated PostScript)
* [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics)
* [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]] (Autocad's Drawing Interchange format)
* [[Computer Graphics Metafile|CGM]] (Computer Graphics Metafile defined by [[ISO standard]]s)
* [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] (Windows Meta File)
* [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] (Portable Network Graphics)
* [[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
* [[VDX (file format)|VDX]] (Microsoft's XML for [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] Drawing)

== Development ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Dia was originally created by Alexander Larsson but he moved on to work on [[GNOME]] and other projects. James Henstridge then took over as the lead developer, but he also moved on to other projects. He was followed by Cyrille Chepelov and Lars Ræder Clausen in turn.

Dia is maintained by a group of developers: Hans Breuer, Steffen Macke&lt;!-- windows --&gt;, and Sameer Sahasrabuddhe.

Dia is written in C, and has an extension system, which also supports writing extensions in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">'''Dialogical analysis''', or more precisely '''dialogical interaction analysis''', refers to a way of analyzing human communication which is based on the theory of [[dialogism]]. The approach has been developed based on the theoretical work of [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Bakhtin]].

==Overview==
[[Dialogism]] makes several assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.com/books?id=8ir3M0yOjGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Linell, 2009]).&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that human communication entails the interaction of diverse perspectives and is embedded in a socio-historical context, that the meaning of a communication can be different to the various participants, that it is important to examine the consequences of a communication, and that each participant in a communication is, to some degree, orienting to the orientation of the other.

Dialogical analysis is an interpretative methodology which closely analyzes spoken or written utterances or actions for their embedded communicative significance. Questions typically asked during a dialogical analysis include: What does each interactant think about themselves, the other and what the other thinks of them? What do the given utterances and actions imply about the given activity or participants? Why was a given communicative act performed &amp;ndash; why did it need to be said? What was the alternative that the utterance was trying to dispel? People are often borrowing words, phrases and ideas from other people, and accordingly, dialogical analysis often asks: who is doing the talking? Specifically, which voices and echoes are evident in the given utterance?

Although dialogical analysis tends to focus on discourse, it is distinct from [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]] because its focus goes beyond the question of how people speak and what they achieve by speaking. Dialogical analysis uses dialogue as a metaphor for understanding phenomena beyond communication itself, such as the self (see [[dialogical self]]), internal dialogues, self-talk, misunderstandings, trust and distrust,&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ut1yKKJGxVIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Markova &amp; Gillespie, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; the production of knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WYNFT16NpMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover Jovchelovitch, 2008])&lt;/ref&gt; and relations between groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;([https://gcal.academia.edu/documents/0010/3091/Cornish___Ghosh_2007_Necessary_contradictions_of_community_led_health_promotion.pdf Cornish, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there have been attempts to formalize the move from dialogism, which is often quite theoretical, to a systematic methodology for data analysis. These approaches focus upon 'sensitizing questions' that facilitate a dialogical analysis&lt;ref&gt;([https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex_Gillespie2/publication/261882642_Sensitizing_Questions_A_Method_to_Facilitate_Analyzing_the_Meaning_of_an_Utterance/links/55a4c32a08ae81aec913096a.pdf?origin=publication_list. "Gillespie &amp; Cornish, 2014"])&lt;/ref&gt; and step-by-step procedures for analyzing multivoicedness.&lt;ref&gt;([http://qrj.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/10/1468794114557991.full.pdf+html "Aveling, Gillespie &amp; Cornish 2015"])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|educational assessment, including the work of [[institutional researchers]]|other uses of the term assessment|Assessment (disambiguation)}}

'''Educational assessment''' is the systematic process of [[documenting]] and using empirical data on the [[knowledge]], [[skill]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, and [[belief]]s to refine programs and improve student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=M.J.|title=Assessing Academic Programs in Higher Education|date=2004|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment data can be obtained from directly examining student work to assess the achievement of learning outcomes or can be based on data from which one can make inferences about learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuh|first1=G.D.|author2=Jankowski, N.|author3=Ikenberry, S.O.|title=Knowing What Students Know and Can Do: The Current State of Learning Outcomes Assessment in U.S. Colleges and Universities|date=2014|publisher=University of Illinois and Indiana University, National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment |location=Urbana |url=http://www.learningoutcomeassessment.org/documents/2013%20Abridged%20Survey%20Report%20Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment is often used interchangeably with test, but not limited to tests.&lt;ref&gt;National council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment can focus on the individual learner, the learning community (class, workshop, or other organized group of learners), a course, an academic program, the institution, or the educational system as a whole (also known as [[granularity]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The word 'assessment' came into use in an educational context after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Robert|last2=Dawson|first2=Phillip|title=A contribution to the history of assessment: how a conversation simulator redeems Socratic method|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|date=2014|volume=39|issue=2|pages=195–204|doi=10.1080/02602938.2013.798394|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2013.798394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a continuous process, assessment establishes measurable and clear student learning outcomes for learning, provisioning a sufficient amount of learning opportunities to achieve these outcomes, implementing a systematic way of gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well student learning matches expectations, and using the collected information to inform improvement in student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suskie|first1=Linda|title=Assessing Student Learning|date=2004|publisher=Anker|location=Bolton, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final purpose of assessment practices in education depends on the ''theoretical framework'' of the practitioners and researchers, their assumptions and beliefs about the nature of human mind, the origin of knowledge, and the process of learning.

==Types==
The term ''assessment'' is generally used to refer to all activities teachers use to help students learn and to gauge student progress.&lt;ref name="Black Box"&gt;Black, Paul, &amp; William, Dylan (October 1998). "Inside the Black Box: Raising Standards Through Classroom Assessment."Phi Beta Kappan. Available at http://www.pdkmembers.org/members_online/members/orders.asp?action=results&amp;t=A&amp;desc=Inside+the+Black+Box%3A+Raising+Standards+Through+Classroom+Assessment&amp;text=&amp;lname_1=&amp;fname_1=&amp;lname_2=&amp;fname_2=&amp;kw_1=&amp;kw_2=&amp;kw_3=&amp;kw_4=&amp;mn1=&amp;yr1=&amp;mn2=&amp;yr2=&amp;c1= PDKintl.org]. Retrieved January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment can be divided for the sake of convenience using the following categorizations:
# Initial, formative, summative and diagnostic assessment
# Objective and subjective
# Referencing (criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, and [[ipsative]])
# Informal and formal
# Internal and external

===Placement, formative, summative and diagnostic===
Assessment is often divided into initial, formative, and summative categories for the purpose of considering different objectives for assessment practices.
* Placement assessment – Placement evaluation is used to place students according to prior achievement or personal characteristics, at the most appropriate point in an instructional sequence, in a unique instructional strategy, or with a suitable teacher&lt;ref&gt;http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED041829&lt;/ref&gt; conducted through [[placement testing]], i.e. the tests that colleges and universities use to assess college readiness and place students into their initial classes. Placement evaluation, also referred to as pre-assessment or initial assessment, is conducted prior to instruction or intervention to establish a baseline from which individual student growth can be measured. This type of an assessment is used to know what the student's skill level is about the subject. It helps the teacher to explain the material more efficiently. These assessments are not graded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mctighe |first1=Jay |last2=O'Connor |first2=Ken |title=Seven practices for effective learning|journal=Educational Leadership|date=November 2005 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=10–17 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/nov05/vol63/num03/Seven-Practices-for-Effective-Learning.aspx |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Formative assessment]] – Formative assessment is generally carried out throughout a course or project. Formative assessment, also referred to as "educative assessment," is used to aid learning. In an educational setting, formative assessment might be a teacher (or [[peer group|peer]]) or the learner, providing feedback on a student's work and would not necessarily be used for grading purposes. Formative assessments can take the form of diagnostic, standardized tests, quizzes, oral question, or draft work. Formative assessments are carried out concurrently with instructions. The result may count. The formative assessments aim to see if the students understand the instruction before doing a summative assessment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Summative assessment]] – Summative assessment is generally carried out at the end of a course or project. In an educational setting, summative assessments are typically used to assign students a course grade. Summative assessments are evaluative. Summative assessments are made to summarize what the students have learned, to determine whether they understand the subject matter well. This type of assessment is typically graded (e.g. pass/fail, 0-100) and can take the form of tests, exams or projects. Summative assessments are often used to determine whether a student has passed or failed a class. A criticism of summative assessments is that they are reductive, and learners discover how well they have acquired knowledge too late for it to be of use.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Diagnostic assessment – Diagnostic assessment deals with the whole difficulties at the end that occurs during the learning process.

Jay McTighe and Ken O'Connor proposed seven practices to effective learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of them is about showing the criteria of the evaluation before the test. Another is about the importance of pre-assessment to know what the skill levels of a student are before giving instructions. Giving a lot of feedback and encouraging are other practices.

Educational researcher Robert Stake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/circe/Robert_Stake.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208111942/http://ed.uiuc.edu/circe/Robert_Stake.html |archive-date=2009-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; explains the difference between formative and summative assessment with the following analogy: {{quote|text=When the cook tastes the soup, that's formative. When the guests taste the soup, that's summative.&lt;ref name="Stake in Scriven"&gt;Scriven, M. (1991). Evaluation thesaurus. 4th ed. Newbury Park, CA:[[Sage Publications]]. {{ISBN|0-8039-4364-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Summative and formative assessment are often referred to in a learning context as ''assessment of learning'' and ''assessment for learning'' respectively. Assessment of learning is generally summative in nature and intended to measure learning outcomes and report those outcomes to students, parents and administrators. Assessment of learning generally occurs at the conclusion of a class, course, semester or academic year. Assessment for learning is generally formative in nature and is used by teachers to consider approaches to teaching and next steps for individual learners and the class.&lt;ref name="Earl, Lorna"&gt;Earl, Lorna (2003). Assessment as Learning: Using Classroom Assessment to Maximise Student Learning. Thousand Oaks, CA, Corwin Press. {{ISBN|0-7619-4626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common form of formative assessment is ''diagnostic assessment''. Diagnostic assessment measures a student's current knowledge and skills for the purpose of identifying a suitable program of learning. ''Self-assessment'' is a form of diagnostic assessment which involves students assessing themselves. ''Forward-looking assessment'' asks those being assessed to consider themselves in hypothetical future situations.&lt;ref name="Diagnostic assessment"&gt;Reed, Daniel. "Diagnostic Assessment in Language Teaching and Learning." Center for Language Education and Research, available at [http://clear.msu.edu/clear/newsletter/files/fall2006.pdf Google.com]. Retrieved January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Performance-based assessment'' is similar to summative assessment, as it focuses on achievement. It is often aligned with the [[standards-based education reform]] and [[outcomes-based education]] movement. Though ideally they are significantly different from a traditional multiple choice test, they are most commonly associated with [[standards-based assessment]] which use free-form responses to standard questions scored by human scorers on a standards-based scale, meeting, falling below or exceeding a performance standard rather than being ranked on a curve. A well-defined task is identified and students are asked to create, produce or do something, often in settings that involve real-world application of knowledge and skills. Proficiency is demonstrated by providing an extended response. Performance formats are further differentiated into products and performances. The performance may result in a product, such as a painting, portfolio, paper or exhibition, or it may consist of a performance, such as a speech, athletic skill, musical recital or reading.

===Objective and subjective===
Assessment (either summative or formative) is often categorized as either objective or subjective. Objective assessment is a form of questioning which has a single correct answer. Subjective assessment is a form of questioning which may have more than one correct answer (or more than one way of expressing the correct answer). There are various types of objective and subjective questions. Objective question types include true/false answers, [[multiple choice]], multiple-response and matching questions. Subjective questions include extended-response questions and essays. Objective assessment is well suited to the increasingly popular computerized or [[e-assessment|online assessment]] format.

Some have argued that the distinction between objective and subjective assessments is neither useful nor accurate because, in reality, there is no such thing as "objective" assessment. In fact, all assessments are created with inherent biases built into decisions about relevant subject matter and content, as well as cultural (class, ethnic, and gender) biases.&lt;ref name="Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)"&gt;Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). "What Do We Mean by e-Assessment?" JISC InfoNet. Retrieved January 29, 2009 from http://tools.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/downloads/vle/eassessment-printable.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basis of comparison===
Test results can be compared against an established criterion, or against the performance of other students, or against previous performance:

*''Criterion-referenced assessment'', typically using a [[criterion-referenced test]], as the name implies, occurs when candidates are measured against defined (and objective) criteria. Criterion-referenced assessment is often, but not always, used to establish a person's competence (whether s/he can do something). The best known example of criterion-referenced assessment is the driving test, when learner drivers are measured against a range of explicit criteria (such as "Not endangering other road users").
*''Norm-referenced assessment'' (colloquially known as "[[Bell curve grading|grading on the curve]]"), typically using a [[norm-referenced test]], is not measured against defined criteria. This type of assessment is relative to the student body undertaking the assessment. It is effectively a way of comparing students. The IQ test is the best known example of norm-referenced assessment. Many entrance tests (to prestigious schools or universities) are norm-referenced, permitting a fixed proportion of students to pass ("passing" in this context means being accepted into the school or university rather than an explicit level of ability). This means that standards may vary from year to year, depending on the quality of the cohort; criterion-referenced assessment does not vary from year to year (unless the criteria change).&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;Educational Technologies at Virginia Tech. "Assessment Purposes." VirginiaTech DesignShop: Lessons in Effective Teaching, available at [http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/assess/purposes.html Edtech.vt.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226164716/http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/assess/purposes.html |date=2009-02-26 }}. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ipsative assessment]]'' is self comparison either in the same domain over time, or comparative to other domains within the same student.

===Informal and formal===
Assessment can be either ''formal'' or ''informal''. Formal assessment usually implies a written document, such as a test, quiz, or paper. A formal assessment is given a numerical score or grade based on student performance, whereas an informal assessment does not contribute to a student's final grade. An informal assessment usually occurs in a more casual manner and may include observation, inventories, checklists, rating scales, [[rubric (academic)|rubrics]], performance and portfolio assessments, participation, peer and self-evaluation, and discussion.&lt;ref name="Valencia, Sheila W"&gt;Valencia, Sheila W. "What Are the Different Forms of Authentic Assessment?" Understanding Authentic Classroom-Based Literacy Assessment (1997), available at [http://www.eduplace.com/rdg/res/litass/forms.html Eduplace.com]. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal and external===
Internal assessment is set and marked by the school (i.e. teachers). Students get the mark and feedback regarding the assessment. External assessment is set by the governing body, and is marked by non-biased personnel. Some external assessments give much more limited feedback in their marking. However, in tests such as Australia's NAPLAN, the criterion addressed by students is given detailed feedback in order for their teachers to address and compare the student's learning achievements and also to plan for the future.

==Standards of quality==
In general, high-quality assessments are considered those with a high level of [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. Approaches to reliability and validity vary, however.

===Reliability===
[[Reliability (statistics)|Reliability]] relates to the consistency of an assessment. A reliable assessment is one that consistently achieves the same results with the same (or similar) cohort of students. Various factors affect reliability—including ambiguous questions, too many options within a question paper, vague marking instructions and poorly trained markers. Traditionally, the reliability of an assessment is based on the following:
# Temporal stability: Performance on a test is comparable on two or more separate occasions.
# Form equivalence: Performance among examinees is equivalent on different forms of a test based on the same content.
# Internal consistency: Responses on a test are consistent across questions. For example: In a survey that asks respondents to rate attitudes toward technology, consistency would be expected in responses to the following questions:
#* "I feel very negative about computers in general."
#* "I enjoy using computers."&lt;ref name="Yu, Chong Ho"&gt;Yu, Chong Ho (2005). "Reliability and Validity." Educational Assessment. Available at [http://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/assessment/reliability.html Creative-wisdom.com]. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of a measurement x can also be defined quantitatively as:
'''&lt;math&gt;R_\text{x} = V_\text{t}/V_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt;''' where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the reliability in the observed (test) score, x; 
&lt;math&gt;V_\text{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; are the variability in ‘true’ (i.e., candidate’s innate performance) and measured test scores respectively. &lt;math&gt;R_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; can range from 0 (completely unreliable), to 1 (completely reliable).
===Validity===
{{Main|Test validity}}

[[validity (statistics)|Valid]] assessment is one that measures what it is intended to measure. For example, it would not be valid to assess driving skills through a written test alone. A more valid way of assessing driving skills would be through a combination of tests that help determine what a driver knows, such as through a written test of driving knowledge, and what a driver is able to do, such as through a performance assessment of actual driving. Teachers frequently complain that some examinations do not properly assess the [[syllabus]] upon which the examination is based; they are, effectively, questioning the validity of the exam.
 
Validity of an assessment is generally gauged through examination of evidence in the following categories:
# Content – Does the content of the test measure stated objectives?
# Criterion – Do scores correlate to an outside reference? (ex: Do high scores on a 4th grade reading test accurately predict reading skill in future grades?)
# Construct – Does the assessment correspond to other significant variables? (ex: Do [[English as a second language|ESL]] students consistently perform differently on a writing exam than native English speakers?)&lt;ref name="Moskal, Barbara M., &amp; Leydens, Jon A"&gt;Moskal, Barbara M., &amp; Leydens, Jon A (2000). "Scoring Rubric Development: Validity and Reliability." Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation, 7(10). Retrieved January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good assessment has both validity and reliability, plus the other quality attributes noted above for a specific context and purpose. In practice, an assessment is rarely totally valid or totally reliable. A ruler which is marked wrongly will always give the same (wrong) measurements. It is very reliable, but not very valid. Asking random individuals to tell the time without looking at a clock or watch is sometimes used as an example of an assessment which is valid, but not reliable. The answers will vary between individuals, but the average answer is probably close to the actual time. In many fields, such as medical research, educational testing, and psychology, there will often be a trade-off between reliability and validity. A history test written for high validity will have many essay and fill-in-the-blank questions. It will be a good measure of mastery of the subject, but difficult to score completely accurately. A history test written for high reliability will be entirely multiple choice. It isn't as good at measuring knowledge of history, but can easily be scored with great precision. We may generalize from this. The more reliable our estimate is of what we purport to measure, the less certain we are that we are actually measuring that aspect of attainment.

It is well to distinguish between "subject-matter" validity and "predictive" validity. The former, used widely in education, predicts the score a student would get on a similar test but with different questions. The latter, used widely in the workplace, predicts performance. Thus, a subject-matter-valid test of knowledge of driving rules is appropriate while a predictively valid test would assess whether the potential driver could follow those rules.

===Evaluation standards===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] has published three sets of standards for evaluations. "The Personnel Evaluation Standards"&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1988). "The Personnel Evaluation Standards: How to Assess Systems for Evaluating Educators". Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition)&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1994).''The Program Evaluation Standards'', 2nd Edition. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (2003). ''The Student Evaluation Standards: How to Improve Evaluations of Students''. Newbury Park, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

==Summary table of the main theoretical frameworks==
The following table summarizes the main ''theoretical frameworks'' behind almost all the theoretical and research work, and the instructional practices in education (one of them being, of course, the practice of assessment). These different frameworks have given rise to interesting debates among scholars.

==Controversy==
Concerns over how best to apply assessment practices across public school systems have largely focused on questions about the use of high-stakes testing and standardized tests, often used to gauge student progress, teacher quality, and school-, district-, or statewide educational success.

===No Child Left Behind===
For most researchers and practitioners, the question is not whether tests should be administered at all—there is a general consensus that, when administered in useful ways, tests can offer useful information about student progress and curriculum implementation, as well as offering formative uses for learners.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;American Psychological Association. "Appropriate Use of High-Stakes Testing in Our Nation's Schools." APA Online, available at &lt;!--&lt;s&gt;www.apa.org/pubinfo/testing.html. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/s&gt; Unnecessary to leave this here.--&gt; [http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/brochures/testing.aspx APA.org], Retrieved January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The real issue, then, is whether testing practices as currently implemented can provide these services for educators and students.

President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) on January 8, 2002.  The NCLB Act reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965.  President Johnson signed the ESEA to help fight the War on Poverty and helped fund elementary and secondary schools.  President Johnson's goal was to emphasizes equal access to education and establishes high standards and accountability.  The NCLB Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade level.

In the U.S., the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] mandates standardized testing nationwide. These tests align with state curriculum and link teacher, student, district, and state accountability to the results of these tests. Proponents of NCLB argue that it offers a tangible method of gauging educational success, holding teachers and schools accountable for failing scores, and closing the [[achievement gap]] across class and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml Reauthorization of NCLB]. Department of Education. Retrieved 1/29/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of standardized testing dispute these claims, arguing that holding educators accountable for test results leads to the practice of "[[teaching to the test]]." Additionally, many argue that the focus on standardized testing encourages teachers to equip students with a narrow set of skills that enhance test performance without actually fostering a deeper understanding of subject matter or key principles within a knowledge domain.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm What's Wrong With Standardized Testing?] FairTest.org.

===High-stakes testing===
{{Main|High-stakes testing}}
The assessments which have caused the most controversy in the U.S. are the use of [[high school graduation examination]]s, which are used to deny diplomas to students who have attended high school for four years, but cannot demonstrate that they have learned the required material when writing exams. Opponents say that no student who has put in four years of [[seat time]] should be denied a high school diploma merely for repeatedly failing a test, or even for not knowing the required material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reform education, not exit exams |work=Daily Bruin |author=Dang, Nick |date=18 March 2003 |quote=One common complaint from failed test-takers is that they weren't taught the tested material in school.

High-stakes tests have been blamed for causing sickness and [[test anxiety]] in students and teachers, and for teachers choosing to narrow the curriculum towards what the teacher believes will be tested. In an exercise designed to make children comfortable about testing, a [[Spokane, Washington]] newspaper published a picture of a [[monster]] that feeds on fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.asd.wednet.edu/Pioneer/barnard/projects/04-05/art/WhatsaWASL/index.html |title=ASD.wednet.edu |access-date=2006-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225033809/http://www2.asd.wednet.edu/Pioneer/barnard/projects/04-05/art/WhatsaWASL/index.html |archive-date=2007-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The published image is purportedly the response of a student who was asked to draw a picture of what she thought of the state assessment.

Other critics, such as Washington State University's [[Don Orlich]], question the use of test items far beyond standard cognitive levels for students' age.&lt;ref name="Bach, Deborah, &amp; Blanchard, Jessica"&gt;Bach, Deborah, &amp; Blanchard, Jessica (April 19, 2005). "WASL worries stress kids, schools." Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Retrieved January 30, 2009 from [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/220713_wasl19.html Seattlepi.nwsource.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to portfolio assessments, simple multiple-choice tests are much less expensive, less prone to disagreement between scorers, and can be scored quickly enough to be returned before the end of the school year. [[Standardized test]]s (all students take the same test under the same conditions) often use multiple-choice tests for these reasons. Orlich criticizes the use of expensive, holistically graded tests, rather than inexpensive multiple-choice "bubble tests", to measure the quality of both the system and individuals for very large numbers of students.&lt;ref name="Bach, Deborah, &amp; Blanchard, Jessica"/&gt; Other prominent critics of high-stakes testing include [[Fairtest]] and [[Alfie Kohn]].

The use of [[IQ tests]] has been banned in some states for educational decisions, and [[norm-referenced tests]], which rank students from "best" to "worst", have been criticized for bias against minorities. Most education officials support [[criterion-referenced tests]] (each individual student's score depends solely on whether he answered the questions correctly, regardless of whether his neighbors did better or worse) for making high-stakes decisions.

===21st century assessment===
It has been widely noted that with the emergence of [[social media]] and [[Web 2.0]] technologies and mindsets, learning is increasingly collaborative and knowledge increasingly distributed across many members of a learning community. Traditional assessment practices, however, focus in large part on the individual and fail to account for knowledge-building and learning in context. As researchers in the field of assessment consider the cultural shifts that arise from the emergence of a more [[participatory culture]], they will need to find new methods of applying assessments to learners.&lt;ref name="Fadel, Charles, Honey, Margaret, &amp; Pasnik, Shelley"&gt;Fadel, Charles, Honey, Margaret, &amp; Pasnik, Shelley (May 18, 2007). "Assessment in the Age of Innovation." Education Week. Retrieved January 29, 2009 from http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2007/05/23/38fadel.h26.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment in a democratic school===
[[Sudbury model]] of democratic education schools do not perform and do not offer assessments, evaluations, transcripts, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's [[right to privacy]] and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational assessment for the 21st century, they adduce.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (2000). [http://sudburyvalleyschool.org/essays/102008.shtml ''21st Century Schools,''] edited transcript of a talk delivered at the April 2000 International Conference on Learning in the 21st Century.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sudbury schools, this policy does not cause harm to their students as they move on to life outside the school. However, they admit it makes the process more difficult, but that such hardship is part of the students learning to make their own way, set their own standards and meet their own goals.

The no-grading and no-rating policy helps to create an atmosphere free of competition among students or battles for adult approval, and encourages a positive cooperative environment amongst the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987). Chapter 20,''Evaluation,'' Free at Last — The Sudbury Valley School.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of a Sudbury education, should the student choose to take it, is the graduation thesis. Each student writes on the topic of how they have prepared themselves for adulthood and entering the community at large. This thesis is submitted to the Assembly, who reviews it. The final stage of the thesis process is an oral defense given by the student in which they open the floor for questions, challenges and comments from all Assembly members. At the end, the Assembly votes by secret ballot on whether or not to award a diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016150834/http://www.mountainlaurelsudbury.org/thesis-procedure.asp ''Graduation Thesis Procedure''], Mountain Laurel Sudbury School.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing ELL students===
A major concern with the use of educational assessments is the overall validity, accuracy, and fairness when it comes to assessing English language learners (ELL). The majority of assessments within the United States have normative standards based on the English-speaking culture, which does not adequately represent ELL populations.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"&gt;http://ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=221ae7c6-6895-4b02-bc69-759936218fba%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=20{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it would in many cases be inaccurate and inappropriate to draw conclusions from ELL students’ normative scores. Research shows that the majority of schools do not appropriately modify assessments in order to accommodate students from unique cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"/&gt; This has resulted in the over-referral of ELL students to special education, causing them to be disproportionately represented in special education programs. Although some may see this inappropriate placement in special education as supportive and helpful, research has shown that inappropriately placed students actually regressed in progress.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"/&gt;

It is often necessary to utilize the services of a translator in order to administer the assessment in an ELL student’s native language; however, there are several issues when translating assessment items. One issue is that translations can frequently suggest a correct or expected response, changing the difficulty of the assessment item.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/cq/pdf/V38N7_CulturallyCompetentAssessment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529041906/http://www.nasponline.org/publications/cq/pdf/V38N7_CulturallyCompetentAssessment.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the translation of assessment items can sometimes distort the original meaning of the item.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt; Finally, many translators are not qualified or properly trained to work with ELL students in an assessment situation.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"/&gt; All of these factors compromise the validity and fairness of assessments, making the results not reliable. Nonverbal assessments have shown to be less discriminatory for ELL students, however, some still present cultural biases within the assessment items.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt;

When considering an ELL student for special education the assessment team should integrate and interpret all of the information collected in order to ensure a non biased conclusion.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt; The decision should be based on multidimensional sources of data including teacher and parent interviews, as well as classroom observations.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt; Decisions should take the students unique cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds into consideration, and should not be strictly based on assessment results.

'''Epiphenomenalism''' is a position on the [[mind–body problem]] which holds that physical and [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] events within the human body ([[Sensory nervous system|sense organs]], [[Neurotransmission|neural impulses]], and muscle contractions, for example) are causal with respect to mental events (thought, consciousness, and cognition). According to this view, subjective mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body and themselves have no causal efficacy on physical events. The appearance that subjective mental states (such as [[intention]]s) influence physical events is merely an illusion. For instance, fear seems to make the heart beat faster, but according to epiphenomenalism the biochemical secretions of the brain and nervous system (such as [[adrenaline]])—not the experience of fear—is what raises the heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walter|first=Sven|title=Epiphenomenalism|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/#H2|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=University of Bielefeld|accessdate=10 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923005826/http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/#H2|archivedate=23 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism is viewed as a form of [[property dualism]].

==Development==
During the seventeenth century, [[Rene Descartes]] argued that animals are subject to mechanical laws of nature. He defended the idea of [[automatic behavior]], or the performance of actions without conscious thought. Descartes questioned how the immaterial mind and the material body can interact causally.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt; His interactionist model (1649) held that the body relates to the mind through the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William|chapter=Epiphenomenalism|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 November 2013|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Shadworth Hodgson|Hodgson]] (1870) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=Shadworth|title=The Theory of Practice|year=1870|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, &amp; Dyer|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1874).&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. (1874). "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. 2006. "Where's the action?: Epiphenomenalism and the problem of free will". In W. Banks, S. Pockett, and S. Gallagher. ''Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? An Investigation of the Nature of Intuition'' (109-124). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Henry Huxley agreed with Descartes that behavior is determined solely by physical mechanisms, but he also believed that humans enjoy an intelligent life. In 1874, Huxley argued that animals are [[Conscious automatism|conscious automata]] in the Presidential Address to the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Huxley proposed that psychical changes are collateral products of physical changes. He termed the stream of consciousness an "epiphenomenon;" like the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time, consciousness has no role in determining behavior.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

Huxley defended [[automatic behavior|automatism]] by testing reflex actions, originally supported by Descartes. Huxley hypothesized that frogs that undergo lobotomy would swim when thrown into water, despite being unable to initiate actions. He argued that the ability to swim was solely dependent on the molecular change in the brain, concluding that consciousness is not necessary for reflex actions. According to epiphenomenalism, animals experience pain only as a result of [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

In 1870, Huxley conducted a case study on a French soldier who had sustained a shot in the [[Franco-Prussian war|Franco-Prussian War]] that fractured his left parietal bone. Every few weeks the soldier would enter a trance-like state, smoking, dressing himself, and aiming his cane like a rifle all while being insensitive to pins, electric shocks, odorous substances, vinegar, noise, and certain light conditions. Huxley used this study to show that consciousness was not necessary to execute these purposeful actions, justifying the assumption that humans are insensible machines. Huxley's mechanistic attitude towards the body convinced him that the brain alone causes behavior.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

In the early 1900s [[behaviorism|scientific behaviorists]] such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] or mental [[fictionalism]], positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. [[George Santayana]] (1905) believed that all motion has merely physical causes.  Because consciousness is accessory to life and not essential to it, natural selection is responsible for ingraining tendencies to avoid certain contingencies without any conscious achievement involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Alwyn|title=Stairway to the Mind|year=1995|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York, New York|isbn=9780387943817|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the [[cognitive revolution]]. Participants in that revolution, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of "epiphobia"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.

However, since the cognitive revolution, there have been several who have argued for a version of epiphenomenalism. In 1970, [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] proposed his "new epiphenomenalism", which states that the body produces a spiritual mind that does not act on the body. How the brain causes a spiritual mind, according to Campbell, is destined to remain beyond our understanding forever (see [[New Mysterianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=David|title=Unsnarling the World-Knot|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781556357558|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[David Chalmers]] and [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] argued that claims about conscious states should be deduced a priori from claims about physical states alone. They offered that epiphenomenalism bridges, but does not close, the explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polger|first=Thomas|title=Natural Minds|year=2004|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262661966|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These more recent versions maintain that only the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental states are epiphenomenal. Imagine both Pierre and a robot eating a cupcake. Unlike the robot, Pierre is conscious of eating the cupcake while the behavior is under way. This subjective experience is often called a ''quale'' (plural [[qualia]]), and it describes the private "raw feel" or the subjective "[[Thomas Nagel|what-it-is-like]]" that is the inner accompaniment of many mental states. Thus, while Pierre and the robot are both doing the same thing, only Pierre has the inner conscious experience.

[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1982), for example, once espoused the following view:

{{quote|I am what is sometimes known as a "qualia freak". I think that there are certain features of bodily sensations especially, but also of certain perceptual experiences, which no amount of purely physical information includes. Tell me everything physical there is to tell about what is going on in a living brain... you won't have told me about the hurtfulness of pains, the itchiness of itches, pangs of jealousy....&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1982, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to epiphenomenalism, mental states like Pierre's pleasurable experience—or, at any rate, their distinctive qualia—are [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]]; they are side-effects or by-products of physical processes in the body. If Pierre takes a second bite, it is not caused by his pleasure from the first; If Pierre says, "That was good, so I will take another bite", his speech act is not caused by the preceding pleasure. The conscious experiences that accompany brain processes are causally impotent. The mind might simply be a byproduct of other properties such as brain size or pathway activation synchronicity, which are adaptive.

Some thinkers draw distinctions between different varieties of epiphenomenalism. In ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between a purely metaphysical sense of epiphenomenalism, in which the epiphenomenon has no causal impact at all, and Huxley's "steam whistle" epiphenomenalism, in which effects exist but are not functionally relevant.

==Arguments for==
A large body of neurophysiological data seems to support epiphenomenalism.  Some of the oldest such data is the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] or "readiness potential" in which electrical activity related to voluntary actions can be recorded up to two seconds before the subject is aware of making a decision to perform the action. More recently [[Benjamin Libet]] et al. (1979) have shown that it can take 0.5 seconds before a stimulus becomes part of conscious experience even though subjects can respond to the stimulus in reaction time tests within 200 milliseconds. The conclusions of this experiment have begun to receive some backlash and criticism, mainly by neuroscientists such as Peter Tse, who claim to show that the readiness potential has nothing to do with consciousness at all.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dartmouth.edu/~peter/pdf/63.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on the Event Related Potential also shows that conscious experience does not occur until the late phase of the potential (P3 or later) that occurs 300 milliseconds or more after the event. In Bregman's [[Illusory continuity of tones|auditory continuity illusion]], where a pure tone is followed by broadband noise and the noise is followed by the same pure tone it seems as if the tone occurs throughout the period of noise. This also suggests a delay for processing data before conscious experience occurs. Popular science author [[Tor Nørretranders]] has called the delay the "[[user illusion]]", implying that we only have the illusion of conscious control, most actions being controlled automatically by non-conscious parts of the brain with the conscious mind relegated to the role of spectator.

The scientific data seem to support the idea that conscious experience is created by non-conscious processes in the brain (i.e., there is subliminal processing that becomes conscious experience). These results have been interpreted to suggest that people are capable of action before conscious experience of the decision to act occurs. Some argue that this supports epiphenomenalism, since it shows that the feeling of making a decision to act is actually an epiphenomenon; the action happens before the decision, so the decision did not cause the action to occur.

==Arguments against==
The most powerful argument against epiphenomenalism is that it is self-contradictory: if we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then our brains know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then our brains should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=William | last=Robinson | editor=Edward N. Zalta | year=2015 | title=Epiphenomenalism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition = Fall 2015 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/#SelStu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some philosophers do not accept this as a rigorous refutation. For example, Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that the personal mind is not the only source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a zombie) could have knowledge about mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 |pages=51–70 |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020014221/http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2 |archivedate=2016-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information about mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia) could have been, in principle, implicitly "written" in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created immaterial mind and a detailed "program" of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind–body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but it cannot be excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, epiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness can be found in the human brain, and it is proven that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.

Some philosophers, such as Dennett, reject both epiphenomenalism and the existence of qualia with the same charge that [[Gilbert Ryle]] leveled against a Cartesian "[[ghost in the machine]]", that they too are [[category mistake]]s. A quale or conscious experience would not belong to the category of objects of reference on this account, but rather to the category of ways of doing things.

[[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalists]] assert that mental states are well described by their overall role, their activity in relation to the organism as a whole. "This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a 'calculating machine', but it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="sep-functionalism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Janet |last=Levin |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2010 |title=Functionalism |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/functionalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so far as it mediates stimulus and response, a mental [[Function (computer science)|function]] is analogous to a program that processes [[input/output]] in [[automata theory]]. In principle, [[multiple realisability]] would guarantee [[Universal Turing machine|platform dependencies]] can be avoided, whether in terms of hardware and operating system or, ''ex hypothesi'', biology and philosophy. Because a [[high-level language]] is a practical requirement for developing the most complex programs, functionalism implies that a [[non-reductive physicalism]] would offer a similar advantage over a strictly eliminative materialism.

[[Eliminative materialism|Eliminative materialists]] believe "[[folk psychology]]" is so unscientific that, ultimately, it will be better to eliminate primitive concepts such as ''mind,'' ''desire'' and ''belief,'' in favor of a future neuro-scientific account. A more moderate position such as [[J. L. Mackie]]'s ''error theory'' suggests that false beliefs should be stripped away from a mental concept without eliminating the concept itself, the legitimate core meaning being left intact.

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel. (2003) ''Freedom evolves''.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticism of Libet-style research has been made by neuroscientist Adina Roskies and cognitive theorists Tim Bayne and Alfred Mele.

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience and a conscious decision occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian G. Guggisberg and Annaïs Mottaz have also challenged those findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3746176 | pmid=23966921 | doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00385 | volume=7 | title=Timing and awareness of movement decisions: does consciousness really come too late? | year=2013 | journal=Front Hum Neurosci | pages=385 | last1 = Guggisberg | first1 = AG | last2 = Mottaz | first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/42/E2904/1|title=An accumulator model for spontaneous neural activity prior to self-initiated movement|first1=Aaron|last1=Schurger|first2=Jacobo D.|last2=Sitt|first3=Stanislas|last3=Dehaene|date=16 October 2012|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=42|pages=16776–16777|accessdate=9 May 2018|via=www.pnas.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030042023/http://www.pnas.org/content/109/42/E2904/1|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself (and the "pre-movement buildup" of neural activity in general), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet's&lt;ref name="LGW"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |title=Time of Conscious Intention to Act in Relation to Onset of Cerebral Activity (Readiness-Potential) |year=1983 |last1=Libet |first1=Benjamin |last2=Gleason |first2=Curtis A. |last3=Wright |first3=Elwood W. |last4=Pearl |first4=Dennis K. |journal=Brain |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=623–42 |pmid=6640273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fried's.&lt;ref name=Fried&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.045 |title=Internally Generated Preactivation of Single Neurons in Human Medial Frontal Cortex Predicts Volition |year=2011 |last1=Fried |first1=Itzhak |last2=Mukamel |first2=Roy |last3=Kreiman |first3=Gabriel |journal=Neuron |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=548–62 |pmid=21315264 |pmc=3052770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In favor of interactionism, [[Celia Green]] (2003) argues that epiphenomenalism does not even provide a satisfactory 'out' from the problem of interaction posed by substance dualism. Although it does not entail substance dualism, according to Green, epiphenomenalism implies a one-way form of interactionism that is just as hard to conceive of as the two-way form embodied in substance dualism. Green suggests the assumption that it is less of a problem may arise from the unexamined belief that physical events have some sort of primacy over mental ones.

[[Donald Symons]] dismisses epiphenomenalism from an evolutionary perspective. He says that the view that mind is an epiphenomenon of brain activity is not consistent with evolutionary theory, because if mind were functionless, it would have disappeared long ago, as it would not have been favoured by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Symons, Donald. The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford University Press. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3794">''Female:Pressure'' is an international network of female, [[transgender]] and [[non-binary]] artists in the fields of electronic music and digital arts founded by [[Susanne Kirchmayr|Electric Indigo]] in 1998 : from musicians, composers and DJs to visual artists, cultural workers and researchers. A worldwide resource of talent that can be searched after criteria like location, profession, style or name. "Why are there so few women active in the electronic music scene?" - each one of us has heard this question a thousand times... Here is the answer: It's not our number, it's about how and if we are recognized!

It was founded as a information resource and network for improving communication and representation of its members. It is notable for raising the profile of women and their work, including through festivals and media campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewire.co.uk/news/26275/female_pressure-inaugurating-perspectives-festival-for-female-musicians|title=Female: Pressure inaugurating Perspectives festival for female musicians&amp;nbsp;— The Wire|work=The Wire Magazine&amp;nbsp;— Adventures In Modern Music|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pop-kultur.berlin/en/modules/female-pressure-panel-sky-deep-marlene-engel-christine-kakaire/|title=Female Pressure Panel at Pop-Kultur Festival 2017 in Berlin|work=Pop Kultur|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/femalepressure-promoter-weighs-female-lineups/|title=A female:pressure Promoter Weighs In On All-Female Lineups|last=|first=|date=|website=Electronic Beats|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://loop.ableton.com/2015/participants/femalepressure/|title=female:pressure|website=loop.ableton.com|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/superstar-djs/a-41298236|title=Superstar DJs from Germany: A Global Success Story {{!}} Documentary &amp; Report: Watch DW-videos online for free {{!}} DW {{!}} 16.11.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/study-confirms-theres-still-a-gender-gap-in-festival-bookings/|title=Study Confirms: There’s Still A Gender Gap In Festival Bookings&amp;nbsp;– Telekom Electronic Beats|last=Telekom|work=Telekom Electronic Beats|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/someone-made-a-database-of-female-and-non-binary-artists/|title=Someone Made A Database Of Female And Non-Binary Artists&amp;nbsp;– Telekom Electronic Beats|last=Telekom|work=Telekom Electronic Beats|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://djmag.com/news/we-lost-ourselves-heady-techno-emika-and-dj-red-berlin|title=We lost ourselves to heady techno with Emika and DJ Red in Berlin|date=2017-01-31|work=DJMag.com|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/new-tumblr-documents-women-and-their-music-gear-5436612|title=New Tumblr Documents Women and Their Music Gear|last=Ohanesian|first=Liz|date=2015-03-18|work=L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">The '''Folkewall'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml Folkewall]&lt;/ref&gt; is a construction with the dual functions of growing plants and purifying waste water.  It was designed by Folke Günther&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/cv/Eng/Biography/short.shtml Folke Günther]&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden. 

Inspired by the "Sanitas wall" at Dr Gösta Nilsson's Sanitas farm project in [[Botswana]], this technique makes an efficient use of space by fulfilling two essential functions: vertical plant growing and [[Water purification|purification]] of [[greywater]]. This system is also known as a living wall or [[green wall]].

==Design==
The basic design is a wall of hollow concrete slabs, with compartments opening on one or both sides of the wall. The hollows are filled with inert material like [[gravel]], [[expanded clay aggregate]], [[perlite]], or [[vermiculite]]. It is designed to let the water [[Trickling filter|trickle]] over the longest possible treatment path along the length of the wall among the pebbles. 

The water is brought in at the top, and percolates following a zig-zag pattern inside the wall. As it does so the plant roots grow among the inert material and extract nutrients from the water. A film of [[Bioremediation|beneficial bacteria]] grows over the pebbles, releasing the nutrients in the percolating greywater. At the bottom of the wall a container collects the purified water, which can then be used for non-[[potable]] household use, for watering the garden, or it can be returned to the top of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/features/digital/archives/0702dignews-1.asp Living wall systems ''(subscription required)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
''Plants used'': since the harvesting of the plants is a part of the purification process, fast growing, herbaceous crops are particularly suited for the Folkewall. Annual food crops are suitable, perennials like trees and shrubs should be avoided.

''Greywater'': The water feeding the plants in the wall must be free of [[heavy metals]] and/or unsafe [[pollutants]], notably [[human waste]]. This requires using source-separating toilets.

==Advantages==
* '''Better use of greywater''': most of the evaporation happens through the plant's leaves, which makes the method especially useful in arid climates. The Folkewall makes use of this aspect.
* '''More efficient use of the area'''. For example in greenhouses or other glazed areas where a wall is used as a greywater purification device, it also works as a '''heat exchanger and buffer'''.
* '''Purification''' of the percolating water, so greywater can be used as irrigation water.
* In warm climates, the wall can be used on the sunny side to '''cool the building'''. 
* '''Low-cost housing''': the combined use of Folkewalls and source-separating toilets would "reduce the infrastructure cost by about 30%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/JF/JF_OTHER/SMALL/Growing%20wall%20-%20Water.pdf Growing walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27512">'''Free will in antiquity''' was not discussed in the same terms as used in the modern [[free will]] debates, but historians of the problem have speculated who exactly was first to take positions as [[determinism|determinist]], [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]], and [[compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien, ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy''; Timothy O'Keefe, ''Epicurus on Freedom'', R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate '', David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', Richard Sorabji, "Necessity, Cause, and Blame "&lt;/ref&gt; There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical "agent-causal" libertarianism, include [[Democritus]] (460–370), [[Aristotle]] (384–322), [[Epicurus]] (341–270), [[Chrysippus]] (280–207), and [[Carneades]] (214–129).

==Pre-Socratic thought==
Early religious accounts of man's fate explored the degree of human freedom permitted by superhuman gods. A strong fatalism is present in tales that foretell the future, based on the idea that the gods have foreknowledge of future events. Anxious not to annoy the gods, the myth-makers rarely challenged the idea that the gods' foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom.

The first thinkers to look for explanatory causes (ἀιτία) in natural phenomena (rather than gods controlling events) were the Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers (''physiologoi''). The reasons or rules (λόγοι) behind the physical (φύσις) world became the ideal "laws" governing material phenomena. [[Anaximander]] (610-546) coined the term physis (φύσις) and perhaps even the cosmological combination of cosmos (κόσμος), as organized nature, and logos (λόγος), as the law behind nature. The Greeks had a separate word for the laws (or conventions) of society, nomos (νόμος). [[Heraclitus]] (535–475) claimed that everything changes ("you can't step twice into the same river") but that there were laws or rules (the logos) behind all the change. The early cosmologists imagined that the universal laws were all-powerful and must therefore explain the natural causes behind all things, from the regular motions of the heavens to the mind (νοῦς) of man. These ''physiologoi'' transformed pre-philosophical arguments about gods controlling the human will into arguments about pre-existing causes controlling it.

==Democritus and Leucippus==
The materialist philosophers [[Democritus]] and his mentor [[Leucippus]] were the first [[determinism|determinists]]. They claimed that all things, including humans, were made of atoms in a void, with individual atomic motions strictly controlled by causal laws. Democritus said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    By convention (nomos) color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality atoms and a void.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    νόμῳ χροιή, νόμῳ γλυκύ, νόμῳ πικρόν, ἑτεῇ δ’ ἄτομα καὶ κενόν&lt;ref&gt;Diels Kranz, fragment B125&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Democritus wanted to wrest control of man's fate from arbitrary gods and make us more responsible for our actions. But ironically, he and Leucippus originated two of the great dogmas of determinism, [[physical determinism]] and [[logical truth|logical necessity]], which lead directly to the traditional and modern problem of free will and determinism.

Leucippus dogmatically declared an absolute necessity which left no room in the cosmos for chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Nothing occurs at random (maten), but everything for a reason (logos) and by necessity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    οὐδὲν χρῆμα μάτην γίνεται, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκ λόγου τε καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 – from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequence is a world with but one possible future, completely determined by its past.

==Socrates==
In Plato's Gorgias (and in the Protagoras 345c4-e6), Socrates argues that no one does wrong willingly, one of the most famous doctrines to be associated with him. When framed in modern (Western) terms, the implication is that it is ignorance, rather that free individual agency, that is responsible for morally wrong actions.

==Aristotle==

Michael Frede typifies the prevailing view of recent scholarship, namely that Aristotle did not have a notion of free-will.&lt;ref&gt; http://philpapers.org/archive/BOB_FW.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] elaborated the four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was ἀιτία, which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic "every event has a (single) cause" idea that was to come later.
Then, in his ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle also said there were "accidents" caused by "chance (τυχή)". In his ''Physics'', he noted that the early physicists had found no place for chance among their causes.

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book V, 1025a25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book VI, 1027a29&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tracing any particular sequence of events back in time will usually come to an accidental event – a "starting point" or "fresh start" (Aristotle calls it an origin or arche (ἀρχή) – whose major contributing cause (or causes) was itself uncaused.

Whether a particular thing happens, says Aristotle, may depend on a series of causes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its generation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' Book VI 1027b12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In general, many such causal sequences contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond causal sequences that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions "depend on us" (ἐφ' ἡμῖν). These are the causal chains that originate within us (ἐv ἡμῖν).

[[Richard Sorabji]]'s 1980 ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'' surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of [[future contingents]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he thinks Aristotle was not aware of the "problem" of free will vis-a-vis determinism (as first described by Epicurus), Sorabji thinks Aristotle's position on the question is clear enough. Voluntariness is too important to fall before theoretical arguments about necessity and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I come now to the question of how determinism is related to involuntariness. Many commentators nowadays hold one or more parts of the following view. Determinism creates a problem for belief in the voluntariness of actions. Regrettably, but inevitably, Aristotle was unaware of this problem, and so failed to cope with it. Indeed, the problem was not discovered until Hellenistic times, perhaps by Epicurus, who was over forty years junior to Aristotle, and who reached Athens just too late to hear his lectures. In Aristotle's time no one had yet propounded a universal determinism, so that he knew of no such theory. His inevitable failure to see the threat to voluntariness is all the more regrettable in that he himself entertained a deterministic account of actions, which exacerbated the problem of how any could be voluntary. I shall argue that this account misrepresents the situation&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Epicurus==
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|right|Epicurus]]
It is with Epicurus and the Stoics that clearly indeterministic and deterministic positions are first formulated. Writing one generation after Aristotle, [[Epicurus]] argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions (''[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]]''), something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.

Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a ''tertium quid'', beyond necessity (Democritus' physics) and beyond chance. His ''tertium quid'' is agent autonomy, what is "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...some things happen of necessity (ἀνάγκη), others by chance (τύχη), others through our own agency (παρ’ ἡμᾶς).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...necessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.&lt;ref&gt;Epicurus, ''Letter to Menoeceus'', §133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lucretius]] (1st century [[BCE]]), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (''libera'') in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (''voluntas'') wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the limbs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, [[Pamela Huby]] suggested that Epicurus was the original discoverer of the "freewill problem". Huby noted that there had been two main free will problems, corresponding to different determinisms, namely theological determinism (predestination and foreknowledge) and the physical causal determinism of Democritus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unfortunate that our knowledge of the early history of the Stoics is so fragmentary, and that we have no agreed account of the relations between them and Epicurus. On the evidence we have, however, it seems to me more probable that Epicurus was the originator of the freewill controversy, and that it was only taken up with enthusiasm among the Stoics by Chrysippus, the third head of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Huby, "The First Discovery of the Freewill Problem", ''Philosophy'', 42 (1967), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000 [[Susanne Bobzien]] challenged Pamela Huby's 1967 assertion that Epicurus discovered the "free will problem".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In 1967 Epicurus was credited with the discovery of the problem of free will and determinism. Among the contestants were Aristotle and the early Stoics. Epicurus emerged victorious, because – so the argument went – Aristotle did not yet have the problem, and the Stoics inherited it from Epicurus. In the same year David Furley published his essay 'Aristotle and Epicurus on Voluntary Action', in which he argued that Epicurus' problem was not the free will problem. In the thirty-odd years since then, a lot has been published about Epicurus on freedom and determinism. But it has only rarely been questioned whether Epicurus, in one way or another, found himself face to face with some version of the free will problem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bobzien thinks Epicurus did not have a model of what she calls "two-sided freedom," because she believes that Epicurus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"assumed....a gap in the causal chain immediately before, or simultaneously with, the decision or choice, a gap which allows the coming into being of a spontaneous motion. In this way every human decision or choice is directly linked with causal indeterminism....To avoid misunderstandings, I should stress that I do believe that Epicurus was an indeterminist of sorts – only that he did not advocate indeterminist free decision or indeterminist free choice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. A. Long]] and [[David Sedley|D. N. Sedley]], however, agree with Pamela Huby that Epicurus was the first to notice the modern problem of free will and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Epicurus' problem is this: if it has been necessary all along that we should act as we do, it cannot be up to us, with the result that we would not be morally responsible for our actions at all. Thus posing the problem of determinism he becomes arguably the first philosopher to recognize the philosophical centrality of what we know as the Free Will Question. His strongly libertarian  approach to it can be usefully contrasted with the Stoics' acceptance of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Long and Sedley, ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'', section 20, "Free Will," p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question remains how random swerves can help to explain free action. In her 1992 book, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', [[Julia Annas]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...since swerves are random, it is hard to see how they help to explain free action. We can scarcely expect there to be a random swerve before every free action. Free actions are frequent, and (fairly) reliable. Random swerves cannot account for either of these features. This problem would be lessened if we could assume that swerves are very frequent, so that there is always likely to be one around before an action. However, if swerves are frequent, we face the problem that stones and trees ought to be enabled to act freely. And even in the case of humans random swerves would seem to produce, if anything, random actions; we still lack any clue as to how they could produce actions which are free.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One view, going back to the 19th century historian [[Carlo Giussani]], is that Epicurus' atomic swerves are involved directly in every case of human free action, not just somewhere in the past that breaks the causal chain of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;"The complete conception of the will according to Epicurus comprises two elements, a complex atomic movement which has the characteristic of spontaneity, that is, is withdrawn from the necessity of mechanical causation: and then the sensus, or self-consciousness in virtue of which the will, illuminated by previous movements of sensation, thought, and emotion, profits by the peculiar liberty or spontaneity of the atomic motions, to direct or not to direct these in a direction seen or selected." — Carlo Giussani, ''Studi Lucreziani'' 1896 (p. 126) (Cyril Bailey translation)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Cyril Bailey]] agreed with Giussani that the atoms of the mind-soul provide a break in the continuity of atomic motions, otherwise actions would be necessitated. Bailey imagined complexes of mind-atoms that work together to form a consciousness that is not determined, but also not susceptible to the pure randomness of individual atomic swerves, something that could constitute Epicurus' idea of actions being "up to us" (πὰρ' ἡμάς).&lt;ref&gt;It is a commonplace to state that Epicurus, like his follower Lucretius, intended primarily to combat the 'myths' of the orthodox religion, to show by his demonstration of the unfailing laws of nature the falseness of the old notions of the arbitrary action of the gods and so to relieve humanity from the terrors of superstition. But it is sometimes forgotten that Epicurus viewed with almost greater horror the conception of irresistible 'destiny' or 'necessity', which is the logical outcome of the notion of natural law pressed to its conclusion. This conclusion had been accepted in its fulness by Democritus, but Epicurus conspicuously broke away from him: 'it were better to follow the myths about the gods than to become a slave to the "destiny" of the natural philosophers: for the former suggests a hope of placating the gods by worship, whereas the latter involves a necessity which knows no placation'. — Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey states that Epicurus did not ''identify'' freedom of the will with chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may be that [Giussani's] account presses the Epicurean doctrine slightly beyond the point to which the master had thought it out for himself, but it is a direct deduction from undoubted Epicurean conceptions and is a satisfactory explanation of what Epicurus meant: that he should have thought that the freedom of the will was chance, and fought hard to maintain it as chance and no more, is inconceivable.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'' p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967 [[David Furley]] de-emphasized the importance of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the "extreme" libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this "traditional interpretation".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    If we now put together the introduction to Lucretius' passage on ''voluntas'' and Aristotle's theory of the voluntary, we can see how the swerve of atoms was supposed to do its work. Aristotle's criterion of the voluntary was a negative one: the source of the voluntary action is in the agent himself, in the sense that it cannot be traced back beyond or outside the agent himself. Lucretius says that voluntas must be saved from a succession of causes which can be traced back to infinity. All he needs to satisfy the Aristotelian criterion is a ''break in the succession of causes'', so that the source of an action cannot be traced back to something occurring before the birth of the agent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The swerve, then, plays a purely negative part in Epicurean psychology. It saves ''voluntas'' from necessity, as Lucretius says it does, but it does not feature in every act of ''voluntas''.&lt;ref&gt;David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, in his 1983 thesis, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", [[Don Paul Fowler]] defended the ancient claim that Epicurus proposed random swerves as directly causing our actions.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I turn to the overall interpretation. Lucretius is arguing from the existence of ''voluntas'' to the existence of the ''clinamen''; nothing comes to be out of nothing, therefore ''voluntas'' must have a cause at the atomic level, viz. the ''clinamen''. The most natural interpretation of this is that every act of ''voluntas'' is caused by a swerve in the atoms of the animal's mind....There is a close causal, physical relationship between the macroscopic and the atomic. Furley, however, argued that the relationship between ''voluntas''  and the ''clinamen'' was very different; not every act of volition was accompanied by a swerve in the soul-atoms, but the ''clinamen'' was only an occasional event which broke the chain of causation between the σύστασις of our mind at birth and the 'engendered' state (τὸ ἀπογεγεννημένον) which determines our actions.Its role in Epicureanism is
merely to make a formal break with physical determinism, and it has no real effect on the outcome of particular actions. (p. 338).&lt;ref&gt;Don Fowler, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", Συζήτησισ: ''Studi sull'epicureismo greco e romano offerti a Marcello Gigante'', (Naples, 1983) 329–52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a 1999 ''Phronesis'' article, Purinton agreed with Fowler that random swerves directly cause volitions and actions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"since they do not make volition itself a fresh start of motion, and Sedley's view does not do justice to his atomism...It seems to me, therefore, that there is no good reason to reject the thesis that Epicurus held that swerves cause volitions from the bottom up. And there are a number of good reasons to accept it."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Purinton, "Epicurus on 'Free Volition' and the Atomic Swerve,'" ''Phronesis'', 44, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stoicism==
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoic school of philosophy]] that solidified the idea of natural laws controlling all things, including the mind. [[Zeno of Citium]], the original founder of Stoicism, had a simple but powerful idea of the causal chain compared to Aristotle. Zeno said that every event has a cause, and that cause necessitates the event. Given exactly the same circumstances, exactly the same result will occur.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is impossible that the cause be present yet that of which it is the cause not obtain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ἀδύνατον δ’ εἴναι τὸ μὲν αἴτιον παρεῖναι, οὖ δέ ἐστιν αἴτιον μὴ ὑπάρχειν.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chrysippus bust.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysippus]]
The major developer of Stoicism, [[Chrysippus]], took the edge off strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, he wanted to strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.

Whereas the past is unchangeable, Chrysippus argued that some future events that are possible do not occur by necessity from past external factors alone, but might (as Aristotle and Epicurus maintained) depend on us. We have a choice to assent or not to assent to an action. Chrysippus said our actions are determined (in part by ourselves as causes) and fated (because of God's foreknowledge), but he also said that they are not necessitated, i.e., pre-determined from the distant past. Chrysippus would be seen today as a [[compatibilism|compatibilist]].

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] describes the first compatibilist arguments to reconcile responsibility and determinism by Chrysippus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Stoic position, given definitive expression by Chrysippus  (c. 280–207 BC), the third head of the school, represents not the opposite extreme from that of Epicurus but an attempt to compromise, to combine determinism and responsibility. Their theory of the universe is indeed a completely deterministic one; everything is governed by fate, identified with the sequence of causes; nothing could happen otherwise than it does, and in any given set of circumstances one and only one result can follow – otherwise an uncaused motion would occur.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chrysippus was concerned to preserve human responsibility in the context of his determinist system. His position was thus one of 'soft determinism', as opposed on the one hand to that of the 'hard determinist' who claims that determinism excludes responsibility, and on the other to that of the libertarian who agrees on the incompatibility but responsibility by determinism. The Greek to eph' hemin (ἐφ΄ ἡμῖν), 'what depends on us', like the English 'responsibility', was used both by libertarians and by soft determinists, though they differed as to what it involved; thus he occurrence of the expression is not a safe guide to the type of position involved. The situation is complicated by the fact that the debate is in Greek philosophy conducted entirely in terms of responsibility (to eph' hemin) rather than of freedom or free will; nevertheless it can be shown that some thinkers, Alexander among them, have a libertarian rather than a soft-determinist conception of responsibility, and in such cases I have not hesitated to use expressions like 'freedom'.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alexander of Aphrodisias==
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (c. 150–210), the most famous ancient commentator on Aristotle, wrote in the age of Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics. He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today. Greek philosophy had no precise term for "free will" as did Latin (''liberum arbitrium'' or ''libera voluntas''). The discussion was in terms of responsibility, what "depends on us" (in Greek ἐφ ἡμῖν).

Alexander believed that Aristotle was not a strict determinist like the Stoics, and Alexander himself argued that some events do not have pre-determined causes. In particular, man is responsible for self-caused decisions, and can choose to do or not to do something, as Chrysippus argued. However, Alexander denied the foreknowledge of events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature.

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] described Alexander's ''De Fato'' as perhaps the most comprehensive treatment surviving from classical antiquity of the problem of responsibility (τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμίν) and determinism. It especially shed a great deal of light on Aristotle's position on free will and on the Stoic attempt to make responsibility compatible with determinism.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, translation and commentary ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[orbital mechanics]], a '''frozen orbit''' is an [[orbit]] for an artificial [[satellite]] in which natural drifting due to the [[central body]]'s shape has been minimized by careful selection of the [[orbital parameters]]. Typically, this is an orbit in which, over a long period of time, the satellite's [[altitude]] remains constant at the same point in each orbit.&lt;ref name=cdeagle&gt;{{cite web|last=Eagle |first=C. David |title=Frozen Orbit Design |url=http://www.cdeagle.com/omnum/pdf/frozen1.pdf |work=Orbital Mechanics with Numerit |accessdate=5 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121072936/http://www.cdeagle.com/omnum/pdf/frozen1.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[orbital inclination|inclination]], [[argument of perigee|position]] of the [[apsis|lowest point]] of the orbit, and [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] have been minimized by choosing [[initial value]]s so that their [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] cancel out.&lt;ref name=chobotov&gt;{{cite book |last=Chobotov |first=Vladimir A. |title=Orbital Mechanics |edition=3rd |year=2002 |publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] |page=221 |url=http://www.knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=1586&amp;VerticalID=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a long-term stable orbit that minimizes the use of [[orbital station-keeping|station-keeping]] propellant.

==Background and motivation==
For most spacecraft, changes to orbits are caused by the [[Geopotential model|oblateness of the Earth]], gravitational attraction from the sun and moon, [[solar radiation pressure]], and [[air drag]]. These are called "perturbing forces". They must be counteracted by maneuvers to keep the spacecraft in the desired orbit. For a [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary spacecraft]], correction maneuvers on the order of 40–50&amp;nbsp;m/s per year are required to counteract the gravitational forces from the sun and moon which move the orbital plane away from the equatorial plane of the Earth.

For [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous spacecraft]], intentional shifting of the orbit plane (called "precession") can be used for the benefit of the mission. For these missions, a near-circular orbit with an altitude of 600–900&amp;nbsp;km is used. An appropriate inclination (97.8-99.0 degrees) is selected so that the precession of the orbital plane is equal to the rate of movement of the Earth around the sun, about 1 degree per day.

As a result, the spacecraft will pass over points on the Earth that have the same time of day during every orbit. For instance, if the orbit is "square to the sun", the vehicle will always pass over points at which it is 6 a.m. on the north-bound portion, and 6 p.m. on the south-bound portion (or vice versa). This is called a "Dawn-Dusk" orbit. Alternatively, if the sun lies in the orbital plane, the vehicle will always pass over places where it is midday on the north-bound leg, and places where it is midnight on the south-bound leg (or vice versa). These are called "Noon-Midnight" orbits. Such orbits are desirable for many Earth observation missions such as weather, imagery, and mapping.

The perturbing force caused by the oblateness of the Earth will in general perturb not only the orbital plane but also the [[eccentricity vector]] of the orbit. There exists, however, an almost-circular orbit for which there are no secular/long periodic perturbations of the eccentricity vector, only periodic perturbations with period equal to the orbital period.  Such an orbit is then perfectly periodic (except for the orbital plane precession) and it is therefore called a "frozen orbit". Such an orbit is often the preferred choice for an Earth observation mission where repeated observations of the same area of the Earth should be made under as constant observation conditions as possible.

The [[Earth observation satellite]]s [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]] are operated in sun-synchronous frozen orbits.

===Lunar frozen orbits===
Through a study of many [[lunar orbit]]ing satellites, scientists have discovered that most [[Lunar orbit|low lunar orbit]]s (LLO) are unstable.&lt;ref name=Elipe2003&gt;[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.5064?journalCode=jgcd Frozen Orbits About the Moon. 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Four ''frozen lunar orbits'' have been identified at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination. NASA expounded on this in 2006:&lt;ref name=nasa20061106&gt;{{cite web |title=Bizarre Lunar Orbits |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/06nov_loworbit/ |last=Bell |first=Trudy E. |date=November 6, 2006 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |work=Science@NASA |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Mass concentration (astronomy)|Lunar mascons]] make most low lunar orbits unstable ... As a satellite passes 50 or 60 miles overhead, the mascons pull it forward, back, left, right, or down, the exact direction and magnitude of the tugging depends on the satellite's trajectory. Absent any periodic boosts from onboard rockets to correct the orbit, most satellites released into low lunar orbits (under about 60 miles or 100 km) will eventually crash into the Moon. ... [There are] a number of 'frozen orbits' where a spacecraft can stay in a low lunar orbit indefinitely. They occur at four inclinations: 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86°"—the last one being nearly over the lunar poles. The orbit of the relatively long-lived Apollo 15 subsatellite [[PFS-1]] had an inclination of 28°, which turned out to be close to the inclination of one of the frozen orbits—but poor [[PFS-2]] was cursed with an inclination of only 11°.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classical theory==
{{cleanup

|date=September 2013}}

The classical theory of frozen orbits is essentially based on the analytical [[Orbital perturbation analysis|perturbation analysis]] for artificial satellites of [[Dirk Brouwer]] made under contract with [[NASA]] and published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Brouwer: "Solution of the Problem of the Artificial Satellite Without Drag", ''Astronomical Journal'', 64 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis can be carried out as follows:

In the article [[orbital perturbation analysis]] the secular perturbation of the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\Delta \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; term of the [[geopotential model]] is shown to be
: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \sin i \quad \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements thusly:

:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta i\ =\ 0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \Omega\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Making a similar analysis for the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term (corresponding to the fact that the earth is [[Figure of the Earth|slightly pear shaped]]), one gets
:   {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ 2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \left(\ e_h\ \left(1 - \frac{15}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)\ \hat{g}\ -\ e_g\ \left(1 - \frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)\ \hat{h}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements as

:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta i\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ e_g\ \left(1 - \frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \Omega\ =\ 2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \frac{\cos i}{\sin i}\ \ e_h\ \left(1 - \frac{15}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

In the same article the secular perturbation of the components of the [[Kepler orbit|eccentricity vector]] caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is shown to be:

:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \left(\Delta e_g, \Delta e_h\right)\ =\ 
    &amp; -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ (-e_h ,e_g)\ + \ 2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos^2 i \left(-e_h, e_g\right)\ = \\
    &amp; -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-e_h, e_g\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

where:

* The first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the in-plane component of the perturbing force
* The second term is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new orbital plane, the orbital plane being perturbed by the out-of-plane force component

Making the analysis for the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term one gets for the first term, i.e. for the perturbation of the eccentricity vector from the in-plane force component

:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right) 
\left(\left(1 - {e_g}^2 + 4\ {e_h}^2\right)\ \hat{g}\ -\ 5\ e_g\ e_h\ \hat{h}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

For inclinations in the range 97.8–99.0 deg, the &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; value given by ({{EquationNote|6}}) is much smaller than the value given by ({{EquationNote|3}}) and can be ignored. Similarly the quadratic terms of the eccentricity vector components in ({{EquationNote|8}}) can be ignored for almost circular orbits, i.e. ({{EquationNote|8}}) can be approximated with

:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right) \ \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

Adding the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; contribution 
&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right) \ (1,\ 0)
&lt;/math&gt;

to ({{EquationNote|7}}) one gets
:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left(\Delta e_g, \Delta e_h\right)\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-\left(e_h+\frac{J_3\ \sin i}{J_2\ 2\ p}\right),\ e_g \right) 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

Now the difference equation shows that the eccentricity vector will describe a circle centered at the point &lt;math&gt;\left(\ 0,\ -\frac{J_3\ \sin i}{J_2\ 2\ p}\ \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;; the polar argument of the eccentricity vector increases with &lt;math&gt; -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\,&lt;/math&gt; radians between consecutive orbits.

As
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = 398600.440\text{ km}^3/s^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_2 = 1.7555\ 10^{10}\text{ km}^5/s^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_3 = -2.619\ 10^{11}\text{ km}^6/s^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

one gets for a polar orbit (&lt;math&gt; i = 90^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt; p = 7200\text{ km}\,&lt;/math&gt; that the centre of the circle is at &lt;math&gt;(0,\ 0.001036)\,&lt;/math&gt; and the change of polar argument is 0.00400 radians per orbit.

The latter figure means that the eccentricity vector will have described a full circle in 1569 orbits.
Selecting the initial mean eccentricity vector as &lt;math&gt; (0,\ 0.001036)\,&lt;/math&gt; the mean eccentricity vector will stay constant for successive orbits, i.e. the orbit is frozen because the secular perturbations of the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; term given by ({{EquationNote|7}}) and of the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term given by ({{EquationNote|9}}) cancel out.

In terms of classical orbital elements, this means that a frozen orbit should have the following (mean!) elements:
:&lt;math&gt;e = -\frac{J_3\ \sin i}{J_2\ 2\ p}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega =\ 90^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Modern theory==
The modern theory of frozen orbits is based on the algorithm given in a 1989 article by Mats Rosengren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |bibcode=1989ommd.proc...49R |author=Mats Rosengren |title=Improved technique for Passive Eccentricity Control (AAS 89-155) |volume=69 |publisher=AAS/NASA |book-title=Advances in the Astronautical Sciences|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this the analytical expression ({{EquationNote|7}}) is used to iteratively update the initial (mean) eccentricity vector to obtain that the (mean) eccentricity vector several orbits later computed by the precise numerical propagation takes precisely the same value. In this way the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; term is used to counteract all secular perturbations, not only those (dominating) caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term. One such additional secular perturbation that in this way can be compensated for is the one caused by the [[solar radiation pressure]], this perturbation is discussed in the article "[[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]]".

Applying this algorithm for the case discussed above, i.e. a polar orbit (&lt;math&gt; i=90^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt; p=7200\text{ km}\,&lt;/math&gt; ignoring all perturbing forces other than the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; forces for the numerical propagation one gets exactly the same optimal average eccentricity vector as with the "classical theory", i.e. &lt;math&gt; (0,\ 0.001036)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

When we also include the forces due to the higher zonal terms the optimal value changes to &lt;math&gt; (0,\ 0.001285)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming in addition a reasonable solar pressure (a "cross-sectional-area" of {{nowrap|0.05 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/kg}}, the direction to the sun in the direction towards the ascending node) the optimal value for the average eccentricity vector becomes &lt;math&gt; (0.000069,\ 0.001285)\,&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to :&lt;math&gt;\omega =\ 87^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the optimal value is '''not''' &lt;math&gt;\omega =\ 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; anymore.

This algorithm is implemented in the orbit control software used for the [[Earth observation satellite]]s [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]]

==Derivation of the closed form expressions for the ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perturbation==
{{cleanup

The main perturbing force to be counter-acted to have a frozen orbit is the "&lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; force", i.e. the gravitational force caused by an imperfect symmetry north/south of the Earth, and the "classical theory" is based on the closed form expression for this "&lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; perturbation".  With the "modern theory" this explicit closed form expression is not directly used but it is certainly still worthwhile to derive it.

The derivation of this expression can be done as follows:

The potential from a zonal term is rotational symmetric around the  polar axis of the Earth and corresponding force is entirely in a longitudial plane with one component &lt;math&gt;F_r\ \hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the radial direction and one component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;  with the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in Figure 1.

[[File:Spherical coordinates unit vectors.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: The unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\phi},\ \hat{\lambda},\ \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;]]

In the article [[Geopotential model]] it is shown that these force components caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term are

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;F_r = J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ 2\ \sin\lambda\ \left(5\sin^2\lambda\ -\ 3\right) \\
&amp;F_\lambda = -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos\lambda\ \left(5\ \sin^2\lambda\ -1\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

To be able to apply relations derived in the article [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] the force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; must be split into two orthogonal components &lt;math&gt;F_t\ \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_z\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; as illustrated in figure 2

[[File:Zonal term force components.svg|thumb|right|Figure 2: The unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of motion and the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is marked as "F"]]
Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},\ \hat{b},\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system with origin in the center of the Earth (in the center of the [[Reference ellipsoid]])  such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; points in the direction north and such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},\ \hat{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; are in the equatorial plane of the Earth with &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; pointing towards the [[Orbital node|ascending node]], i.e. towards the blue point of Figure 2.

The components of the unit vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r},\ \hat{t},\ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

making up the local coordinate system (of which &lt;math&gt;\hat{t},\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in figure 2), and expressing their relation with &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},\ \hat{b},\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;r_a= \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b= \cos i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_n= \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_a=-\sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_b= \cos i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_n= \sin i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_a= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_b=-\sin i\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_n= \cos i\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar argument of &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; relative the orthogonal unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}=\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}=\cos i\ \hat{b}\ +\ \sin i\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the orbital plane

Firstly

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \lambda =\ r_n\ =\ \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the equator plane and &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; (between the green points of figure 2) and from equation (12) of the article [[Geopotential model]] one therefore obtains
:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
F_r = J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ 2\ \sin i \ \sin u\,\ \left(5\sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -\ 3\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

Secondly the projection of direction north, &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, on the plane spanned by &lt;math&gt;\hat{t},\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this projection is 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north illustrated in figure 1.

From equation ({{EquationNote|11}}) we see that

:&lt;math&gt;F_\lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\ = -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2\lambda\ -1\right)\ \cos\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\ =\ -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2\lambda\ -1\right)\ (\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z})\,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore:
:   {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
F_t  =\ -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right)\ \sin i \ \cos u
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}
:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
F_z =\ -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right)\ \cos i
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

In the article [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] it is further shown that the secular perturbation of the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; is

:   {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \frac{1}{\mu p}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}F_z r^3 \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}F_z r^3 \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

Introducing the expression for &lt;math&gt;F_z\,&lt;/math&gt; of ({{EquationNote|14}}) in ({{EquationNote|15}}) one gets
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\Delta \hat{z}\ = -\frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \cdot \\
&amp;\left[ \hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \cos u \ du\ + 
\hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

The fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{r}\ =\ 1 + e \cdot \cos \theta\ =\ 1 + e_g \cdot \cos u + e_h \cdot \sin u&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;e_g =\ e\ \cos \omega&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_h =\ e\ \sin \omega&lt;/math&gt;

are the components of the eccentricity vector in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{g},\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system.

As all integrals of type
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^m u \ \sin^n u\ du\,&lt;/math&gt;
are zero if not both &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; are even, we see that

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \cos u \ du 
&amp;=\ 2\ e_g\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2 u \cos^2 u \ du \ -
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^2 u \ du \right) \\
&amp;=\ 2\pi\ e_g \ (\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i-1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

and

:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \sin u \ du
&amp;=\ 2\ e_h\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^4 u \ du \ -
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2 u \ du \right) \\
&amp;=\ 2\pi\ e_h \ (\frac{15}{4} \sin^2 i-1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

It follows that

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta \hat{z}\ &amp;=\  2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \left[e_g \ (1-\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i)\ \hat{g}
+\ e_h \ (1-\frac{15}{4} \sin^2 i)\ \hat{h}\right]\quad \times \ \hat{z} \\
&amp;=\ 2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \left[
\ e_h \ (1-\frac{15}{4} \sin^2 i)\ \hat{g}\ - e_g \ (1-\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i)\ \hat{h}\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; are the base vectors of the rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit with &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the equatorial plane towards the ascending node and &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar argument relative this equatorial coordinate system

:&lt;math&gt;f_z\,&lt;/math&gt; is the force component (per unit mass) in the direction of the orbit pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

In the article [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] it is shown that the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector is

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bar{e}\ =\frac {1}{\mu}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right)\ r^2\ du
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}

where

*&lt;math&gt;\hat{r},\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the usual local coordinate system with unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; directed away from the Earth
*&lt;math&gt;V_r = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot e \cdot \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; - the velocity component in direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;V_t = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot (1 + e \cdot \cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt; - the velocity component in direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the expression for &lt;math&gt;F_r,\ F_t\,&lt;/math&gt; of ({{EquationNote|12}}) and ({{EquationNote|13}}) in ({{EquationNote|20}}) one gets
: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\Delta \bar{e}\ =\frac {J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \sin i\  \cdot \\ 
&amp;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ 2 \ \sin u\,\ \left(5\sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -\ 3\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \ \cos u\right)du
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|21}}}}

Using that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_r}{V_t} = \frac {e_g \cdot \sin u\ -\ e_h \cdot \cos u}{\frac {p}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

the integral above can be split in 8 terms:

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ 2 \ \sin u\,\ \left(5\sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -\ 3\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \ \cos u\right)\ du\ = \\
&amp;-10\sin^2 i \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \sin^3 u\ du \\
&amp;+6\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \sin u\ du \\
&amp;-15\ \sin^2 i \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{r}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \sin^2 u  \ \cos u\ du \\
&amp;+3\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{r}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \cos u\ du  \\
&amp;+\frac{15}{2}\sin^2 i\ e_g\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \ \sin^3 u \ \cos u\ du \\
&amp;-\frac{15}{2}\sin^2 i\ e_h \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \ \sin^2 u \ \cos^2 u\ du \\
&amp;-\frac{3}{2}\ e_g \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \ \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \sin u \ \cos u\ du \\
&amp;+\frac{3}{2}\ e_h \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \cos^2 u\ du
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|22}}}}

Given that
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \sin u\ \hat{h}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \cos u\ \hat{h}&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{r}\ =\ 1 + e \cdot \cos \theta\ =\ 1 + e_g \cdot \cos u + e_h \cdot \sin u&lt;/math&gt;

and that all integrals of type

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^m u \ \sin^n u\ du\,&lt;/math&gt;
are zero if not both &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; are even:

'''Hungry ghost''' is a concept in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Chinese traditional religion]] representing  beings who are driven by intense emotional needs in an [[Animals in Buddhism|animalistic]] way.
The term  {{lang|zh|[[:wikt:餓鬼|餓鬼]]}} ''{{lang|pny|èguǐ}}'', literally "'''hungry ghost'''", is the Chinese translation of the term ''[[preta]]'' in [[Buddhism]].
"Hungry ghosts" play a role in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] as well as in [[Chinese folk religion]].
The term is not to be confused with the generic term for "[[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]", {{lang|zh|[[:wikt:鬼|鬼]]}} ''{{lang|pny|guǐ}}'' (i.e. the spirit of a deceased ancestor). The understanding is that all people become such a regular ghost when they die,&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Venerable Yin-shun. ''The Way to Buddhahood''. Massachusetts: Wisdom Publications: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and would then slowly weaken and eventually die a second time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfnn.org/book/article2/1323.htm 目次：冥報記白話]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Eberhard, Stephen F. ''The Ghost Festival in Medieval China''. New Jersey: Princeton University Press: 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Hungry ghosts, by contrast, are a much more exceptional case, and would only occur in very unfortunate circumstances, such as if a whole family were killed or when a family no longer venerated their ancestors.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

With the rise in popularity of [[Buddhism]], the idea became popular that [[soul]]s would live in space until reincarnation.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; In the [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition it is believed that hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; and Taoism&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Oldstone-Moore, Jennifer. ''Taoism''. USA: Oxford University Press: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors. According to the [[Flower Garland Sutra|Hua-yen Sutra]] evil deeds will cause a soul to be reborn in one of six different realms.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Baroni, Helen J. Ph.D. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism''. New York: The Rosen Publishing Group, Incorporated: 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be reborn as a denizen of [[Diyu|hell]], a lower degree of evil will cause a soul to be reborn as an animal, and the lowest degree will cause a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Gregory, Peter N., ed. ''Inquiry Into the Origin of Humanity''. Hawaii: University of Hawaii Press: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition, evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost are killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;

==Myths of origin ==
[[File:Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 2.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Image from a Japanese scroll which describes the realm of the hungry ghosts and how to placate them. Currently housed at the [[Kyoto National Museum]], artist unknown.]]
There are many legends regarding the origin of hungry ghosts. In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition there are stories from ''Chuan-chi po-yuan ching'' ("Sutra of One Hundred Selected Legends") that is from the early third century.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Eberhardt, Wolfram. ''Chinese Festivals''. New York: Abelard-Schuman Ltd.: 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of these stories are as follows:

One story is of a rich man who traveled selling [[sugar-cane]] juice. One day a [[Buddhist monk|monk]] came to his house looking for some juice to cure an illness. The man had to leave, so he instructed his wife to give the monk the drink in his absence. Instead of doing this, she secretly urinated in the monk's bowl, added sugar cane juice to it and gave it to the monk. The monk was not deceived, he poured out the bowl and left. When the wife died she was reborn as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

Another such tale is of a man who was giving and kind. One day he was about to leave his house when a monk came by begging. The man instructed his wife to give the monk some food. After the man left his house his wife was overcome with greed. She took it upon herself to teach the monk a lesson, so she locked the monk in an empty room all day with no food. She was reborn as a hungry ghost for innumerable lifetimes.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

Most times the legends speak of hungry ghosts who in a previous lifetime were greedy women who refused to give away food.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt; Other stories in the Buddhist tradition come from ''Kuei wen mu-lien ching'' ("The Sutra on the Ghosts Questioning Mu-lien"). One of the stories tells of a man who was a diviner who constantly misled people due to his own avarice and is now a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; There is another story in "The Legend of Mu-lien Entering the City and Seeing Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts". The story is about five hundred men that were sons of elders of the city they lived in. When monks came begging to the city for food, the sons denied them because they thought the monks would keep coming back and eventually take all their food. After the sons died they were reborn as hungry ghosts.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

==Celebrations and practices ==
[[File:Ghost Festival in Ping Chou.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Offerings are prepared for hungry ghosts during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{see also|Ghost Festival}}
In Chinese [[ancestor worship]]  鬼法界, 鬼界 is "the realm of hungry ghosts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism-dict.net/ddb/indexes/term-en.html Buddhism-dict.net] (accessed: October 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a belief of the [[oral tradition]] of Chinese villagers that the ghosts of the ancestors may be granted permission to return to the world of the living at a certain time of the year, hungry and ready to take what they can from there, if these spirits had not been given sufficient offerings by their living relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Martin | first = Emily | author2 = Emíly M. Ahern | title = The cult of the dead in a Chinese village| publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 1973 | pages = | isbn =9780804708357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[festival]] called the [[Ghost Festival|Hungry Ghost Festival]] (TC: 盂蘭盆, SC: 盂兰盆 Yúlánpén) is held to honor the hungry ancestor ghosts and food and drink is put out to satisfy their needs.
The Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated during the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[[Stephen F. Teiser]]. ''The Ghost Festival in Medieval China''. Princeton University Press, 1996 .&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, during this month, the gates of [[Diyu|hell]] are opened up and the hungry ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment.  These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who have forgotten to pay tribute to them after they died. They have long thin necks because they have not been fed by their families. Tradition states that families should offer prayers to their deceased relatives and burn "[[hell money]]". It is believed that "hell money" is a valid currency in the underworld and helps ghosts to live comfortably in the afterlife. People also burn other forms of [[joss paper]] such as paper houses, cars and televisions to please the ghosts.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;"Hungry Ghost Festival". Essortment, 2002. Retrieved Oct 20, 2008. [http://www.essortment.com/all/hungryghostfes_opi.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune.  A big feast is held for the ghosts on the 15th day of the 7th month, where people bring samples of food and place them on the offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Live shows are also put on and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats is always empty as this is where the ghosts are supposed to sit to better enjoy the live entertainment. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes, so that the sound attracts and pleases the ghosts.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;[http://www.chinese-culture.net/html/hungry_ghost_festival.html "Chinese Culture: Hungry Ghost Festival"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These acts were better known as "Merry-making".&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;"Ghost Festival" ChinaVoc 2001-2007 , {{cite web |url=http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608143719/http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest of the town wears an ornate crown of five gold and red panels, a practice borrowed from [[Buddhism]]. This represented the five most powerful deities (The [[Jade Emperor]], [[Guan Yu]], [[Tu Di Gong]], [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] and [[Xi Wangmu]]). He is believed to become their voice on earth.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

A sacrificial altar and a chair are built for a priest either at a street entrance or in front of the village. The [[Bodhisattva]] Ksitigarbha sits in front of the chair. Under the chair are plates of rice flour and peaches. Sitting on the altar are three spirit tablets and three funeral banners. After noon, sheep, pigs, chicken, fruits, and cakes are donated by families that are displayed on the altar. A priest will put a triangular paper banner of three colors with special characters on every sacrifice. After the music begins to play, the priest hits the bell to call the hungry ghosts back to the table. He then throws the rice and peaches into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

During the evening, [[incense]] is burnt in front of the doors of households. Incense stands for prosperity, the more incense burnt, the greater one's prosperity.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;  During the festival, shops are closed to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it. Behind the altar,  monks will sing songs that it is believed only the ghosts can understand. This rite is called ''shi ge'r'', meaning "singing ghost songs".&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Fifteen days after the feast, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to [[Diyu|hell]], people float lanterns on water and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a piece of board. Hungry ghosts are believed to have found their way back when the lanterns go out.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

==Types of spirits ==

It is believed that the [[soul]] contains elements of both [[yin and yang]]. The yin is the ''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|kui]]'', or demon part, and the yang is the ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'', or spirit part. When death occurs, the ''kui'' should return to earth, and the ''shen'' to the grave or family shrine. If a ghost is neglected, it will become a ''kui''. The ''shen'', or ancestral spirit watches over its descendants, and can bring good fortune if properly worshipped.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;"Zhongyua Festival - Hungry Ghost Festival". China Daily. 2004 Aug 30. Retrieved 2008 Oct 20. [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/30/content_370126.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungry ghosts are different from the [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts of Chinese traditions]], which all people are believed to become after death. According to the [[Buddha Dharma]], there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;  Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. The ghosts with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. The ghosts with great wealth also have three subgroups: the ghosts of sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; the ghosts of losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and the ghosts of great powers, like ''[[yaksha]]s'' and ''[[rakshasa]]s'', who are the powerful rulers of ghosts. The ghosts of sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas the ghosts of great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most have little or no wealth and are extremely hungry.

Sixteen hungry ghosts are said to live in [[Diyu|hell]] or in a region of hell. Unlike other hell dwellers, they can leave hell and wander. They look through garbage and human waste on the outskirts of human cities. They are said to be invisible during the daylight hours but visible at night. Some hungry ghosts can only eat corpses, or their food is burnt up in their mouths, sometimes they have a big belly and a neck as thin as a needle (this image is the basic one for hungry ghosts in [[Buddhism in Asia|Asian Buddhism]]).&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Folk beliefs and customs ==
[[File:GhostFestivalsMalaysia002.jpg|thumb|300px|A performance held during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. People are not supposed to sit in the red chairs at the front because they are reserved for the "hungry ghosts."]]
There are many folk beliefs and taboos surrounding the [[Ghost Festival|Hungry Ghost Festival]]. Spirits are thought to be dangerous, and can take many forms, including snakes, moths, birds, foxes, wolves, and tigers. Some can even use the guise of a beautiful man or woman to seduce and possess. One story refers to a ghost which takes the form of a pretty girl and seduces a young man until a priest intervenes and sends the spirit back to hell. It is believed that [[Demonic possession|possession]] can cause illness and/or mental disorders.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

During the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]] children are advised (usually by an elder in the family) to be home before dark, and not to wander the streets at night for fear a ghost might possess them. Swimming is thought to be dangerous as well, as spirits are believed to have drowned people. People will generally avoid driving at night, for fear of a "collision", or spiritual offence, which is any event leading to illness or misfortune.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;DeBernardi, Jean Elizabeth, and Jean DeBernardi. ''Rites of Belonging: Memory, Moderninity &amp; Identity in a Malaysian Chinese Community''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  While "ghost" is a commonly used term throughout the year, many people use the phrase "backdoor god" or "good brother" instead during the 7th month, so as not to anger the ghosts.  Another thing to avoid is sampling any of the food placed on the offering table, as doing this can result in "mysterious illness".  Any person attending a show at indoor entertainment venues (''[[getai]]s'') will notice the first row of chairs is left empty. These seats are reserved for the spirits, and it is considered bad form to sit in them. After an [[Joss paper|offering]] has been burnt for the spirits, stepping on or near the burnt area should be avoided, as it is considered an "opening" to the spirit world and touching it may cause the person to be possessed.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The English term has often been used metaphorically to describe the insatiable craving of an addict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Mark Epstein]] in '' Thoughts Without a Thinker'', pp. 29, 30, {{ISBN|0-465-08585-7}}, of the compulsive [[infidelity]] of a patient.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with Buddhism outside China==
The [[desire realm#Preta Realm|World of the Hungry Ghosts]] ''(preta)'' is one of the six domains of the [[desire realm]] of Buddhism.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Preta}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] Hungry Ghosts (Tib. ཡི་དྭགས་, Wyl. yi dwags, {{lang-sa|[[pretas]]}}) have their own realm depicted on the [[Bhavacakra]] and are represented as teardrop or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]]-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food such that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having "mouths the size of a needle's eye and a stomach the size of a mountain". This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires.

According to the [[History of Buddhism]], as elements of Chinese Buddhism entered a dialogue with Indian Buddhism in the [[Tibetan Plateau]], this synthesis is evident in the compassion rendered in the form of blessed remains of food, etc., offered to the ''pretas'' in rites such as [[Ganachakra]].  {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=December 2008}}

===Japanese Buddhism===
[[File:Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 1.tif|thumb|475px|Section of the Hungry Ghosts Scroll depicting one of the thirty-six types of hungry ghosts who constantly seeks water to drink and explaining how those who have been born as such are saved by the offerings of the living. Kyoto Museum]]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], two such creatures{{Ambiguous|date=November 2016}} exist: the '''gaki''' and the '''[[jikininki]]'''.  Gaki (餓鬼) are the [[spiritual being|spirit]]s of [[jealousy|jealous]] or greedy people who, as punishment for their mortal vices, have been cursed with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as human [[corpse]]s or [[feces]], though in more recent legends, it may be virtually anything, no matter how bizarre. Jikininki (食人鬼 "people-eating ghosts") are the spirits of greedy, [[selfishness|selfish]] or [[impiety|impious]] individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses. They do this at night, scavenging for newly dead bodies and food offerings left for the dead. They sometimes also loot the corpses they eat for valuables. Nevertheless, jikininki lament their condition and hate their repugnant cravings for dead human flesh. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=December 2008}}

The Hungry Ghosts Scroll kept at the [[Kyoto National Museum]] depicts the world of the hungry ghosts, the suffering of these creatures and contains tales of salvation of these ghosts. The whole scroll has been designated as National Treasure of Japan and it was possibly part of a set of scrolls depicting the six realms which was kept at [[Sanjūsangen-dō]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hungry_Ghosts_Scroll_Kyoto_1.tif Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22753">In [[mathematics]], the '''incompressibility method''' is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] method like the [[probabilistic method]], the [[counting]] method or the [[pigeonhole principle]]. To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class which is [[Incompressible string|incompressible]]. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by [[Computability theory|computable]] coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few [[bit]]s (are incompressible).

==History==
The incompressibity method depends on an objective, fixed notion of incompressibility. Such a notion was provided by the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] theory, named for [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&amp;jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=68&amp;option_lang=eng  A. N. Kolmogorov, "Three approaches to the definition of the concept 'quantity of information', ''Probl. Peredachi Inf.'', 1:1 (1965), 3–11]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the incompressibility method with Kolmogorov complexity its theory of computation was to&lt;ref name="Pa"&gt;[http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Pa79.pdf W. J. Paul, "Kolmogorov's complexity and lower bounds", pp 325–333 in: L. Budach Ed., ''Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. Fund. Comput. Theory'', 1979.]&lt;/ref&gt; prove that the running time of a one-[[Punched tape|tape]] [[Turing machine]] is quadratic for accepting a palindromic language and [[sorting algorithm]]s require at least &lt;math&gt;n \log n&lt;/math&gt; time to sort &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items. The first influential paper using the incompressibility method was published in 1980.&lt;ref name="PSS"&gt;[http://dlacm.org/citation.cfm?id=804685 W. J. Paul, J. I. Seiferas, J. Simon, "An information-theoretic approach to time bounds for on-line computation" (preliminary version), ''Proc. 12th  ACM Symp. Theory Comput (STOC)'', 357–367, 1980.]&lt;/ref&gt; The method was applied to a number of fields, and its name was coined in a textbook.&lt;ref name="LV"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JvXiBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=vitanyi+Introduction M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Ccomplexity and Its Applications'', Springer, 1993, 1997, 2008, Chapter 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Kolmogorov complexity of an object, represented by a finite, binary string, is the length of the shortest binary program on a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed]], [[Mathematical optimization|optimal]] [[universal Turing machine]]. Since the machine is fixed and the program concerned is the shortest, the Kolmogorov complexity is a definite positive [[Integer (computer science)|integer]]. The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of the shortest binary program from which it can be computed. Therefore, it is a lower [[Upper and lower bounds|bound]] on the length of a computably-compressed version (in bits) of that object by any existing (or future) compression program.

==Applications==

===Number theory===
According to an [[Mathematical beauty|elegant]] [[Euclid]]ian proof, there is an infinite number of [[prime number]]s. [[Bernhard Riemann]] demonstrated that the number of primes less than a given number is connected with the 0s of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin]] proved in 1896 that this
number of primes is [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;n/\ln n&lt;/math&gt;; see [[Prime number theorem]] (use &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; for the natural logarithm an &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; for the binary logarithm). Using the incompressibility method, [[G. J. Chaitin]] argued as follows:  Each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be described by its [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]] &lt;math&gt;n= p_1^{n_1} \cdots p_k^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; (which is unique), where &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots , p_k&lt;/math&gt; are the first &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; primes which are (at most) &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Exponentiation|exponents]] (possibly) 0. Each exponent is (at most) &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;, and can be described by &lt;math&gt; \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits. The description of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be given in &lt;math&gt;k \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits, provided we know the value of &lt;math&gt;\log \log n&lt;/math&gt; (enabling one to [[Parsing|parse]] the consecutive blocks of exponents). To describe &lt;math&gt;\log \log n&lt;/math&gt; requires only &lt;math&gt;\log \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits. Using the incompressibility of most positive integers, for each &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of binary length &lt;math&gt;l\approx \log n&lt;/math&gt; which cannot be described in fewer than &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; bits. This shows that the number of primes, &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt;  less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) \geq \frac{\log n}{\log \log n} -o(1).
&lt;/math&gt;

A more-sophisticated approach attributed to Piotr Berman (present proof partially by John Tromp) describes every incompressible &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n/p_k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is the largest prime number dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is incompressible, the length of this description must exceed &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;. To parse the first block of the description &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must be given in prefix form &lt;math&gt;P(k)=\log k +\log \log k +\log \varepsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary, small, positive function. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\log p_k \leq P(k)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;p_k \leq n_k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n_k=\varepsilon(k)k\log k&lt;/math&gt; for a special sequence of values &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2,  \ldots &lt;/math&gt;. This shows that the expression below holds for this special sequence, and a simple extension shows that it holds for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) \geq \frac n {\varepsilon(n)\log n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Both proofs are presented in more detail.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

===Graph theory===
A [[labeled graph]] &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes can be represented by a string &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; bits, where each bit indicates the presence (or absence) of an edge between the pair of nodes in that position. &lt;math&gt;K(G) \geq {n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of each vertex satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
|d-n/2| = O\left(\sqrt{n \log n}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this by the incompressibity method, if the deviation is larger we can compress the description of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; below &lt;math&gt;K(G)&lt;/math&gt;; this provides the required contradiction. This theorem is required in a more complicated proof, where the incompressibility argument is used a number of times to show that the number of unlabeled graphs is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sim \frac{2^{n \choose 2}}{n!}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539797327805  H. M. Buhrman, M. Li, J. T. Tromp, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Kolmogorov random graphs and the incompressibility method", ''SIAM J. Comput.'', 29:2(1999), 590–599.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorics===
A transitive [[tournament]] is a complete [[directed graph]], &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;(i,j),(j,k) \in E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(i,k) \in E&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the set of all transitive tournaments on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes. Since a tournament is a labeled, directed [[complete graph]], it can be encoded by a string &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; bits where each bit indicates the direction of the edge between the pair of nodes in that position. Using this encoding, every transitive tournament contains a transitive subtournament on (at least) &lt;math&gt;v(n)&lt;/math&gt; vertices with

:&lt;math&gt;
v(n) \leq 1+ \lfloor 2 \log n \rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

This was shown as the first problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/probabilistic-methods-in-combinatorics  P. Erdos, J. Spencer, ''Probabilistic methods in combinatorics'', Academic Press, 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is easily solved by the incompressibility method,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316594900647 M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi,  "Kolmogorov complexity arguments in combinatorics", ''J. Combinatorial Theory'', Series A, 66:2(1994), 226–236.]&lt;/ref&gt; as are the coin-weighing problem, the number of covering families and expected properties; for example, at least a fraction of &lt;math&gt;1-1/n&lt;/math&gt; of all transitive tournaments on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices have transitive subtournaments on not more than &lt;math&gt;1+2\lceil2 \log n \rceil&lt;/math&gt; vertices. &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large enough.

If a number of events are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] (in [[probability theory]]) of one another, the probability that none of the events occur can be easily calculated. If the events are dependent, the problem becomes difficult. [[Lovász local lemma]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/scans/LocalLem.pdf P. Erdős, L. Lovász, "Problems and results on 3-chromatic hypergraphs and some related questions", in A. Hajnal, R. Rado, and V. T. Sós, eds. ''Infinite and Finite Sets (to Paul Erdős on his 60th birthday)''. North-Holland. pp. 609–627.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a principle that if events are mostly independent of one another and have an individually-small probability, there is a positive probability that none of them will occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1667060  R. A. Moser, G. Tardos, "A constructive proof of the general lovász local lemma", ''Journal of the ACM (JACM)'', 2:57(2010), 11.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was proven by the incompressibility method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?updated-min=2008-12-31T21:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max, L. Fortnow, "A Kolmogorov Complexity Proof of the Lovász Local Lemma", ''Computational Complexity Weblog'', 2 June 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the incompressibility method, several versions of [[Expander graph|expanders]] and superconcentrator graphs were shown to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-2418%28200008%2917:1%3C64::AID-RSA5%3E3.0.CO;2-3/abstract U. Schoning, "Construction of expanders and superconcentrators using Kolmogorov complexity", ''Random Structures &amp; Algorithms'', 17:1(2000), 64–77.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topological combinatorics===

In the [[Heilbronn triangle problem]], throw &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in the unit square and determine the maximum of the minimal area of a triangle formed by three of the points over all possible arrangements. This problem was solved for small arrangements, and much work was done on asymptotic expression as a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The original conjecture of [[Heilbronn]] was &lt;math&gt;O(1/n^2)&lt;/math&gt; during the early 1950s. [[Paul Erdős]] proved that this bound is correct for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, a prime number. The general problem remains unsolved, apart from the best-known lower bound &lt;math&gt;\Omega((\log n)/n^2)&lt;/math&gt; (achievable; hence, [[Heilbronn]]'s conjecture is not correct for general &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and upper bound &lt;math&gt;\exp(c \sqrt{\log n})/n^{8/7}&lt;/math&gt; (proven by Komlos, Pintsz and Szemeredi in 1982 and 1981, respectively). Using the incompressibility method, the average case was studied. It was proven that if the area is too small (or large) it can be compressed below the Kolmogorov complexity of a uniformly-random arrangement (high Kolmogorov complexity). This proves that for the overwhelming majority of the arrangements (and the expectation), the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points thrown uniformly at random in the unit square is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n^3)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the incompressibility method proves the lower and upper bounds of the property involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rsa.10024/abstract  T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "The average‐case area of Heilbronn‐type triangles", ''Random Structures &amp; Algorithms'', 20:2(2002),  206–219.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probability===
The [[law of the iterated logarithm]], the [[law of large numbers]] and the recurrence property were shown to hold using the incompressibility method&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1132061 V. G. Vovk, "The law of the iterated logarithm for random Kolmogorov, or chaotic, sequences", ''Theory Probab. Appl.'' 3:32(1988), 413–426.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020019095002014 M. Zimand, "A high-low Kolmogorov complexity law equivalent to the 0–1 law", ''Inform. Process. Letters'', 57:2(1996), 59–84.]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[normal number]]s expressed as binary strings (in the sense of [[E. Borel]]) and the distribution of 0s and 1s in binary strings of high Kolmogorov complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01192146#page-2 M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Statistical properties of finite sequences with high Kolmogorov complexity",  ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', 27(1994), 365–376.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Turing machines time complexity}}Turing-machine time complexity===
The basic Turing machine, as conceived by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, consists of a memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a read-write head attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the read-write head can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, or not at all according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.

In 1968, F. C. Hennie showed that such a Turing machine requires order &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; to recognize the language of binary palindromes in the [[Best, worst and average case|worst case]]. In 1977, W. J. Paul&lt;ref name="Pa"/&gt; presented an incompressibility proof which showed that order &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; time is required in the average case. For every integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, consider all words of that length. For convenience, consider words with the middle third of the word consisting of 0s. The accepting Turing machine ends with an accept state on the left (the beginning of the tape). A Turing-machine computation of a given word gives for each location (the boundary between adjacent cells) a sequence of crossings from left to right and right to left, each crossing in a particular state of the finite control. Positions in the middle third of a candidate word all have a [[Crossing sequence (Turing machines)|crossing sequence]] of length &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; (with a total computation time of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;), or some position has a crossing sequence of &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt;. In the latter case, the word (if it is a [[palindrome]]) can be identified by that crossing sequence.

If other palindromes (ending in an accepting state on the left) have the same crossing sequence, the word (consisting of a prefix up to the position of the involved crossing sequence) of the original palindome [[Concatenation (mathematics)|concatenated]] with a suffix the remaining length of the other palindrome would be accepted as well. Taking the palindrome of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] described by &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt; bits is a contradiction.

Since the overwhelming majority of binary palindromes have a high Kolmogorov complexity, this gives a lower bound on the average-case [[Time complexity|running time]]. The result is much more difficult, and shows that Turing machines with &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; work tapes are more powerful than those with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; work tapes in [[real-time computing|real time]] (here one symbol per step).&lt;ref name="PSS"/&gt;

In 1984, W. Maass&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;[http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1985-292-02/S0002-9947-1985-0808746-4/ W. Maass, "Combinatorial lower bound arguments for deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines", ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 292 (1985), 675–693.]&lt;/ref&gt; and M. Li and  P. M. B. Vitanyi &lt;ref name="LVa"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089054018890003X M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Tape versus queue and stacks: The lower bounds", ''Information and Computation'', 78:1(1988), 56–85.]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the simulation of two work tapes by one work tape of a Turing machine takes &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministically]] (optimally, solving a 30-year [[open problem]]) and &lt;math&gt;\Omega (n^2/(\log n \log \log n))&lt;/math&gt; time nondeterministically &lt;ref name = "LVa"/&gt; (in,&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt; this is &lt;math&gt;\Omega (n^2/(\log^2 n \log \log n))&lt;/math&gt;. More results concerning tapes, [[Stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] and [[Queue (abstract data type)|queues]], deterministically and nondeterministically,&lt;ref name="LVa"/&gt; were proven with the incompressibiity method.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

===Theory of computation===
[[Heapsort]] is a sorting method, invented by J. W. J. Williams and refined by [[R. W. Floyd]], which always runs in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; time. It is questionable whether Floyd's method is better than Williams' on average, although it is better in the worst case. Using the incompressibility method, it was shown&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt; that Williams' method runs on average in &lt;math&gt;2n \log n +O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time and Floyd's method runs on average in &lt;math&gt;n\log n+O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time. The proof was suggested by [[Ian Munro (computer scientist)|Ian Munro]].

[[Shellsort]], discovered by [[Donald Shell]] in 1959, is a [[comparison sort]] which divides a list to be sorted into sublists and sorts them separately. The sorted sublists are then merged, reconstituting a partially-sorted list. This process repeats a number of times (the number of passes). The difficulty of analyzing the complexity of the sorting process is that it depends on the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of keys to be sorted, on the number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of passes and the increments governing the scattering in each pass; the sublist is the list of keys which are the increment parameter apart. Although this sorting method inspired a large number of papers, only the worst case was established. For the average running time, only the best case for a two-pass Shellsort&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Computer-Programming-Searching/dp/0201896850 D. E. Knuth, ''Sorting and Searching'' (Vol. 3 ''The Art of Computer Programming''), 2nd Ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998, pp 83–95.]&lt;/ref&gt; and an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;O(n^{23/15})&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9608105 S. Janson, D. E. Knuth, "Shellsort with three increments", ''Random Structures Algorithms'' 10:1–2(1997), 125–142.]&lt;/ref&gt; for a particular increment sequence for three-pass Shellsort were established. A general lower bound on an average &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-pass Shellsort was given&lt;ref name="JLV"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=355488  T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "A lower bound on the average-case complexity of Shellsort", ''Journal of the ACM (JACM)'', 47:5(2000) 905–911.]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first advance in this problem in four decades. In every pass, the comparison sort moves a key to another place a certain distance (a path length). All these path lengths are [[Logarithmic number system|logarithmically coded]] for length in the correct order (of passes and keys). This allows the reconstruction of the unsorted list from the sorted list. If the unsorted list is incompressible (or nearly so), since the sorted list has near-zero Kolmogorov complexity (and the path lengths together give a certain code length) the sum must be at least as large as the Kolmogorov complexity of the original list. The sum of the path lengths corresponds to the running time, and the running time is lower-bounded in this argument by &lt;math&gt;\Omega (pn^{1+1/p})&lt;/math&gt;. This was improved in &lt;ref&gt;P.M.B. Vitanyi (2018), On the average-case complexity of Shellsort, Random Structures and Algorithms, 52:2, 354--363&lt;/ref&gt; to a lower bound of 
:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega \left( n\sum_{k=1}^p h_{k-1}/h_k \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h_0=n&lt;/math&gt;. This implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitanyi lower bound for all &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences;
the Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by a lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^{23/15})&lt;/math&gt; inversions.

Another example is as follows. &lt;math&gt;n,r,s&lt;/math&gt; are natural numbers and &lt;math&gt;2 \log n \leq r,s \leq n/4&lt;/math&gt;, it was shown that for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[Logical matrix|Boolean]] &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix; every &lt;math&gt;s \times (n-r)&lt;/math&gt; submatrix has a [[Matrix rank|rank]] at least &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; by the incompressibility method.

===Logic===
According to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], in every formal system with computably enumerable theorems (or proofs) strong enough to contain [[Peano arithmetic]], there are true (but unprovable) statements or theorems. This is proved by the incompressibility method; every formal system &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be described finitely (for example, in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; bits). In such a formal system, we can express &lt;math&gt;K(x) \geq |x|&lt;/math&gt; since it contains arithmetic. Given &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, we can search exhaustively for a proof that some string &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n\gg f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;K(y) \geq n&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, we obtain the first such string; &lt;math&gt;K(y) \leq \log n+f&lt;/math&gt;: contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Information-Cambridge-Theoretical-Computer/dp/0521616042 G. J. Chaitin, ''Algorithmic Information Theory'', Cambridge University Press, 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other methods==
Although the [[probabilistic method]] generally shows the existence of an object with a certain property in a class, the incompressibility method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an incompressibility proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by incompressibility into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the incompressibility method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by incompressibility can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened in the case of the general lower bound on the running time of [[Shellsort]].&lt;ref name="JLV"/&gt;

Rogers College of Law''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.arizona.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; at the '''University of Arizona''' has created an academic center for the study of American Indian and indigenous peoples law, policy, and human rights. The '''Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program''' furthers the research, training, and advocacy of Indian law and [[international law]] of [[indigenous peoples]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.arizona.edu/indigenous-peoples-law-policy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002020918/http://www.law.arizona.edu/depts/iplp/index.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Courses and clinical opportunities are offered in areas of law and policy concerning indigenous peoples in the United States and around the world. What makes the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program at the University of Arizona Law (Arizona Law) unique is our approach to legal education in the field of federal Indian law, tribal law and policy, and indigenous peoples human rights. Students are trained in the classroom and in real-world settings by faculty who are leaders both in their academic fields and as practitioners in tribal, national, and international forums. Through clinical studies and direct advocacy under the supervision of the world's most distinguished scholars in the field, students and practitioners provide legal and other forms of assistance to local and international indigenous communities.  

The IPLP Program has been involved in numerous indigenous legal issues around the world. Students and professors in the IPLP Program have assisted Central American Maya villages that have filed lawsuits in the Belize Supreme Court alleging that both the attorney general of Belize and the minister of Natural Resources and Environment had violated their property rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://uanews.org/node/16401 and https://law.arizona.edu/maya-communities-southern-belize &lt;/ref&gt;  

Faculty and students of the IPLP Program have worked in coordination with other groups representing [[Carrie Dann]] and recently deceased [[Mary Dann]], who have struggled against the federal government for decades over [[Western Shoshone]] territory, in precedent-setting proceedings before the Organization of American States' [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and the United Nations [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]]. It culminated with the Inter-American Commission issuing a report in which it condemned the United States for violating the Dann sisters' human rights. &lt;ref&gt;https://law.arizona.edu/western-shoshone&lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition, IPLP Program personnel and affiliates have worked with the people of [[Awas Tingni]], a Mayangna (Sumo) indigenous community located on the Atlantic Coast in Nicaragua, for many years with the landmark case decided by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], Mayagna (Sumo) Community of Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua. After a lengthy legal battle, the community successfully gained legal recognition of its customary land tenure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.arizona.edu/awas-tingni |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://law.arizona.edu/awas-tingni |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latrell Fontaine Sprewell''' (born September 8, 1970) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player; he played for the [[Golden State Warriors]], the [[New York Knicks]],  and the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. During his time as a professional, Sprewell was named to the yearly [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] All-Star game four times; he also helped the Knicks reach the [[NBA Finals]] and the Timberwolves the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals. Despite his accomplishments, his career was overshadowed by a 1997 incident in which he choked coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a practice, which ultimately resulted in a 68-game suspension.

Sprewell's career came to an unexpected end in 2005 when he refused a $21-million three-year contract offer from the Timberwolves, which Sprewell implied would not be enough to feed his children. The Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Since that time, he has made headlines for grounding his million-dollar yacht and subsequently having it repossessed for missed payments, having two of his homes foreclosed upon, and being prohibited from seeing his children.&lt;ref name="Ostler"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/08/23/SPGT3RNR151.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Scott | last=Ostler | title=Captain Spree should remain a landlubber | date=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NBA career==

===Golden State Warriors===
After attending [[Washington High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Washington High School]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Sprewell played competitively with the [[Three Rivers Community College (Missouri)|Three Rivers Community College]] Raiders Basketball Team in [[Poplar Bluff, Missouri]] from 1988&amp;ndash;1990, and from 1990&amp;ndash;1992 with the [[University of Alabama]], where he was a teammate of future NBA players [[Robert Horry]], [[Jason Caffey]] and [[James Robinson (basketball)|James Robinson]].

He was selected 24th overall in the [[1992 NBA draft]] by the [[1992–93 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. Sprewell, nicknamed "Spree", made an immediate impact, starting 69 of the 77 games he played in during his rookie season and averaging 15.4 points per game. His performance would improve over the next few years, leading the team in scoring and playing for the Western Conference All-Star team in 1994, 1995, and 1997, scoring 24.2 ppg in 1996–97, fifth in the league. Additionally, in 1993–1994 he led the league in games played and minutes per game as the Warriors, led by Sprewell and NBA Rookie of the year [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Chris Webber]], made it back to the [[1994 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. They would, however, lose in the first round to the [[1993–94 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in three games.

====1997 choking incident====
Though a four-time All-Star, a significant blemish on Sprewell's career was an incident that took place on December 1, 1997, when he attacked head coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a Warriors practice. When Carlesimo yelled at Sprewell to make crisper passes (specifically asking him to "put a little mustard" on a pass),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Sonics set to make Spurs assistant Carlesimo coach |url=http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/10245270 |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=July 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212024621/http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/10245270 |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell responded that he was not in the mood for criticism and told the coach to keep his distance. When Carlesimo approached, Sprewell threatened to kill him and dragged him backwards by his throat, choking him for 7–10 seconds before his teammates and assistant coaches pulled Sprewell off his coach. Sprewell returned about 20 minutes later after showering and changing and again accosted Carlesimo. He landed a glancing blow at Carlesimo's right cheek before being dragged away again by the assistant coaches.  It was not his first violent incident with the Warriors; in 1995, Sprewell fought with teammate [[Jerome Kersey]] and returned to practice carrying a [[dimensional lumber|two-by-four]], and reportedly threatened to return with a gun.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; In a 1993 practice, Sprewell fought with [[Byron Houston]], who was 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell and had what many teammates describe as having a Mike Tyson-like demeanor and physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1011658/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=December 15, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprewell was suspended for 10 games without pay. However, the next day, in the wake of a public uproar, the Warriors voided the remainder of his contract altogether, which included $23.7 million over three years, and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] suspended him for one year. Sprewell took the case to [[arbitration]] and the contract voiding was overturned, but the league did suspend him for the rest of the season without pay, which amounted to 68 games. He sought to vacate the arbitration contract under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. His case went through all appeals, and was remanded. During the time he was serving his suspension from the NBA, Sprewell was charged with [[reckless driving]] for his role in a 90-mile-per-hour accident that injured two people. He spent three months under house arrest as part of a no-contest plea.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AP, March 18, 1998; AP, July 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Knicks===
Due to the [[1998–99 NBA season|NBA lockout]], Sprewell did not play again until February 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/38835785.html?dids=38835785:38835785&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+06%2C+1999&amp;author=Associated+Press&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=SPREWELL+CAN'T+SAVE+KNICKS+MAGIC+WIN+OPENER%3B+CAMBY%3A+10+SECONDS&amp;pqatl=google "Sprewell can't save Knicks"]. [[Associated Press]]. February 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; after the Warriors traded him to the [[1998–99 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]], [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] and [[Terry Cummings]].  Sprewell played 37 games for the Knicks that season, playing off the bench in all but four games.

Many pundits felt that signing the volatile Sprewell was too big a gamble for the Knicks to take, but Sprewell himself vowed he was a changed man. The Knicks, who at the time still revolved around veteran All-Star [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Patrick Ewing]], narrowly qualified for the [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999 playoffs]], making the field as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks navigated past the [[1998–99 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], [[1998–99 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]] and finally the [[1998–99 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]], making it as the first eighth seed in NBA history to the [[1999 NBA Finals]], where they met the [[1998–99 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], who beat them in five games although Sprewell enjoyed a good series for the most part, averaging 26.0 ppg. He tallied 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Knicks' 78-77 Game 5 loss, and was subsequently featured on the cover of the September 1999 issue of ''[[SLAM Magazine]]''.

Sprewell moved into the Knicks' starting lineup for the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000 season]] at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, helping the Knicks to a 50-32 record good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference led by Sprewell, Ewing and [[shooting guard]] [[Allan Houston]].  The Knicks navigated past the [[1999–2000 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] in three hard-fought games and the [[1999–2000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern Conference Finals against the [[1999–2000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. But their quest for back-to-back NBA Finals appearances came to an end when they were defeated by the Pacers in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Sprewell averaged 19.7 ppg in the series, and the Knicks gave him a five-year/$62 million contract extension.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

The [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01 season]] saw Sprewell step up as the Knicks' leader with Ewing traded to the [[2000–01 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], making his only All-Star appearance for the Knicks that year, scoring 17.7 points off the bench. However, despite another impressive season from Sprewell the Knicks would lose in the first round to the [[2000–01 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] in five games in those [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001 playoffs]].  In [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02]] Sprewell averaged 19.4 ppg, including 49 points in a game against the [[2001–02 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]], one of three times he scored 40 or more points that season; but it was not enough as the Knicks would miss the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time in 15 years.

Prior to the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]], Sprewell reported to training camp with a broken hand, which he claimed occurred when he slipped on his yacht; the Knicks fined him a record $250,000 for failing to report the incident to them. He then sued the ''[[New York Post]]'' for claiming he had broken his hand in a fight.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Sprewell_Latrell.html ESPN Classic - Sprewell's Image Remains in a Chokehold&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell ultimately lost the lawsuit against the ''New York Post''.

That season, Sprewell made NBA history as he hit 9 of 9 three-point shots in one game, making the most three pointers without a single miss for the first time en route to a season-high 38 points versus the [[2002–03 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]]. The record has since been tied by then-[[Chicago Bulls]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and broken by Nuggets guard [[Ty Lawson]], who made 10 threes without missing in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After that season, in which the Knicks missed the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row, Sprewell was traded to the [[2003–04 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]] in a four-team trade involving [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Terrell Brandon]].

===Minnesota Timberwolves===

In the [[2003–2004 NBA season|2003–04 season]], Sprewell became part of the league's highest-scoring trio alongside superstar [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[point guard]] [[Sam Cassell]]. With a 58-24 record, the Timberwolves qualified for the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004 playoffs]] as the top seed in the Western Conference. They navigated past the [[2003–04 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in five games, and [[2003–04 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]] in seven, in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals they met the [[2003–04 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], who defeated them in six games thanks to miracle shooting by Laker superstar off-guard [[Kobe Bryant]], still the only appearance by the Timberwolves in the conference finals.  Sprewell finished third in team scoring at 16.8 ppg, behind Garnett's 24.2 and Cassell's 19.8.

On October 31, 2004, the [[2004–05 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]] offered Sprewell a three-year, $21 million contract extension, substantially less than what his then-current contract paid him. Claiming to feel insulted by the offer he publicly expressed outrage, declaring, "I have a family to feed." He declined the extension and the Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Having once more drawn the ire of fans and sports media, Sprewell had the worst season of his career in the final year of his contract. In the summer of 2005, the [[2005–06 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], [[2005–06 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[2005–06 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] all expressed interest in signing Sprewell, but none ended up signing him.

One month into the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]] and without a contract, Sprewell's agent, Bob Gist, said his client would rather retire than play for the NBA minimum salary, telling ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', "Latrell doesn't need the money that badly. To go from being offered $7 million to taking $1 million, that would be a slap in the face." Several days later, Gist said that Sprewell planned to wait until "teams get desperate" around the [[trade deadline]] in February, and then sign with a contending team -an eventuality that never materialized for him. Gist said that Sprewell would not be interested in signing for any team's $5 million [[NBA Salary Cap#Mid-level exception|mid-level exception]], calling that amount "a level beneath which [Sprewell] would not stoop or kneel!"

In March 2006, Sprewell was offered contracts by the [[2005–06 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] and [[2005–06 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], both of whom were considered at the time to be strong favorites to win the [[NBA Finals|NBA Championship]], but Sprewell failed to respond and remained a free agent as the season came to a close. The [[2005–06 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] also showed minimal interest in him at the start of that season, but nothing ever came of it.

Over the course of his career, Sprewell started 868 of the 913 games he played in, averaging 18.8 ppg, 4.2 apg and 4.1 rpg with playoff career averages of 19.7 ppg, 3.4 apg and 4.3 rpg. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team at the end of his second season, and to the All-NBA Defensive second team that same year.

==Personal life==
Sprewell's personal life since he last played in the NBA has been plagued with controversy and financial trouble. In 1994, his four-year-old daughter was attacked by his pet [[pit bull]] and bitten in her nose, lips, forehead and one ear, requiring surgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-27/sports/9410270221_1_bitten-pet-dog-candace-cabbil&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier, while attending junior college, Sprewell had been arrested for stealing.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/1094/new-york-magazine-on-latrell-sprewell-in-1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he appeared in a Priceline.com television advertisement, poking fun at himself.

===Relationships===
On August 30, 2006, [[Milwaukee]] police investigated a claim by a 21-year-old female who claimed that she and Sprewell were having consensual sex aboard his {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Yacht|yacht]], named ''Milwaukee's Best'', when Sprewell began to strangle her. Police allegedly observed red marks on her neck. Police investigating the allegation searched Sprewell's yacht for evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Purvis and Charles Gardner |title=Sprewell questioned in alleged assault |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=8/30/2006&amp;id=10707 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]   |date=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, police declined to press charges. Sprewell then sought a restraining order along with "civil remedies" against the accuser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Purvis |title=No charges against Sprewell |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=9/6/2006&amp;id=11009 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2007, Sprewell's long-term companion sued him for $200 million for ending their relationship agreement. She claimed Sprewell agreed to support her and their four children through college.&lt;ref name='Ostler'/&gt;

===Property===

On August 22, 2007, it was reported by multiple news agencies that Sprewell's yacht was repossessed by federal marshals after failing to continue paying for and insuring the vessel, for which he reportedly still owed approximately $1.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. marshal seizes Sprewell's $1.5M yacht |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20396558/ |work=[[msnbc.com]] |date=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while piloted by Sprewell, the yacht ran ashore near Atwater Beach, just north of Milwaukee. Sprewell refused to contract with a professional salvage firm to remove the yacht, which was eventually freed with the help of a local fishing vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erin Richards |title=Sprewell's yacht freed |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=482234 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 the yacht was auctioned for $856,000 after Sprewell defaulted on a $1.5 million mortgage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Doege |title=Sprewell yacht sold at auction |url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2008/02/11/newscolumn2.html?jst=pn_pn_lk |work=The Business Journal of Milwaukee |date=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three months later a Milwaukee area home owned by Sprewell went into [[foreclosure]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Marie Rohde |title=Latrell Sprewell's home foreclosed |url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/proofandhearsay/archive/2008/05/12/latrell-sprewell-s-home-foreclosed.aspx |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between September 2007 and January 2008, according to documents, Sprewell had failed to make mortgage payments of $2,593 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Ex-NBA star Latrell Sprewell $1.5 million yacht, home could be foreclosed |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3241444 |work=[[ESPN NBA]] |date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 a Westchester mansion owned by Sprewell went into foreclosure status,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Westchester Supreme Court Index No. 09-16447&lt;/ref&gt; but that action was dismissed on motion of another party's attorney, Roger K. Marion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

[[File:Majestic Liberty Large.jpg|thumb|right|''Liberty Enlightening the World'', known as the [[Statue of Liberty]], was donated to the US by France and is an artistic personification of liberty.]]
Broadly speaking, '''liberty''' ([[Latin]]: ''Libertas'') is the ability to do as one pleases.&lt;ref&gt;The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2005, Merriam-Webster, Inc, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-636-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In politics, liberty consists of the social, political, and economic freedoms to which all community members are entitled.&lt;ref&gt;"Each of those social and political freedoms which are considered to be the entitlement of all members of a community; a civil liberty." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy, liberty involves [[free will]] as contrasted with, [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The fact of not being controlled by or subject to fate; freedom of will." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[theology]], liberty is freedom from the effects of "sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties."&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom from the bondage or dominating influence of sin, spiritual servitude, worldly ties." ''Oxford English Dictionary''.[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107898?rskey=Fm0VI1&amp;result=1#eid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word "freedom" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.&lt;ref name=mill1&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869)., "Chapter I: Introductory", ''On Liberty''. http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus liberty entails the [[duty|responsible]] use of freedom under the [[rule of law]] without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Freedom is more broad in that it represents a total lack of restraint or the unrestrained ability to fulfill one's desires. For example, a person can have the freedom to murder, but not have the liberty to murder, as the latter example deprives others of their right not to be harmed.  Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.

The word "liberty" is often used in slogans, such as "[[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]"&lt;ref&gt;The Declaration of Independence, ''The World Almanac'', 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-60057-201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://franceintheus.org/spip.php?article620&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Free will}}
Philosophers from earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (121–180 AD) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, "Meditations", Book I, Wordsworth Classics of World Literature, {{ISBN|1853264865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679):&lt;blockquote&gt;"a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Part 2, Ch. XXI).&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke:

:"In the state of nature, liberty consists of being free from any superior power on Earth. People are not under the will or lawmaking authority of others but have only the law of nature for their rule. In political society, liberty consists of being under no other lawmaking power except that established by consent in the commonwealth. People are free from the dominion of any will or legal restraint apart from that enacted by their own constituted lawmaking power according to the trust put in it. Thus, freedom is not as Sir Robert Filmer defines it: 'A liberty for everyone to do what he likes, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.' Freedom is constrained by laws in both the state of nature and political society. Freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. Freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it. Persons have a right or liberty to (1) follow their own will in all things that the law has not prohibited and (2) not be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, and arbitrary wills of others."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Two Treatises on Government]]: A Translation into Modern English'', ISR, 2009, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|[[John Stuart Mill]].]]

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873), in his work, ''[[On Liberty]]'', was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;Westbrooks, Logan Hart (2008) "Personal Freedom" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gxaa371USUC&amp;pg=PA134 p. 134] ''In'' Owens, William (compiler) (2008) ''Freedom: Keys to Freedom from Twenty-one National Leaders'' Main Street Publications, Memphis, Tennessee, p3–38, {{ISBN|978-0-9801152-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]'', [[Isaiah Berlin]] formally framed the differences between these two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: [[positive liberty]] and [[negative liberty]]. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from [[tyranny]] and the [[arbitrary]] exercise of [[authority]], while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear.

The modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Junius P. (2007) ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A–K'' ; Vol. II, L–Z,&lt;/ref&gt; To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes).&lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen, 2010, Democratic Freedom and the Concept of Freedom in Plato and Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt; That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it:

:"This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

This applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mikalson|first=Jon|title=Ancient Greek Religion|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405181778|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o6xxlwbldcC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=ancient+Greece+++rights+women&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20Greece%20%20%20rights%20women|edition=2nd|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all [[religion]]s and [[ethnic group]]s were given the same rights and had the same [[freedom of religion]], women had the same rights as men, and [[slavery]] was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Henry Robertson, John Graham Merrills (1996). ''Human Rights in the World: An Introduction to the Study of the International Protection of Human Rights''. [[Manchester University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-7190-4923-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]], citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and [[equality before the law|equality]]. The need for tolerance on an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] basis can be found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts]] of [[Ashoka the Great]], which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amartya Sen]] (1997). ''Human Rights and Asian Values''. {{ISBN|0-87641-151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Indica (Arrian)|Indica]]'':
&lt;br&gt;{{quote|"This also is remarkable in [[History of India|India]], that all Indians are free, and no Indian at all is a slave. In this the Indians agree with the [[Lacedaemonian]]s. Yet the Lacedaemonians have [[Helot]]s for slaves, who perform the duties of slaves; but the Indians have no slaves at all, much less is any Indian a slave."}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, "Ashoka's orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund (2004).

[[Roman law]] also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]].  Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the [[nobility]], rarely by the common man.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

=== Social contract ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Eugène Delacroix]] – ''[[Liberty Leading the People|Liberty Leading the People (La liberté guidant le people)]]'' (1830)]]
[[File:French-Liberty-British-Slavery-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''French Liberty. British Slavery'' (1792), [[James Gillray]] caricatured French "liberty" as the opportunity to starve and British "slavery" as bloated complaints about taxation.]]
The [[social contract]] theory, most influentially formulated by [[Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Rousseau]] (though first suggested by Plato in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''), was among the first to provide a political classification of [[rights]], in particular through the notion of [[sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]]. The thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[logic|reasoned]] that [[law]] governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the [[monarch|king]] his power, rather than the king's power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of [[Montesquieu]]. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on [[individualism|individual liberty]] as a fundamental reality, given by "[[Nature]] and [[God|Nature's God]]," which, in the [[utopia|ideal state]], would be as universal as possible.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'', [[John Stuart Mill]] sought to define the "...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual," and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes "how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control".&lt;ref name=mill1 /&gt;

==Origins of political freedom==

=== England and Great Britain ===
England and following the [[Act of Union 1707]] Great Britain, laid down the cornerstones to the concept of individual liberty.

In 1166 [[Henry II of England]] transformed English law by passing the [[Assize of Clarendon]] act. The act, a forerunner to trial by jury, started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Human Rights|url=https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/history-human-rights|publisher=Liberty|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215 the [[Magna Carta]] was drawn up, it became the cornerstone of liberty in first England, Great Britain and later, the world.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}}

In 1689 the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] grants 'freedom of speech in Parliament', which lays out some of the earliest [[civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher=British Library|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled ''[[On Liberty]]'' argues for toleration and individuality. ''If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1859 |title= On Liberty |publisher=John W.Parker &amp; Son |place=London |edition= 2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AjpGAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AHMraC_Owoi8C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1864 |title= On Liberty |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman Roberts &amp; Green |place=London |edition= 3 |url= https://archive.org/details/onliberty00inmill |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]'', by [[Isaiah Berlin]], determines 'negative liberty' as an obstacle, as evident from 'positive liberty' which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Ian|title=''Positive and Negative Liberty''|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/|date=5 March 2012|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 British representatives attempt to and are prevented from adding a legal framework to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. (It was not until 1976 that the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Final authorized text''|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/universal-declaration-of-human-rights|date=September 1952|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

According to the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], all men have a natural right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the presence of slavery.  Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount, since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize.  The Supreme Court, in the [[Dred Scott]] decision, upheld this principle.  It was not until 1866, following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], that the US Constitution was amended to extend these rights to persons of color, and not until 1920 that these rights were extended to women.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of the United States of America, ''The World Almanac and book of facts'' (2012), pp. 485–86, Amendment XIV "Citizenship Rights not to be abridged.", Amendment XV "Race no bar to voting rights.", Amendment XIX, "Giving nationwide suffrage to women.". World Almanac Books, {{ISBN|978-1-60057-147-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices.  In the United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold v. Connecticut''. 381 U.S. 479 (1965) Decided June 7, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle:
{{quote|I am grateful that I have rights in the proverbial public square – but, as a practical matter, my most cherished rights are those that I possess in my bedroom and hospital room and death chamber. Most people are far more concerned that they can control their own bodies than they are about petitioning Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/a-culture-of-liberty_b_242402.html|title=A Culture of Liberty|date=21 July 2009|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty.  [[Liberalism|Liberals]] in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom.  [[Progressive Era|Progressives]] stress freedom from business monopoly as essential.  [[Libertarian]]s disagree, and see economic freedom as best.  The [[Tea Party movement]] sees big government as the enemy of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capitol Reader|title=Summary of Give Us Liberty: A Tea Party Manifesto – Dick Armey and Matt Kibbe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuxEfI9GwcC&amp;pg=PP9|date=21 June 2013|publisher=Primento|isbn=978-2-511-00084-7|pages=9–10}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |last=Haidt |first=Jonathan |date=16 October 2010 |title=What the Tea Partiers Really Want |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703673604575550243700895762 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc |access-date=17 March 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald P.

=== France ===
France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, [[French Revolution|overthrew]] their own monarchy, with the cry of "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".  The bloodbath that followed, known as the [[reign of terror]], soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of [[conservatism]], wrote "The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. C. D., ''Edmund Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in France: a Critical Edition'', 2001, Stanford. pp. 66–67, {{ISBN|0-8047-3923-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

=== Liberalism ===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
According to the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', liberalism is "the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize [[freedom of choice]]".  But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals.  Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration.  Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return.  This idea of freedom is personal rather than political.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 1990, {{ISBN|1-56584-589-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective.&lt;ref&gt;William Safire, ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', "Liberalism takes criticism from both the right and the left,...", p. 388, Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19534334-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarianism ===
{{Main|Libertarianism|Minarchism|Libertarian Socialism|Anarcho-capitalism}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Libertarians]] hold liberty as their primary political value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libertarianism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339321/libertarianism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2014-05-20|quote=libertarianism, political philosophy that takes individual liberty to be the primary political value}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.&lt;ref&gt;David Kelley, "Life, liberty, and property." ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' (1984) 1#2 pp. 108–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Republican liberty ===
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
According to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian [[Quentin Skinner]]&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, contributor and co-editor, ''Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Volume I: Republicanism and Constitutionalism in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-67235-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quentil Skinner, contributor and co-editor, ''Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Volume II:  The Values of Republicanism in Early Modern Europe'' Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-67234-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the philosopher [[Philip Pettit]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pettit, ''Republicanism: a theory of freedom and government'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; one's liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one's actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], to be a ''liber homo'', a free man, means not being subject to another's arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite [[Machiavelli]] who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli, ''Discourses on Livy'', Harvey C. Mansfield &amp; Nathan Tarcov, translators, University of Chicago Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-226-50036-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the [[English Civil War]] resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes' [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Socialism ===
{{Main|Socialism}}
{{Socialism sidebar}}
Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhargava|first= Rajeev |title= Political Theory: An Introduction |publisher= Pearson Education India|date=2008|isbn=|page = 255|quote=Genuine freedom as Marx described it, would become possible only when life activity was no longer constrained by the requirements of production or by the limitations of material scarcity…Thus, in the socialist view, freedom is not an abstract ideal but a concrete situation that ensues only when certain conditions of interaction between man and nature (material conditions), and man and other men (social relations) are fulfilled.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where "alienated labor" refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodwin|first= Barbara |title= Using Political Ideas |publisher= Wiley|date=2007|isbn=978-0470025529|pages = 107–09|quote=Socialists consider the pleasures of creation equal, if not superior, to those of acquisition and consumption, hence the importance of work in socialist society.  Whereas the capitalist/Calvinist work ethic applauds the moral virtue of hard work, idealistic socialists emphasize the joy. This vision of 'creative man', Homo Faber, has consequences for their view of freedom...Socialist freedom is the freedom to unfold and develop one's potential, especially through unalienated work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marxism ====
{{Main|Marxism}}
For Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a [[communist society]] characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx's emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the "realm of freedom", or discretionary free time, for each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wood|first= John Cunningham |title= Karl Marx's Economics: Critical Assessments I |publisher= Routledge|date=1996|isbn=978-0415087148|pages = 248–49|quote=Affluence and increased provision of free goods would reduce alienation in the work process and, in combination with (1), the alienation of man's 'species-life'. Greater leisure would create opportunities for creative and artistic activity outside of work.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Peffer|first= Rodney G. |title= Marxism, Morality, and Social Justice |publisher= Princeton University Press|date=2014|isbn= 9780691608884|page = 73|quote= Marx believed the reduction of necessary labor time to be, evaluatively speaking, an absolute necessity. He claims that real wealth is the developed productive force of all individuals. It is no longer the labor time but the disposable time that is the measure of wealth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: "A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed. It would instead be a society in which individuals freely act as the truly human individuals they are. Marx's radical communism was, in this way, also radically individualistic."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural prerequisites==
Some authors have suggested that a virtuous culture must exist as a prerequisite for liberty. Benjamin Franklin stated that "only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of Benjamin Franklin 569 (Albert H. Smyth ed., 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Madison likewise declared: "To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of James Madison 223 (Gaillard Hunt ed., 1904).&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams acknowledged: "Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Howe, Jr., The Changing Political Thought of John Adams 165 (1966) (quoting from John Adams' "Reply to the Massachusetts Militia," Oct. 11, 1789).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">[[Short-term memory]] for learned associations has been studied using the '''match-to-sample task''' (and the related '''delayed match-to-sample task''', and '''non-match to sample task'''). The basic procedure begins by presenting a subject with a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] (often a light of a particular color, or a visual pattern) that they will be required to remember, known as the 'sample'. They are then required to identify from a subsequent set of stimuli one that 'matches' the sample, known as the comparison stimuli. While the correct comparison stimulus option often matches the sample identically, the task can require a symbolic match or a matching of similar features (e.g. similar in color or shape).&lt;ref name="Mazur, J.

One comparison stimulus matches the sample (either because it is an identical color, or because the animal has learned an association such as green means left) and the other does not match. If it chooses (pecks) the matching comparison, then it is rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;("Models of Learning and Performance." Dr. Robert Cook's Homepage | Department of Psychology, Tufts University.

A more complex version of the task has formed the basis for human-centered cognitive test batteries since the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Englund, C. E., Reeves, D. L., Shingledecker, C. A., Thorne, D. R., &amp; Wilson, K. P. (1987). Unified Tri-Service Cognitive Performance Assessment Battery (UTC-PAB). 1. Design and Specification of the Battery. Retrieved from http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA182480&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perez, W. A., Masline, P. J., Ramsey, E. G., &amp; Urban, K. E. (1987). Unified Tri-Services Cognitive Performance Assessment Battery: Review and Methodology. Retrieved from http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA181697&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the task involves a 4X4 matrix pattern that is filled with yellow and red squares. Participants are allotted a specific amount of time to study the first pattern that appears on the screen. After the first pattern disappears, it is then replaced by a pair of matrices. One of these is the same as the previously viewed stimulus and one differs by one or more cells of the matrix. The participant then indicates which of the two was the presented stimulus. One trial of this tasks takes approximately 5–10 seconds.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
The strengths of this procedure are that participants have a limited time to think, so if they are more aware/alert, they should make more correct responses. It has also been hypothesized to be impacted by alertness, but resilient to practice effects.

==Sleep deprivation==
The match-to-sample task has been shown to be an effective tool to understand the impact of sleep deprivation on short-term memory. One research study&lt;ref&gt;Elsmore, T. F. (1995). A comparison of the effects of sleep deprivation on synthetic work performance and a conventional performance assessment battery. San Diego, Calif.: Naval Health Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt; compared performance on a traditional sequential test battery with that on a synthetic work task requiring subjects to work concurrently on several tasks, testing subjects every three hours during 64 hrs of [[sleep deprivation]]. Similarly, another study&lt;ref&gt;Habeck C, Rakitin BC, Moeller J, Scarmeas N, Zarahn E, Brown T, Stern Y. (2005). Brain research. Cognitive brain research&lt;/ref&gt; used an event-related [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] of the [[biological neural network|neural network]]s underlying the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval phase in the task. This test was used to discover the reduction in pattern expressions with sleep deprivation for each subject and how it related to the change in performance on the delayed-match-to-sample task. It also expanded the prefrontal areas regarding [[working memory]] and revealed substantial individual differences in performance. The test also reproduced findings of other working memory studies which demonstrated interactions between PFC and other parts of the brain.

==Delayed match-to-sample tasks and working memory==
The Delayed match-to-sample procedure is a slightly more complex variation of the task. In this case there is a time delay between the presentation of the sample and the comparison stimuli. By varying the length of the delay we can gain insight into how long the subject can retain information in their [[working memory]]. We can also use the delay to identify the extent to which modifying or adding new stimuli affects the performance of working memory in the subject. This is known as 'interference' and can come in two forms ; retroactive (following the presentation of the sample) or proactive (prior to the presentation of the sample).&lt;ref name="Mazur, J.

'''Mūla Bandha''' is a Sanskrit (मूल बंध) compound term:  ''Mūla'' denotes "[[:wikt:root|root]]", "[[:wikt:base|base]]",&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.515&lt;/ref&gt; "[[:wikt:beginning|beginning]]", "[[:wikt:foundation|foundation]]",&lt;ref name="Iyengar, 1976: p.459"&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.459&lt;/ref&gt; "origin or cause", "[[:wikt:basis|basis]]", "[[:wikt:source|source]]";&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.437&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bandha'' denotes "[[:wikt:bondage|bondage]]", "[[:wikt:fetter|fetter]]",&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.525&lt;/ref&gt; "posture",&lt;ref name="Iyengar, 1976: p.459"/&gt; "joining together", "catching hold of".&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.436&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. K. S. Iyengar|Iyengar]] (1976: p.&amp;nbsp;525) defines Mūla Bandha as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A posture where the body from the [[anus]] to the [[navel]] is contracted and lifted up and towards the spine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is qualified in that the actual muscle contracted is not the [[sphincter]] muscle nor the muscle which cessates urination, but [[Transverse perineal muscles|the muscle equidistant between the two]]. 

Maehle (2007: p.&amp;nbsp;11) defines it as "root lock" and further specifies that:

{{quote|The root referred to here is the root of the spine, the [[pelvic floor]] or, more precisely, the centre of the pelvic floor, the [[perineum]].  The perineum is the muscular body between the anus and the genitals. By slightly  contracting the [[pubococcygeus muscle|pubo-coccygeal (PC) muscle]], which goes from the pubic bone to the tail bone (coccyx), we create an energetic seal that locks ''prana'' into the body and so prevents it from leaking out at the base of the spine.  ''Mula Bandha'' is said to move ''prana'' into the central channel, called ''sushumna'', which is the subtle equivalent of the spine.|&lt;ref&gt;Maehle, Gregor (2007). ''Ashtanga Yoga: Practice and Philosophy'' (Paperback).  New World Library. {{ISBN|1-57731-606-1}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-1-57731-606-0}}, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mūla Bandha is the principal, key and primary Bandha of the [[Yoga|Yogic traditions]]. Mūla Bandha is essential to all safe, grounded workings of [[bodymind]] disciplines. This Bandha in and of itself conditions the [[Muladhara]] [[Chakra]], simultaneously keening, rooting and engaging the systemic [[:wikt:plethora|plethora]] of processes that constitute [[bodymind]] and with diligence resolving them in discipline and accord. Mūla Bandha should be held as a restraint only after [[kumbhaka]], which in this instance is where the breath is expressed in its entirety and held outside the body.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.435&lt;/ref&gt; Iyengar (1976: p.&amp;nbsp;435) likens the functionality of the [[Bandha (Yoga)|Bandha]] and especially Mūla Bandha to "safety-valves which should be kept shut during the practice of kumbhakas".

Iyengar (1976:  p.&amp;nbsp;437) specifies the energetic prāṇas of [[vayu|Vāyu]] engaged through Mūla Bandha as: "...[[Apāna Vāyu]] (the prāṇa in the lower abdomen), whose course is downwards, is made to flow up to unite with [[Prāna Vāyu]], which has its seat within the region of the chest."

Iyengar (1976:  p.&amp;nbsp;437) cautions that:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
Mūla Bandha should be attempted first in antara kumbhaka (retention after inhalation). The region of the lower abdomen between the navel and the anus is contracted towards the spine and pulled up to the diaphragm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Iyengar (1976:  p.&amp;nbsp;437) states that:  "While practicing Mūla Bandha, the yogi attempts to reach the true source or mūla of creation."

==Text==

Music, When Soft Voices Die

Music, when soft voices die,&lt;br /&gt;
Vibrates in the memory;&lt;br /&gt;
Odours, when sweet violets sicken,&lt;br /&gt;
Live within the sense they quicken.

Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,&lt;br /&gt;
Are heap'd for the belovèd's bed;&lt;br /&gt;
And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,&lt;br /&gt;
Love itself shall slumber on.

==Summary==

The poem was published as "To---" in 1824 under Miscellaneous Poems in two stanzas of four couplets each containing four lines in ''Posthumous Poems''.

The theme of the poem is the endurance of the memories of events and of sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Raymond D. "Structure and Prosodic Pattern in Shelley's Lyrics". ''PMLA'', Vol. 65, No. 6 (December 1950), pp. 1076–1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Shelley edited the poems and wrote the preface to the collection. She described the poems: "Many of the Miscellaneous Poems, written on the spur of the occasion, and never retouched, I found among his manuscript books, and have carefully copied: I have subjoined, whenever I have been able, the date of their composition."&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe.

==Musical compositions==

Many composers and musicians have set the poem to music with vocal accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=14938 |title=Vocal settings of "Music, when soft voices die" |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the composers are [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] as a three-part song in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtgiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1060&amp;lpg=PA1060&amp;dq=music+when+soft+voices+die+charles+wood+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Nd-dcw1Nr&amp;sig=xJ-pM5elz9cARNGG9oIQaQxrFEM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u-wqT7PtDMiIsQLVzviSDg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20when%20soft%20voices%20die%20charles%20wood%201914&amp;f=false |title=Catalog of Copyright Entires, U.S. Library of Congress |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Bridge]], for mixed chorus a capella, in 1904, [[Eric Nelson (musician)|Eric Nelson]] in 1999, Canadian composer Stephen Chatman, as a part of his set "There Is Sweet Music Here," in 1993, Sir Charles [[Hubert Parry]] in 1897, Three Songs, Opus 12, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rvwsociety.com/workschoral.html |title=Ralph Vaughan Williams Society |publisher=Rvwsociety.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051430/http://www.rvwsociety.com/workschoral.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Taneyev]], Opus 17, No. 3, ''Pust' otsvuchit'', in 1905, [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] for mixed chorus in 1907, [[Peter Warlock]] in 1911 (two versions), [[Liza Lehmann]] for voice and piano, [[Henry Cowell]] in 1922, [[Jack Gibbons]], Opus 17, [[Samuel Barber]], for piano and voice in 1926, [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]], [[Quincy Porter]] in 1947, [[Roger Quilter]], for voice and piano, Opus 25, No. 5, in 1927, [[John Harbison]] for SATB choir and organ or harpsichord in 1966, Julie Knowles for SSA chorus and piano in 1982, Victor C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">The '''Obfuscated Perl Contest''' was a competition for programmers of [[Perl]] which was held annually between 1996 and 2000.  Entrants to the competition aimed to write "devious, inhuman, disgusting, amusing, amazing, and bizarre Perl code".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol3_2/tpj0302-0012.html The 3rd Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest] Felix Gallo - Perl Journal (You may need to subscribe to the Perl Journal to be able to view this link, which is the source of the quote given.)&lt;/ref&gt; It was run by ''The Perl Journal'' and took its name from the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=256|title=[[Advanced Perl Programming]]|author=Simon Cozens|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2005|isbn=9780596004569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contest==
The entries were judged on aesthetics, output and incomprehensibility. One entrant per year received the ''Best of Show'' award.
Entrants were advised to try and demonstrate a range of Perl knowledge, while being humorous, surprising and deceitful. Code which purposely crashed the judges' machines was discouraged.

The competition was typically divided into four categories, which, in the last&lt;!-- really last? --&gt; contest, included:
* Create a Diversion (limit of 2048 bytes if using Perl/Tk, 512 bytes otherwise)
* World Wide Wasteland (limit of 512 bytes)
* Inner Beauty (limit of 512 bytes)
* Best ''The Perl Journal'' (code which generated the words ''The Perl Journal'', limit of 256 bytes)

The '''Open Christmas Letter''' was a public message for [[peace]] addressed "To the Women of Germany and Austria",&lt;ref name=Oldfield46&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; signed by a group of 101 British [[Women's suffrage|suffragists]]&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, 2008, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of the [[First World War]] approached. The Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to American feminist [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], the president of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in ''Jus Suffragii'', the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were [[Pacifism|pacifists]]. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared, [[Women's suffrage|suffrage for women]].

The decision by some suffragists to speak out against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favour of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would think more highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organisations or with refugee aid societies. Nearly all suffragists agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war partial suffrage was granted, for property-holding women aged 30 and over.

==Background==
[[File:Hobhouse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emily Hobhouse]] authored the Open Christmas Letter and circulated it for signatures.]]
From 1906 until mid-1914, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the United Kingdom was the party seen as most supportive of [[women's suffrage]]—the right of women to vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;Archive Awareness Campaign. ''From Kitchen Table to Cabinet Table.'' [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4.html "Women, the Vote and Labour 1906–1918." page 1.] [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4_2.html Page 2.] [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4_3.html Page 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting them the right to vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

Like the NUWSS, the more militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] travelled to [[Glasgow]] and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that "peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats".&lt;ref name=Winslow&gt;Winslow, Barbara. ''Sylvia Pankhurst: sexual politics and political activism'', p. 81. Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|1-85728-345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker's Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

==German suffragists==
[[File:Anita Augspurg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[:de:Anita Augspurg|Anita Augspurg]], German lawyer and activist, sent a letter to the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] in late 1914.]]
In ''Jus Suffragii'' in December 1914, Carrie Chapman Catt published a letter that she had received earlier from [[:de:Anita Augspurg|Anita Augspurg]], [[:de:Lida Gustava Heymann|Lida Gustava Heymann]], and several other German women activists including presidents of woman suffrage societies in Germany. The letter was entitled "To the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, through its president, Mrs. Chapman Catt."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It began, "To the women of all nations warm and hearty greetings in these wretched and bloody times."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt; The German women expressed that the "criminally rekindled war" should not separate women from all countries who had previously been united "by the common striving for the highest object—personal and political freedom".&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt; They stated that "True humanity knows no national hatred, no national contempt. Women are nearer to true humanity than men."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt;

Catt published another letter from German women's rights activist [[Clara Zetkin]], one that expressed the desire for all women not to let "the thunder of guns and the shouts of the [[Jingoism|jingoes]]" make them forget that the rise of civilisation amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that the women of the world should guard their children against the "hollow din" of "cheap racial pride" which filled the streets, and that "the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite".&lt;ref name=Oldfield24&gt;Oldfield, 2003, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British suffragists==
[[File:Margaret Bondfield 1919.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Margaret Bondfield]] signed the Open Christmas Letter but was unable to travel to [[The Hague]] in April 1915.]]
In response to the letters from Germany, [[Emily Hobhouse]] organised the writing and signing of a peace-promoting letter from British women: the Open Christmas Letter.&lt;ref name=Oldfield60&gt;Oldfield, 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, [[Emily Hobhouse|Hobhouse]] campaigned against and worked to change the appalling conditions inside the British [[concentration camp]]s in South Africa built for [[Boer]] women and children during the [[Second Boer War]]. She saw in the German letters the opportunity for maintaining vital international relations among women who could help mitigate the damage that war would bring. She wrote what she called a "Letter of Christmas Greeting" in November 1914 and circulated it for signatures of women who wished for peace.&lt;ref name=Foreword&gt;Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (First Congress: 1915: The Hague) ''Bericht—Rapport—Report'', Foreword by Emily Hobhouse, pp. ix–xii. Amsterdam: International Women's Committee of Permanent Peace, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; Pankhurst and [[Helen Bright Clark]] were among the first to sign Hobhouse's plea for continued sisterhood among the women of the world.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;

Others among the 101 signers were [[Margaret Ashton]], [[Margaret Bondfield]],&lt;ref name=Rappaport98&gt;Rappaport, 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eva Gore-Booth]], [[Esther Roper]], [[Maude Royden]], [[Helena Swanwick]], and a wide range of women united by the wish for "undiminished sisterly relations"&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt; and a swift end to hostilities.&lt;ref name=Liddington&gt;Liddington, Jill. ''The road to Greenham Common: feminism and anti-militarism in Britain since 1820'', p. 96. Syracuse University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8156-2539-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included among the women were some who were members of the Women's Labour League, and some of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. One of the listed women was "Mrs. M. K. Gandhi" but it is unknown whether [[Kasturba Gandhi]], the wife of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], asked that her name be included. At least one of the signers was an American: Florence Edgar Hobson was the New York-born wife of English Liberal social theorist and economist [[John A. Hobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Peter.

===Message===
Under the heading "On Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men",&lt;ref name=Oldfield46/&gt; the letter's salutation addressed "Sisters" and began, "Some of us wish to send you a word at this sad [[Christmastide]], though we can but speak through the Press..."&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The women of the UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which was at that time a neutral nation. The letter continued, "The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do."&lt;ref name=Oldfield46/&gt; The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913, "the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight".&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not our mission to preserve life? Do not humanity and common sense alike prompt us to join hands with the women of neutral countries, and urge our rulers to stay further bloodshed? ...&lt;br /&gt;Even through the clash of arms, we treasure [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|our poet's]] vision, and already seem to hear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"A hundred nations swear that there shall be&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pity and Peace and Love among the good and free."&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley, Percy Bysshe]]. [http://www.bartleby.com/139/shel11325.html The Revolt in Islam. A Poem in Twelve Cantos. Canto Fifth.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Christmas hasten that day...&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Response==
[[File:Rosa Mayreder, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rosa Mayreder]] from [[Austria]] signed the reply.]]
In the spring of 1915, the letter was answered in kind by 155 Germanic feminists including Augspurg and Heymann who had sent the earlier letter from Germany. [[Margarethe Lenore Selenka]], [[Minna Cauer]], and [[Helene Stöcker]] were among the German signers; [[Rosa Mayreder]], Marianne Fickert, Ernestine Federn, and [[:de:Ernestine von Fürth|Ernestine von Fürth]] were in the group of Austrian signers.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The response was entitled "Open Letter in Reply to the Open Christmas Letter from Englishwomen to German
and Austrian Women"&lt;ref name=Oldfield67&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in ''Jus Suffragii'' on 1 March 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmers, 2008, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To our English sisters, sisters of the same race, we express in the name of many German women our warm and heartfelt thanks for their Christmas greetings, which we only heard of lately.&lt;br /&gt;This message was a confirmation of what we foresaw—that women of the belligerent countries, with all faithfulness, devotion, and love to their country, can go beyond it and maintain true solidarity with the women of other belligerent nations, and that really civilised women never lose their humanity...&lt;ref name=Oldfield67/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Peace initiatives==
[[File:Carrie Chapman Catt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carrie Chapman Catt]] aided the interchange of peace wishes between women of warring nations.]]
Directly after war broke out in August 1914, [[Rosika Schwimmer]], a native of [[Austria–Hungary]] working in England but prevented by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations.&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt; In September 1914, [[:de:Marie Stritt|Marie Stritt]], president of the German Union for Woman Suffrage, wrote to [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] in America with "deep personal regret" for the "terrible war" to say that the women of Germany must withdraw their invitation to the annual IWSA International Alliance meeting in June 1915 which was to convene in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Oldfield18&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1914 [[Julia Grace Wales]], a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]], expanded eloquently on the concept, and published her views in a pamphlet entitled "Continuous Mediation Without Armistice", popularly known as the [[Wisconsin Plan]].&lt;ref name=WisconsinPlan&gt;Wisconsin Historical Society. Teachers' Lessons. [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/teachers/lessons/wwi/pdfs/prewarpulsepackage.pdf "Teacher Background—Julia Grace Wales and the Peace Movement"]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, instead of holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in [[The Hague]] for four days beginning 28 April 1915.&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt;

When this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Fawcett and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded—they were primarily concerned with helping the UK men win the war.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The NUWSS membership rejected a resolution favoured by [[Helen Bright Clark]] and [[Margaret Bondfield]]&lt;ref name=Rappaport98/&gt; which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Margaret Ashton resigned from the NUWSS and was subsequently censured by her local [[Manchester]] branch of suffragists.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague.&lt;ref name=Crawford668&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

At The Hague, between 28 April and 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals.&lt;ref name=WASM&gt;Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000. Editorials. [http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/hague/intro.htm "How Did Women Activists Promote Peace in Their 1915 Tour of Warring European Capitals?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The event was called the [[International Congress of Women]], or the Women's Peace Congress. A planned contingent of 180 British women was greatly reduced to just three persons by the government cancellation of British ferry service across the [[English Channel]], stranding Royden and Swanwick, among others.&lt;ref name=Crawford668/&gt; Having already travelled to [[Flushing, Netherlands]] on a mission of mercy in late October 1914 to provide food for refugees from the [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|fall of Antwerp]], [[Chrystal Macmillan]] was able to attend the women's conference and speak for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, January 2008. MacTutor Biographies. [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Printonly/MacMillan_Chrystal.html Jessie Chrystal MacMillan]. University of St. Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan, a signer of the Open Christmas Letter, had previously resigned from the NUWSS when its refusal to stand against the war had become clear. Macmillan was selected as one of the international committee who would travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world,&lt;ref name=WisconsinPlan/&gt; and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President [[Woodrow Wilson]] with the plan. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his [[Fourteen Points]], and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=WASM/&gt;

==Women's suffrage==
During the war, with British suffragists abstaining from taking militant action, British statesmen such as Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] began to have a change of heart regarding their right to vote. In early 1917 a clause which provided suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 years and older was debated, and in June it was attached to the bill which would later become the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. Suffragists who were pacifists and suffragists who were nationalistic could both congratulate themselves for winning this incremental victory. Ten years later full voting equality with men was achieved in the UK with the [[Representation of the People Act 1928]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11169">For a [[plane curve]] ''C'' and a given fixed point ''O'', the '''pedal equation''' of the curve is a relation between ''r'' and ''p'' where ''r'' is the distance from ''O'' to a point on ''C'' and ''p'' is the perpendicular distance from ''O'' to the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to ''C'' at the point. The point ''O'' is called the ''pedal point'' and the values ''r'' and ''p'' are sometimes called the ''pedal coordinates'' of a point relative to the curve and the pedal point. It is also useful to measure the distance of ''O'' to the normal &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; (the ''contrapedal coordinate'') even though it is not an independent quantity and it relates to &lt;math&gt;(r,p)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;p_c:=\sqrt{r^2-p^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Some curves have particularly simple pedal equations and knowing the pedal equation of a curve may simplify the calculation of certain of its properties such as curvature. This coordinates are also well suited for solving certain type of force problems in [[classical mechanics]] and [[celestial mechanics]].

==Equations==

===Cartesian coordinates===
For ''C'' given in [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]] by ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and with ''O'' taken to be the origin, the pedal coordinates of the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') are given by:&lt;ref&gt;Yates §1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{x\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+y\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The pedal equation can be found by eliminating ''x'' and ''y'' from these equations and the equation of the curve.

The expression for ''p'' may be simplified if the equation of the curve is written in [[Homogeneous polynomial#Homogenization|homogeneous coordinates]] by introducing a variable ''z'', so that the equation of the curve is ''g''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The value of ''p'' is then given by&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the result is evaluated at ''z''=1

===Polar coordinates===
For ''C'' given in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] by ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(θ), then

:&lt;math&gt;p=r\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Tangential angle#Polar tangential angle|polar tangential angle]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{dr}{d\theta}\tan \phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The pedal equation can be found by eliminating θ from these equations.&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 166, Edwards p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, from the above we can find that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right|=\frac{r p_c}{p},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; p_c:=\sqrt{r^2-p^2} &lt;/math&gt; is the "contrapedal" coordinate, i.e. distance to the normal. This implies that if a curve satisfies an autonomous differential equation in polar coordinates of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(r,\left|\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right|\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
its pedal equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(r,\frac{rp_c}{p}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====
As an example take the logarithmic spiral with the spiral angle α:
:&lt;math&gt;
r=a e^{\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} \theta}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dr}{d\theta}= \frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} a e^{\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} \theta}=\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} r,
&lt;/math&gt;
hence 
:&lt;math&gt; \left|\frac{d r}{d \theta}\right|=\left|\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\right| r, &lt;/math&gt;
and thus in pedal coordinates we get
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{r}{p}p_c=\left|\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\right| r, \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad |\sin\alpha| p_c=|\cos\alpha| p,&lt;/math&gt;
or using the fact that &lt;math&gt; p_c^2=r^2-p^2&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; p=|\sin\alpha|r.&lt;/math&gt;

This approach can be generalized to include autonomous differential equations of any order as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke Proposition 1&lt;/ref&gt; A curve ''C'' which a solution of an ''n''-th order autonomous differential equation (&lt;math&gt;n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) in polar coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; f\left(r,|r'_{\theta}|,r''_{\theta},|r'''_{\theta}|\dots,r_\theta^{(2j)},|r_\theta^{(2j+1)}|,\dots, r_\theta^{(n)}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[pedal curve]] of a curve given in pedal coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt; f(p,p_c, p_c p_c',p_c (p_c p_c')',\dots, (p_c\partial_p)^n p)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the differentiation is done with respect to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Force problems===
Solutions to some force problems of classical mechanics can be surprisingly easily obtained in pedal coordinates.

Consider a dynamical system:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot x=F^\prime(|x|^2)x+2 G^\prime(|x|^2){\dot x}^\perp,&lt;/math&gt;

describing an evolution of a test particle (with position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot x&lt;/math&gt;) in the plane in the presence of central &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and Lorentz like &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; potential. The quantities:

:&lt;math&gt; L=x\cdot \dot x^\perp+G(|x|^2), \qquad c=|\dot x|^2-F(|x|^2), &lt;/math&gt;

are conserved in this system.

Then the curve traced by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is given in pedal coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\left(L-G(r^2)\right)^2}{p^2}=F(r^2)+c,&lt;/math&gt;

with the pedal point at the origin. This fact was discovered by P. Blaschke in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke Theorem 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
As an example consider the so-called [[Kepler problem]], i.e. central force problem, where the force varies inversely as a square of the distance:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{x}=-\frac{M}{|x|^{3}}x, &lt;/math&gt;

we can arrive at the solution immediately in pedal coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L^2}{p^2}=\frac{2M}{r}+c, &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the particle's angular momentum and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to its energy. Thus we have obtained the equation of a conic section in pedal coordinates.

Inversely, for a given curve ''C'', we can easily deduce what forces do we have to impose on a test particle to move along it.

==Pedal equations for specific curves==

===Sinusoidal spirals===
For a [[sinusoidal spiral]] written in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;r^n = a^n \sin(n \theta)&lt;/math&gt;
the polar tangential angle is 
:&lt;math&gt;\psi = n\theta&lt;/math&gt;
which produces the pedal equation
:&lt;math&gt;pa^n=r^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The pedal equation for a number of familiar curves can be obtained setting ''n'' to specific values:&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 168, Edwards p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| −2
| [[Rectangular hyperbola]]
| Center
| ''rp'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

===Spirals===
A spiral shaped curve of the form
:&lt;math&gt;r = c \theta^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
satisfies the equation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6260">A '''personality clash''' occurs when two (or more) people find themselves in conflict not over a particular issue or incident, but due to a fundamental incompatibility in their personalities, their approaches to things, or their [[style of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200612/when-personalities-clash Judith Sills, 'When Personalities Clash']&lt;/ref&gt;

A personality clash may occur in work-related, family-related, or social situations.

==Types==

[[Carl Jung]] saw the polarity of [[extraversion and introversion]] as a major potential cause of personality conflicts in everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 46-7&lt;/ref&gt; as well as underlying many past intellectual and philosophical disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

He also opposed thinking and feeling types, intuitive and sensation types, as potential sources of misunderstanding between people;&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (2004) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; while other typologies can and have been developed since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200612/when-personalities-clash Sills]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
The issue of personality clashes in the workplace is controversial. According to the Australian government, the two types of workplace conflicts are when people's ideas, decisions or actions relating directly to the job are in opposition, or when two people just don't get along.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Workplace_conflict?OpenDocument Workplace conflict], [[Better Health Channel]].&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Weed argue that in a conflict situation, don’t ask who, ask what and why. Managers should avoid blaming interpersonal conflicts on personality clashes. Such a tactic is an excuse to avoid addressing the real causes of conflict, and the department’s performance will suffer as a result. Managers must be able to recognize the signs of conflict behaviors and deal with the conflict in a forthright fashion. Approaching conflicts as opportunities to improve departmental policies and operations rather as ailments to be eradicated or ignored will result in a more productive work force and greater departmental efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Turner. S. and Weed. F., Conflict in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs NJ (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to avoid recognizing harsher business bullying situations, employers are more likely to refer to these actions as a personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;Namie. G., Workplace bullying: Escalated incivility, Ivey Publishing, London, Ontario, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In therapy==

[[Sigmund Freud]] thought a harmonious match of therapist and patient was essential for psychotherapy; but subsequent experience has demonstrated that success can follow even where there is an underlying personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Macolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neville Symington]] indeed saw a patient's willingness to proceed with therapy, ''despite'' her dislike of him, as a positive sign of health, and as a beginning repudiation of her [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;Symington, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==

Some suggest that the only answer to a personality clash is the [[folk remedy]] of distancing - reducing contact with the clashing personality involved.&lt;ref&gt;J. &amp; M. McCarthy, ''Software for your Head'' (2002) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations are to focus on the positives in the other person, and to examine one's own psychodynamics for clues as to why one is finding them so difficult&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200612/when-personalities-clash?page=2 Sills]&lt;/ref&gt; - perhaps due to a [[Projection (psychology)|projection]] of some unacknowledged part of one's own personality.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Gardner]] saw a major part of what he called [[interpersonal intelligence]] as the ability to mediate and resolve such personality clashes from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 39 and p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Actual===

* Circumstances conspired to produce a painful personality clash between the ordered, cerebral, emotionally contained [[A. J. P. Taylor]], and the spendthrift, bohemian, expansive [[Dylan Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wrigley, ''A. J. P. Taylor'' (2006) p. 92 and p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The clash between the cautious, moderate [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley]] and the mercurial, extremist [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] at the close of Queen Anne's reign did much to usher in the long [[Whig (British political party)#Whig supremacy|Whig ascendency]] that followed.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''The Peace and the Protestant Succession'' (1965) p. 301-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The personality clash between [[Henry Tizard]] and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]] had adverse effects on the Allied conduct of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wood/D. D. Dempster, ''The Narrow Margin'' (1992) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary===

* [[C. P. Snow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel on the [[Corridors of Power (novel)|corridors of power]] described caballing with someone whose temperament "clashed right at the roots with mine: even if he was not being offensive, he would have tempted me to say something hard. But I was doing a job, and I couldn't afford luxuries, certainly not the luxury of being myself".&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Corridors of Power'' (1975) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of human rights''' attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of [[human rights]] and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Human Rights|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH4b|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural rights==

{{Main article|Natural law|Natural right}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (δίκαιον φυσικόν ''dikaion physikon''; [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church Fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[paganism|pagan]] concept of natural law into [[Christianity]]. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the 16th century, asked by the Spanish monarchs to investigate the legitimacy of claims to land dominion by the ''indios'' of Latin America, Francisco de Vitoria expounded a theory of natural rights, especially in his famous ''Relectio de Indis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=The Pre-Hobbesian Roots of Natural Rights Theory|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao7103-williams.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] beginning from the principle that man in the state of nature, which is to say without a "commonwealth" (a state) is in a state of constant war one with the other and thus in fear of his life and possessions (there being no property nor right without a sovereign to define it). Hobbes asserted natural law as how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act; the first principle of natural law being to seek peace, in which is self-preservation. Natural law (which Hobbes accepted was a misnomer, there being no law without a commonwealth) was discovered by considering humankind's natural interests, whereas previous philosophers had said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for human beings to agree to create a commonwealth by submitting to the command of a sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly of individuals. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank Van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007 |title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dignity" is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Rahner]] discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom. Specifically, his ideas of freedom relate to human rights as an appeal to the freedom to [[Karl Rahner#Incarnation-grace|communicate with the divine]]. As embodied individuals who can have this freedom and dignity threatened by external forces, the protection of this dignity takes on an appeal to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "natural rights" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the debate on human rights remains thus a debate around the correct interpretation of Natural Law, and human rights themselves a positive, but reductionist, expression thereof&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Cornides, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jakob_cornides Natural and Un-Natural Law], New York, C-Fam (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social contract==

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested the existence of a hypothetical ''social contract'' where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of preservation to form institutions to govern them. They give up their natural complete liberty in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to [[John Locke]]'s theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his "Du Contrat Social" ([[The Social Contract]]).

International [[equity (law)|equity]] expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:

{{cquote|the most fundamental fiduciary relationship in our society is manifestly that which exists between the community (the people) and the state, its agencies and [[official]]s.|||Paul Finn&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"/&gt;}}

The relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the [[English law]] tradition is a [[fiduciary]] one. In equity law, a politician's fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and [[competence (human resources)|competence]] in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the [[Court of equity|Courts of Equity]], the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"&gt;Salevao (2005) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocity==

The Golden Rule, or the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'' states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world's major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic" by the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1993.

==Soviet concept of human rights==

{{Main article|Human rights in the Soviet Union}}

Soviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted ''against'' the government", whereas Soviet law declared that [[State (polity)|state]] is the source of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lambelet, Doriane. "The Contradiction Between Soviet and American Human Rights Doctrine: Reconciliation Through Perestroika and Pragmatism." 7 ''Boston University International Law Journal''. 1989. p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shiman&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiman | first = David | title = Economic and Social Justice: A Human Rights Perspective | publisher = Amnesty International | year= 1999 | url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/hreduseries/tb1b/Section1/tb1-2.htm | isbn = 0-9675334-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Soviet legal system regarded [[law]] as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; Extensive [[Extrajudicial punishment|extra-judiciary powers]] were given to the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret police agencies]]. The regime abolished Western [[rule of law]], [[civil liberties]], [[Criminal justice|protection of law]] and [[Property rights|guarantees of property]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (2001) ''Communism'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-64688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''.

==Other theories of human rights==

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=''Human Rights''|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

[[Human security]] is an emerging school of thought which challenges the traditional, state-based conception of security and argues that a people-focused approach to security is more appropriate in the modern interdependent world and would be more effective in advancing the security of individuals and societies across the globe.

;Ipso facto legal rights theory

According to the recommendation of human rights scholar Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LLB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK: ‘Right’ being synonymous of ‘legal’ and antonymous of both ‘wrong’ and ‘illegal’, every ‘right’ of any human person is ipso facto a ‘legal right’ which deserves protection of law and legal remedy irrespective of having been written into the law, constitution or otherwise in any country.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LlB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK.

==Critiques of human rights==

The idea of [[human rights]] is not without its critics. [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]] are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of [[natural rights]]. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a leading contemporary critic of human rights. His criticisms are discussed below.

===Edmund Burke on natural rights===

[[Edmund Burke]] was an 18th-century philosopher, political theorist and statesman largely associated with the school of [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampsher-Monk|first=Iain|title=The political philosophy of Edmund Burke|year=1987|publisher=Longman|location=New Work|pages=preface, x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views on [[natural rights]] are best articulated in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', which directly attacked the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (1789) and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of Burke’s uneasiness of the ''Declaration'' lies in the drafter’s abandonment of the existing establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of [[general will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from a form of inherited wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that it was arrogant and limiting for the drafters of the ''Declaration'' to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Edmund|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France 1790|url=http://www.constitution.org/eb/rev_fran.htm#01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“they have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own”&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may seem to the drafters that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Michael A.|title=The Skeptic's Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in Frabce, 1790-1990|journal=Political Theory|date=August 1991|volume=19|issue=3|pages=391–418 at 404|doi=10.1177/0090591791019003006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the ''Declaration'' is based.

Burke did not deny the existence of natural rights; rather he thought that the [[a priori (epistemology)|a priori]] reasoning adopted by the drafters produced notions that were too abstract to have application within the framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stating that “the pretended right of these theorists are all extremes; and in a proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false”,&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; Burke identified that abstract rights are meaningless without a societal framework:

{{cquote|What is the use of discussing a man’s abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

In contrast to [[John Locke|Locke]], Burke did not believe the purpose of government was to protect pre-existing natural rights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed “the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke it was the government, as a result of long social evolution, that transformed the meaningless natural rights into the practical advantaged afforded to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not the rights themselves, as much as the level of abstraction and the placing of them above government which Burke found dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated “those who pull down important ancient establishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration, and public institutions… are the most mischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men”.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke politics had no simple answers, and definitely no overarching, universal maxims such as those expressed in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather the rights afforded to individuals were to be assessed in the context of the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he acknowledged that the simplicity of the ''Declaration'' was attractive and feared its ability to undermine social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke believed that the absolute nature of these principles of abstraction were inherently revolutionary; they were uncompromising and any derogation from the principles a reason to rise up in arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem because;

{{cquote|All government… is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

The natural rights “Against which there can be no prescription; against these no agreements is binding”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; gave the revolutionaries the tools to destroy the very society that Burke believed afforded them with rights. In this way Burke thought the rights contained in the ''Declaration'' would lead to “the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham on natural rights===

The 18th-century [[Utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] criticised the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' in his text ''Anarchical Fallacies''. He famously asserted that the concept of natural rights was “nonsense upon stilts”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham criticised the ''Declaration'' both for the language that it adopted and the theories it posited, stating; “Look to the letter, you find nonsense; look beyond the letter, you find nothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the critiques Bentham levelled against the ''Declaration'' was its assertions of rights in the form of absolute and universal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified that absolute rights possessed by everyone equally are meaningless and undesirable. They lack meaning because if everyone has, for example, unbounded liberty, there is nothing precluding them from using that liberty to impinge on the liberty of another. In this way “human government and human laws”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required to give some bounds to rights in order for them to be realised.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if advocates of absolute rights recognise this necessity, as the proponents of the ''Declaration'' did, Bentham argues that it is in vain.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"/&gt; “It would be self-contradictory, because these rights are, in the same breath which their existence is declared, declared to be impresciptable; and impriscriptable… means nothing unless it excludes the interference of the laws.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this contradiction, Bentham warned of the dangers of couching rights in absolute terms. A government that is able to protect every person’s right absolutely and equally is a utopian aspiration, but the ''Declaration'' couches it as the conditions for its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations, then, it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham does not deny that there are some laws that are morally wrong; his uneasiness is in easily justifying a revolutionary call to arms – with the violence, chaos and destruction associated with it – based on a repugnant law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the theoretical faults, Bentham thought that natural rights were a construction adopted to pursue the selfish aims of the drafters, of which no logical basis could be found.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"&gt;Philip Schofield, "Bentham, Jeremy (1748–1832)"; Ed. Donald M. Borchert, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Vol. 1. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006) at 555&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that it may be desirable to have rights, but “a reason for wishing that a certain right were established, is not that right; want is not supply; hunger is not bread.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish rights existed by virtue of laws enacted by a sovereign was logically sound, but to assert rights established by nature was not.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"/&gt; “A natural right is a son that never had a father.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Bentham think that there was no logical basis for the theory of natural rights, but he believed that their individualistic approach was harmful to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The great enemies of public peace are the selfish and the dissocial passions – necessary as they are – the one to the very existence of each individual, the other to his security…What has been the object, the perpetual and palpable object, of this declaration to pretended rights? To add such force as possible to these passions, but already too strong, - to burst the cords that hold them in, - to say to the selfish passions, there – everywhere – is your prey! - to the angry passions, there –everywhere- is your enemy. Such is the morality of this celebrated manifesto.|||Jeremy Bentham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bentham thought that society was dependent upon people's ability to pursue the greater good, not just the short-term satisfaction of their own desires. The advancement of natural rights, which he saw as celebrating selfishness, was to provide the means to break down the social community that makes human life bearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist Critique of human rights===
In [[On the Jewish Question]], [[Karl Marx]] criticized ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' as bourgeois ideology:
:''Above all, we note the fact that the so-called rights of man, the droits de l'homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen, are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i.e., the rights of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. ... according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791:
:''"Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others."''
:''Liberty, therefore, is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.''
and that:
:''Security is the supreme social concept of bourgeois society, the concept of the police, the whole society exists only to ensure each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property.''

Thus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.

Marxist critical theorist [[Slavoj Žižek]] argued that: "liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be 'harassed', that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others." and "universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/against-human-rights-zizek |title=Against human rights - Slavoj Žižek |publisher=libcom.org|date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist [[Robert Fine]] claims that the key to Marx’s argument was to rebut the radicalism Bauer espoused: a radicalism that not only denied the rights of Jews but at once trashed the rights of man and citizen as such. What Marx stood for in the Jewish Question as in his earlier writings more generally was a philosophy of right. Fine believes what Marx stood against was a spiritless radicalism that revealed its inhumanity not only through its hostility to Jews but also through its hostility to the idea of right." Moreover, Fine argued that Marx argued that the society that gives rise to the idea of rights is the same as that which gives rise to the commodity form. They are two sides of the same medal. It is a society based on production by independent producers whose contact with each other is mediated through the exchange of products on the market. These producers are formally free to produce what and how much they wish. They are formally equal in that no producer can force others to produce against their will or expropriate their products against their will. They are self-interested in that they are all entitled to pursue their own private interests regardless of what others think or do. Their contact with other producers takes the form of free and equal exchanges in which individuals exchange their property in return for the property of another and this exchange of unneeded things in return for useful things appears to be done for the mutual benefit of each party.

Fine also claims that for Marx, exchange relations appear to be formed among free and equal property owners who enter a voluntary contract in pursuit of their own self-interest. Fine cites what he believes to be Marx's point about how in exchange lies the clue to all modern conceptions of freedom and equal right:

:Although individual A feels a need for the commodity of individual B, he does not appropriate it by force, nor vice versa, but rather recognise one another reciprocally as proprietors, as persons whose will penetrates their commodities. Accordingly, the juridical moment of the Person enters here… all inherent contradictions of bourgeois society appear extinguished ... and bourgeois democracy even more than the bourgeois economists takes refuge in this aspect.: (Marx, Grundrisse:243, 251)

Furthermore, the parties to the exchange must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and alienate his own, except through an act to which both parties consent. Marx characterised this sphere of commodity exchange as ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man’ – the realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and
Bentham:

:‘Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity ... are determined only by their own free will....Equality because each enters into relations with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent with equivalent. Property because each disposes only what is his own. And Bentham because each looks only to his own advantage. The only force bringing them together is the selfishness, the gain and the private interest of each.: (Marx, Capital 1: 280)

Thus according to [[Robert Fine]], Marx's basic criticism was that within political society people were seen as co-operative, while in their economic roles they were competitive, individualistic and egoistic. In short, the theory of rights expressed the division and alienation of human beings.

===Alasdair MacIntyre on human rights===

[[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a Scottish philosopher who has published a number of works in a variety of philosophical fields, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ted|title=Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p-macint/|work=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2005 |editor1=James Fieser|editor2=Bradley Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacIntyre criticises the concept of [[human rights]] in [[After Virtue]] and he famously asserts that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns.”&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntyre argues that every attempt at justifying the existence of human rights has failed. The assertions by 18th century philosophers that [[natural rights]] are self-evident truths, he argues, are necessarily false as there are no such things as self-evident truths. He says that the plea 20th century philosophers made to intuition show a flaw in philosophical reasoning. MacIntyre then outlines that, although [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]] is not wrong in asserting that the inability to demonstrate a statement does not necessitate its falsity, the same argument can be applied in relation to witches and unicorns.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"/&gt;

MacIntyre made this critique of human rights in the context of a wider argument about the failure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to produce a coherent moral system.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of the enlightenment sought to cast aside the discredited notions of hierarchy and [[theology]] as justifications for morality. Instead, MacIntyre argues, the enlightenment placed the individual as the sovereign authority to dictate what is right and wrong. However allegiances to historical notions of morality remained and philosophers sought to find a secular and rational justification for existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem, MacIntyre maintains, is that theological morality was developed to overcome defects in human nature; to posit an example of the ideal. Without this notion of ‘perfect humanity’ the only remaining foundation to build a moral theory on was the foundation of imperfect human nature.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; For MacIntyre, the result was a collection of moral stances, each claiming to have a rational justification and each disputing the findings of the rival notions.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"/&gt;

MacIntyre believes that a number of the moral debates that occur in society can be explained as a result of this failure of the “Enlightenment Project”.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 96&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights are an example of a moral belief, founded in previous theological beliefs, which make the false claim of being grounded in rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate how the principles lead to conflict, he gives the example of [[abortion]]; in this case the right of the mother to exercise control over her body is contrasted with the deprivation of a potential child to the right to life. Although both the right to liberty and the right to life are, on their own, considered morally acceptable claims, conflict arises when we posit them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of value and property==
{{See also|Property}}
[[Henry of Ghent]] articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his ''Theories of Surplus Value'', seeing the beginnings of a theory of [[surplus value]] in Locke's works. In Locke's ''Second Treatise'' he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more "industrious and rational" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of [[money]], Marx argued in ''Theories of Surplus Value'' that Locke's system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''physical body''' or '''physical object''' (or simply a '''body''' or '''object''') is an [[Identity (philosophy)|identifiable]] collection of [[matter]], which may be constrained by an identifiable boundary, and may move as a unit by translation or rotation, in [[Three-dimensional space|3-dimensional space]].

In common usage, an object is a collection of matter within a defined [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] boundary in [[3-dimensional space]]. The boundary must be defined and identified by the properties of the material.  The boundary may change over time.  The boundary is usually the visible or tangible surface of the object.  The matter in the object is constrained (to a greater or lesser degree) to move as one object.  The boundary may move in space relative to other objects that it is not attached to (through translation and rotation).  An object's boundary may also deform and change over time in other ways.

Also in common usage, an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of [[matter]].  Atoms or parts of an object may change over time.  An object is defined by the simplest representation of the boundary consistent with the observations.  However the laws of Physics only apply directly to objects that consist of the same collection of matter.

Each object has a unique identity, independent of any other properties.  Two objects may be identical, in all properties except position, but still remain distinguishable.  In most cases the boundaries of two objects may not overlap at any point in time.  The property of identity allows objects to be counted.

Examples of [[scientific model|models]] of physical bodies include, but are not limited to a [[particle]], several [[interaction|interacting]] smaller bodies (particles or other), and [[continuous media]].

The common conception of physical objects includes that they have [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] in the [[universe|physical world]], although there do exist [[physical theory|theories]] of [[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]] which may challenge{{how|date=June 2013}} this. In modern physics, "extension" is understood in terms of the [[spacetime]]: roughly speaking, it means that for a given moment of [[time]] the body has some location in the space, although not necessarily a [[point (geometry)|point]]. A physical body as a whole is assumed to have such [[physical quantity|quantitative]] properties as [[mass]], [[momentum]], [[electric charge]], other [[Conservation law (physics)|conserving quantities]], and possibly other quantities.

A body with known composition and described in an adequate physical theory is an example of [[physical system]].

==In common usage==

An object is known by the application of [[sense]]s. The properties of an object are inferred by learning and reasoning based on the information perceived.  Abstractly, an object is a construction of our mind consistent with the information provided by our senses, using [[Occam's razor]].

In common usage an object is the material inside the boundary of an object, in 3-dimensional space.  The boundary of an object is a contiguous surface which may be used to determine what is inside, and what is outside an object.  An object is a single piece of material, whose extent is determined by a description based on the properties of the material.  An imaginary sphere of granite within a larger block of granite would not be considered an identifiable object, in common usage.  A fossilized scull encased in a rock may be considered an object because it is possible to determine the extent of the scull based on the properties of the material.

For a [[rigid body]], the boundary of an object may change over time by [[Continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]].  For a [[deformable body]] the boundary may also be continuously [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] over time in other ways.

An object has an [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].  In general two objects with identical properties, other than position at an instance in time, may be distinguished as two objects and may not occupy the same space at the same time (excluding component objects).  An object's identity may be tracked using the continuity of the change in its boundary over time.  The identity of objects allows objects to be arranged in [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[counting|counted]].

The material in an object may change over time.  For example, a rock may wear away or have pieces broken off it.  The object will be regarded as the same object after the addition or removal of material, if the system may be more simply described with the continued existence of the object, than in any other way.  The addition or removal of material may discontinuously change the boundary of the object.  The continuation of the objects identity is then based on the description of the system by continued identify being simpler than without continued identity.

For example, a particular car might have all its wheels changed, and still be regarded as the same car.

The identity of an object may not split.  If an object is broken into two pieces at most one of the pieces has the same identity.  An object's identity may also be destroyed if the simplest description of the system at a point in time changes from identifying the object to not identifying it.  Also an object's identity is created at the first point in time that the simplest model of the system consistent with perception identifies it.

An object may be composed of components.  A component is an object completely within the boundary of a containing object.

==Classical mechanics==

In [[classical mechanics]] a physical body is collection of matter having properties including [[mass]], [[velocity]], [[momentum]] and [[energy]].  The matter exists in a volume of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] space. This space is its [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]].

Under [[Newtonian gravity]] the gravitational field further away than the furthest extent of an object is determined only by the mass and the position of the center of mass.

Interactions between objects are partly described by orientation and external shape.

In [[continuum mechanics]] an object may be described as a collection of sub objects, down to an infinitesimal division, which interact with each other by forces which may be described internally by [[pressure]] and [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]].

== Quantum mechanics ==

In [[quantum mechanics]] an object is a particle or collection of particles.  Until measured, a particle does not have a physical position. A particle is defined by a [[Wave function|probability distribution]] of finding the particle at a particular position.  There is a [[Uncertainty principle|limit to the accuracy with which the position and velocity may be measured]].  A particle or collection of particles is described by a [[quantum state]].

These ideas vary from the common usage understanding of what an object is.

== String theory ==

In [[particle physics]], there is a debate as to whether some [[elementary particle]]s are not bodies, but are [[point (geometry)|points]] without [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] in [[physical space]] within [[space-time]], or are always extended in at least one dimension of space as in [[string theory]] or [[M theory]].

==In psychology==
In some branches of [[psychology]], depending on [[school of thought]], a physical body is a [[physical object]] with [[physical properties]], as compared to [[mental objects]].  In ([[reductionistic]]) [[behaviorism]], a physical body and its properties are the (only) [[meaningful]] objects of study.
While in the modern day behavioral psychotherapy it is still only the means for goal oriented behavior modifications, in [[Body Psychotherapy]] it is not a means only anymore, but its felt sense is a goal of its own. In [[cognitive psychology]], physical bodies as they occur in [[biology]] are studied in order to understand the [[mind]], which may not be a physical body, as in [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] schools of thought.

==In philosophy==
{{Further|Ontology|Metaphysics}}

A physical body is an enduring object that exists throughout a particular [[trajectory]] of [[space]] and orientation over a particular duration of [[time]], and which is located in  the [[physical world|world]] of [[physical space]] (i.e., as studied by [[physics]]).  This contrasts with [[abstract object]]s such as [[mathematical object]]s which do not exist at any particular time or place.
Examples are a [[cloud]], a [[human body]], a weight, a billiard ball, a table, or a [[proton]].  This is contrasted with [[abstract object]]s such as [[mental object]]s, which exist in the [[mental world]], and [[mathematical object]]s. Other examples that are '''''not''''' [[physical bodies]] are [[emotions]], the concept of "[[justice]]", a feeling of hatred, or the [[number]] "3".  In some philosophies, like the [[Idealism]] of [[George Berkeley]], a physical body '''''is''''' a [[mental object]], but still has extension in the space of a visual field.

'''Piktochart''' is a web-based [[infographic]] application which allows users without intensive experience as graphic designers to easily create infographics and visuals using themed templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piktochart.com/product-features/|title=Product Features|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Piktochart|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In March 2012, the first iteration of Piktochart was launched by co-founders, Goh Ai Ching and Andrea Zaggia in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{Cite web
|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/piktocharts-latest-version-lets-users-make-search-friendly-infographics/
|title = Piktochart’s Latest Version Lets Users Make Search-Friendly Infographics
|date =  30 January 2012
|author =  Catherine Shu
|publisher = [[Techcrunch]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the same year, Piktochart grew its user base to more than 170,000 users and received a $140,000 grant from the Malaysian government’s Cradle Fund, as well as announcing that it had raised seed funding from a number of investors.&lt;ref name="techcrunch" /&gt; 

Its userbase grew with the addition of new formats such as reports, banners and presentations which resulted in more than 3 million users in mid-2015. Piktochart is described by [[Forbes Magazine]] as an infographic tool for "the graphically challenged," or for those who are simply in a time-crunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCue|first=TJ|title=Why Infographics Rule|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2013/01/08/what-is-an-infographic-and-ways-to-make-it-go-viral/|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=8 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Piktochart has been used by more than 11 million people worldwide and has grown to become a semi-distributed team of 53 team members with the office based in Penang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/a-silicon-valley-of-the-east-penang-s-thriving-start-up-communit-7576346|title=A Silicon Valley of the East: Penang’s thriving start-up community|last=Chia|first=Lianne|date=26 January 2017|website=Channel NewsAsia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Whereas companies like [[LucidChart]], [[Trendalyzer]], [[Gliffy]] and others had previously focused on data-representation tools that would be useful for intra-corporate collaboration as aids to speeches and presentations, and for the creation of internal communications documents, Piktochart described itself as focused on empowering users to create infographics that would be web-publisher ready and able to stand alone as a piece of multimedia content.  Piktochart provides over 600 templates which users can edit, or by using more advanced functions, customize as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trewe|first=Marti|title=Piktochart: simple infographic creator online for the busy professional|url=http://agbeat.com/business-marketing/piktochart-simple-infographic-creator-online-for-the-busy-professional/|publisher=AG Beat|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Heather|title=Infographics Made Easy With Piktochart|url=http://web.appstorm.net/reviews/graphic-design/infographics-made-easy-with-piktochart/|publisher=Web Appstorm|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of Piktochart, released in 2017, includes a HTML publisher which allows users to create visuals that can be viewed online or embedded to a website, as well as allowing the user to include multiple interactive elements such as charts, videos, map visualization, and animated icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peacock|first=Marisa|title=New Piktochart Release Makes Infographics Interactive: Adds Links, Clickable Tabs|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/new-piktochart-release-makes-infographics-interactive-adds-links-clickable-tabs-019380.php|publisher=CMS Wire|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pitchcap.jpg|thumb|right|"''Captain Swayne pitchcapping the people of Prosperous''"]]
'''Pitchcapping''' was a form of [[torture]] used by the British military against suspected Irish rebels during the period of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], most famously on [[Anthony Perry]], one of the leaders of the Wexford Rebels.

== Process ==
The process involved pouring hot [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], or [[tar]] (mainly used at the time for lighting purposes), into a conical shaped paper "cap", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head, allowed to cool, then rapidly removed, taking with it a portion of the suspect's skin and tissue. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by [[Myles Byrne]]* [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala_djvu.txt] in his memoirs.

"''Flogging, half hanging, picketing, were mild tortures in comparison of the pitch caps that were applied to the heads of those who happened to wear their hair short, called croppies; the head being completely singed, a cap made of strong linen well imbued with boiling pitch was so closely put on that it could not be taken off without bringing off a part of the skin and flesh from the head : in many instances the tortured victim had one of his ears cut off to satisfy the executioner that if he escaped he could readily be discovered, being so well marked.'' "&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Miles Byrne&lt;/ref&gt;

The torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victim's hair/scalp. The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembles [[scalping]], earlier known as a practice used by the colonists in [[North America]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] on each other.
Pitch has long, even in antiquity, been used (like other hot liquids, even melted metal) to pour into a victim's orifices. However, both those techniques were usually faster and often lethal, so less suitable as torture proper, rather as [[capital punishment]].

It has been extended to include any attacks against Jews and physical destruction of Jewish property, as well as looting of Jewish homes and businesses, throughout history.{{r|YIVO}}{{r|books1}}{{r|books2}} The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incidents, at times leading to, or culminating in, [[massacre]]s. All outbreaks of antisemitic violence have become retrospectively known as pogroms.{{r|Brass}} 

The Russian-language term was adopted in the English language in order to describe the mass violence of 1881 and 1882 that was directed against Jews within the [[Pale of Settlement]] which was first created by [[Catherine the Great]] in what would become most of present-day [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], as well as parts of [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Poland]]. The term ''pogrom'' is sometimes used, as well, to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish ethnic or religious groups.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WileyBlackwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt;&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Definitions of pogrom}}
First recorded in 1882, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''pogrom'' (погро́м, {{IPA-ru|pɐˈgrom|pron}}) is derived from the common prefix po- and the verb ''gromit''' (громи́ть, {{IPA-ru|grɐˈmʲitʲ|pron}}) meaning "to destroy, to wreak havoc, to demolish violently". Its literal translation is "to harm".&lt;ref name=Abramson/&gt; The noun "pogrom", which has a relatively short history, is used in [[English language|English]] and many other languages as a [[loanword]], possibly borrowed from [[Yiddish]] (where the word takes the form פאָגראָם).&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; Its widespread circulation in today's world began with the antisemitic excesses in the Russian Empire in 1881–1883.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt;

==Historical background==
Anti-Jewish riots had already taken place in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. Jewish communities were targeted in the [[Black Death Jewish persecutions]] of 1348–1350, in [[Toulon]] in 1348, in [[Barcelona]] as well as in other Catalan cities,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe after the black death '' 2000 p. 13 "The first massacres took place in April 1348 in Toulon, where the Jewish quarter was raided and forty Jews were murdered in their homes. Shortly afterwards, violence broke out in Barcelona."&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Erfurt massacre (1349)]], the [[Basel massacre]], massacres in Aragon and in Flanders,&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Judaica: chronological index of Jewish history''; p. 203  Máttis Kantor - 2005 "The Jews were savagely attacked and massacred, by sometimes hysterical mobs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall ''John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture''; p. 376 2006 "The period of the Black Death saw the massacre of Jews across Germany, and in Aragon, and Flanders,"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the "Valentine's Day" [[Strasbourg pogrom]] of 1349.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, «La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire» ("The greatest epidemic in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n° 310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 510 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period,&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''The Renaissance'', Simon and Schuster (1953), page 730–731, {{ISBN|0-671-61600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending further to the [[Brussels massacre]] of 1370. On Holy Saturday of 1389, a pogrom began in [[Prague]] that led to the burning of the Jewish quarter, the killing of many Jews, and the suicide of many Jews trapped in the main synagogue; the number of dead was estimated at 400–500 men, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Newman [https://www.academia.edu/1470909/The_Passion_of_the_Jews_of_Prague_The_Pogrom_of_1389_and_the_Lessons_of_a_Medieval_Parody_2012_ The Passion of the Jews of Prague: The Pogrom of 1389 and the Lessons of a Medieval Parody] Church History 81:1 (March 2012), 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The first atrocities against Jewish civilians, on a genocidal scale of destruction, were committed during the [[Khmelnytsky Pogrom]]s of 1648–1657 in present-day [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Herman Rosenthal |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=469&amp;letter=C |title=Chmielnicki, Bogdan Zinovi |website=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians give estimates of the scale of the murders by Khmelnytsky's [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] ranging between 40,000 and 100,000 men, women and children,&lt;ref&gt;Historians, who put the number of killed Jewish civilians at between 40,000 and 100,000 during the [[Khmelnytsky Pogrom]]s in 1648–1657, include:&lt;ol type="a" style="Margin: 0;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;{{space}} Naomi E.

The [[Russian Empire]], which previously had very few Jews, acquired territories with [[Russian Partition|large Jewish populations]] during the military [[Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795 conducted jointly with [[Austrian Partition|the Austrian]] and [[Prussian Partition|Prussian armies]], and resulting in Poland's elimination from the geopolitical map of Europe for the next 123 years.&lt;ref name="Davies60"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Davies |title=God's Playground: a history of Poland |id=Volume II: Revised Edition |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press |year=2005 |chapter=Rossiya: The Russian Partition (1772–1918) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;q=alien+imposition |pages=60–61 |isbn=978-0199253401|title-link=God's Playground }}&lt;/ref&gt; In conquered territories, a new political entity called the [[Pale of Settlement]] was formed in 1791 by [[Catherine the Great]].

Large-scale pogroms, which began in the Russian Empire several decades earlier, intensified during the period of the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Revolution of 1917]]. Professor [[Zvi Gitelman]] (''A Century of Ambivalence'') estimated that only in 1918–1919 over 1,200 pogroms took place in Ukraine, thus amounting to the greatest slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe since 1648.&lt;ref name=Gitelman25&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitelman |first=Zvi Y. |year=2001 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f2rng6jDW4C&amp;q=Kiev+March+1919+since+1648 |title=Revolution and the Ambiguities |id=Chapter&amp;nbsp;2 |isbn=978-0253338112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his book ''[[Two Hundred Years Together]]'' provided additional statistics from research conducted by [[Nahum Gergel]] (1887–1931).

The instructions issued from above had only a limited impact on soldiers' attitudes toward violence against Jews, as related by author and future Nobel laureate [[Ivan Bunin]]. On May 15, 1919, Bunin wrote in his diary about yet another massacre: {{quote|Members of the [[Red Army]] in [[Odessa]] led a pogrom against the Jewish population in the town of [[:ru:Большой Фонтан (Одесса)|Big Fountain]]. Ovsyaniko-Kulikovsky and the writer Kipen happened to be there and told me the details. Fourteen [[commissar|commissars]] and thirty Jews from among the common people were killed. Many stores were destroyed. The soldiers tore through the night, dragged the victims from their beds, and killed whomever they met. People ran into the [[steppe]] or rushed into the sea. They were chased after and fired upon – a genuine hunt, as it were. Kipen saved himself by accident – fortunately he had spent the night not in his home, but at the White Flower sanitorium. At dawn, a detachment of Red Army soldiers appeared. 'Are there any Jews here?' they asked the watchman. 'No, no Jews here.' 'Swear what you're saying is true!' The watchman swore, and they went on farther. Moisei Gutman, a cab [driver], was killed. He was a dear man who moved us from our [[dacha]] last fall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Bunin]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Uf_yeeb97wC&amp;q=Big+Fountain Cursed Days: A Diary of Revolution.]'' May 2/15, 1919.

Gergel's overall figures, which are generally considered conservative, are based on the testimony of witnesses and newspaper reports collected by the ''Mizrakh-Yidish Historiche Arkhiv'' which was first based in Kiev, then Berlin and later New York.

During the 1911 [[History of the Jews in Wales#Modern period|Tredegar riot]] in [[Wales]], Jewish homes and businesses were looted and burned over the period of a week, before the [[British Army]] was called in by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]], who described the riot as a "pogrom".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; In 1919 there was a pogrom in [[Argentina]], during the [[Tragic Week (Argentina)|Tragic Week]].&lt;ref name="bookrags"/&gt;

===After World War II===
After the end of [[World War II]], a series of violent antisemitic incidents occurred against returning Jews throughout [[Europe]], particularly in the Soviet-occupied East where [[Nazi]] propagandists had extensively promoted the notion of a [[Judeo-Bolshevism|Jewish-Communist conspiracy]] (see [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946]] and [[Anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944–1946]]). Anti-Jewish riots also [[The Sergeants affair#Reactions in Britain|took place in Britain]] in 1947.

In the Arab world, anti-Jewish rioters killed over 140 Jews in the [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania]]. Following the start of the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]], a number of anti-Jewish events occurred throughout the Arab world, some of which have been described as pogroms. In 1947, half of Aleppo's 10,000 Jews left the city in the wake of the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo|Aleppo riots]], while other anti-Jewish riots took place in [[1947 Aden riots|British Aden]] and [[1948 Anti-Jewish Riots in Oujda and Jerada|the French Moroccan cities of Oujda and Jerada]].&lt;ref name="antisemitism"/&gt;

{{see also|Definitions of pogrom}}

According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "the term is usually applied to attacks on [[Jews]] in the [[Russian Empire]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [and] the first extensive pogroms followed the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in 1881",&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; and the ''Wiley-Blackwell Dictionary of Modern European History Since 1789'' states that pogroms "were [[antisemitic]] disturbances that periodically occurred within the tsarist empire."&lt;ref name="WileyBlackwell"/&gt; However, the term is widely used to refer to many events which occurred prior to the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]. Historian of Russian Jewry [[John Klier]] writes in ''Russians, Jews, and the Pogroms of 1881–1882'' that "By the twentieth century, the word 'pogrom' had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews."&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt; [[Henry Abramson|Abramson]] wrote that "in mainstream usage the word has come to imply an act of [[antisemitism]]", since while "Jews have not been the only group to suffer under this phenomenon&amp;nbsp;... historically Jews have been frequent victims of such violence".&lt;ref name=Abramson/&gt;

[[File:TulsaRaceRiot-1921.png|left|thumb|The 1921 [[Tulsa race riot]], which destroyed the wealthiest black community in the United States, has been described as a pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-reading-ferguson-books-on-race-police-protest-and-us-history-20140818-story.html | title=Reading Ferguson: books on race, police, protest and U.S. history | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term is also used in reference to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of ''pogroms''. Reviewing its uses in scholarly literature, historian [[Werner Bergmann]] proposes that pogroms should be "defined as a ''unilateral, nongovernmental'' form of ''collective'' violence ''initiated by the majority population'' against a largely defenseless ethnic group, and he states that pogroms occur when the ''majority'' expects the state to provide them with no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority,"&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; but he adds that in Western usage, the word's "anti-Semitic overtones" have been retained.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt;  Historian [[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]] supports this, writing that "there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label [pogrom]," but states that the majority of the incidents "habitually" described as pogroms took place in societies significantly divided by ethnicity and/or religion where the violence was committed by the higher-ranking group against a stereotyped lower-ranking group against whom they expressed some complaint, and with the belief that the law of the land would not be used to stop them.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

There is no universally accepted set of characteristics which define the term pogrom.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergmann2/&gt;  Klier writes that "when applied indiscriminately to events in [[Eastern Europe]], the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that 'pogroms' were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features."&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt;  Use of the term pogrom to refer to events in 1918–19 in Polish cities including [[Kielce pogrom (1918)|Kielce]], [[Pinsk massacre|Pinsk]] and [[Lwów pogrom (1918)|Lwów]], was specifically avoided in the 1919 [[Morgenthau Report]] and the word "excesses" was used instead because the authors argued that the use of the term "pogrom" required a situation to be [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] rather than political in nature, which meant that it was inapplicable to the conditions existing in a war zone,&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pietrowski/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pease"/&gt; and media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 [[Crown Heights riot]] caused public controversy.&lt;ref name="JewishWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conaway"/&gt; In 2008, two separate attacks in the [[West Bank]] by [[Israeli Jews|Israeli Jewish]] [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] on [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Arab]]s were characterized as pogroms by then [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Ehud Olmert]].&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;"As a Jew, I was ashamed at the scenes of Jews opening fire at innocent Arabs in Hebron. There is no other definition than the term 'pogrom' to describe what I have seen."[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/settlers-attack-palestinian-village/2008/09/14/1221330653198.html Settlers attack Palestinian village]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7770384.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Olmert condemns settler 'pogrom'|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Werner Bergmann suggests a particularly unifying characteristic of all such incidents: "[b]y the ''collective attribution'' of a threat, the pogrom differs from other forms of violence, such as [[lynching]]s, which are directed at individual members of a minority group, while the ''imbalance of power'' in favor of the rioters distinguishes pogroms from other forms of riot ([[food riot]]s, [[race riot]]s or '[[communal riot]]s' between evenly matched groups); and again, the ''low level of organization'' separates them from [[vigilantism]], [[terrorism]], [[massacre]] and [[genocide]]".&lt;ref name="international"/&gt;

|38||Alexandrian pogrom (name disputed){{efn|Prof. Sandra Gambetti: "A final note on the use of terminology related to anti-Semitism. Scholars have frequently labeled the Alexandrian events of 38 C.E. as the first pogrom{{cn|date=May 2018}} in history and have often explained them in terms of an ''ante litteram'' explosion of anti-Semitism. This work [''The Alexandrian Riots''] deliberately avoids any words or expressions that in any way connect, explicitly or implicitly, the Alexandrian events of 38 C.E. to later events in modern or contemporary Jewish experience, for which that terminology was created. ... To decide whether a word like ''pogrom'', for example, is an appropriate term to describe the events that are studied here, requires a comparative re-discussion of two historical frames—the Alexandria of 38 C.E. and the Russia of the end of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alexandrian Riots of 38 C.E. and the Persecution of the Jews: A Historical Reconstruction |author=Prof. Sandra Gambetti |publisher=BRILL |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdCMH96eKwUC&amp;q=ante+litteram |pages=11–12 |isbn=978-9004138469 |location=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholarly research around the subject has been divided on certain points, including whether the Alexandrian Jews fought to keep their citizenship or to acquire it, whether they evaded the payment of the poll-tax or prevented any attempts to impose it on them, and whether they were safeguarding their identity against the Greeks or against the Egyptians.

The Western Mail's 'London Letter' pointed this out on 28 August 1911, when it stated that 'both the Government and the Jewish leaders think that the Jewish press is betraying an unnecssary amount of alarm, and that it would have been better advised to have treated the attacks upon Jews and their property in Wales as part of a general attack upon persons and property'. Perhaps the most cogent letter on this subject came from Bertam Jacobs, a Welsh-born London barrister who wrote to the South Wales Argus. ... Jacobs pointed out the absurdity of likening the South Wales riots to the Russian pogroms, noting the crucial differences between the two, especially the fact that no Jew was physically assautled, no private house belonging to a Jew was set up, no anti-Semitic cries or slogans were heard, and, especially, no synagogue was attacked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1073091/llgc-id:1082967/llgc-id:1083672/getText|title=Welsh Journals Online -|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ifOnge30CkC&amp;pg=PA82|title=Controversy and Crisis|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;ref name="Bergmann"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A4mqsik_VDcC&amp;pg=PA351 International handbook of violence research, Volume 1 (Springer, 2005)] "The word "pogrom" (from the Russian, meaning storm or devastation) has a relatively short history. Its international currency dates back to the anti-Semitic excesses in Tsarist Russia during the years 1881–1883, but the phenomenon existed in the same form at a much earlier date and was by no means confined to Russia. As John D. Klier points out in his seminal article "The pogrom paradigm in Russian history", the anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia were described by contemporaries as demonstrations, persecution, or struggle, and the government made use of the term besporiadok (unrest, riot) to emphasize the breach of public order. Then, during the twentieth century, the term began to develop along two separate lines. In the Soviet Union, the word lost its anti-Semitic connotation and came to be used for reactionary forms of political unrest and, from 1989, for outbreaks of interethnic violence; while in the West, the anti-Semitic overtones were retained and government orchestration or acquiescence was emphasized."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Bergmann2&gt;Bergmann writes that "the concept of "ethnic violence" covers a range of heterogeneous phenomena, and in many cases there are still no established theoretical and conceptual distinctions in the field (Waldmann, 1995:343)" Bergmann then goes on to set out a variety of conflicting scholarly views on the definition and usage of the term pogrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">In mathematics, the '''Poincaré–Miranda theorem''' is a generalization of the [[intermediate value theorem]], from a single function in a single dimension, to {{mvar|n}} functions in {{mvar|n}} dimensions. It says as follows:

::Consider &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; continuous functions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables, &lt;math&gt;f_1,\ldots, f_n&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that for each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is constantly negative when &lt;math&gt;x_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; and constantly positive when &lt;math&gt;x_i=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a point in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[cube]] &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]^n&lt;/math&gt; in which all functions are ''simultaneously'' equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem is named after [[Henri Poincaré]], who conjectured it in 1883, and [[Carlo Miranda]], who in 1940 showed that it is equivalent to the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kulpa|1997|p=545}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuitive description==
{{Plain image with caption|image=PoincareMiranda.png|caption=A graphical representation of Poincaré–Miranda theorem for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}}|width=350px|align=right|caption position=bottom|triangle=triangle}}
The picture on the right shows an illustration of the Poincaré–Miranda theorem for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}} functions. Consider a couple of functions {{math|(''f'',''g'')}} whose [[Domain of a function|domain of definition]] is the {{math|[-1,+1]{{sup|2}}}} square. The function {{mvar|f}} is negative on the left boundary and positive on the right boundary (green sides of the square), while the function {{mvar|g}} is negative on the lower boundary and positive on the upper boundary (red sides of the square). When we go from left to right along ''any'' path, we must go through a point in which {{mvar|f}} is {{math|0}}. Therefore, there must be a "wall" separating the left from the right, along which {{mvar|f}} is {{math|0}} (green curve inside the square). Similarly, there must be a "wall" separating the top from the bottom, along which {{mvar|g}} is {{math|0}} (red curve inside the square). These walls must intersect in a point in which both functions are {{math|0}} (blue point inside the square).

==Generalizations==
The simplest generalization, as a matter of fact a [[corollary]], of this theorem is the following one. 
For every variable {{math|''x{{sub|i}}''}}, let {{math|''a{{sub|i}}''}} be any value in the range
{{math|[sup{{sub|''x{{sub|i}}''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;0}}&amp;nbsp;''f{{sub|i}}'',&amp;nbsp;inf{{sub|''x{{sub|i}}''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1}}&amp;nbsp;''f{{sub|i}}'']}}.
Then there is a point in the unit cube in which for all {{mvar|i}}: 
:&lt;math&gt;f_i=a_i&lt;/math&gt;.  

The this statement can be reduced to the original one by a simple [[translation of axes]],
:&lt;math&gt;x^\prime_i=x_i\qquad y^\prime_i=y_i-a_i\qquad \forall i\in\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*{{math|''x{{sub|i}}''}} are the [[coordinates]] in the domain of the function
*{{math|''y{{sub|i}}''}} are the coordinates in the [[codomain]] of the function

'''Preventive repression''' is [[political repression]] of political opponents before they actually carry out any activities that would threaten the current political system. The term was used to describe the political methods of the [[Paraguay]] ''[[caudillo]]'' [[Stroessner]], whose methods of "nipping in the bud" the possibilities of any real or imagined unrest were reported at a 1972 Inter-American Defense Board meeting of US and Latin American military.  &lt;ref&gt;James D.  Cockcroft, "Paraguay's Stroessner: An Ultimate Caudillo?", in:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=eVfrobeHtz0C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340&amp;dq=%22preventive+repression%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Qt1UlTGoL&amp;sig=wc2AEeaD1HSiWQ7EXbQ8rjQ-EWA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result p. 340]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Marcuse]], in his work ''[[Counterrevolution and Revolt]]'' operates with the term  "preventive counterrevolution".

Since then, the term has been used to describe actions of other dictatorships.

[[File:7sigma RainGarden 66.JPG|thumb|300px|Business parking lot that drains to a rain garden. The curb retains the asphalt pavement, yet lets water flow off the edges.]]

One of the wide variety of soil-absorption/filter systems, a '''rain garden''', also called a '''stormwater garden''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Application 5th Edition|last=William|first=Marsh|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a designed depression storage or a planted hole that allows [[rainwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious surface|impervious]] [[urban area]]s, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas, the opportunity to be absorbed. The primary purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as [[groundwater]] rather than being sent through [[stormwater]] drains straight out to sea.

The plants—a selection of [[wetland]] edge vegetation, such as [[wildflower]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[fern]]s, [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s—take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in [[Biofilter|biofiltration]].&lt;ref name=wolverton&gt;B.C.

A more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements that can be used to capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property. Thus, the whole garden can become a rain garden, and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself.

==Restoring the water cycle and mitigating urbanization==
{{see|Urbanization}}
In developed areas, natural [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] where [[storm water]] would pool are filled in. The surface of the ground is often [[Regrading|leveled]] or paved. Storm water is directed into [[storm drain]]s which often may cause overflows of [[combined sewer]] systems or poisoning, erosion or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff.&lt;ref name=Kuichling&gt;Kuichling, E. 1889.

[[File:SUNY-ESF-rain-garden-2014-b.jpg|thumb|left|Rain garden, [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry]], Syracuse, New York]]
Rain gardens are often located near a building's roof drainpipe (with or without [[rainwater tank]]s). Most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A [[French drain]] may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural [[water cycle]] displaced by [[urban development]] and allow for [[groundwater]] recharge. While rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may also increase [[Water pollution|pollution]] unless [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] materials are included in the design of the filtration layers.&lt;ref name= Dietz&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11270-005-8266-8 | last1 =  Dietz | first1 = Michael E. | first2 = John C. | last2 = Clausen | year = 2005 | title = A Field Evaluation of Raingarden Flow and Pollutant Treatment | journal = Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution | volume = 167 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 123–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenge of rain garden design centers on calculating the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can handle during storm-water events. This challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust [[native plants]] and encouraging adequate biofiltration, but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce [[redox]] of incoming pollutant streams.

Rain gardens are beneficial for many reasons: improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized [[flood control]], are aesthetically pleasing, and provide interesting planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and [[biodiversity]], tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in attractive and environmentally advantageous ways, and provide significant partial solutions to important environmental problems that affect us all.

A rain garden provides a way to use and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for [[irrigation]]. They allow a household or building to deal with excessive rainwater runoff without burdening the public storm water systems. Rain gardens differ from retention basins, in that the water will infiltrate the ground within a day or two. This creates the advantage that the rain garden does not allow [[mosquito]]es to breed. Compost, rather than soil, has better effects on filtering groundwater and rainwater. Compact lawn soil cannot harbor groundwater nearly as well, because the water simply flows off.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
The first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that occurred before development of an area. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] had the idea to replace the traditional [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMP) pond with a [[bioretention]] area. He approached Larry Coffman, an environmental engineer and the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea.&lt;ref name=urbrun&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Urban Runoff |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |magazine=Nonpoint Source News-Notes |issue=42 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |date=August 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707213649/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a {{convert|300|–|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} rain garden on each house's property.&lt;ref name="marcom"&gt;''Wisconsin Natural Resources'' (magazine). [http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/supps/2003/feb03/run.htm#one “Rain Gardens Made One Maryland Community Famous.”] February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead of a system of [[Curb (road)|curbs]], [[sidewalk]]s, and [[Street gutter|gutters]], which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75–80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event.&lt;ref name=marcom/&gt;

This is also referred to as [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD) in Australia, [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems or SUDS]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] (LID) in the United States, and is cited by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/rain-gardens |title=Rain Gardens |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-04-28 |website=Soak Up the Rain |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''de facto'' rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant LID tool. Any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and retain rain water within the garden so as to drain adjacent land without running off a property is at conception a rain garden—particularly if vegetation is maintained with recognition of its role in this function. Vegetated roadside [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]], now promoted as “[[bioswale]]s”, remain the conventional drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world.

What is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make [[sustainable development]] possible. This is as true for wealthy developed communities retrofitting [[bioretention]] into built stormwater management systems, as for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path.

==Characteristics==
[[File:2006NeighborsNewRG2.JPG|thumb|A home rain garden recently planted]]
A rain garden requires an area where water can collect and [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]], and plants to maintain infiltration rates, diverse microbe communities, and water holding capacity. This way the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[Bird|birds]], and beneficial [[Insect|insects]]. [[Transpiration]] by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms. This includes any plant extending roots to the garden area.

Simply adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens may be all that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off one's roof than people realize. Thus, rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation after the required location and storage capacity of the garden area are determined.

===Soil and drainage===
When an area's soils are not [[Permeability (fluid)|permeable]] enough to allow water to drain and filter properly, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed. This bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% [[sand]], 20% [[compost]], and 20% [[topsoil]], and there is a current trend to replace compost with [[biochar]]. The former non-permeable soil needs to be removed and replaced. The sandy soil (bioretention) mixture cannot be combined with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content because the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, according to a 1983 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212091532/http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. But, it also indicates that pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least .25 in/hour. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable City Network, Dubuque, IA (2011-02-21).[http://www.sustainablecitynetwork.com/topic_channels/water/article_b65fe518-3de0-11e0-82aa-00127992bc8b.html "USGS: Rain Gardens Work Regardless of Soil Conditions."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a [[drywell]] with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an [[infiltration basin]] defeating its purpose. [[Depression-focused recharge]] of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high [[water table]]. In some cases lined [[bioretention]] cells with [[subsurface drainage]] are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.

Rain gardens are at times confused with [[bioswale]]s. [[Swale (geographical feature)|Swales]] slope to a destination, while rain gardens do not; however, a bioswale may end with a rain garden. Drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series, saving time and money on maintenance. Part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a [[water garden]], [[wetland]], or pond, and not a rain garden. Using the proper terminology ensures that the proper methods are used to achieve the desired results.

===Plants===
Although specific plants are selected and designed for respective soils and climates,&lt;ref name="dussa"&gt;Dussaillant et al. [http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?140904] Journal of Hydrologic Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; plants that can tolerate both saturated and dry soil are typically used for the rain garden. They need to have minimal maintenance to survive, and be compatible with adjacent land use.

Native and adapted plants are the examples of such plants that are generally used. They are more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment.

Trees under power lines, or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist, or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage. Trees generally contribute most when located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression, yet do not excessively shade the garden. That said, shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of habitat. Plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time because heat drives out [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation.

Bamboo is another plant that works particularly well since it can clean water 27.6% better than domestic plants like grass or clovers. Rice, although it is hard to grow and maintain, works even better.

The '''Signorelli parapraxis''' represents the first and best known example of a [[parapraxis]] and its analysis in [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]''. The parapraxis centers on a [[Anomic aphasia|word finding]] problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name ([[Luca Signorelli|Signorelli]]) of the painter of the [[Orvieto]] frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters [[Botticelli]] and [[Boltraffio]]. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others.
 
==Botticelli - Boltraffio - Trafoi==
One important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village [[Trafoi]] where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through [[Bosnia-Herzegowina]].
 
The second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word ''signor'' from the forgotten name Signorelli. ''Herr'', the German counterpart of ''Signor'', is then linked to Herzegowina and the word ''Herr'' occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation.

Freud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. [[Jacques Lacan]] suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting.

==Trafoi in Kraepelin's dream==
The first critique to Freud came from [[Emil Kraepelin]], who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on [[dream speech|language disturbances in dreams]], relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism ''Trafei'', which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian ''trofei'' is associated to ''Trafei'' in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of ''trofei'' reads in German ''Siegeszeichen'' (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin ''signum'' clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;22-24).

==Sebastiano Timpanaro==
In ''The Freudian Slip'' [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]] discusses Freud's  analysis in chapter 6 "Love and Death at Orvieto." (p.&amp;nbsp;63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a major role during the parapraxis, as he states: "Boltraffio is a ''Schlimbesserung'' [that is a substitute worse than another substitute]" and adds "the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault."(p.&amp;nbsp;71). He calls Botticelli an "involuntary banalization" and Boltraffio "a semi-conscious disimproved correction."(p.&amp;nbsp;75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: "The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of ''signor'' from Signorelli and of ''Her(r)'' from Herzegowina is another."

==Swales' investigation==
[[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]] (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in [[Bergamo]] mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name [[Da Vinci]], another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on ''[[Piazza della Scala]]'' in [[Milan]] some days before his visit to [[Bergamo]]), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.

==Freud neglected his own observation==
[[File:Luca signorelli, cappella di san brizio, predica e punizione dell'anticristo 01.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Fresco of the Deeds of the Antichrist]]
Freud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos. The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The "signature"  can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb ''signare'' and this word, instead of Freud's ''signore'', then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations (''Bo'' and ''Herr'') Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's [[self-esteem]]). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis ''during'' Freud's trip from Ragusa to [[Trebinje]] (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales. {{fact|date=June 2016}}

'''Philip Jaisohn''' (January 7, 1864 – January 5, 1951) was the anglicized name used by '''Soh Jaipil''' ({{korean|labels=no|서재필|{{linktext|徐|載|弼}}}}), a noted champion for Korea's [[Korean independence movement|independence]], journalist, the first Korean to become a naturalized citizen of the [[United States]], and the founder of the first [[Korea]]n newspaper in [[Hangul]], the [[Tongnip Sinmun|Independent News]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segye.com/Articles/NEWS/SOCIETY/Article.asp?aid=20110407005238&amp;subctg1=&amp;subctg2= 서재필 박사 60주기 추모제, 8일 보성 기념공원서 열려] The Segyenews 2011.04.07 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the organizers of the [[Gapsin Coup]] in 1884 as well as the 1896 to 1898 civil rights movement and other [[suffrage]] movements. However, when the [[Gapsin Coup]] failed, he took refuge in the United States, where he became a medical doctor. During his time in the United States he became the first Korean to gain [[United States|American]] citizenship. From 1895 to 1898 he returned to [[Korea]] as chief adviser to the [[Joseon dynasty]] government and returned from 1945 to 1948 as chief adviser to the American occupation forces in the south. His nicknames were Songjae ({{korean|labels=no|송재|松齋}}) and Ssang-gyeong ({{korean|labels=no|쌍경|雙慶}}), his [[courtesy name]] was '''Yun-gyeong''' ({{korean|labels=no|윤경|允卿}}) and he wrote under the [[pen name]] '''N.H. Osia'''.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Soh Jaipil was born in [[Boseong County]], [[Joseon|Korea]]. His family was one of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]'s noble families. He was the second son of a Soh Kwang-hyo (also known as Soh Kwang-ha), who was a local magistrate in [[Boseong County]]. He was raised by one of his relatives in [[Seoul]]. At eight years of age, he was adopted by Soh Kwang-ha, the second cousin of his biological father Soh Kwang-hyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=1593&amp;docId=574510&amp;mobile&amp;categoryId=1593 Soh Jaipil] {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soh's family was from the upper echelons of Joseon Society. He was the eight generation descendant of [[Seo Jong-je]], a daughter to [[Queen Jeongseong]]. She was the wife to the 21st King [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]]. [[Seo Kwang-bum]], who shared similar ideological beliefs was also from his family.

During his adolescence Soh studied at [[Kim Seong-geun]] and [[Park Kyu-su]]'s private school. When Soh was a teenager, he had already been exposed to the reformist ideals of [[Kim Ok-gyun]].

===Political activist===
{{Main|Gapsin Coup}}
He passed the [[Gwageo|civil service exam]] at the age of 18, becoming one of the youngest people to ever pass this exam. As a result, he became a junior officer in 1882. Thereafter he was appointed to Gyoseokwan Bujeongja ({{korean|labels=no|교서관 부정자|校書館 副正字}}) and Seungmunwon Gajuseo ({{korean|labels=no|승문원 가주서|承文院假主書}}). In 1883 he was appointed to Seungmunwon Bujeongja ({{korean|labels=no|승문원 부정자|承文院 副正字}}) and Hunryunwon Bubongsa ({{korean|labels=no|훈련원 부봉사|訓鍊院 副奉事}}). In the following year, he was sent to Japan where he studied both at the Keio Gijuku (the forerunner of the [[Keio University]]) and the [[Toyama Army Academy]]. In July 1884, his adoptive mother  died, but he quickly returned to public service under special orders.

In his reports to the king, Soh explained that in the new world Korea's armed forces were useless and obsolete. This annoyed powerful conservatives, but it made Soh widely known and respected among like-minded young intellectuals. By that time, a small but growing number of young intellectuals understood that fundamental reform had to occur or Korea would fall victim to the imperialist powers.&lt;ref name="tistir"&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/07/363_101797.html (20) Seo Jae-pil: pioneering reformer, independence fighter] koreatimes 2011.12.28 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was appointed to Joryeon-guk Sagwanjang ({{korean|labels=no|조련국 사관장|操鍊局 士官長}}).

In December 1884, Soh, following [[Kim Ok-gyun]], was involved in the [[Gapsin Coup]], a radical attempt to overturn the old regime and establish equality among people. Soh and [[Kim Ok-gyun]], [[Park Yeong-hyo]], [[Yun Chi-ho]], [[Hong Yeong-shik]], and others had planned a coup for seven months, from July to December 1884. He was appointed the Vice-Minister of Defense. The coup was defeated in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops. As a result, his two younger brothers were killed and his biological father Soh Kwang-ha and biological mother Lady Lee of Seongju were executed under a guilt-by-association system. His first wife Lady Kim was sold into slavery, but committed suicide. Convicted of treason, Soh Jaipil lost his whole family and had to flee Korea to save his life.

The majority of the 1884 revolutionaries fled to Japan. Unlike them, Soh moved to the United States. He saw Japan as essentially a conduit for Western knowledge and ideas, but preferred to deal with what he saw as the source itself.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

===Exile in the United States===
[[File:Philip Jaisohn's Graduation from Columbia Medical College 1892.jpg|thumb|196x196px|Graduation from Columbia Medical College (1892)]][[File:Philip Jaisohn and Muriel Armstrong in 1930's.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Philip Jaisohn and Muriel Armstrong, 1930s]]

In 1885, early in his stay in America Soh worked part-time jobs. In 1886, Soh lived in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], and attended the Harry Hillman Academy (Wilkes-Barre, PA) thanks to the help of John Welles Hollenback. He began to use the name "Philip Jaisohn" at that time. In 1890, he became the first Korean immigrant to acquire United States citizenship. He studied medicine at Columbia Medical College (now [[George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences]]), and was the first Korean to receive an American medical degree in 1892.{{r|fnd|kt|LFT}}

In 1890, he became a U.S. citizen and from then he was often referred to by his American name Philip Jaisohn.

In 1894, he married Muriel Armstrong, a distant relative of the former president of the United States, [[James Buchanan]], and daughter of [[George B. Armstrong]], credited as the founder of the U.S. [[Railway Mail Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/rms/history/1864-1875.html|title=A Fast Start, 1864–1875|publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two daughters, Stephanie and Muriel. In 1895, he was pardoned by the Joseon government, but he flatly refused to return.

===The Independent===
[[Image:독립신문 1897.04.07 금요일자.gif|274x274px|thumb|right|''The Independent'']][[File:Seo Jp &amp; Muriel Jaisohn &amp; Kim Ks.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Soh Jaipil and his daughter Muriel, [[Kim Kyu-sik]], in [[Incheon]](1947)]]{{Main|Tongnip Sinmun}}
In 1894, [[Japan]] defeated China in the [[First Sino-Japanese war]] which occurred on the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The Korean cabinet was filled with reformists. Along with these political changes, the treason of the [[Gapsin Coup]] was pardoned enabling Jaisohn's return in 1895. In December 1895, he went to [[Incheon]]. The Joseon government wanted to appoint him to Foreign Secretary but he refused to take the position. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. Jaisohn published a newspaper, ''The Independent'' (독립신문), to transform the Korean population into an informed citizenry. He was the first to print his newspaper entirely in Hangul to extend readership to lower classes and women.

===Sowing the ideals of independence and democracy===
[[File:Independence Gate in 1897.jpg|thumb|198x198px|[[Independence Gate]]]]
{{Main|Independence Club|Independence Gate}}
In the 1896 to 1898 Civil rights movement and suffrage movements. Soh's goal was to ensure that Korea would drift away from the Chinese sphere of influence but without falling too heavily under the influence of Russia or Japan. He was also behind the construction of the Independence Gate, which was initially meant to symbolize the end of Korea's ritual subordination to China.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;  Apart from his journalistic and political activities, he delivered regular lectures on modern politics and the principles of [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

He promoted national independence as the principal political ideal and emphasized neutral diplomatic approaches to protect Korea from China, Russia and Japan. He also underscored the importance of public education, modernized industry and public hygiene. The Independence was particularly critical of misconduct by government officials, which caused strong reactions by the conservatives. Under the aegis of the [[Independence Club]] ({{korean|labels=no|독립협회|獨立協會}}), Jaisohn organized the All People's Congress, an open public forum to debate over political issues. The Congress was hailed by young reformers and began to establish nationwide chapters.

In November 1897, Soh enabled the construction of the [[Independence Gate]] (독립문;獨立門).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=50661&amp;yy=2007 역사속의 오늘-독립문 완공] imail 2007.11.20 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he also ended the policy of [[Yeongeunmun]] (영은문;迎恩門).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/201005/h2010051721354086330.htm 독립문에 대한 오해와 진실] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920235952/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/201005/h2010051721354086330.htm |date=2012-09-20 }} The Hanguk Ilbo {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeongeunmun  was the [[Korea]]n policy of welcoming the Chinese envoys, Yeongeun roughly translates from Korean to English as "Welcome to beneficent Envoys of suzerain's."

In 1898, conservatives accused Jaisohn and the Club of seeking to replace the monarchy with a republic, and the Korean government requested Jaisohn to return to the US. After his return, the Korean government ordered the Club to disband and arrested 17 leaders including [[Rhee Syngman]].

=== Clerk and Company manage ===
In April to August 1898, he accompanied an army to the [[Spanish–American War]]. In 1899 he found employment as clerk for the [[University of Pennsylvania Hospital]].

In 1904, worked with Harold Deemer, who was a year younger, to create the "Deemer and Jaisohn shop". It was a stationery and printing industry store. In 1915, the shop became called the Philip Jaisohn Company, and specialized in the printing industry.

=== Independence movements ===
In the [[United States]], Jaisohn conducted medical research at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and later became a successful printer in [[Philadelphia]]. When he heard the news of the [[March 1st Movement]] (1919), a nationwide protest against Japanese rule in Korea, Jaisohn convened the "First Korean Congress", which was held in Philadelphia for three days. After the Congress, Jaisohn devoted his energies and private property to the freedom of Korea. He organized the League of Friends of Korea in 26 cities with the help of Rev. [[Floyd Tomkins]], and established the "Korean Information Bureau." He published a political journal "Korea Review" to inform the [[United States|American]] public of the situation in Korea, and to persuade the [[U.S. government]] to support the freedom for [[Koreans]].

In the 1920s, Soh, who had just turned 60, returned to research and spent his 60s and 70s working as a specialist doctor and micro-biologist, as well as occasionally publishing in peer-review academic journals.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

Five years later in 1924, Jaisohn went legally bankrupt due to his political engagement and had to resume practicing medicine to make a living. At age 62, he became a student again at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to renew his medical knowledge. After this, he published five research articles in the medical journals specializing in pathology. During World War II, he volunteered as a physical examination officer with the belief that the victory of the U.S. would bring freedom to Korea.

===Last days in Korea===

Jaisohn returned to Korea once again after [[surrender of Japan|Japan's defeat]] in [[World War II]]. The [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. Army Military Government]] in control of the southern part of Korea invited him to serve as chief adviser. In December 1946, he was elected to the Interim Legislative Assembly ({{korean|labels=no|남조선과도입법의원|南朝鮮過渡立法議院}}). In May 1945, liberal and moderate socialist intellectuals selected him as candidate for presidency, but he declined. When the date of the first presidential election was confirmed by the [[United Nations]], Jaisohn was petitioned to run for presidency by 3,000 people including a young [[Kim Dae-jung]], but he refused in the end.

Jaisohn felt that political unity was needed for a new nation despite his uneasy relationship with the president elect [[Syngman Rhee]]. He decided to return to the United States in 1948. Suffering a [[heart attack]] a week earlier on December 29, Jaisohn died on January 5, 1951 during the Korean War, just two days before his 87th birthday.

His body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in [[Bib church]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1994 his remains were repatriated to [[South Korea]]. His ashes were buried in the [[National Cemetery of South Korea]] in [[Seoul]].

==Philip Jaisohn Memorial House==
[[File:Jaisohn House Media.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Philip Jaisohn Memorial House]]
The Philip Jaisohn Memorial House in [[Media, Pennsylvania]] was Dr. Jaisohn's home from 1925 to 1951. This house was bought when Dr. Jaisohn was in great financial difficulties, while his house in Philadelphia was pledged due to his devotion to the Korean independence. His Media home was acquired by the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation in 1987 and opened to the public in 1990. Since then, the Jaisohn House has been visited by many students and politicians from Korea such as former [[President of South Korea|South Korean president]] and Nobel peace laureate [[Kim Dae-jung]] as well as Korean American immigrants and community neighbors.

On May 21, 1994, the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] and the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation dedicated a [[List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Delaware County|historical marker]] for Dr. Jaisohn, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;American-educated medical doctor who sowed seeds of democracy in Korea, published its first modern newspaper (1896-98), and popularized its written language. The first Korean to earn a Western medical degree and become a U.S. citizen. He worked for Korean independence during the Japanese occupation, 1910-45. Chief Advisor to the U.S. Military Government in Korea, 1947-1948. This was his home for 25 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While studies have shown the effects of [[solitary confinement]] to be detrimental to some inmates, '''solitary confinement of women''' has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the [[United States]] are roughly comparable to those for men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/|title=FAQ|date=2012-01-31|website=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career. Conversely, solitary confinement has also has a very positive effect on women. This article explores both sides of the argument.

== Incidence ==
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Solitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bottos, Shauna. 2007. ''Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature''. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2001-01-01|title=Telling the Story: A Study in the Segregation of Women Prisoners|jstor=29768065|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=196–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. 2014. “Worse Than Second-Class: Solitary Confinement of Women in the United States.” Retrieved May 2, 2016 (https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/worse_than_second-class.pdf).
&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disciplinary segregation ===
An offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wichmann, Cherami and Kelly Taylor. 2004. ''Federally Sentenced Women in Administrative Segregation: A Descriptive Analysis''. Research Report No. R-158. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preasmyer|first=Amy|date=2014|title=Together we can make a difference|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Administrative segregation ===
Administrative segregation, or “ad seg," is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rojo|first=Misty|date=2014|title=Solitary Torture in Women’s Prisons|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Voluntary ====
Women prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2006-01-01|title=TO BE, ONE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE: Spatio—temporality in Prison Segregation|jstor=23639455|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=587–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary ====
Women prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Women put in segregation ===
In general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaylor, Cassandra. 1998. “It's Like Living in A Black Hole: Women of Color and Solitary Confinement in the Prison Industrial Complex.” ''New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement'' 385:390-420.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Arkles, Gabriel. 2009. "Safety and Solidarity Across Gender Lines: Rethinking Segregation of Transgender People in Detention." Temple ''Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review'' 18(2):515-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Consequences for women ==
Solitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They “experience segregation ''as women''”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
Being put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to [[claustrophobia]], anger, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[hallucinations]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=The Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766384|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=Follow-Up Report on the Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766385|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Fire Inside'' magazine, written by offenders in California women’s prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehorn|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Surviving Solitary|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

All of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===
Women in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in [[sexual harassment]] ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women’s right to the privacy of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is [[sexualization|sexualized]] and humiliating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some prisons, women in segregation wear a "[[Babydoll|baby doll]]," a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Beyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be especially devastating for women whose [[mental state]]s are already deteriorating, due to prior [[mental illness]] or to the effects of being in segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional [[sanitary napkin|sanitary pads]] during their menstrual periods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to ''The Fire Inside'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Separation from children ===
Women are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.

=== Reentry ===
Women who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As one California prisoner who wrote for ''The Fire Inside'' prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Stages of the SHU|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive effects ==
Solitary confinement is also known to have very positive effects on women. For example, ones needs are taken care of as food, shelter and a warm place to sleep are provided for the women. Moreover, a small solitary confinement cell is usually locked by a door or by bars, meaning that they are safe and secure from other violent inmates. Security survellance ensures that a female solitary confinement inmate has the highest welfare standards avaliable to them. Many women begin to love their solitary confinement cell and take comfort in the fact they are being taken care of. &lt;ref&gt;Solitarie en femme, K.Chould p.33-54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in solitary confinement ==
In general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margo|first=Schlanger,|date=2013-01-01|title=Prison Segregation: Symposium Introduction and Preliminary Data on Racial Disparities|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/461/|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5433|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12|website=www.bjs.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Representations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerness|first=Bonnie|last2=Lewey|first2=Jamie Bissonette|date=2014-01-01|title=Race and the Politics of Isolation in U.S. Prisons|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgender inmates in solitary confinement ==
[[Transgender]] or [[gender variance|gender nonconforming]] people are overrepresented in prisons, especially transgender people of color. This could be partly due to the fact that they are disproportionately homeless or living in poverty, conditions which more often lead to incarceration, and because they are targeted by the police and perceived as violent or sexually promiscuous (transgender women in particular). These misconceptions can also be used as reasons that guards place transgender inmates in solitary confinement. The issues that cisgender women face in prisons in general and in solitary confinement in particular can be exacerbated for transgender women, and for transgender men as well. For example, transgender inmates are much more likely to be sexually assaulted than their [[cisgender]] counterparts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Allegedly to protect against this kind of thing, transgender offenders are often put into solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Transgender women are sometimes put in male prisons and then separated from the general prison population and put in “protective custody,” which functions in the same ways as solitary confinement,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and in fact transgender inmates are sometimes put into segregation facilities that have worse conditions than the ones that cisgender inmates are in.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edney|first=Richard|date=2004-11-01|title=TO KEEP ME SAFE FROM HARM? TRANSGENDER PRISONERS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF IMPRISONMENT|url=https://ojs.deakin.edu.au/index.php/dlr/article/view/247|journal=Deakin Law Review|volume=9|issue=2|pages=328–338|issn=1835-9264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to be for their own safety, since most harassment and assault comes from other prisoners. However, this does not prevent the violence perpetrated by prison guards. Further, while transgender women are often put into confinement to keep them from becoming victims of violence, they are sometimes held near inmates who have been put into confinement because of past violent actions, and then experience violence from those inmates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Being in solitary confinement can have consequences for transgender women’s mental and physical health, in particular because transgender people are already more likely to suffer from depression or other mental illness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prisoners, and especially those in solitary confinement, do not always have access to the necessary medications, and transgender people specifically are often denied access to the hormones that they take.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Transgender inmates in some prisons are able to form communities with each other or with cisgender inmates, and these relationships both help prevent violence and help support those who have experienced it. Studies have been reported in which men have bonded together to prevent a transgender woman in their facility from being sexually assaulted, and to help transgender women get access to medication they needed. These groups sometimes commit violent acts to defend or avenge a friend who has been hurt, as in the case in a New York men’s prison when a group of men killed another man who had attacked a young female transgender inmate; however, despite this violence, it is evident that transgender women sometimes form strong and protective bonds with other inmates that are taken away in solitary confinement. In fact, this is sometimes the purpose of segregating inmates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Despite all this, some transgender women, just like some cisgender women, do in fact request to be put into solitary confinement for their own safety. This is not the norm, however, and most women find it to be a painful and harmful experience.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5950">'''Stochastic frontier analysis''' (SFA) is a method of [[Model (economics)|economic modeling]].  It has its starting point in the [[stochastic]] production frontier models simultaneously introduced by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977).

The ''production frontier model'' without random component can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;y_i  = f(x_i ;\beta ) \cdot TE_i&lt;/math&gt;
the best 
where ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed scalar output of the producer ''i'', ''i=1,..I, x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a vector of ''N'' inputs used by the producer ''i'', ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, β)'' is the production frontier, and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of technology parameters to be estimated.

''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the technical efficiency defined as the ratio of observed output to maximum feasible output.
''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1'' shows that the ''i-th'' firm obtains the maximum feasible output, while ''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1'' provides a measure of the shortfall of the observed output from maximum feasible output.

A stochastic component that describes random shocks affecting the production process is added. These shocks are not directly attributable to the producer or the underlying technology. These shocks may come from weather changes, economic adversities or plain luck. We denote these effects with &lt;math&gt;\exp \left\{ {v_i } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Each producer is facing a different shock, but we assume the shocks are random and they are described by a common distribution.

The stochastic production frontier will become:

&lt;math&gt;y_i  = f(x_i ;\beta ) \cdot TE_i  \cdot \exp \left\{ {v_i } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume that ''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also a stochastic variable, with a specific distribution function, common to all producers.

We can also write it as an exponential &lt;math&gt;TE_i  = \exp \left\{ { - u_i } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0'', since we required ''TE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1''. Thus, we obtain the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;y_i  = f(x_i ;\beta ) \cdot  \exp \left\{ { - u_i } \right\}   \cdot \exp \left\{ {v_i } \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we also assume that ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, β)'' takes the log-linear [[Cobb–Douglas]] form, the model can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\ln y_i  = \beta _0  + \sum\limits_n {\beta _n \ln x_{ni}  + v_i  - u_i } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the “noise” component, which we will almost always consider as a two-sided [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] variable, and ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the non-negative technical inefficiency component. Together they constitute a compound [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error term]], with a specific distribution to be determined, hence the name of “composed error model” as is often referred.

Stochastic Frontier Analysis has examined also "cost" and "profit" efficiency (see Kumbhakar &amp; Lovel 2003). The "Cost frontier" approach attempts to measure how far from full-cost minimization (i.e. cost-efficiency) is the firm. Modeling-wise, the non-negative cost-inefficiency component is added rather than subtracted in the stochastic specification. "Profit frontier analysis" examines the case where producers are treated as profit-maximizers (both output and inputs should be decided by the firm) and not as cost-minimizers, (where level of output is considered as exogenously given). The specification here is similar with the "production frontier" one.

Stochastic Frontier Analysis has also been applied in micro data of consumer demand in an attempt to benchmark consumption and segment consumers. In a two-stage approach, a stochastic frontier model is estimated and subsequently deviations from the frontier are regressed on consumer characteristics (Baltas 2005).

==Extensions: The two-tier stochastic frontier model==
Polacheck &amp; Yoon (1987) have introduced a three-component error structure, where one non-negative error term is added to, while the other is subtracted from, the zero-mean symmetric random disturbance. This modeling approach attempts to measure the impact of informational inefficiencies (incomplete and imperfect information) on the prices of realized transactions, inefficiencies that in most cases characterize both parties in a transaction (hence the two inefficiency components, to disentangle the two effects).

Recently, various non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches were proposed in the literature, where no parametric assumption on the functional form of production relationship is made, see for example Parmeter and Kumbhakar (2014) and  Park, Simar and Zelenyuk (2015) &lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jproda/v43y2015i2p199-214.html  Park, B., Simar, L. and V. Zelenyuk (2015) "Categorical data in local maximum likelihood: theory and applications to productivity analysis," Journal of Productivity Analysis 43:2, pp. 199-214.]&lt;/ref&gt; and references cited therein.

[[File:Feminine Hygiene Products in a Walmart.png|thumb|Feminine hygiene products are subject to tax in a number of countries]]
A '''tampon tax''' is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that [[tampons]]—and other [[feminine hygiene]] products—are subject to [[value-added tax]], unlike the [[tax exemption]] status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, [[sanitary napkins]], [[menstrual cups]] and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt.

Proponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, [[tax exempt]] necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; The [[BBC]] estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use [[feminine hygiene]] products for about a week each month for about 30 years.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; While [[sales tax]] policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general [[consumption tax]] on sanitary products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, [[condoms]] included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and "[[feminine hygiene]] is not a choice".&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women.&lt;ref name="Hinckley Journal of Politics:Public Discourse of Policies Concerning Menstrual Taboo"/&gt; The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;

After the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.

* Slovakia levies a 20% tax on sanitary products—the basic goods rate. A Slovakian film director commented that there are no plans to change the law and that east Europe missed elements of feminist change while living under communist government.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom has levied a [[value-added tax (United Kingdom)|value-added tax]] on sanitary products since it joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from [[Member of Parliament]] [[Dawn Primarolo]] saying that this reduction was "about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity."&lt;ref name="theweek: UK News"/&gt; This is the lowest rate possible under the [[European Union]]'s [[European Union value added tax|value added tax law]], which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The [[UK Independence Party]] raised the issue in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was "long-standing" and a complicated issue within the European Union.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/plan-international-uks-research-on-period-poverty-and-stigma|title=Plan International UK's Research on Period Poverty and Stigma|last=|first=|date=December 20, 2017|website=Plan International UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/one-in-10-young-women-struggle-to-afford-pads-and-tampons-a8008671.html|title=Period Poverty: Why One in 10 Young Women Struggle to Afford Pads and Tampons|last=Rowlingson|first=Karen|date=October 21, 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Coryton]] led a "Stop taxing periods, period" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products.&lt;ref name="Coryton"/&gt; [[George Osborne]] mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 [[Autumn Statement]] pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful [[clicktivism]],&lt;ref name="Clicktivism"/&gt; with over 320,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_student"/&gt; In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_Cameron"/&gt; It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 October 2018|author=Nosheena Mobarik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In July 2017, a pilot program began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/access-sanitary-products-aberdeen-pilot-evaluation-report/pages/2/|title=Access to sanitary products Aberdeen pilot: evaluation report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot scheme was launched for six months in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], with £42,500 of funding from the devolved [[Scottish Government]] in order to address the growing scandal of "period poverty". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; and Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative.

Further to this half year pilot program, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. Scotland is the first country to ban period poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-43148080/period-poverty-helping-homeless-and-vulnerable-women |title=Period poverty: Helping homeless and vulnerable women - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2018-02-26 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products.

In the United States, almost all states tax "tangible individual property" but exempt non-luxury "necessities": groceries, [[medical prescription|prescriptions]], [[prosthetics]], agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes—the exemptions vary between states.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and {{As of|2018|11|lc=yes}}, ten states specifically exempted essential hygiene products (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/these-are-the-u-s-states-that-tax-women-for-having-per-1793848102|title=These are the U.S. states that tax women for having periods|last=Hillin|first=Taryn|work=Splinter|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ktnv.com/news/national/democracy-2018/election-results-2018-nevada-ballot-questions-1-6|title=Election Results 2018: Nevada Ballot Questions 1-6|work=KNTV|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten states have dropped the tampon tax — Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, according to NPR and CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz |first=Andrea |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/health/nevada-tampon-tax-repealed-trnd/index.html |title=Nevada becomes the 10th state to eliminate 'pink tax' on menstrual products |publisher=CNN |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In January 2018, California rejected a proposal to eliminate tampon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=2 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) don’t allow the use of an EBT for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices.  The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2018/08/14/lack-feminine-hygiene-products-keeps-girls-out-school/948313002/|title=Teen girls are missing school because they don't have access to feminine hygiene products|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some changes to the tampon taxes but most of these changes are state level or by city. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax. 

==== California ====
California Assemblywoman [[Cristina Garcia (politician)|Cristina Garcia]] reported that California women each pay roughly [[US$]]7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and [[Ling Ling Chang]] proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this period, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed "for being women" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was "regulatory discrimination" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to [[taboo|social taboos]] against discussing menstruation.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Both houses of the [[California State Legislature]] voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016,&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, [[Jerry Brown]], three months later.&lt;ref name="Reuters: Cali veto"/&gt;

California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co-authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/theres-no-happy-hour-for-menstruation-tax-liquor-instead-of-tampons-lawmakers-say/?utm_term=.f1b7dfe6354e|title='There's no happy hour for menstruation': Tax liquor instead of tampons, lawmakers say|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=March 13, 2017|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, California State Legislature passed AB 10 requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10|title=Bill Text  - AB-10 Feminine hygiene products: public school restrooms.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/TA/AC/PL/tier1.asp|title=Tier I Schools - Persistently Lowest-Achieving Schools (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.waxie.com/ab10-menstrual-care|title=AB10 Menstrual Care {{!}} Waxie Sanitary Supply|last=Supply|first=WAXIE Sanitary|website=info.waxie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hospeco.com/assets/user/documents/HSC_school_rules_L-HSC-0113-S_online.pdf|title=Do you know the new school rules?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hospeco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York ====
In July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY" /&gt; Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_Why" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff_Florida" /&gt;

==== New Jersey ====
A 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that "repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotropia|first=Christopher Anthony|last2=Rozema|first2=Kyle|date=2017|title=Who Would Benefit from Repealing Tampon Taxes? Empirical Evidence from New Jersey|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2999970|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2999970|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004-2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.

== Activism ==
Supporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts "menstrual equity", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. 

Free the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/new-york-city-bill-to-call-for-free-tampons-in-public-restrooms-shelters-and-jails/|title=New York City Bill to Call for Free Tampons in Public School Restrooms, Shelters and Jails|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|work=Well|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol features three [[hare]]s or [[rabbit]]s chasing each other in a circle. Like the [[triskelion]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"/&gt; the [[triquetra]], and their antecedents (e.g., the [[triple spiral]]), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold [[rotational symmetry]]. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the [[lunar phase|lunar cycle]]. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the [[Trinity]]. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

Another appears on an ancient Islamic-made [[reliquary]] from southern Russia. Another 13th or early 14th century box, later used as a reliquary, was made in [[Iran]] under [[Mongol]] rule, and is preserved in the treasury of the [[Cathedral of Trier]] in Germany. On its base, the casket has Islamic designs, and originally featured two images of the three hares.

One theory pertaining to the spread of the motif is that it was transported from China across Asia and as far as the south west of England by merchants travelling the [[silk road]] and that the motif was transported via designs found on expensive [[Chinese ceramics|Oriental ceramics]]. This view is supported by the early date of the surviving occurrences in China. However, the majority of representations of the three hares in churches occur in England and northern Germany. This supports a contrary view that the three hares occurred independently as English or early German symbols.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puzzle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | title=The Three Rabbits and Similar Puzzles | author=Singmaster, David |date = August 2004| accessdate=November 11, 2008| publisher=threehares.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918164613/http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | archivedate=18 September 2008 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the Devon name, Tinners' Rabbits, is related to local [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin miners]] adopting it. The mines generated wealth in the region and funded the building and repair of many local churches, and thus the symbol may have been used as a sign of the miners' patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/three_hares.htm | title=The Tinner's Rabbits | author=Sandles, Tim | publisher=Legendary Dartmoor | date=23 November 2007 | accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ornament (architecture)|architectural ornament]] of the three hares also occurs in churches that are unrelated to the miners of South West England.  Other occurrences in England include floor tiles at [[Chester Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7gmsuBKphC0J:www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/visiting/heritage/archaeology/idoc.ashx%3Fdocid%3Da1e344d2-e034-4e75-be85-98ed4ece781f%26version%3D-1+three+hares+chester&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgMqXBfw-mvBT3_AZ5KnzDpUjwT5pik-gSyTJI6wpQXn4Od5hI10k54W8sUz9qhk-acrzKxQAWpiY7q1Bq8FQExwnvVsWobptu9pvl3a84IMS8dra-D4mghOq4E-Cch5GefRNTM&amp;sig=AHIEtbRIEWcY1KRQp2amOyhcsuPLrEwDcQ | title=The archaeology of Cheshire West and Chester in ten objects }}&lt;/ref&gt; stained glass at [[Long Melford]], Suffolk&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;At the [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]], above the northern door, is a small stained glass [[roundel]], only a few inches in diameter.  {{cite web|url=http://www.theukcuriosityblog.com/look/photo/the-three-hares-window-a-medieval-mystery|title=The three hares window: a medieval mystery|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918035853/http://www.theukcuriosityblog.com/look/photo/the-three-hares-window-a-medieval-mystery|archivedate=18 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ceiling in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

==In Christianity==
The motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval European churches, particularly in France (''e.g.'', in the [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]] in [[Lyon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourhares.com/ |title=Three Hares at Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, four hares, and three hares and three wolves, elsewhere. photographs and drawing |publisher=Fourhares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of [[Devon]], England. The motif appears in [[illuminated manuscripts]],&lt;ref name="|Terrier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trois-lievres.skyrock.com/ |title=Three hares and their ears commune (''Trois lièvres à oreilles communes'') |first2=Tom (Archaeologist and historian)|last2=Greeves |first3=Sue (researcher)|last3=Andrew |first1=Michel |last1=Terrier |language=French |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; architectural [[wood carving]], [[stone carving]], window [[tracery]] and [[stained glass]]. In South Western England there are over thirty recorded examples of the three hares appearing on '[[roof boss]]es' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] churches in [[Devon]], (particularly [[Dartmoor]]). There is a good example of a roof boss of the three hares at [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widecombe-in-the-moor.com/history/minutes/2005/the_three_hares.php |first1=Tom, Dr. |last1=Greeves |first2=Sue |last2=Andrews |first3=Chris |last3=Chapman |title=From China to Widecombe: The Extraordinary Journey of The Three Hares |publisher=Widecombe-in-the-Moor |accessdate=24 April 2012 |date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmoor, with another in the town of [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] on the edge of the moor. The [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] occurs with similar central placement in Synagogues.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt; Another occurrence is on the [[ossuary]] that by tradition contained the bones of [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="Shackle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/three_hares.htm |last1=Shackle |first1=Eric |work=Eric Shackle's e-book |title=Three Hares Share Three Ears |accessdate=24 April 2012 |year=2006 |location=Sydney, Australia |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AsPtdXu?url=http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/three_hares.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where it occurs in England, the three hares motif usually appears in a prominent place in the church, such as the central rib of the [[chancel]] roof, or on a central rib of the [[nave]]. This suggests that the symbol held significance to the church, and casts doubt on the theory that they may have been a masons' or carpenters' signature marks.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; There are two possible and perhaps concurrent reasons why the three hares may have found popularity as a symbol within the church. Firstly, it was widely believed that the hare was [[hermaphrodite]] and could reproduce without loss of [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt; This led to an association with the [[Virgin Mary]], with hares sometimes occurring in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Northern Renaissance|Northern European]] paintings of the Virgin and [[Christ Child]]. The other Christian association may have been with the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threehares.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-three-hares_25.html |title=Three Hares as representation of the Trinity |publisher=Threehares.blogspot.com |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the ''"One in Three and Three in One"'' of which the triangle or three interlocking shapes such as rings are common symbols. In many locations the three hares are positioned adjacent to the [[Green Man]], a symbol commonly believed to be associated with the continuance of [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Christianity and Paganism|paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |title=Green Men &amp; The Way of All Flesh |first1=Richard |last1=Hayma |accessdate=31 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131231951/http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |archivedate=31 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These juxtapositions may have been created to imply the contrast of the Divine with man's [[sin]]ful, earthly nature.&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, the "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;In [[Hebrew]], the rock hyrax is called שפן סלע (''shafan sela''), meaning ''rock "shafan"'', where the meaning of ''shafan'' is obscure, but is [[colloquially]] used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. {{cite web|first1=Nosson |last1=Slifkin |authorlink1=Natan Slifkin |work=The camel, the hare &amp; the hyrax: a study of the laws of animals with one kosher sign in light of modern zoology |location=Southfield, MI; [[Nanuet, NY]] |publisher=Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim Distributed by Feldheim |chapter=6 |title=Shafan–The Hyrax |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |format=PDF |date=1 March 2004 |isbn=1-56871-312-6 |pages=99–135 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} {{ISBN|978-1-56871-312-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although rabbits are listed as a non-[[kosher]] animal in the Bible{{mdash}}they at least arguably chew their cud{{efn-ua|Even though they are not a [[ruminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://answersingenesis.org/contradictions-in-the-bible/do-rabbits-really-chew-the-cud/ |title=Do rabbits really chew their cud |work=Demolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions |volume=2  |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} lacking [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]]{{mdash}}rabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Jewish diaspora]].  The replica of the [[Khodoriv|Chodorow]] [[Synagogue]] from Poland (on display at the [[Beth Hatefutsoth|Museum of the Jewish Diaspora]] in [[Tel Aviv]]) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of [[Deuteronomy]]:

{{quote|
:.כנשר יעיר קינו על גוזליו ירחף. יפרוש כנפיו יקחהו ישאהו על אברתו
|Deuteronomy 32:11, [[The Song of Moses]]}}

This may be translated: "As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions  (...thus is [[God]] to the Jewish people)."&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

The hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the "rotating rabbits".  An ancient German [[riddle]] describes this graphic thus:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Three hares sharing three ears,
Yet every one of them has two.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous [[wooden synagogues]] from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashknaz]] region (in Germany) that are on museum display in [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] Museum in Tel Aviv, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]  and The [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.  They also appear in the Synagogue from [[Horb am Neckar]] (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from [[Unterlimpurg]] near [[Schwäbisch Hall]], which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: "... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens... The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] context".&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

Not only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the [[Torah ark]], the place where the [[Religious text|holy scriptures]] repose.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

They appear on [[headstones]] in [[Sataniv]] (Сатанів), [[Khmelnytsky Oblast]], western [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/ruthellengruber/general_site/Sataniv.html |title=Gruber, Ruth Ellen.

It notes:

:So that we give pleasure to each of you.
:And when we have turned, count our ears,

"These are the oldest known dated examples of the Three Rabbits as a puzzle." One commentator believes its being a puzzle is likely reason for the image's popularity.&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt;

One recent philosophical book poses it as a problem in perception and an [[optical illusion]]—an example of [[contour rivalry]]. Each rabbit can be individually seen as correct—it is only when you try to see all three at once that you see the problem with defining the hares' ears. This is similar to "The Impossible [[Penrose triangle|Tribar]]" by [[Roger Penrose]],&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt; originated by [[Oscar Reutersvärd]]. Compare [[M.C. Escher]]'s [[impossible object]].

===During daylight: ''Shí-kè''===
The ''Shí-kè'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|時}}}} - {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|刻}}}}) system is derived from [[solar time|the position of the sun]]. 

====Dual hour: Shí====
Each ''shí'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|時}}|s={{linktext|时}}}}) was {{frac|12}} of the time between one midnight and the next,&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; making it roughly double the modern hour. These dual hours are named after the [[earthly branches]] in order, with midnight in the first ''shí''. This first ''shí'' traditionally occurred from 23:00 to 01:00 on the 24-hour clock, but was changed during the [[Song dynasty]] so that it fell from 00:00 to 02:00.&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt;

Starting from the end of the [[Tang Dynasty]] into the [[Song Dynasty]], each ''shí'' was divided into two, with the first half of each ''shí'' called the initial hour ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|初}}}}) and the second called the central hour ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|正}}}}).&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; Using the change of the midnight hour and the first ''shí'' above, you could say that during the Song Dynasty midnight went from the central hour of the first ''shí'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|子|正}}}}) to the initial hour of the first ''shí'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|子|初}}}}).

====One-hundredth of a day: Kè ====
Days were also divided into smaller units, called ''kè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|刻}}}}). One ''kè'' was usually defined as {{frac|100}} of a day until 1628, though there were short periods before then where days had 96, 108 or 120 ''kè''.&lt;ref name="Units"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sôma|first=Mitsuru|last2=Kawabata|first2=Kin-aki|last3=Tanikawa|first3=Kiyotaka|date=2004-10-25|title=Units of Time in Ancient China and Japan|url=http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/5/887|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|language=en|volume=56|issue=5|pages=887–904|doi=10.1093/pasj/56.5.887|issn=0004-6264|bibcode=2004PASJ...56..887S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Kè'' literally means "mark" or "engraving", referring to the marks placed on sundials&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;{{cite book |first1=F.

There are 100 marks which represent a day.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help keep time. 

Using the definition of ''kè'' as {{frac|100}} of a day, each ''kè'' is equal to 0.24 hours, 14.4 minutes, or 14 minutes 24 seconds. Every ''shí'' will contain 8{{frac|3}} ''kè'', with 7 or 8 full ''kè'' and partial beginning and/or ending ''kè''. These fractional ''kè'' are multiples of {{frac|6}} ''kè'', or 2 minutes 24 seconds.{{efn|600 is the [[Least common multiple|LCM]] of 100 and 24, so the time between ''kè'' and ''shí'' scale may be {{frac|6}}, {{frac|3}}, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|2|3}}, or {{frac|5|6}} major ''kè''. The {{frac|6}} major ''kè'' is the common factor}} The 7 or 8 full ''kè'' within each ''shí'' were referred to as "major ''kè''" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|大刻}}}}). Each {{frac|6}} of a ''kè'' was called a "minor ''kè''" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|小刻}}}}).&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]] |script-chapter=曆象彙編/曆法典/第099卷 |trans-chapter=Calendar compilations/Calendar quotations/Volume 99 |chapter-url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh/%E6%AC%BD%E5%AE%9A%E5%8F%A4%E4%BB%8A%E5%9C%96%E6%9B%B8%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90/%E6%9B%86%E8%B1%A1%E5%BD%99%E7%B7%A8/%E6%9B%86%E6%B3%95%E5%85%B8/%E7%AC%AC099%E5%8D%B7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Describing the time during daylight====
Both ''shí'' and ''kè'' would be used to describe the time accurately. There are two ways of doing this.
#Eight ''kè'' mode. Before the Tang dynasty, the ''shí'' were noted first, then each of the major ''kè'' were counted up to 8.&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng" /&gt; 
##As an example, counting by major ''kè'' from the first ''shí'' to the second would look like this: &lt;code&gt;''zǐ''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 1 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子一刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 2 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子二刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 3 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子三刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 4 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子四刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 5 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子五刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 6 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子六刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 7 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c= 子七刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 8 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子八刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''chǒu''&lt;/code&gt;. ({{zh |labels=no|c=丑}}). 
##Given the time ''&lt;code&gt;xū 1 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=戌一刻}}), this would be read as "1 ''kè'' after xū ''shí''", making the time 20:09:36.
#Four ''kè'' mode. After the Tang dynasty's introduction of "initial" and "central" parts of the ''shí'', the ''shí'' was still noted first, but with an added description of which half of the ''shí'' the ''kè'' was taking place in. Since this narrowed the range of the possible major ''kè'' down to four, it was only necessary to specify the major ''kè'' between one and four.&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng" /&gt; 
## This would change our first example above to look like this: ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 1 kè &lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初一刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 2 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初二刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 3 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初三刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 4 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初四刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central&lt;/code&gt;''{{efn|Note that the beginning of the central hour doesn't occur at the same time as the fourth major ''kè''. The difference between the start of the central hour and the fourth major ''kè'' is always between 1 and 5 minor ''kè''.}} ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 1 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正一刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 2 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正二刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 3 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正三刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 4 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正四刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;chǒu initial&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=丑初}}).
##Given the time ''&lt;code&gt;sì central 3 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=巳正三刻}}), this would be read as "the third ''kè'' in the second half of ''sì''", making the time 11:31:12.

====Smaller time units====
=====Fēn=====
''Kè'' were subdivided into smaller units, called ''fēn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|分}}}}). The number of ''fēn'' in each ''kè'' varied over the centuries,&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; but a ''fēn'' was generally defined as {{frac|6000}} of a day.&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng" /&gt; Using this definition, one ''fēn'' is equal to 14.4 seconds. This also means that a ''fēn'' is {{frac|60}} of a major ''kè'', and a minor ''kè'' has only 10 ''fēn''.

=====Miǎo=====
In 1280, [[Guo Shoujing]]'s Shòushí Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|授时曆}}}}) had each ''fēn'' subdivided into 100 ''miǎo'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|秒}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Jean-Claude |last=Martzloff |title=Chinese mathematical astronomy |editor-link=Helaine Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-last=Selin |encyclopedia=Mathematics across cultures |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer |date=2000 |pages=373–407 |ISBN=0-7923-6481-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the definition of ''fēn'' as 14.4 seconds, each ''miǎo'' was 144 milliseconds long. 

=====Shùn and niàn=====
{{Expand Chinese|刹那|date=May 2018}}

Each ''fen'' was subdivided into ''shùn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|瞬}}}}), and ''shùn'' were subdivided into ''niàn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|念}}}}).

The [[Mahāsāṃghika]], translated into Chinese as the ''Móhēsēngzhī Lǜ'' ([[Taishō Tripiṭaka]] 1425) describes several units of time, including ''shùn'' or ''shùnqǐng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|瞬頃}}|l=blink moment}}) and ''niàn''. According to this text, ''niàn'' is the smallest unit of time at 18 milliseconds and a ''shùn'' is 360 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |script-title=zh:摩訶僧祗律 |title=Móhēsēngzhī Lǜ |trans-title=[[Mahāsāṃghika]]|chapter=Taishō Tripiṭaka 1425 |chapter-url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/en/T22n1425_017 |quote={{zh|labels=no|c=須臾者，二十念名一瞬頃，二十瞬名一彈指，二十彈指名一羅豫，二十羅豫名一須臾。日極長時有十八須臾，夜極短時有十二須臾，夜極長時有十八須臾，日極短時有十二須臾。}} Rough translation: ''Definition of ''xūyú'': 20 ''niàn'' is 1 ''shùnqǐng''. 20 ''shùn'' is 1 ''tánzhǐ''. 20 ''tánzhǐ'' is one ''luóyù''. 20 ''luóyù'' is one ''xūyú''. In the longest day there are 18 ''xūyú'', and in the shortest night there are 12 ''xūyú''. In the shortest day there are 12 ''xūyú'' and in the longest night there are 18 ''xūyú''.''}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It also describes larger units of time, including a ''tánzhǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|彈指}}}}) which is 7.2 seconds long, a ''luóyù'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|羅豫}}}}) which is 2 minutes 24 seconds long, and a ''xūyú'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|須臾}}}}), which is {{frac|30}} of a day at 48 minutes long.{{efn| This 30-part day is identical to the [[Hindu units of time|Hindu muhūrta]].}}

===During night: ''Gēng-diǎn'' system===
The ''Gēng-diǎn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|更}}}} - {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|點}}}}) system uses predetermined signals to define the time during the night. 

====One-tenth of a day: ''Gēng''====

''Gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|更}}}}) is a time signal given by drum or gong. The drum was sounded by the [[Drum tower (Asia)|drum tower]] in city centers, and by night watchman hitting a gong in other areas.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The character for ''gēng'' {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|更}}}}, literally meaning "rotation" or "watch", comes from the rotation of watchmen sounding these signals.

The first ''gēng'' theoretically comes at sundown, but was standardized to fall at &lt;code&gt;yǒu shí central 1 kè &lt;/code&gt;, or 19:12. The time between each ''gēng'' is {{frac|10}} of a day, making a ''gēng'' 2.4 hours—or 2 hours 24 minutes—long.

The 5 ''gēngs'' in the night are numbered from one to five: ''yī gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|一|更}}}}) (alternately ''chū gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|初更}}}}) for "initial watch"); ''èr gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|二更}}}});  ''sān gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三更}}}}); ''sì gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|四更}}}}); and  ''wǔ gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|五更}}}}). The 5 gēngs in daytime are named after times of day listed in the [[Book of Sui]], which describes the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] dividing the day and night into ten equal parts. They are morning ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|朝}}}});  midmorning, ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|禺}}}}); noon, ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|中}}}});  afternoon ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|晡}}}});  and evening ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|夕}}}}).&lt;ref name="Sui"&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Book of Sui]] |chapter=Zhì dì 14 tiānwén shàng |trans-chapter=Treatise 14, On Astronomy |script-chapter=志第14 天文上 |chapter-url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/zh:%E9%9A%8B%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B719 |at="Water clocks" ({{zh|labels=no|c=漏刻}})|quote={{zh|labels=no|c=晝有朝，有禺，有中，有晡，有夕。夜有甲、乙、丙、丁、戊。}} Rough translation: ''Daytime has morning, midmorning, noon, late afternoon, evening. Night has first, second, third, fourth, fifth.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 10-part system, the ''gēng'' are strongly associated with the 10 [[Celestial stem|celestial stems]], especially since the stems are used to count off the ''gēng'' during the night in Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="Sui" /&gt;

====One-sixtieth of a day: ''Diǎn''====
''Diǎn'' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|點}}|s={{linktext|点}}}}), or point, marked when the bell time signal was rung. The time signal was released by the drum tower or local temples.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

Each ''diǎn'' or point is {{frac|60}} of a day, making them 0.4 hours, or 24 minutes, long. Every sixth ''diǎn'' falls on the ''gēng'', with the rest evenly dividing every ''gēng'' into 6 equal parts.

====Describing the time during the night====
Gēng and diǎn were used together to precisely describe the time at night.

:Counting from the first ''gēng'' to the next would look like this: ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=一更}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 1 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更一點|s=一更一点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 2 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更二點|s=一更二点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 3 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更三點|s=一更三点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 4 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更四點|s=一更四点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 5 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更五點|s=一更五点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;èrgēng&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=二更}}).
:Given the time ''&lt;code&gt;sāngēng 2 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=三更二點|s=三更二点}}), you would read it as "two ''diǎn'' after ''sāngēng''", and find the time to be 00:48.{{efn|This assumes that the ''diǎn'' haven't moved; or if they have, that ''sāngēng'' still falls at exactly midnight.}} 

The night length is inconsistent during a year. The nineteenth volume of the [[Book of Sui]] says that at the winter solstice, a day was measured to be 60% night, and at the summer solstice, only 40% night.&lt;ref name="Petersen" /&gt; The official start of night thus had a variation from 0 to 1 ''gēng''. 

This variation was handled in different ways. From the start of the [[Han dynasty#Western Han|Western Han dynasty]] in 206 BC until 102 AD, ''yīgēng'' was moved back one ''kè'' every 9th day from the winter solstice to the summer solstice, and moved forward one ''kè'' every 9th day from summer solstice to the winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt; {{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Jens Østergård |year=1992 |title=The Taiping Jing and the A.D. 102 Clepsydra Reform |journal=Acta Orientalia |volume=53 |location=Copenhagen |pages=122–158 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12945035/The_Taiping_Jing_%E5%A4%AA%E5%B9%B3%E7%B6%93_and_the_A.D._102_Clepsydra_Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xia Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|夏曆}}|s={{linktext|夏历}}}}), introduced in 102 AD, added or subtracted a ''kè'' to the start of night whenever the sun moved 2.5° north or south from its previous position.&lt;ref name="Petersen" /&gt;

==Modern applications==

Chinese still uses characters from these systems to describe time, even though China has changed to the [[UTC]] standards of hours, minutes, and seconds. 

''Shí'' is still used to describe the hour. Because of the potential for confusion, ''xiǎoshí'' ({{zh |labels=no|s={{linktext|小时}}|t={{linktext|小時}}}}, literally "small hour") is sometimes used for the hour as part of a 24-hour cycle, and ''shíchen'' ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|時辰}}|s={{linktext|时辰}}}}) is used for the hour as part of the old 12-hour cycle. 

''Diǎn'' is also used interchangeably with ''shí'' for the hour. It can also be used to talk about the time on the hour—for example, 8 o' clock is written as 8 ''diǎn'' ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|八點}}|s={{linktext|八点}}}}). 

''Fēn'' is also used for minutes. To avoid confusion, sometimes the word ''fēnzhōng'' ({{zh |labels=no|s={{linktext|分钟}}|t={{linktext|分鐘}}}}, literally "clock minute") is used to clarify that one is talking about modern minutes. The time 09:45 can thus be written as "9 ''shí'', 45 ''fēn''" ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|九時|四十五|分}}|s={{linktext|九时|四十五|分}}}}) or "9 ''diǎn'', 45 ''fēn''" ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|九点|四十五|分}}|t={{linktext|九點|四十五|分}}}}).

''Kè'' has been defined as {{frac|96}} of a day since 1628, so the modern ''kè'' equals 15 minutes and each double hour contains exactly 8 ''kè''.&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; Since then, ''kè'' has been used as shorthand to talk about time in {{frac|8}} of a double hour or {{frac|4}} of a single hour. Their usage is similar to using "quarter hour" for 15 minutes or "half an hour" for 30 minutes in English.  For example, 6:45 can be written as "6 ''diǎn'', 3 ''kè''" ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|六點|三|刻}}|s={{linktext|六点|三|刻}}}}).

''Miǎo'' is now the standard term for a second. Like ''fēn'', it is sometimes written as ''miǎozhōng'' ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|秒鐘}}|s={{linktext|秒钟}}}}, literally "clock second") to clarify that someone is talking about modern seconds.

'''Tri-Stat dX''' is a [[Generic role-playing game system|generic]] [[role-playing game]] system developed and published by [[Guardians of Order]] in 2003. Like other [[generic role-playing game system]]s, Tri-Stat dX has adaptable rules that can be applied to many genres and settings.

Tri-Stat dX's name comes from the system's three main Stats: '''Mind''', '''Body''' and '''Soul'''. "dX" refers to the [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] [[dice]] used in the game: any of the available die types may be used.

It is based on the original Tri-Stat System first introduced in 1999 with the popular ''[[Big Eyes, Small Mouth]]'' ''(BESM)'' [[anime]]-genre RPG (which used d6 dice), which is now published by [[White Wolf Publishing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.white-wolf.com/besm/ White Wolf Publishing, Big Eyes, Small Mouth]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512051548/http://www.white-wolf.com/besm/ |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[superhero]]-genre RPG ''[[Silver Age Sentinels]]'' (which used d10 dice), and now includes a number of related systems and games such as ''[[Ex Machina (role-playing game)|Ex Machina]]'', ''Dreaming Cities'', and ''[[Tékumel: Empire of the Petal Throne|Tekumel]]'' (which uses a variation of the system).

The core rules for the Tri-Stat dX system were once available as a free download from the Guardians of Order website, which is now defunct. Although White Wolf has acquired the publishing rights for ''BESM'', they have not offered continued support for the Tri-Stat dX system. The rules however are still available on DriveThruRPG&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/368/TriStat-dX-Core-System-RolePlaying-Game/ Tri-Stat dX]&lt;/ref&gt; at no cost.

Since all mechanics in Tri-Stat dX use two dice of the same die type (2d6, 2d10, 2d20 etc.), the first choice a [[Game Master]] (GM) must decide the game's '''Power Level''', and thus what type of polyhedral dice to use in their game.

Tri-Stat uses one table of '''Stat Values''' which range from 1 (Inept) to 40 (Godlike). The "human norm" is considered 4. The bigger the die type used in the game, the more powerful the characters generally are, and achieve Stat Values much higher than the human norm. Playing in a "mundane" (real-world) setting, the GM would set the die type to 2d4, and only allow characters to achieve maximum unadjusted die roll totals of 8. A typical "action-adventure" would use a 2d6, allowing more heroic characters and unadjusted rolls up to 12. Games with [[transhuman]] characters would use 2d8, and allow rolls up to 16. Superhero games would use 2d10, or 2d12. Godlike characters would use 2d20.

===Character Points===
Characters in Tri-Stat are built with '''Character Points'''. To help keep characters "balanced", each player is given the same number of Character Points. Depending on the setting's Power Level (and die type chosen by the GM), the GM assigns a number of Character Points to each player to spend on Stats and other abilities. In a "Subhuman" mundane world, the characters have 25 - 50 points. In an "Action-Adventure" setting, characters get 50 - 70 points and so on. Godlike characters could have 300+ Character Points.

===Stats===
Characters in Tri-Stat have three main '''Stats''':
* '''Body''': a measure of the character's physical prowess and health.
* '''Mind''': a measure of the character's mental capacity and intelligence.
* '''Soul''': a measure of the character's spirit and willpower.

Typical Stats range in levels from 1 to 20, although the Stats can go higher depending on the Power Level of the game. Levels of Stats are purchased with Character Points. All Stats cost two Character Points per level, requiring a minimum expenditure of two points per Stat. (Example: Having a Mind Stat of 6 would cost 12 points, two points each for the six stat points). An optional rule the GM can impose increases the point cost for Stats at incremental levels, so that high level Stats require more points to be increased to the next level.

===Derived values===
'''Derived Values''' are determined by mathematical formulas based on the values of the character's Stats.
* '''Attack Combat Value''': ('''ACV''') [(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3] which is the focus of all the character's Stats to determine their bonus to Hit an opponent during combat scenes.
* '''Defense Combat Value''': ('''DCV''') [(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3 - 2] which is the character's ability to react against incoming attacks.
* '''Health Points''': [(Body + Soul) × 5] which is the amount of damage a character can withstand before they are knocked unconscious or killed. These are similar to [[hit points]] in other games.

'''Optional derived values:'''
* '''Energy Points''': [(Mind + Soul) × 5] an optional Stat used for fueling certain superpower Attributes. When a character runs out of Energy Points, they can no longer use that power.
* '''Shock Value''': [(Health Points) / 5] for more "realistic" combat scenes, when a character suffers their Shock Value in damage, there is a chance they can become stunned.

===Attributes===
Any Character Points left over from buying Stat levels are used to buy '''Attributes''' for the character. Attributes represent special talents, perks and superpower abilities a character may have. (With them, characters can fly, cast spells, bend iron bars, etc.). Not all campaigns require a character to have superpowers, so a GM can decide which Attributes will be allowed in their game and which ones will not. Because some Attributes (like Special Attacks, Organizational Ties, Gadgets, Henchmen, and Highly Skilled) are similar to [[GURPS]] [[advantage (role-playing games)|advantages]] and [[d20 System]] Feats, at least some Attributes will be available to characters regardless of the setting.

Tri-Stat has many kinds of Attributes available to choose from. Each Attribute costs a certain amount of Character Points to purchase a '''Rank Level''' in that ability. The costs of an Attribute Level depends on what it can do for the character. Certain Attributes can be modified by '''Power Modifier Values''' ('''PMVs''') (which can increase, ''e.g.'', a power's area of effect, duration, range, or number of targets, also increasing the point cost of the Attribute per Rank&lt;!-- thus similar to GURPS enhancements--&gt;).

===Defects===
'''Defects''' are the opposite of Attributes, and represent some kind of flaw or weakness in the character. By selecting Defects, a player can regain Character Points to spend elsewhere. There are many Defects available and each returns an amount of Character Points based on the severity of how much they hinder the character. An Attribute can also be assigned a Defect which brings the cost of the power down. For instance, a beam weapon superpower could require a character's special concentration to maintain, giving an advantage to an enemy force. A Personality Defect could be a [[mental illness]] the character suffers from, such as [[paranoia]], [[delusion]]s, or [[schizophrenia]]; or could be simply a character flaw, such as being completely obnoxious and difficult for others to deal with.

===Skills===
'''Skills''' represent special areas of mental knowledge or technique a character may excel in. Like most games that use Skills, Tri-Stat has a comprehensive Skill list of subjects useful to characters. Of course, players and the GM may add Skills of their devising into the game system if needed. Depending on the campaign setting, certain Skills may or may not be available. For instance, in a [[Medieval]] fantasy setting, skills for computers would not be available. Each Skill is also tied to one (or more) of the character's three Stats. Mechanics, for example, is tied to both the Body and Mind Stat. Which one, depends on how the GM feels the character is using it.

Skills are organized as either General or Combat Skills, and are purchased by '''Skill Points''' that are separate from Character Points. A character's starting amount of Skill Points and maximum '''Skill Level''' is determined by the campaign's Power Level. For example, in a "Subhuman" game, characters get 10 Skill Points and can have a maximum Skill Level of 2. In a "Godlike" campaign, characters get 60 Skill Points and can have a maximum Skill Level of 10. Certain Attributes can give characters more or fewer Skill Points as they choose. A character's level in a Skill determines how well they are at performing it. At Skill level 1 they are "well trained", and at 10 they are "heavenly masters" of it.

The Skill Point cost of a Skill depends on the particular Skill and the campaign setting it is being used in. Unlike many other games, skill cost is not based on its real world difficulty to learn.  Instead, skill cost is based on its utility in a given setting.  More useful skills cost more.  Thus, in a mystery setting, investigative skills would be very expensive, while in a medieval martial arts setting those same investigative skills would be cheap to acquire.

Skills are available with '''Specializations''' that subdivide a particular area of knowledge into specific Skills a character is adept at. For instance, if picking the Artisan Skill, a character could Specialize in "Woodworking" or "Plumbing" among others. Specializations only cost one Skill Point to acquire no matter the setting. For example, a character could pick Gun Combat in a modern day setting, and pay 8 Skill Points for 1 level of Gun Combat, and pay one Skill Point to Specialize in pistol (Level 2). When using other kinds of firearms their effective Level is 1, but with a pistol it would be Level 2.

==Overview of game mechanics==
All die roll resolutions in Tri-Stat use two polyhedral dice of the same type. Depending on the Power Level of the campaign, these die types will be different. For "mundane" settings, 2d4 is used; for "heroic-action" settings 2d6 is used; for "post-human" settings 2d8 is used; for "superhero" games 2d10 or 2d12 can be used; and for "Godlike" settings, 2d20 is used. The task resolution mechanic is similar to the method used in [[GURPS]], where rolling lower than the target number is a success and rolling over it is a failure.

===Task resolutions===
Whenever a character needs to roll dice to see if they succeeded or failed at doing something, they must make a dice roll which randomly determines success or failure. There are three kinds of checks in Tri-Stat, '''Stat Checks''', '''Skill Checks''' and '''Contested Checks'''. Stat Checks are made when the GM feels a check of a character's innate ability is required rather than a specific Skill. Skill Checks are made when a particular area of the character's expertise is being challenged. Contested Checks are made against the actions of another character, or non-player character (NPC), that is challenging the character, and is rolled against what that opponent does.

Stat Checks and Skill Checks are often altered by a '''Difficulty Modifier''' as determined by the GM. The Difficulty Modifier is added to the target number (usually the player's relevant Stat score) thus making rolling under the target number harder or easier. Modifier ranges depend on the type of die being used in the game. For instance, when using 2d6, Difficulty Modifiers range from +6 "really easy" to -6 "really hard". For 2d20, something really easy would be +20 and really difficult is -20. In all cases, average difficulty is set at zero, or no modification.

When making a Stat Check, a player must roll a total, with two dice, that is less than or equal to the value of the character's Stat. For example, making a check to open a heavy door, a player must roll equal to or less than the numerical level of the character's Body Stat. If the roll was higher, the character has failed at the task.

When making a Skill Check, the player selects the particular Skill being challenged and adds the Skill's numerical level as a bonus to the Stat it is tied to. The player must roll less than or equal to the modified Stat Check to succeed the task. Like a Stat Check, a higher roll is a failure. Often a GM may decide a particular task requires at least one level in a specific Skill, otherwise the character cannot perform the task or must do so as an Unskilled Check, where depending on the general familiarity of the situation, the GM adds in or subtracts Modifiers for the action.

When directly challenged by another character or NPC, a player makes Stat and Skill checks as normal, but the results must be greater than the opposition's results to succeed. GMs may levy Difficulty Modifiers for favorable or unfavorable circumstance as they see fit, if the particular challenger is at an advantage, or disadvantage during the contest.

===Combat scenes===
Time in Tri-Stat is measured in '''Rounds''' which represent about 5 seconds of real time. Rounds are linked together in '''Scenes'''. A Scene changes when the specific events and places happen to change in the game. For example, a brawl Scene in a bar would change if the fight is moved out to the parking lot. During a Round, a character can take one of several kinds of '''Actions''', such as Move, Attack, or Defend.

Combat can be seen as a bunch of contested actions made against particular adversaries, however the character uses their Attack Combat Value as the number they must roll equal to, or less than, to score successful attacks against the opposition. Their ACV can be modified by Combat Skills, like Gun Combat, and any Specializations with a particular weapon to score a better hit against the target. Characters roll for '''Initiative''' (2 dice + ACV), during a Round of combat to see who goes first. The higher roll "Gains Initiative" and allows the character to either take action first, or hold and wait to see what their opponent does.

Defenders of attacks roll their Defense Combat Value to see if they defend against an incoming attack. If they roll less than or equal to their DCV, they successfully defend against the attack whether or not the attacker succeeded his ACV or not. A failed Defense roll means the attack got through and the target takes damage.

===Resolving damage===
Characters can take damage from either suffering an injury or from an attack in combat. Each attack has a '''Maximum Damage Rating''' ('''MDR'''), which is the total amount of damage points a particular weapon or accident situation can inflict upon the victim. When an attack makes it through a defense, the defender takes damage from the attack. Depending on the Power Level of the campaign, the damage is rolled with 2 dice and consulted on a '''Damage Percentage Table'''. The particular roll will indicate that the target took 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the attack's MDR. The attacker's Attack Combat Value is fully added to the resulting percentage of MDR to determine the total amount of damage inflicted upon the target. Damage is then deducted from a character or object's Health Points.

There are also optional damage rules, like a BESM-like approach where attacks always deal 100% damage (although 75% would be closer to the BESM damage increments) or the damage system from ''[[Hong Kong Action Theatre!]]'', where the margin of success of both attacker and defender determines whether the attack deals 100% damage, 50% damage, or completely misses.

'''Critical Hits''' are inflicted whenever an attack die roll comes up as a 2. The attacker automatically hits the target (who cannot defend against it). The target then suffers double the MDR of the weapon plus the attacker's ACV in damage.

If a character loses all their Health Points, they fall unconscious and are dying. If their Health Points drop to the full negative amount of their Health Points they die. For instance, a character who has 25 Health Points dies when their Health Points reach −25.

===Rewards===
Game Masters reward Tri-Stat characters with '''Advancement Points''', which the players can use to purchase better levels of Stats, Skills and Attributes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29699">'''Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks''' (ZIFs) are a class of [[metal-organic framework]]s that are topologically isomorphic with [[zeolite]]s. ZIFs are composed of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally-coordinated]] [[transition metal]] ions (e.g. [[iron|Fe]], [[cobalt|Co]], [[copper|Cu]], [[zinc|Zn]]) connected by [[imidazolate]] linkers. Since the metal-imidazole-metal angle is similar to the 145° Si-O-Si angle in zeolites, ZIFs have zeolite-like topologies.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=KS|title=Exceptional chemical and thermal stability of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|journal=PNAS|year=2006|pages=10186–10191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0602439103|url=http://yaghi.chem.ucla.edu/pdfPublications/Park_Yaghi.pdf|volume=103|issue=27|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10310186P |display-authors=etal|pmc=1502432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 105 ZIF topologies have been reported in the literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Phan, A.; Doonan, C.

==Applications of ZIFs==

=== Applications to carbon capture ===
{{Main|carbon capture and storage}}

ZIF’s exhibit some properties relevant to carbon capture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venna|first=Surendar R.|last2=Carreon|first2=Moises A.|date=2010-01-13|title=Highly Permeable Zeolite Imidazolate Framework-8 Membranes for CO2/CH4 Separation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja909263x|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=132|issue=1|pages=76–78|doi=10.1021/ja909263x|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; but commercial technology is based on amine solvents.&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Bernard|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|date=2014|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=Hackensack, NJ|isbn=978-1-78326-328-8|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method to separate carbon dioxide exploits differences in its permeability. Because of the tunability of the pores, zeolites have been used to separate carbon dioxide. The pore size ranges from 3-12 Angstroms. Because the size of a carbon dioxide molecule is approximately 5.4 Angstroms, zeolites with a pore size of 4-5 Angstroms can be a great fit for carbon capture. However, there are factors other than just pore size that need to be considered when determining how effective zeolites will be at carbon capture. The first is basicity, which can be created by doing an alkali metal cation exchange. The second is the Si/Al ratio which impacts the cation exchange capacity. To get a higher adsorption capacity, there must be a lower Si/Al ratio in order to increase the cation exchange capacity.

Zif’s 68, 69, 70, 78, 81, 82, 95, and 100 have been found to have very high uptake capacity, meaning that they can store a lot of carbon dioxide even if they don’t have extremely high affinities. Of those, 68, 69, and 70 show high affinities for carbon dioxide, evidenced by their adsorption isotherms, which show steep uptakes at low pressures. One liter of ZIF can hold 83 liters of {{co2}}. This could also be useful for [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure-swing adsorption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phan|first=Anh|last2=Doonan|first2=Christian J.|last3=Uribe-Romo|first3=Fernando J.|last4=Knobler|first4=Carolyn B.|last5=O'Keeffe|first5=Michael|last6=Yaghi|first6=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2010-01-19|title=Synthesis, structure, and carbon dioxide capture properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=43|issue=1|pages=58–67|doi=10.1021/ar900116g|issn=1520-4898|pmid=19877580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other separation applications ===
Much ZIF research focuses on the separation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide because a well-studied ZIF, ZIF-8, has a very high separation factor for hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixtures. It is also very good for the separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, like the following: 
* Ethane-propane = 80
* Ethylene- propylene = 10
* Ethylene- propane = 167
In addition to gas separations, ZIF’s have the potential to separate components of biofuels, specifically, water and ethanol. Of all of the ZIF’s that have been tested, ZIF-8 shows high selectivity. ZIF’s have also shown potential in separating other alcohols, like propanol and butanol, from water. Typically, water and ethanol (or other alcohols) are separated using distillation, however ZIF’s offer a potential lower-energy separation option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Kang|last2=Nalaparaju|first2=Anjaiah|last3=Chen|first3=Yifei|last4=Jiang|first4=Jianwen|date=2014-04-23|title=Biofuel purification in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks: the significant role of functional groups|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2014/CP/c4cp00739e#!divAbstract|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=16|issue=20|doi=10.1039/C4CP00739E|issn=1463-9084|bibcode=2014PCCP...16.9643Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalysis ===
ZIF’s also have great potential as heterogeneous catalysts; ZIF-8 has been shown to act as good catalysts for the transesterification of vegetable oils, the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction between benzoyl chloride and anisole, and for the formation of carbonates. ZIF-8 nanoparticles can also be used to enhance the performance in the [[Knoevenagel condensation]] reaction between benzaldehyde and malononitrile.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guan|first=Yebin|last2=Shi|first2=Juanjuan|last3=Xia|first3=Ming|last4=Zhanga|first4=Jun|last5=Pang|first5=Zhenfeng|last6=Marchetti|first6=Alessandro|last7=Wang|first7=Xiaohong|last8=Cai|first8=Jingsong|last9=Kong|first9=Xueqian|display-authors=3|date=2017-11-30|title= Monodispersed ZIF-8 particles with enhanced performance for CO2 adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis |journal=Applied Surface Science|language=en|volume=423|issue=|pages= 349-353 |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.06.183|issn=|bibcode=2017ApSS..423..349G}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZIF’s have also been shown to work well in oxidation and epoxidation reactions; ZIF-9 has been shown to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of tetralin and the oxidation of many other small molecules. It can also catalyze reactions to produce hydrogen at room temperature, specifically the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane and [[sodium|Na]][[borohydride|BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] hydrolysis.

=== Sensing and Electronic Devices ===
ZIF’s are also good candidates for chemical sensors because of their tunable adsorbance properties. ZIF-8 exhibits sensitivity when exposed to the vapor of ethanol and water mixtures, and this response is dependent on the concentration of ethanol in the mixture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Binling|last2=Yang|first2=Zhuxian|last3=Zhu|first3=Yanqiu|last4=Xia|first4=Yongde|date=2014-09-23|title=Zeolitic imidazolate framework materials: recent progress in synthesis and applications|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/ta/c4ta02984d#!divAbstract|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry A|language=en|volume=2|issue=40|doi=10.1039/C4TA02984D|issn=2050-7496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ZIF’s are attractive materials for matrices for biosensors, like electrochemical biosensors, for in-vivo electrochemical measurements. They also have potential applications as luminescent probes for the detection of metal ions and small molecules. ZIF-8 luminescence is highly sensitive to Cu2+, and Cd2+ ions as well as acetone. ZIF nanoparticles can also sense fluorescently tagged single stranded pieces of DNA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Drug Delivery ===
Because ZIF’s are porous, chemically stable, thermally stable, and tunable, they are potentially a platform for drug delivery and controlled drug release. ZIF-8 is very stable in water and aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions but decompose quickly in acidic solutions, indicating a pH sensitivity that could aid in the development of ZIF-based drug-release platforms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Comparing ZIFs with Other Compounds ==
{{Original research inline|date=May 2017}}

=== ZIFS vs MOFs ===

While ZIFs are a subset of the MOF hybrids that combine organic and metal frameworks to create hybrid microporous and crystalline structures, they are much more restricted in their structure. Similar to MOFs, most ZIF properties are largely dependent on the properties of the metal clusters, ligands, and synthesis conditions in which they were created.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basnayake|first=Sajani A.|last2=Su|first2=Jie|last3=Zou|first3=Xiadong|last4=Balkus|first4=Kenneth J.|date=2015-02-04|title=Carbonate-Based Zeolitic Imidazolate Frame for Highly Selective CO2 Capture|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic5027174|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|doi=10.1021/ic5027174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ZIF alterations up to this point have involved changing the linkers - bridging O2- anions and imizazolate-based ligands&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"/&gt; - or combining two types of linkers to change bond angles or pore size due to limitations in synthesizing methods and production.&lt;ref name=methane&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Nhung T. T.|last2=Lo|first2=Tien N. H.|last3=Kim|first3=Jaheon|date=2016-04-04|title=Mixed-Metal Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks and their Selective Capture of Wet Carbon Dioxide over Methane|url=http://globalscience.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/mm-zif-2016.pdf|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|language=en|volume=55|doi=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00814}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of changing linkers included adding functional groups with various polarities and symmetries to the imidazolate ligands to alter the ZIFs carbon dioxide adsorption ability without changing the transitional-metal cations.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Sibo|last2=Wang|first2=Xinchen|title=Imidazolium Ionic Liquids, Imidazolylidene Heterocyclic Carbenes, and Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Photochemical Reduction|journal=Angewandte Chemie|date=2015-12-08|volume=55|issue=7|doi=10.1002/anie.201507145|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201507145/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to MOFs, which have a much larger degree of variety in the types of their building units.

Despite these similarities with MOFs, ZIFs have significant properties that distinguish these structures as uniquely to be applied to carbon capture processes. Because ZIFs tend to resemble the crystalline framework of zeolites, their thermal and chemical stability are higher than those of other MOFs, allowing them to work at a wider range in temperatures, making them suitable to chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt;

Perhaps the most important difference is the ZIFs hydrophobic properties and water stability. A main issue with zeolites and MOFs, to a certain extent, was their adsorption of water along with CO2.[7] Water vapor is often found in carbon-rich exhaust gases, and MOFs would absorb the water, lowering the amount of CO2 required to reach saturation.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt; MOFs are also less stable in moist and oxygen rich environments due to metal-oxygen bonds performing hydrolysis. ZIFs, however, have nearly identical performances in dry and humid conditions, showing much higher CO2 selectivity over water, allowing the adsorbent to store more carbon before saturation is reached.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt;

=== ZIFs vs commercially available products ===

Even in comparison with other materials, the ZIFs most attractive quality is still its hydrophobic properties. When compared to ZIFs in dry conditions, activated carbon was nearly identical with its uptake capacity.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt; However, once the conditions were changed to wet, the activated carbon’s uptake was halved. When this saturation and regeneration tests were run at these conditions, ZIFs also showed minimal to no structural degradation, a good indication of the adsorbent’s re-usability.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt;

However, ZIFs tend to be expensive to synthesize. MOFs require synthesis methods with long reaction periods, high pressures, and high temperatures, which aren’t methods that are easy to scale-up.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt; ZIFs do tend to be more affordable than commercially available non-ZIF MOFs.

When combined with polymer-sorbent materials, research determined that hybrid polymer-ZIF sorbent membranes no longer following the upper bound of the Robeson plot, which is a plot of selectivity as a function of permeation for [[membrane gas separation]].&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"/&gt;
