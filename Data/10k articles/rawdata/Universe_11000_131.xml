[[File:Ahu-Tongariki-2013.jpg|300px|right|thumb|All fifteen standing moai at Ahu Tongariki.]]
[[File:Ahu-Tongariki-and-Traveling-Moai.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Ahu Tongariki with volcano Poike in the background and the nearby "Traveling Moai" in the foreground.]]

'''Ahu Tongariki''' is the largest [[Easter Island#Stone platforms|ahu]] on [[Easter Island]]. Its [[moai]] were toppled during [[History of Easter Island#The "statue-toppling"|the island's civil wars]] and in the twentieth century the ahu was swept inland by a [[tsunami]]. It has since been restored and has fifteen [[moai]] including an 86 tonne moai that was the heaviest ever erected on the island. Ahu Tongariki is one kilometer from [[Rano Raraku]] and [[Poike]] in the [[Hotu-iti]] area of [[Rapa Nui National Park]].  All the moai here face sunset during Summer Solstice.

==History==
''Ahu Tongariki'' was the main centre and capital of the [[Hotu Iti]], the eastern confederation of the [[Rapanui]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2005 Island at the end of the world {{ISBN|1-86189-282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its [[moai]] were toppled during [[History of Easter Island#The "statue-toppling"|the island's civil wars]]. In 1960, a [[tsunami]] caused by an earthquake off the coast of Chile swept the Ahu Tongariki inland. 

Ahu Tongariki was substantially restored in the 1990s by a multidisciplinary team headed by archaeologists Claudio Cristino (Director) and Patricia Vargas (Co-director executive team), in a five-year project carried out under an official agreement of the Chilean Government with [[Tadano Limited]] and the [[University of Chile]].

==Location==
[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|400px|left|Map of Rapa Nui showing major ahus with moai. Ahu Tongariki, and [[Rano Raraku]] are on the South coast just before Poike at the eastern end of the island.]]
This ahu is on the south coast of Rapa Nui, close to two previous volcanoes, [[Rano Raraku]] and [[Poike]].

Poike is one of the three main [[extinct volcanoes]] that form Rapa Nui, which last erupted between 230,000 and 705,000 years ago. Rano Raraku is a volcanic crater formed of consolidated [[volcanic ash]] or [[tuff]], which compose the carved moai. Indeed, nearly half (hundreds) of the moai are still buried in the slopes of the Rano Raraku, the main moai quarry. The large, flat plain below [[Rano Raraku]] provided easy access to the tuff.

'''American Airlines Flight 1420''' was a flight from [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] (DFW) to [[Little Rock National Airport]] in the United States. On June 1, 1999, the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|McDonnell Douglas MD-82]] operating for Flight 1420 overran the runway upon landing in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and crashed. Eleven of the 145 people aboard, the captain and ten passengers, were killed in the crash.

==Aircraft==
[[Image:American Airlines MD-82; N7527A@LAX;10.10.2011 622qh (6482769703).jpg|thumb|An American Airlines MD-82 similar to the one involved]]
[[Image:American Airlines Flight 1420 seat injury chart.svg|thumb|Seat chart for American Airlines Flight 1420 created by the [[NTSB]], revealing the location of passengers and lack of injury, severity of injuries, and deaths]]
The aircraft involved in the incident was a [[McDonnell Douglas]] MD-82 ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|215AA}}''), a derivative of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] and part of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] series of aircraft.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02"/&gt;{{rp|12}}  It was delivered new to American Airlines in 1983, and had been operated continuously by the airline since, accumulating a total of 49,136 flight hours.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The aircraft was equipped with [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D|Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-217C]] [[turbofan]] [[jet engines]].&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

The aircraft was equipped with [[X band]] [[weather radar]], which is susceptible to [[wikt:Special:Search/attenuation|attenuation]] during heavy precipitation, and did not have an attenuation alert to warn the flight crew of system impairment during heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|13}} The radar weather system had a forward-looking design that offered the flight crew only a limited field of view in front of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

==Flight crew==
Flight 1420 was commanded by [[Pilot in command|Captain]] Richard Buschmann, age 48.  Captain Buschmann was a very experienced chief pilot for [[American Airlines]] with 10,234 total flight hours, of which approximately half were accumulated flying the MD-80 series of aircraft.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|10}}  Buschmann graduated from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1972, serving in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] until 1979. Buschmann held the rank of lieutenant colonel with the US [[Air Force Reserve Command]], and was hired by American Airlines in July 1979. Experienced at flying the [[Boeing 727]] for American, he transitioned to flying the twin-engine [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] series in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legacy.alliedpilots.org/public/gonewest/memorial/bydate.asp |title=Recent Losses |publisher=[[Allied Pilots Association]] |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight's [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] was Michael Origel, age 35.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The first officer had been with the airline for less than a year, and only had 182 hours of flight time with American Airlines as an MD-80 pilot.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|11}} However, the first officer had trained as a pilot with the [[United States Navy]] and had prior commercial flight experience as a corporate pilot, with a total of 4,292 hours of flying experience at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Flight 1420 was staffed with four flight attendants, all of which were qualified on the MD-80 and had recently received refresher training on emergency procedures.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Flight and weather conditions==
[[File:AA1420Little rock weather web.ogv|thumb|left|Simulation of weather conditions]]
Flight 1420 was scheduled to depart DFW at 20:28 [[Central Time Zone#Central Daylight Time|Central Daylight Time]] and arrive in Little Rock at 21:41.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  However, the flight crew were advised before boarding Flight 1420 that their departure would be delayed, and that the [[National Weather Service]] had issued in-flight weather advisories indicating severe thunderstorms along Flight 1420's planned flight path.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  Adverse weather caused the plane that was intended for Flight 1420 to be delayed in arriving at DFW.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  Airline policy set a maximum pilot duty time of 14 hours, and Flight 1420 was the flight crew's last flight of the day.  The first officer notified the airline's flight dispatcher that the flight crew would exceed their duty limit and be unable to depart if Flight 1420 did not depart by 23:16.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  The airline substituted another MD-80, tail number N215AA, which allowed Flight 1420 to depart DFW at 22:40.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

At 23:04, [[air traffic controller]]s issued a weather advisory indicating severe thunderstorms in an area that included Little Rock airport.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  In the event that Flight 1420 was unable to land for any reason, [[Nashville International Airport]] was designated as an alternate airport, and the flight also had the option of turning back and landing at DFW.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  The flight crew witnessed lightning produced by the storm while on approach to Little Rock.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  However, the flight crew discussed the weather reports and decided to expedite their approach.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Air traffic control at Little Rock originally told Flight 1420 to expect an approach to runway 22L.  However, at 23:39, a controller advised Flight 1420 of a wind shear alert and a change in wind direction.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|3}} As a result, Captain Buschmann requested a change to runway 4R so that the flight would have a headwind during landing, and Flight 1420 was cleared for a visual approach to runway 4R.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|4}}  Because they were already close to the airport, the controller had to direct Flight 1420 away from the airport in order to line them up for a landing on runway 4R.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|116}}  This resulted in Flight 1420 facing away from the airport for several minutes, and because the plane's weather radar had a narrow and forward-facing field of view, the flight crew could not see thunderstorms approaching the airport during their turn.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|116}}  As the aircraft approached runway 4R, a severe [[thunderstorm]] arrived over the airport, and at 23:44 the first officer notified the controller that they had lost sight of the runway.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|4}} The controller then cleared Flight 1420 to land on runway 4R using an [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) approach.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

The pilots rushed to land as soon as possible, leading to errors in judgment that included the crew's failure to complete the airline's pre-landing checklist before landing.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|122}} This was a crucial event in the [[Chain of events (aviation)|accident chain]], as the crew overlooked multiple critical landing systems on the checklist. The flight crew failed to arm the automatic [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]] system, which automatically moves the spoiler control lever and deploys the spoilers upon landing.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}} The pilots also failed to set the plane's automatic braking system.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|21}} Autospoilers and autobrakes are essential to ensure the plane's ability to stop within the confines of a wet runway, especially one that is being subjected to strong and gusting winds. The flight crew also failed to set [[Flap (aeronautics)|landing flaps]], another item on the pre-flight checklist, but as the plane descended past {{convert|1000|feet|m}}, the first officer realized the flaps were not set and the flight crew set a 40-degree flap setting for landing.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|123}}

At 23:49:32, the controller issued its last weather report before Flight 1420 landed, advising that winds at the airport were 330 degrees at 25 knots.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|6}} The reported winds exceeded the MD-82's 20-knot crosswind limit for landing in reduced visibility on a wet runway.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Despite the excessive crosswind and two wind shear reports, Captain Buschmann did not abandon the aircraft's approach into Little Rock, instead deciding to continue the approach to runway 4R.

==The crash==
[[File:AA1420Little rock airplane web.ogv|thumb|Simulation of the landing]] 
The aircraft touched down on Runway 4R at 23:50:20. About 2 seconds after the wheels touched down, First Officer Origel stated: "We're down. We're sliding!"  Because the pilots failed to arm the autospoiler, the spoilers did not deploy automatically on landing, and the flight crew did not deploy them manually.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|167}}  Spoilers disrupt the airflow over the wings and prevent them from generating lift. That causes the plane's weight to be borne by the landing gear. About 65 percent of Flight 1420's weight would have been supported by the plane's landing gear if the spoilers are deployed, but without the spoilers this number dropped to only 15 percent.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|134}} With the light loading of the landing gear, the aircraft's brakes were ineffective at slowing down the plane, which continued down the runway at high speed.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|134–135}} Directional control was lost when Captain Buschmann applied too much reverse thrust, which reduced the effectiveness of the plane's rudder and vertical stabilizer.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|135–136}}

The aircraft continued past the end of the runway, traveling another 800 feet and striking a security fence and an ILS localizer array.  The aircraft then collided with a structure built to support the landing lights for runway 22L, which extended out into the [[Arkansas River]].&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|43}}  Such structures are usually [[wikt:frangible|frangible]], that is, designed to shear off on impact, but because the approach lights were located on the unstable river bank, they were firmly anchored.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|159}}  The collision with the nonfrangible structure crushed the airplane's nose and destroyed the left side of the plane's fuselage, from the cockpit back to the first two rows of coach seating.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|159}}  The impact broke the aircraft apart into multiple large sections, which came to a rest short of the river bank.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|43}}

Captain Buschmann and 10 of the plane's 139 passengers died in the crash. This included 2 passengers that died in hospital in the weeks that followed.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|47}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2001/apr/11/flight-1420-plaintiff-sobbingly-testifies-about-he/ |title=Flight 1420 plaintiff sobbingly testifies about her distress |last=Harter |first=Andrea |newspaper=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=April 11, 2001 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First Officer Origel, 3 of the 4 flight attendants, and 41 passengers sustained serious injuries.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

== Investigation ==
The [[National Transportation Safety Board| National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] investigated the crash.

===Automatic spoiler and brake systems===
The NTSB conducted extensive testing in order to determine whether the automatic spoiler and brake systems had been armed by the pilots prior to landing.

The plane's [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) was reviewed, and sounds that were consistent with the spoiler arming or automatically deploying were not recorded by the CVR.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|42}}  The NTSB conducted two test flights of American Airlines MD-80 aircraft, which confirmed that arming the spoiler created an audible "click" that could be clearly heard on CVR playback.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|42}}  The NTSB also conducted ground tests on similar aircraft, including another American Airlines MD-80 that overran the runway (but was not destroyed) after its autospoiler system failed to deploy during a landing in [[Palm Springs, California]].&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|55}}  The NTSB also found that the sounds made by manual deployment of the spoiler were distinguishable from the sounds made by automatic deployment of the spoiler system.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|58–59}}  No sounds consistent with arming or auto-deployment of the spoiler system were recorded on Flight 1420's CVR.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|42}}

After Flight 1420 and the Palm Springs incident, American Airlines revised its checklist so that pilots would confirm that the spoilers are armed for auto-deployment before landing, confirm spoiler deployment, and deploy spoilers manually if they failed to automatically deploy.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name="Racing the Storm"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Racing the Storm|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=1|number=2|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot behavior regarding thunderstorms===
The NTSB investigation also focused on pilot behavior in inclement weather, to determine what impact the storms had on the pilots' decision-making process while approaching Little Rock Airport.

Experts from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] created a study recording behavior of pilots landing at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport,&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|142}}  which aimed to see whether pilots were willing to land in thunderstorms. Within a total of 1,952 thunderstorm encounters, 1,310 pilots (67 percent) flew into thunderstorms during landing attempts.&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|142}} The study found that pilots exhibited more recklessness if they fell behind schedule, if they were attempting to land at night, and if aircraft in front of them successfully landed in bad weather. In a later interview, [[Greg Feith]], the lead NTSB investigator, said he was surprised to learn that pilots exhibited this behavior.&lt;ref name="Racing the Storm" /&gt; Feith added that the pilots may have exhibited "get there-itis" as the pilots knew that they were approaching their 14-hour duty limits.&lt;ref name="Racing the Storm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhoda|first=D.A.|title=An Assessment of Thunderstorm Penetrations and Deviations by Commercial Aircraft in the Terminal Area|url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/publications/publication-files/nasa-reports/Rhoda_1999_NASA-A2_WW-10087.pdf|author2=Pawlak, M.L.|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT Lincoln Laboratory]]|date=June 3, 1999|accessdate=March 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204003134/http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/publications/publication-files/nasa-reports/Rhoda_1999_NASA-A2_WW-10087.pdf|archive-date=February 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Multiple lawsuits were filed after the crash and on December 15, 1999, the [[Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation]] consolidated the various federal lawsuits over the crash for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings and assigned the case to the late United States District Court Senior Judge [[Henry Woods (judge)|Henry Woods]] of the Eastern District of Arkansas. In the lawsuits the passengers sought compensatory and punitive damages from American Airlines.

From the beginning Judge Woods separated the passenger cases into two groups: domestic and international passengers, because different laws governed the rights of the claimants in each category. For example, passengers traveling on international tickets were prohibited by an international treaty (the [[Warsaw Convention]]) from recovering punitive damages. Therefore, Judge Woods ruled only the domestic passengers would be permitted to pursue punitive damages claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In Re Air Crash at Little Rock, Ark., on June 1, 1999 |vol=109 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion=1022 |pinpoint=1024 |court=E.D.Ark. |date=2000 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/109/1022/2522798/ |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board issued its determination on the cause of the crash:&lt;ref name="NTSB AAR-01-02" /&gt;{{rp|169–170}}

{{quote|
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were the flight crew's failure to discontinue the approach when severe thunderstorms and their associated hazards to flight operations had moved into the airport area and the crew's failure to ensure that the spoilers had extended after touchdown.

Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's (1) impaired performance resulting from fatigue and the situational stress associated with the intent to land under the circumstances, (2) continuation of the approach to a landing when the company's maximum crosswind component was exceeded, and (3) use of reverse thrust greater than 1.3 engine pressure ratio after landing.
}}

The compensatory damages claims proceeded first. American Airlines "admitted liability for the crash and individual trials were scheduled to assess the proper amount of compensatory damages. Thereafter American Airlines reached settlement agreements with a majority of the domestic Plaintiffs."&lt;ref name="231 F.Supp.2d 852"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Aircraft Accident at Little Rock, Arkansas |vol=231 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion=852 |pinpoint=855-57 |court=E.D.Ark. |date=2002 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/231/852/2452474/ |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the only liability trial arising out of the crash of Flight 1420, a federal jury in Little Rock awarded Captain Buschmann's family $2 million in wrongful death damages in a lawsuit they filed against the Little Rock National Airport.&lt;ref name="rapoportlaw.com" /&gt; The jury decided Captain Buschmann's death occurred because the aircraft collided with illegal non-frangible approach light supports erected in what should have been the Runway Safety Area.

It has been stated the jury verdict completely absolved Captain Buschmann of all fault for the crash.&lt;ref name="airlaw.com"/&gt; However, 1) the National Transportation Safety Board has not changed its probable cause ruling and 2) American Airlines admitted liability for the crash and "paid many millions of dollars in damages to the passengers and their families."&lt;ref name="rapoportlaw.com"/&gt;

According to a comment made about 10 years after the crash by David Rapoport, a lawyer who was a member of the PSC,&lt;ref name=PSC&gt;Court-appointed Plaintiffs' Steering Committee in consolidated litigation arising out of the crash&lt;/ref&gt; "after all these years [whether Captain Buschmann was "absolved" of all responsibility for the crash] is still a matter reasonable people who are fully informed may disagree on", however, there should be consensus "flight operations should not be conducted in the terminal area when thunderstorms are on the flight path; and non-frangible objects should not be placed where it is foreseeable an aircraft may go."&lt;ref name="rapoportlaw.com"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The events of Flight 1420 were featured in "Racing the Storm", a [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 1 (2003)|Season 1 (2003)]] episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''&lt;ref name="Racing the Storm" /&gt; (called ''Air Emergency'' and ''Air Disasters'' in the U.S. and ''Air Crash Investigation'' in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatization was broadcast in the United States with the title "Fatal Landing". The flight was also included in a ''Mayday'' [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 8 (2009) Special|Season 8 (2009) ''Science of Disaster'' special]] titled "Cruel Skies",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Cruel Skies|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=8|number=2|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looked at the role of bad weather in aviation disasters.

* [[The Weather Channel]] detailed the story of the flight on an episode of ''Storm Stories'', as did [[The Biography Channel]] on the show ''Flightmares''.

==Aftermath==
A 2004 memorial ceremony was held adjacent to the airport. Jeana Varnell, one of the survivors, attended the ceremony and in a newspaper article, strongly objected to the memorializing of Captain Buschmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2004/jun/02/forever-linked-through-flight-1420/ |title='Forever linked' through Flight 1420 |last=Harter |first=Andrea |newspaper=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=June 2, 2004 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anthelion''' (plural '''anthelia''', from late [[Greek language|Greek]] ανθηλιος, "opposite the sun") is a rare [[optical phenomenon]] of the [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] family. It appears on the [[parhelic circle]] opposite to the [[sun]] as a faint white spot, not unlike a [[sun dog|sundog]], and may be crossed by an X-shaped pair of diffuse arcs.
[[Image:Anthelion 120 parhelion Vädersolstavlan.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Anthelion (bottom) and [[120° parhelion]] (top) depicted in [[Vädersolstavlan]] ]]

How anthelia are formed is disputed. Walter Tape, among others, has argued they are not separate haloes, but simply where various haloes caused by horizontally oriented column-shaped [[ice crystal]]s coincide on the parhelic circle to create a bright spot. If this theory is correct, anthelia should only appear together with these other haloes.&lt;ref name="meteoros-anthelion"&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Anthelion | publisher = Arbeitskreis Meteore e.V.
 | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, anthelia occur unaccompanied by other plate crystal haloes, thus scientists have produced alternative explanations. The Dutch professor S.W. Visser proposed they form by two exterior light reflections in quadrangular prisms, while Robert Greenler has suggested two interior reflections in column-shaped crystals produces the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="meteoros-anthelion" /&gt;

While the anthelion area is usually sparse on haloes, in a complex display it features various rare optic phenomena: Flanking the anthelion on the parhelic circle are two [[120° parhelion|120° parhelia]] (and two [[Liljequist parhelion|Liljequist parhelia]]) caused by plate crystals.  The [[Tricker arc|Tricker]] and [[diffuse arc]]s are produced in singly oriented column crystals and form an [[Ankh]]-like shape passing through the anthelion.  [[Wegener arc]]s occasionally cross the sky to converge in the anthelion.&lt;ref name="atoptics-South-Pole-Anthelic"&gt;{{cite web

'''Astrophysical X-ray sources''' are [[astronomical objects]] with physical properties which result in the emission of [[X-rays]].

There are a number of types of astrophysical objects which emit X-rays, from [[galaxy cluster]]s, through [[black holes]] in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) to galactic objects such as [[supernova remnant]]s, [[star]]s, and [[binary star]]s containing a [[white dwarf]] ([[cataclysmic variable star]]s and [[super soft X-ray source]]s), [[neutron star]] or black hole ([[X-ray binaries]]). Some [[solar system]] bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the [[Moon]], although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed [[X-ray background]]. The X-ray continuum can arise from [[bremsstrahlung]], either magnetic or ordinary Coulomb, [[Thermal radiation|black-body radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton scattering]] of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morrison P |title=Extrasolar X-ray Sources |journal=Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. |year=1967 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=325–50 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.05.090167.001545 |bibcode=1967ARA&amp;A...5..325M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, celestial entities in space are discussed as celestial X-ray sources. The origin of all observed [[astronomical X-ray sources]] is in, near to, or associated with a [[coronal cloud]] or gas at coronal cloud temperatures for however long or brief a period.

{{Main|Galaxy groups and clusters}}
[[Galaxy groups and clusters#Clusters of galaxies|Clusters of galaxies]] are formed by the merger of smaller units of matter, such as galaxy groups or individual galaxies. The infalling material (which contains galaxies, gas and [[dark matter]]) gains [[kinetic energy]] as it falls into the cluster's gravitational [[potential well]]. The infalling gas collides with gas already in the cluster and is [[Shocks and Discontinuities (MHD)|shock]] heated to between 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; K depending on the size of the cluster. This very hot gas emits X-rays by thermal bremsstrahlung emission, and [[spectral line|line emission]] from metals (in astronomy, 'metals' often means all elements except [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]). The galaxies and [[dark matter]] are collisionless and quickly become [[virial theorem|virialised]], orbiting in the cluster [[potential well]].

At a [[statistical significance]] of 8σ, it was found that the spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law.&lt;ref name=Clowe&gt;{{cite journal |author= Clowe D |title = A Direct Empirical Proof of the Existence of Dark Matter |journal=Astrophys J |year=2006 |volume=648 |issue= 2 |pages = L109–L113 |doi = 10.1086/508162 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608407 |bibcode=2006ApJ...648L.109C|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

A '''quasi-stellar radio source''' ('''[[quasar]]''') is a very energetic and distant [[galaxy]] with an [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN). QSO 0836+7107 is a '''Q'''uasi-'''S'''tellar '''O'''bject (QSO) that emits baffling amounts of radio energy. This radio emission is caused by electrons spiraling (thus accelerating) along magnetic fields producing [[Cyclotron radiation|cyclotron]] or [[Synchrotron radiation|synchrotron]] radiation. These electrons can also interact with visible light emitted by the disk around the AGN or the black hole at its center. These photons accelerate the electrons, which then emit X- and gamma-radiation via [[Compton scattering|Compton]] and [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton]] scattering.

On board the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (CGRO) is the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) which detects in the 20 [[keV]] to 8 [[MeV]] range. QSO 0836+7107 or 4C 71.07 was detected by BATSE as a source of soft gamma rays and hard X-rays. "What BATSE has discovered is that it can be a soft gamma-ray source", McCollough said. QSO 0836+7107 is the faintest and most distant object to be observed in soft gamma rays. It has already been observed in gamma rays by the [[Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope]] (EGRET) also aboard the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]].&lt;ref name=Dooling&gt;{{cite web |author=Dooling D |title=BATSE finds most distant quasar yet seen in soft gamma rays Discovery will provide insight on formation of galaxies |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast24nov99_1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Black holes ==
[[File:Chandra image of Cygnus X-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Chandra image of [[Cygnus X-1]], which was the first strong black hole candidate to be discovered.]]
{{Main|Black hole}}
Black holes give off radiation because matter falling into them loses gravitational energy which may result in the emission of radiation before the matter falls into the [[event horizon]]. The infalling matter has [[angular momentum]], which means that the material cannot fall in directly, but spins around the black hole. This material often forms an [[accretion disk]]. Similar luminous accretion disks can also form around [[white dwarf]]s and neutron stars, but in these the infalling gas releases additional energy as it slams against the high-[[density]] surface with high speed. In case of a neutron star, the infall speed can be a sizeable fraction of the speed of light.{{clear}}
In some neutron star or white dwarf systems, the [[magnetic field]] of the star is strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disc. The material in the disc gets very hot because of friction, and emits X-rays. The material in the disc slowly loses its angular momentum and falls into the compact star. In neutron stars and white dwarfs, additional X-rays are generated when the material hits their surfaces. X-ray emission from black holes is variable, varying in [[luminosity]] in very short timescales. The variation in luminosity can provide information about the size of the black hole.

A [[Type Ia supernova]] is an explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in orbit around either another white dwarf or a [[red giant]] star. The dense white dwarf can accumulate gas donated from the companion. When the dwarf reaches the critical mass of {{Solar mass|1.4|link=y}}, a thermonuclear explosion ensues. As each Type Ia shines with a known luminosity, Type Ia are called "standard candles" and are used by astronomers to measure distances in the universe.

SN 2005ke is the first Type Ia supernova detected in X-ray wavelengths, and it is much brighter in the [[ultraviolet]] than expected.{{clear}}

=== Vela X-1 ===
{{Main|Vela X-1}}

{{Main|Sun}}
In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; After detecting X-ray photons from the Sun in the course of a rocket flight, T. Burnight wrote, "The sun is assumed to be the source of this radiation although radiation of wavelength shorter than 4 Å would not be expected from theoretical estimates of black body radiation from the solar corona."&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; And, of course, people have seen the solar corona in scattered visible light during solar eclipses.

While neutron stars and black holes are the quintessential point sources of X-rays, all main sequence stars are likely to have hot enough coronae to emit X-rays.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gould RJ, Burbidge GR |title=High energy cosmic photons and neutrinos |journal=Annales d'Astrophysique|volume=28 |page=171|year=1965 |bibcode=1965AnAp...28..171G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A- or F-type stars have at most thin convection zones and thus produce little coronal activity.&lt;ref name=Knigge&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knigge C, Gilliland RL, Dieball A, Zurek DR, Shara MM, Long KS |title=A blue straggler binary with three progenitors in the core of a globular cluster? |journal=Astrophys J|year=2006 |volume=641 |issue=1 |pages=281–287 |doi=10.1086/500311 |bibcode=2006ApJ...641..281K|arxiv = astro-ph/0511645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar [[solar cycle]]-related variations are observed in the flux of solar X-ray and UV or EUV radiation. Rotation is one of the primary determinants of the magnetic dynamo, but this point could not be demonstrated by observing the Sun: the Sun's magnetic activity is in fact strongly modulated (due to the 11-year magnetic spot cycle), but this effect is not directly dependent on the rotation period.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

Solar flares usually follow the solar cycle. [[CORONAS-F]] was launched on July 31, 2001 to coincide with the 23rd solar cycle maximum.
The solar flare of October 29, 2003 apparently showed a significant degree of linear polarization (&gt; 70% in channels E2 = 40-60 keV and E3 = 60-100 keV, but only about 50% in E1 = 20-40 keV) in hard X-rays,&lt;ref name=Zhitnik&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhitnik IA |author2=Logachev YI |author3=Bogomolov AV |author4=Denisov YI |author5=Kavanosyan SS |author6=Kuznetsov SN |author7=Morozov OV |author8=Myagkova IN |author9=Svertilov SI |author10=Ignat’ev AP |author11=Oparin SN |author12=Pertsov AA |author13=Tindo IP |title=Polarization, temporal, and spectral parameters of solar flare hard X-rays as measured by the SPR-N instrument onboard the CORONAS-F satellite |journal=Solar System Research|year=2006 |volume=40 |issue=2|page=93|doi=10.1134/S003809460602002X|bibcode = 2006SoSyR..40...93Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; but other observations have generally only set upper limits.

[[Coronal loop]]s form the basic structure of the lower [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the Sun. These highly structured and elegant loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic]] flux within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the [[solar cycle]], it is for this reason coronal loops are often found with [[sunspots]] at their footpoints. Coronal loops populate both active and quiet regions of the solar surface. The [[Yohkoh]] Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) observed X-rays in the 0.25-4.0 [[SI units|keV]] range, resolving solar features to 2.5 arc seconds with a temporal resolution of 0.5–2 seconds. SXT was sensitive to plasma in the 2-4 MK temperature range, making it an ideal observational platform to compare with data collected from [[TRACE]] coronal loops radiating in the EUV wavelengths.&lt;ref name=Aschwanden&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aschwanden MJ |title=Observations and models of coronal loops: From Yohkoh to TRACE, In: Magnetic coupling of the solar atmosphere |volume=188 |page=1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White dwarfs ===
{{Main|White dwarf}}
When the core of a medium mass star contracts, it causes a release of energy that makes the envelope of the star expand. This continues until the star finally blows its outer layers off. The core of the star remains intact and becomes a [[white dwarf]]. The white dwarf is surrounded by an expanding shell of gas in an object known as a planetary nebula. [[Planetary nebulae]] seem to mark the transition of a medium mass star from [[red giant]] to white dwarf. X-ray images reveal clouds of multimillion degree gas that have been compressed and heated by the fast stellar wind. Eventually the central star collapses to form a white dwarf. For a billion or so years after a star collapses to form a white dwarf, it is "white" hot with surface temperatures of ~20,000 K.

X-ray emission has been detected from PG 1658+441, a hot, isolated, magnetic white dwarf, first detected in an [[Einstein Observatory|Einstein]] IPC observation and later identified in an [[Exosat]] channel multiplier array observation.&lt;ref name=Pravdo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pravdo SH, Marshall FE, White NE, Giommi P |title=X-rays from the magnetic white dwarf PG 1658 + 441 |journal=Astrophys J|year=1986 |volume=300|page=819|doi=10.1086/163859 |bibcode=1986ApJ...300..819P}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The broad-band spectrum of this DA white dwarf can be explained as emission from a homogeneous, high-gravity, pure hydrogen atmosphere with a temperature near 28,000 K."&lt;ref name=Pravdo /&gt; These observations of PG 1658+441 support a correlation between temperature and helium abundance in white dwarf atmospheres.&lt;ref name=Pravdo /&gt;

A [[super soft X-ray source]] (SSXS) radiates soft X-rays in the range of 0.09 to 2.5 [[keV]]. Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced by steady [[nuclear fusion]] on a white dwarf's surface of material pulled from a [[binary star|binary companion]].&lt;ref name=maxplanck&gt;{{cite web |title=Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics: Super Soft X-ray Sources – Discovered with ROSAT |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/sss/sss_high.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a flow of material sufficiently high to sustain the fusion.

Real mass transfer variations may be occurring in V Sge similar to SSXS RX J0513.9-6951 as revealed by analysis of the activity of the SSXS V Sge where episodes of long low states occur in a cycle of ~400 days.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simon V, Mattei JA |title=Activity of the super-soft X-ray source V Sge |journal=AIP Conf Proc|year=2002 |volume=637|page=333|doi=10.1063/1.1518226 |bibcode=2002AIPC..637..333S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RX J0648.0-4418 is an X-ray pulsator in the [[Crab nebula]]. HD 49798 is a subdwarf star that forms a binary system with RX J0648.0-4418. The subdwarf star is a bright object in the optical and UV bands. The orbital period of the system is accurately known. Recent [[XMM-Newton]] observations timed to coincide with the expected eclipse of the X-ray source allowed an accurate determination of the mass of the X-ray source (at least 1.2 solar masses), establishing the X-ray source as a rare, ultra-massive white dwarf.&lt;ref name=Mereghetti&gt;{{cite web |title=XMM-Newton weighs up a rare white dwarf and finds it to be a heavyweight |year=2009|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=45453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brown dwarfs ===
{{Main|Brown dwarf}}
According to theory, an object that has a mass of less than about 8% of the mass of the Sun cannot sustain significant [[nuclear fusion]] in its core.&lt;ref name=browndwarf&gt;{{cite web |title=Brown Dwarfs |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/browndwarf_fg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the dividing line between [[red dwarf]] stars and [[brown dwarf]]s. The dividing line between [[planet]]s and brown dwarfs occurs with objects that have masses below about 1% of the mass of the Sun, or 10 times the mass of [[Jupiter]]. These objects cannot fuse deuterium.
[[File:Lp94420 duo m.jpg|thumb|300px|Chandra image of LP 944-20 before flare and during flare.]]

==== LP 944-20 ====
With no strong central nuclear energy source, the interior of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, [[convection]] sets up conditions for the development of a strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of [[lightning]]. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non flaring period is also a significant result. It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a brown dwarf star, and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2500&amp;nbsp;°C and becomes electrically neutral.{{clear}}
[[File:Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the brown dwarf TWA 5B.jpg|189px|right|Chandra observation of TWA 5B.]]

==== TWA 5B ====
Using NASA's [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], scientists have detected X-rays from a low mass brown dwarf in a multiple star system.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite web |date=April 14, 2003|title=X-rays from a Brown Dwarf's Corona |url=http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy/jay/chapter18_etu6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first time that a brown dwarf this close to its parent star(s) (Sun-like stars TWA 5A) has been resolved in X-rays.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; "Our Chandra data show that the X-rays originate from the brown dwarf's coronal plasma which is some 3 million degrees Celsius", said Yohko Tsuboi of [[Chuo University]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; "This brown dwarf is as bright as the Sun today in X-ray light, while it is fifty times less massive than the Sun", said Tsuboi.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; "This observation, thus, raises the possibility that even massive planets might emit X-rays by themselves during their youth!"&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Electric potentials of about 10 million volts, and currents of 10 million amps&amp;nbsp;– a hundred times greater than the most powerful lightning bolts&amp;nbsp;– are required to explain the auroras at Jupiter's poles, which are a thousand times more powerful than those on Earth.

On Earth, auroras are triggered by solar storms of energetic particles, which disturb Earth's magnetic field. As shown by the swept-back appearance in the illustration, gusts of particles from the Sun also distort Jupiter's magnetic field, and on occasion produce auroras.

Saturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun indicating that Saturn's X-radiation is due to the reflection of solar X-rays by Saturn's atmosphere. The optical image is much brighter, and shows the beautiful ring structures, which were not detected in X-rays.{{clear}}

== X-ray fluorescence ==
Some of the detected X-rays, originating from solar system bodies other than the Sun, are produced by [[fluorescence]]. Scattered solar X-rays provide an additional component.

In the Röntgensatellit (ROSAT) image of the Moon, pixel brightness corresponds to X-ray intensity. The bright lunar hemisphere shines in X-rays because it re-emits X-rays originating from the sun. The background sky has an X-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture. The dark side of the Moon's disk shadows this X-ray background radiation coming from the deep space. A few X-rays only seem to come from the shadowed lunar hemisphere. Instead, they originate in Earth's geocorona or extended atmosphere which surrounds the orbiting X-ray observatory. The measured lunar X-ray luminosity of ~1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; W makes the Moon one of the weakest known non-terrestrial X-ray source.

=== Comet detection ===

This image merges data acquired by Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (blue and green) and X-Ray Telescope (red). At the time of the observation, the comet was 99.5 million miles from Earth and 115.3 million miles from the Sun.]]

NASA's [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite was monitoring [[Comet Lulin]] as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. "The solar wind -- a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun -- interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite web |author=Reddy F |title=NASA's Swift Spies Comet Lulin |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/lulin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Celestial X-ray sources ==
The [[celestial sphere]] has been divided into 88 constellations. The [[IAU]] constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are [[galaxies]] or [[black hole]]s at the centers of galaxies. Some are [[pulsar]]s. As with the [[X-ray astronomy#Astronomical X-ray sources|astronomical X-ray sources]], striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the [[universe]] as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth.

Regarding [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopea A]] [[Supernova remnant|SNR]], it is believed that first light from the stellar explosion reached Earth approximately 300 years ago but there are no historical records of any sightings of the progenitor supernova, probably due to [[interstellar dust]] absorbing optical wavelength radiation before it reached Earth (although it is possible that it was recorded as a sixth magnitude star [[3 Cassiopeiae]] by [[John Flamsteed]] on August 16, 1680&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes DW |title=Did Flamsteed see the Cassiopeia A supernova? |journal=Nature |volume=285|year=1980 |issue=5761 |page=132|doi=10.1038/285132a0|bibcode = 1980Natur.285..132H }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Possible explanations lean toward the idea that the source star was unusually massive and had previously ejected much of its outer layers. These outer layers would have cloaked the star and reabsorbed much of the light released as the inner star collapsed.

CTA 1 is another SNR X-ray source in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. A pulsar in the CTA 1 [[supernova]] remnant (4U 0000+72) initially emitted radiation in the X-ray bands (1970–1977).

As of August 27, 2007, discoveries concerning asymmetric iron line broadening and their implications for relativity have been a topic of much excitement. With respect to the asymmetric iron line broadening, Edward Cackett of the [[University of Michigan]] commented, "We're seeing the gas whipping around just outside the neutron star's surface,". "And since the inner part of the disk obviously can't orbit any closer than the neutron star's surface, these measurements give us a maximum size of the neutron star's diameter. The neutron stars can be no larger than 18 to 20.5 miles across, results that agree with other types of measurements."&lt;ref name=Cackett&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Gibb M, Bhattacharyya S, Strohmayer T, Cackett E, Miller J |title=Astronomers Pioneer New Method for Probing Exotic Matter |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/news/27aug07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We've seen these asymmetric lines from many black holes, but this is the first confirmation that neutron stars can produce them as well. It shows that the way neutron stars accrete matter is not very different from that of black holes, and it gives us a new tool to probe Einstein's theory", says Tod Strohmayer of [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name=Cackett /&gt;

"This is fundamental physics", says Sudip Bhattacharyya also of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] and the [[University of Maryland]]. "There could be exotic kinds of particles or states of matter, such as quark matter, in the centers of neutron stars, but it's impossible to create them in the lab. The only way to find out is to understand neutron stars."&lt;ref name=Cackett /&gt;

Using [[XMM-Newton]], Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer observed Serpens X-1, which contains a neutron star and a stellar companion. Cackett and Jon Miller of the [[University of Michigan]], along with Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer, used [[Suzaku (satellite)|Suzaku]]'s superb spectral capabilities to survey Serpens X-1.

=== Microquasar ===
A [[microquasar]] is a smaller cousin of a [[quasar]] that is a radio emitting [[X-ray binary]], with an often resolvable pair of radio jets. [[SS 433]] is one of the most exotic [[star system]]s observed. It is an [[eclipsing binary]] with the primary either a black hole or neutron star and the secondary is a late [[A-type star]]. SS 433 lies within [[Supernova remnant|SNR]] [[W50 (nebula)|W50]]. The material in the jet traveling from the secondary to the primary does so at 26% of light speed. The spectrum of SS 433 is affected by [[Doppler shift]]s and by [[special relativity|relativity]]: when the effects of the Doppler shift are subtracted, there is a residual redshift which corresponds to a velocity of about 12,000 kps. This does not represent an actual velocity of the system away from the Earth; rather, it is due to [[time dilation]], which makes moving clocks appear to stationary observers to be ticking more slowly. In this case, the relativistically moving excited atoms in the jets appear to vibrate more slowly and their radiation thus appears red-shifted.&lt;ref name=Margon&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margon B |title=Observations of SS 433|journal=Annu.

=== Messier 87 ===
[[File:M87 jet.jpg|300px|thumb|A 5,000 [[Light-year|ly]] jet of matter ejected from M87 at near [[Speed of light|lightspeed]].]]
Observations made by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds [[Messier 87]]. These loops and rings are generated by variations in the rate at which material is ejected from the [[supermassive black hole]] in jets. The distribution of loops suggests that minor eruptions occur every six million years.

One of the rings, caused by a major eruption, is a shock wave 85,000 light-years in diameter around the black hole. Other remarkable features observed include narrow X-ray emitting filaments up to 100,000 light-years long, and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago.

The galaxy also contains a notable [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN) that is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly [[radio wave]]s.&lt;ref name=Baade&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baade W, Minkowski R |title=On the Identification of Radio Sources |journal=Astrophys J |year=1954 |volume=119 |page=215|doi=10.1086/145813 |bibcode=1954ApJ...119..215B}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

=== Magnetars ===
[[File:Magnetar SGR 1900+14.jpg|300px|thumb|Magnetar SGR 1900+14 is in the exact center of the image, which shows a surrounding ring of gas 7 [[Light-year|ly]] across in infrared light, as seen by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The magnetar itself is not visible at this wavelength, but it has been seen in X-ray light.]]
A '''[[magnetar]]''' is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]], particularly X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s. The theory regarding these objects was proposed by [[Robert C. Duncan (astrophysicist)|Robert Duncan]] and Christopher Thompson in 1992, but the first recorded burst of gamma rays thought to have been from a magnetar was on March 5, 1979.&lt;ref name=Kouveliotou&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kouveliotou C, Duncan RC, Thompson C |year=2003 |journal=Sci Am |url=http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/sciam.pdf |title=Magnetars |pages=34–41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611144829/http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/sciam.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These magnetic fields are hundreds of thousands of times stronger than any man-made magnet,&lt;ref name=Dreasen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fzd.de/db/Cms?pNid=1482 |title=HLD user program, at Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory |accessdate = 2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quadrillions of times more powerful than [[Earth's magnetic field|the field surrounding Earth]].&lt;ref name=Naye&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3310066.html?page=1&amp;c=y |title=The Brightest Blast |author=Naye R |accessdate=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, they are the most magnetic objects ever detected in the universe.&lt;ref name=Kouveliotou /&gt;

On March 5, 1979, after dropping probes into the atmosphere of [[Venus]], [[Venera 11]] and [[Venera 12]], while in heliocentric orbits, were hit at 10:51 am EST by a blast of gamma ray radiation. This contact raised the radiation readings on both the probes Konus experiments from a normal 100 counts per second to over 200,000 counts a second, in only a fraction of a millisecond.&lt;ref name=Kouveliotou /&gt; This giant flare was detected by numerous spacecraft and with these detections was localized by the interplanetary network to SGR 0526-66 inside the N-49 SNR of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].&lt;ref name=Mazets&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mazets EP, Aptekar RL, Cline TL, Frederiks DD, Goldsten JO, Golenetskii SV, Hurley K, von Kienlin A, Pal'shin VD |title=A Giant Flare from a Soft Gamma Repeater in the Andromeda Galaxy, M31 |journal=Astrophys J|year=2008 |arxiv=0712.1502|bibcode = 2008ApJ...680..545M |doi = 10.1086/587955 |volume=680|issue=1 |pages=545–549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, Konus detected another source in March 1979: [[SGR 1900+14]], located 20,000 light-years away in the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] had a long period of low emissions, except the significant burst in 1979, and a couple after.

What is the evolutionary relationship between pulsars and magnetars? Astronomers would like to know if magnetars represent a rare class of pulsars, or if some or all pulsars go through a magnetar phase during their life cycles. NASA's [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (RXTE) has revealed that the youngest known pulsing neutron star has thrown a temper tantrum. The collapsed star occasionally unleashes powerful bursts of X-rays, which are forcing astronomers to rethink the life cycle of neutron stars.

"We are watching one type of neutron star literally change into another right before our very eyes. This is a long-sought missing link between different types of pulsars", says Fotis Gavriil of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Naeye&gt;{{cite web |author=Naeye R |title=Powerful Explosions Suggest Neutron Star Missing Link |year=2008|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/magnetar_hybrid.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:213034main kes 75 226.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] image shows the supernova Kes 75 with the young, normal pulsar, neutron star PSR J1846-0258 in the center of the blue area at the top.]]

PSR J1846-0258 is in the constellation Aquila. It had been classed as a normal pulsar because of its fast spin (3.1 s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and pulsar-like spectrum. RXTE caught four magnetar-like X-ray bursts on May 31, 2006, and another on July 27, 2006. Although none of these events lasted longer than 0.14 second, they all packed the wallop of at least 75,000 Suns. "Never before has a regular pulsar been observed to produce magnetar bursts", says Gavriil.&lt;ref name=Naeye /&gt;

"Young, fast-spinning pulsars were not thought to have enough magnetic energy to generate such powerful bursts", says Marjorie Gonzalez, formerly of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, now based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. "Here's a normal pulsar that's acting like a magnetar."&lt;ref name=Naeye /&gt;
[[File:213032main chandra before after 226.jpg|thumb|300px|These [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] images show PSR J1846-0258 in Kes 75 on October 2000 (left) and June 2006 (right). The pulsar brightened in X-rays after giving off powerful outbursts earlier in 2006.]]

The observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory showed that the object had brightened in X-rays, confirming that the bursts were from the pulsar, and that its spectrum had changed to become more magnetar-like. The fact that PSR J1846's spin rate is decelerating also means that it has a strong magnetic field braking the rotation. The implied magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth's field, but it's 10 to 100 times weaker than a typical magnetar. [[Victoria Kaspi]] of [[McGill University]] notes, "PSR J1846's actual magnetic field could be much stronger than the measured amount, suggesting that many young neutron stars classified as pulsars might actually be magnetars in disguise, and that the true strength of their magnetic field only reveals itself over thousands of years as they ramp up in activity."&lt;ref name=Naeye /&gt;{{clear}}

== X-ray dark stars ==
{{Main|X-ray dark star}}
During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images of the [[X-ray astronomy#Sun|Sun in X-rays]], the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. [[Betelgeuse]], on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark.&lt;ref name=Posson&gt;{{cite arXiv |vauthors=Posson-Brown P, Kashyap VL, Pease DO, Drake JJ |title=Dark Supergiant: Chandra's Limits on X-rays from Betelgeuse |eprint=astro-ph/0606387|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray flux from the entire stellar surface corresponds to a surface flux limit that ranges from 30-7000 ergs s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at T=1 MK, to ~1 erg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at higher temperatures, five orders of magnitude below the quiet Sun X-ray surface flux.&lt;ref name=Posson /&gt;

Like the [[red supergiant]] Betelgeuse, hardly any X-rays are emitted by [[red giant]]s.&lt;ref name=Gudel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Güdel M |title=X-ray astronomy of stellar coronae |journal=Astron Astrophys Rev |year=2004 |volume=12 |issue=2–3 |pages=71–237 |doi=10.1007/s00159-004-0023-2 |url=http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |arxiv=astro-ph/0406661 |bibcode=2004A&amp;ARv..12...71G |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811230835/http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the X-ray deficiency may involve
* a turn-off of the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]],
* a suppression by competing [[Stellar wind|wind]] production, or
* strong attenuation by an overlying thick [[chromosphere]].&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

Prominent bright red giants include [[Aldebaran]], [[Arcturus]], and [[Gamma Crucis]]. There is an apparent X-ray "dividing line" in the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram|H-R diagram]] among the [[giant star]]s as they cross from the [[main sequence]] to become red giants. [[Alpha Trianguli Australis]] (α TrA / α Trianguli Australis) appears to be a Hybrid star (parts of both sides) in the "Dividing Line" of evolutionary transition to red giant.&lt;ref name=Kashyap&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashyap V, Rosner R, Harnden FR Jr, Maggio A, Micela G, Sciortino S |title=X-ray emission on hybird stars: ROSAT observations of alpha Trianguli Australis and IOTA Aurigae |journal=Astrophys J|year=1994|volume=431 |page=402|doi=10.1086/174494 |bibcode=1994ApJ...431..402K}}&lt;/ref&gt; α TrA can serve to test the several [[X-ray astronomy#Astronomical models|Dividing Line models]].

There is also a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

In the few genuine late A- or early F-type coronal emitters, their weak dynamo operation is generally not able to brake the rapidly spinning star considerably during their short lifetime so that these coronae are conspicuous by their severe deficit of X-ray emission compared to chromospheric and transition region fluxes; the latter can be followed up to mid-A type stars at quite high levels.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt; Whether or not these atmospheres are indeed heated acoustically and drive an "expanding", weak and cool corona or whether they are heated magnetically, the X-ray deficit and the low coronal temperatures clearly attest to the inability of these stars to maintain substantial, hot coronae in any way comparable to cooler active stars, their appreciable chromospheres notwithstanding.&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

== X-ray interstellar medium ==
{{Main|Interstellar medium}}
The Hot Ionized Medium (HIM), sometimes consisting of [[Corona|coronal gas]], in the temperature range 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K emits X-rays. [[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures&amp;nbsp;– of varying sizes&amp;nbsp;– can be observed, such as [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas, by X-ray satellite telescopes. The Sun is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

== Diffuse X-ray background ==
[[File:Rosat 0.25kev all-sky survey.gif|thumb|300px|right|This [[ROSAT]] image is an Aitoff-Hammer equal-area map in galactic coordinates with the Galactic center in the middle of the 0.25 keV diffuse X-ray background.]]
In addition to discrete sources which stand out against the sky, there is good evidence for a diffuse X-ray background.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; During more than a decade of observations of X-ray emission from the Sun, evidence of the existence of an isotropic X-ray background flux was obtained in 1956.&lt;ref name=Kupperian&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kupperian JE Jr |author2=Friedman H |title=Experiment research US progr. for IGY to 1.7.58 |journal=IGY Rocket Report Ser. |month= |year=1958 |volume= |issue=1 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This background flux is rather consistently observed over a wide range of energies.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; The early high-energy end of the spectrum for this diffuse X-ray background was obtained by instruments on board [[Ranger 3]] and [[Ranger 5]].&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; The X-ray flux corresponds to a  total energy density of about 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; eV/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; The ROSAT soft X-ray diffuse background (SXRB) image shows the general increase in intensity from the Galactic plane to the poles.

By comparing the soft X-ray background with the distribution of neutral hydrogen, it is generally agreed that within the Milky Way disk, [[Super soft X-ray source|super soft X-rays]] are absorbed by this neutral hydrogen.

== X-ray dark planets ==
{{Main|X-ray dark planet}}
X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. "Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area."&lt;ref name=Gudel /&gt;

Between 2011 and 2015, [http://www.blaikenvind.se BlaikenVind AB], a joint venture of [[Skellefteå Kraft]] and [[Fortum]] are building one of Europe's largest wind farms in northern [[Sweden]]. When finished, the park will consist of 90 wind power plants and have a total capacity of 225&amp;nbsp;MW. '''Blaiken wind farm''', has been chosen as a demonstration plant by the EU's NER300 programme, one of the world's largest funding programmes for climate-neutral energy.  The project meets the challenge of developing good solutions for efficient wind power production in a cold and icy climate.

'''Cellular components''' are the complex [[biomolecule]]s and [[structural biology|structures]] of which [[cell (biology)|cells]], and thus living [[organism]]s, are composed. Cells are the structural and functional units of life. The smallest organisms are single cells, while the largest organisms are assemblages of trillions of cells. DNA is found in nearly all living cells; each cell carries chromosome(s) having a distinctive DNA sequence.

Examples include [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, [[biomolecular complex]]es such as a [[ribosome]], and structures such as [[biological membrane|membranes]], and [[organelle]]s. While the majority of cellular components are located within the cell itself, some may exist in [[extracellular]] areas of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasyutin|first=I.

Cellular components may also be called '''biological matter''' or '''biological material'''. Most biological matter has the characteristics of [[soft matter]], being governed by relatively small energies. All known life is made of biological matter. To be differentiated from other [[hypothetical types of biochemistry|theoretical or fictional life forms]], such life may be called ''[[carbon-based life|carbon-based]]'', ''cellular'', ''organic'', ''biological'', or even simply ''living'' – as some definitions of life exclude [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]].

[[File:Diskflaskor.JPG|thumb|Detergents]]
A '''detergent''' is a [[surfactant]] or a mixture of surfactants with cleaning properties in dilute solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/D01643.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book - detergent |publisher=Goldbook.iupac.org |date=2012-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These substances are usually [[alkylbenzenesulfonate]]s, a family of compounds that are similar to [[soap]] but are more soluble in [[hard water]], because the polar [[sulfonate]] (of detergents) is less likely than the polar [[carboxylate]] (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.

In most household contexts, the term ''detergent'' by itself refers specifically to ''[[laundry detergent]]'' or ''[[Dishwashing liquid|dish detergent]]'', as opposed to ''hand soap'' or other types of cleaning agents.  Detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions.  Detergents, like soaps, work because they are [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]]: partly [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (polar) and partly [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] (non-polar).  Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds (like oil and grease) with water.  Because air is not hydrophilic, detergents are also [[foaming agent]]s to varying degrees.

==Chemical classification of detergents==
Detergents are classified into three broad groupings, depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants.

===Anionic detergents===
Typical anionic detergents are [[Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate|alkylbenzenesulfonates]].  The alkylbenzene portion of these [[anions]] is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic.  Two different varieties have been popularized, those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups.  The former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Eduard Smulders, Wolfgang Rybinski, Eric Sung, Wilfried Rähse, Josef Steber, Frederike Wiebel, Anette Nordskog, "Laundry Detergents" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a08_315.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets.

[[Bile acids]], such as [[deoxycholic acid]] (DOC), are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils.

[[File:Soap&amp;Detergents.png|thumb|480px|right|Three kinds of anionic detergents: a branched sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, linear [[sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate]], and a soap.]]

===Cationic detergents===
Cationic detergents that are similar to the anionic ones, with a hydrophilic component, but, instead of the anionic sulfonate group, the cationic surfactants have [[quaternary ammonium]] as the polar end.  The ammonium sulfate center is positively charged.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents===
Non-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged, hydrophilic headgroups. Typical non-ionic detergents are based on [[polyoxyethylene]] or a [[glycoside]]. Common examples of the former include [[polysorbate|Tween]], [[Triton X-100|Triton]], and the Brij series. These materials are also known as ethoxylates or PEGlyates and their metabolites, [[nonylphenol]].  Glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup. Examples include [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]] and [[maltosides]]. HEGA and MEGA series detergents are similar, possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup.

[[Zwitterion]]ic detergents possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of +1 and −1 charged chemical groups. Examples include [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]].

==Major applications of detergents==

===Household cleaning===
{{Main article|Laundry detergent|Dishwasher detergent}}
One of the largest applications of detergents is for household cleaning including [[dish washing]] and washing [[laundry]].  The formulations are complex, reflecting the diverse demands of the application and the highly competitive consumer market.

===Fuel additives===
Both carburetors and fuel injector components of [[Otto engine]]s benefit from detergents in the fuels to prevent [[fouling]].  Concentrations are about 300 [[parts per million#Parts-per expressions|ppm]].  Typical detergents are long-chain amines and amides such as polyisobuteneamine and polyisobuteneamide/succinimide.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Dabelstein, Arno Reglitzky, Andrea Schütze, Klaus Reders "Automotive Fuels" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_719.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blasting honkanummi 4-6.jpg|thumb|Rock blasting in Finland]]

'''Drilling and blasting''' is the controlled use of [[explosives]] and other methods such as [[gas pressure blasting]] pyrotechnics, to break [[rock (geology)|rock]] for [[earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]. It is practiced most often in [[mining]], [[quarrying]] and [[civil engineering]] such as [[dam]] or road construction. The result of rock blasting is often known as a '''rock cut'''.&lt;!--'''shot-firing''' as synonym?--&gt;

Drilling and blasting currently utilizes many different varieties of [[explosive material|explosives]] with different compositions and performance properties.  Higher [[velocity]] explosives are used for relatively hard rock in order to shatter and break the rock, while low velocity explosives are used in soft rocks to generate more gas pressure and a greater heaving effect. For instance, an early 20th-century blasting manual compared the effects of black powder to that of a wedge, and dynamite to that of a hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice|first=William|title=The Shot-Firer's Guide|year=c. 1910|publisher="The Electrician" Printing and Publishing Company Ltd.|location=London|pages=79–80|url=https://archive.org/stream/shotfirersguidep00maurrich#page/78/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used explosives in mining today are [[ANFO]] based blends due to lower cost than [[dynamite]].

Before the advent of [[tunnel boring machine]]s, drilling and blasting was the only economical way of excavating long [[tunnel]]s through hard rock, where digging is not possible. Even today, the method is still used in the construction of  tunnels, such as in the construction of the [[Lötschberg Base Tunnel]]. The decision whether to construct a tunnel using a TBM or using a drill and blast method includes a number of factors.  Tunnel length is a key issue that needs to be addressed because large TBMs for a rock tunnel have a high capital cost, but because they are usually quicker than a drill and blast tunnel the price per metre of tunnel is lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolymbas|first=Dimitrios|title=Tunelling and tunnel mechanics: a rational approach to tunnelling |year=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-25196-0|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that shorter tunnels tend to be less economical to construct with a TBM and are therefore usually constructed by drill and blast. Managing ground conditions can also have a significant effect on the choice with different methods suited to different hazards in the ground.

== History ==
The use of explosives in mining goes back to the year 1627,&lt;ref&gt;Gary L. Buffington, [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=ASSE-00-005 The Art of Blasting on Construction and Surface Mining Sites], American Society of Safety Engineers (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; when [[gunpowder]] was first used in place of mechanical tools in the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] (now [[Slovakia|Slovak]]) town of [[Banská Štiavnica]]. The innovation spread quickly throughout Europe and the Americas.

While drilling and blasting saw limited use in pre-industrial times using [[gunpowder]] (such as with the [[Blue Ridge Tunnel]] in the United States, built in the 1850s), it was not until more powerful (and safer) [[explosive]]s, such as [[dynamite]] (patented 1867), as well as powered [[drill]]s were developed, that its potential was fully realised.

Drilling and blasting was successfully used to construct tunnels throughout the world, notably the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]],  the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]], the [[Simplon Tunnel]], the [[Jungfraubahn]] and even the longest road tunnel in the world, [[Lærdalstunnelen]], are constructed using this method.

In 1990, 2.1 million [[tonnes]] (2.32 million short tons) of commercial explosives were consumed in the United States, representing an estimated expenditure of 3.5 to 4 billion 1993 dollars on blasting. Australia had the highest explosives consumption that year at 500 million tonnes (551 million short tons), with [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] another leader in rock blasting (Persson et al. 1994:1).

== Procedure ==
[[File:Södermalmstunneln 2009a.jpg|thumb|A [[Drilling jumbo|drill jumbo]] during the construction of [[Citybanan]] under Stockholm, used for drilling holes for explosives]]
As the name suggests, drilling and blasting works as follows:

*A number of holes are drilled into the rock, which are then filled with explosives.
*Detonating the explosive causes the rock to collapse.
*Rubble is removed and the new tunnel surface is reinforced.
*Repeating these steps until desired excavation is complete.

The positions and depths of the holes (and the amount of explosive each hole receives) are determined by a carefully constructed pattern, which, together with the correct timing of the individual explosions, will guarantee that the tunnel will have an approximately circular cross-section.

During operation, [[blasting mat]]s may be used to contain the blast, suppress dust and noise, for fly rock prevention and sometimes to direct the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hansen|editor1-first=T.

== Rock support ==
As a tunnel or excavation progresses the roof and side walls need to be supported to stop the rock falling into the excavation. The philosophy and methods for rock support vary widely but typical rock support systems can include:
* [[Rock Bolt|Rock bolts]] or rock dowels
* [[Shotcrete]]
* Ribs or mining arches and lagging
* Cable bolts
* In-situ concrete
Typically a rock support system would include a number of these support methods, each intended to undertake a specific role in the rock support such as the combination of rock bolting and shotcrete.

{{Infobox dubnium}}
'''Dubnium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Db''' and [[atomic number]] 105. Dubnium is highly radioactive: the most stable known [[isotopes of dubnium|isotope]], dubnium-268, has a [[half-life]] of about 28 hours. This greatly limits the extent of research on dubnium.

Dubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially.  The Soviet [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) claimed the first discovery of the element in 1968, followed by the American [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] in 1970. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]], resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was formally named ''dubnium'' in 1997 after the town of [[Dubna]], the site of the JINR.

Theoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of [[group 5 element|group 5]] in the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s, placing it under [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], and [[tantalum]]. Dubnium should share most properties, such as its valence [[electron configuration]] and having a dominant +5 oxidation state, with the other group 5 elements, with a few anomalies due to [[relativistic effects]]. A limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this. Solution chemistry experiments have revealed that dubnium often behaves more like niobium rather than tantalum, breaking [[periodic trends]].

== Discovery ==
===Background===
[[Uranium]], element 92, is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantity in nature; heavier elements can only be produced practically by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element—[[neptunium]], element 93—was achieved in 1940 by a team of researchers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radiochemistry and Nuclear Chemistry|last=Choppin|first=G. R.|last2=Liljenzin|first2=J.-O.|last3=Rydberg|first3=J.|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7506-7463-8|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, American scientists synthesized the elements up to [[mendelevium]], element 101, which was synthesized in 1955. From element 102, the priority of discoveries was contested between American and Soviet physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/017/28017156.pdf|title=The Transuranium Elements: From Neptunium and Plutonium to Element 112|last=Hoffman|first=D. C.|date=|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=October 10, 2017|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rivalry resulted in a race for new elements and credit for their discoveries, later named the [[Transfermium Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | date = 1995 | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | page =5 | title = The Transfermium Wars |first=L. |last=Rothstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reports ===

The first report of the [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of element 105]] came from the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], in April 1968. The scientists bombarded [[americium-243|&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am]] with a beam of [[neon-22|&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne]] ions, and reported 9.4&amp;nbsp;MeV (with a half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7&amp;nbsp;MeV (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.05&amp;nbsp;s) [[alpha decay|alpha activities]] followed by alpha activities similar to those of either &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;103 or &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;103. Based on prior theoretical predictions, the two activity lines were assigned to &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;105 and &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;105, respectively.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

:{{nuclide|americium|243}} + {{nuclide|neon|22}} → &lt;sup&gt;265−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;105 + ''x'' {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}} (''x'' = 4, 5)

After observing the alpha decays of element 105, the researchers aimed to observe [[spontaneous fission]] (SF) of the element and study the resulting fission fragments. They published a paper in February 1970, reporting multiple examples of two such activities, with half-lives of 14&amp;nbsp;ms and {{val|2.2|0.5|u=s}}. They assigned the former activity to &lt;sup&gt;242mf&lt;/sup&gt;Am{{efn|This notation signifies that the nucleus is a [[nuclear isomer]] that decays via spontaneous fission.}} and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element 105. They suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element 105, because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the &lt;sup&gt;242mf&lt;/sup&gt;Am-producing transfer reaction, in accordance with theoretical predictions. To establish that this activity was not from a (&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne,''x''n) reaction, the researchers bombarded a &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am target with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O ions; reactions producing &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;103 and &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;103 showed very little SF activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;103 and &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;103 produced no SF activity at all, in line with theoretical data. The researchers concluded that the activities observed came from SF of element 105.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

In April 1970, a team at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] (LBL), in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], United States, claimed to have synthesized element 105 by bombarding [[californium-249]] with [[nitrogen-15]] ions, with an alpha activity of 9.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. To ensure this activity was not from a different reaction, the team attempted other reactions: bombarding &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cf with &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, Pb with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, and Hg with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N. They stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei matched those of &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;103, implying that the parent nuclei were of &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;105.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

:{{nuclide|californium|249}} + {{nuclide|nitrogen|15}} → &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;105 + 4 {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}

These results did not confirm the JINR findings regarding the 9.4&amp;nbsp;MeV or 9.7&amp;nbsp;MeV alpha decay of &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;105, leaving only &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;105 as a possibly produced isotope.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

JINR then attempted another experiment to create element 105, published in a report in May 1970. They claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element 105 and that the experiment confirmed their previous work. According to the paper, the isotope produced by JINR was probably &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;105, or possibly &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;105.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt; This report included an initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the SF activity nearly matched that of [[Niobium(V) chloride|niobium pentachloride]], rather than [[hafnium tetrachloride]]. The team identified a 2.2-second SF activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, and inferred that the source of the SF activity must have been element 105.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

In June 1970, JINR made improvements on their first experiment, using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a [[collimator]] before the catcher. This time, they were able to find 9.1&amp;nbsp;MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;103 or &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;103, implying that the original isotope was either &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;105 or &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;105.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

JINR did not propose a name after their first report claiming synthesis of element 105, which would have been the usual practice. This led LBL to believe that JINR did not have enough experimental data to back their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/dubnium|title=Dubnium {{!}} chemical element|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|access-date=March 25, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After collecting more data, JINR proposed the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns) in honor of the Danish nuclear physicist [[Niels Bohr]], a founder of the theories of [[atomic structure]] and [[Old quantum theory|quantum theory]]. When LBL first announced their synthesis of element 105, they proposed that the new element be named ''hahnium'' (Ha) after the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], the "father of nuclear chemistry", thus creating an [[element naming controversy]].&lt;ref name="FontaniCosta2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fontani|first1=M.|last2=Costa|first2=M.|last3=Orna|first3=M.

In 1981, the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI; ''Society for Heavy Ion Research'') in [[Darmstadt]], West Germany, claimed synthesis of element 107; their report came out five years after the first report from JINR but with greater precision, making a more solid claim on discovery.&lt;ref name="1993 report"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|year=1993|title=Discovery of the Transfermium elements|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/562229/iupac1.pdf|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=65|issue=8|pages=1757|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|pmid=|access-date=September 7, 2016|via=|last1=Barber|first1=Robert C|last2=Greenwood|first2=N.

In 1985, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) formed a [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] (JWP) to assess discoveries and establish final names for the controversial elements.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt; The party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognition of an element, and in 1991, they finished the work on assessing discoveries and disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 LBL experiment, closely followed by the June 1970 JINR experiment, so credit for the discovery of the element should be shared between the two teams.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

LBL said that the input from JINR was overrated in the review. They claimed JINR was only able to unambiguously demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 a year after they did. JINR and GSI endorsed the report.&lt;ref name="1993 responses" /&gt;

In 1994, IUPAC published a recommendation on naming the disputed elements. For element 105, they proposed ''joliotium'' (Jl) after the French physicist [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], a contributor to the development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called [[nobelium]].&lt;ref name="1994 IUPAC"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|year=1994|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994)|url=https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac-2007/1994/pdf/6612x2419.pdf|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=66|issue=12|pages=2419–2421|doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|pmid=|access-date=September 7, 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922194905/https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac-2007/1994/pdf/6612x2419.pdf|archivedate=September 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation was criticized by the American scientists for several reasons. Firstly, their suggestions were scrambled: the names ''rutherfordium'' and ''hahnium'', originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were respectively reassigned to elements 106 and 108. Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name ''seaborgium'' for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the 1993 report had given the LBL team the sole credit for its discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/seaborgium-dispute.html|title=Naming of element 106 disputed by international committee|last=Yarris|first=L.|year=1994|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=no|access-date=September 7, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, IUPAC abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise. They suggested ''seaborgium'' for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all the other American proposals, except for the established name ''lawrencium'' for element 103. The equally entrenched name ''nobelium'' for element 102 was replaced by ''flerovium'' after Georgy Flerov, following the recognition by the 1993 report that that element had been first synthesized in Dubna. This was rejected by American scientists and the decision was retracted.&lt;ref name="AlbertC2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=D.

== Predicted properties ==
According to the [[periodic law]], dubnium should belong to group 5, with [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], and [[tantalum]]. Several studies have investigated the properties of element 105 and found that they generally agreed with the predictions of periodic law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to [[relativistic effects]],{{Efn|Relativistic effects arise when an object moves at velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.}} which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. These properties have remained challenging to measure for several reasons: the difficulties of production of superheavy atoms, the low rates of production, which only allows for microscopic scales, requirements for a radiochemistry laboratory to test the atoms, short half-lives of those atoms, and the presence of many unwanted activities apart from those of synthesis of superheavy atoms. So far, studies have only been performed on single atoms.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

=== Atomic and physical ===

[[File:7s electrons dubnium relativistic vs nonrelativistic.svg|thumb|Relativistic (solid line) and nonrelativistic (dashed line) radial distribution of the 7s valence electrons in dubnium.]]
A direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of [[electromagnetic attraction]] between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for the outermost s [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] (and p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; ones, though in dubnium they are not occupied): for example, the 7s orbital contracts by 25% in size and is stabilized by 2.6&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

A more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals [[shielding effect|shield]] the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move in larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its 6d electrons.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

[[File:Atomic orbitals dubnium.svg|thumb|Relativistic stabilization of the ''n''s orbitals, the destabilization of the {{nobreak|(''n''-1)d}} orbitals and their spin–orbit splitting for the group 5 elements.]]
Another effect is the [[spin–orbit interaction]], particularly spin–orbit splitting, which splits the 6d subshell—the [[azimuthal quantum number]] ℓ of a d&amp;nbsp;shell is 2—into two subshells, with four of the ten orbitals having their ℓ lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. All ten energy levels are raised; four of them are lower than the other six. (The three 6d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels, 6d&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt;.)&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

A singly ionized atom of dubnium (Db&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) should lose a 6d electron compared to a neutral atom; the doubly (Db&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) or triply (Db&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate 7s electrons, unlike its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is expected to have two 6d, rather than 7s, electrons remaining, the resulting +3 oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum +5 oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

Atoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a [[body-centered cubic]] configuration, like the previous group 5 elements.&lt;ref name=bcc /&gt; The predicted density of dubnium is 29&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

=== Chemical ===

Computational chemistry is simplest in [[gas-phase chemistry]], in which interactions between molecules may be ignored as negligible. Multiple authors&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; have researched dubnium pentachloride; calculations show it to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting the properties of a compound of a group 5 element. For example, the [[molecular orbital]] levels indicate that dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. Compared to its tantalum analog, dubnium pentachloride is expected to show increased [[covalent bond|covalent]] character: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

Calculations of [[Aqueous solution|solution]] chemistry indicate that the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, will be more stable than those of niobium and tantalum and the +3 and +4 states will be less stable. The tendency towards [[hydrolysis]] of cations with the highest oxidation state should continue to decrease within group 5 but is still expected to be quite rapid. [[Complexation]] of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have shown a reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

== Experimental chemistry ==
Experimental results of the chemistry of dubnium date back to 1974 and 1976. JINR researchers used a [[wikt:thermochromatography|thermochromatographic]] system and concluded that the volatility of dubnium bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about the same as that of hafnium bromide. It is not certain that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element 105. These results may imply that dubnium behaves more like [[hafnium]] than niobium.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

The next studies on the chemistry of dubnium were conducted in 1988, in Berkeley. They examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated [[nitric acid]]; [[sorption]] of dubnium on glass [[cover slip]]s was then compared with that of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces; the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. Surprisingly, the behavior on extraction from mixed nitric and [[hydrofluoric acid]] solution into [[methyl isobutyl ketone]] differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that complexing behavior could not be predicted purely from simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

This prompted further exploration of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Various labs jointly conducted thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and [[protactinium]] were extracted from concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]; after mixing with lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed behavior different from that of tantalum but similar to that of niobium and its pseudohomolog protactinium at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 [[Molar concentration|moles per liter]]. This similarity to the two elements suggested that the formed complex was either {{chem|DbOX|4|-}} or {{chem|[Db(OH)|2|X|4|]|-}}. After extraction experiments of dubnium from [[hydrobromic acid|hydrogen bromide]] into [[diisobutyl carbinol]] (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than either protactinium or niobium. This was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, like the group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested that dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

The first isothermal gas chromatography experiments were performed in 1992 with &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db (half-life 35 seconds). The volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits, but dubnium appeared to be significantly less volatile. It was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of {{chem|DbOBr|3}}, which was predicted to be less volatile than {{chem|DbBr|5}}. Later experiments in 1996 showed that group 5 chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides, with the exception of tantalum, presumably due to formation of {{chem|TaOCl|3}}. Later volatility studies of chlorides of dubnium and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen. The oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

In 2004–05, researchers from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Db, as a fivefold alpha decay product of the newly created [[moscovium|element 115]]. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow further chemical experimentation, with a half-life of over a day. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer with dubnium was removed from the surface of the target and dissolved in [[aqua regia]] with tracers and a [[lanthanum]] carrier, from which various +3, +4, and +5 species were precipitated on adding [[ammonium hydroxide]]. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, where it converted to nitrate form and was then dried on a film and counted. Mostly containing a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, it also had a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further in both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and never in niobium-only fractions. It was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=N. J. |last1=Stoyer |first2=J.

In 2009, at the JAEA tandem accelerator in Japan, dubnium was processed in nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution, at concentrations where niobium forms {{chem|NbOF|4|-}} and tantalum forms {{chem|TaF|6|-}}. Dubnium's behavior was close to that of niobium but not tantalum; it was thus deduced that dubnium formed {{chem|DbOF|4|-}}. From the available information, it was concluded that dubnium often behaved like niobium, sometimes like protactinium, but rarely like tantalum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nagame |first=Y.|last2=Kratz |first2=J.

'''eSolar''' is a privately held company that develops [[concentrating solar power]] (CSP) plant technology. The company was founded by the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]-based business incubator [[Idealab]] in 2007 as a developer of CSP plant technology. The company aims to develop a low cost alternative to [[fossil fuel]]s through a combination of small [[heliostat]]s, modular architecture, and a high-precision sun-tracking system. In October 2017, an article in GreenTech Media suggested that eSolar ceased business in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/concentrated-solar-contender-esolar-goes-awol#gs.RMlHENM Concentrated Solar Power Contender ESolar Goes AWOL], GreenTech Media, Jason Deign, October 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Heliostat design===
eSolar has designed heliostats that are smaller than the industry norm, allowing for pre-fabrication, mass-manufacturing, and easy installation, thereby reducing production and installation costs.  eSolar announced a new heliostat design, referred to as SCS5, during the 2013 SolarPACES Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.  SCS5 offers a more simplified design and enhanced reliability to reduce total installed solar collector system cost by more than a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/solarpaces-2013-esolar-debuts-heliostat-molten-salt-plant-design_N7008.html|title=SolarPACES 2013: eSolar debuts heliostat, molten salt plant design - Solar Novus Today|website=www.solarnovus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun-tracking software===
eSolar has developed a sun-tracking control system that is able to calibrate heliostats and monitor the performance of each heliostat within the field. Tests have shown an unprecedented pointing accuracy and high thermal concentration ratios. [citation]

===Power tower and electricity generation===
An array of heliostats reflect [[solar radiation]] to a tower-mounted thermal receiver.  In the direct-steam configuration, the concentrated solar energy boils water in the receiver to produce steam. The steam is piped to a [[steam turbine]] generator, which converts the energy to electricity. The steam out of the turbine is condensed and pressurized back into the receiver.  In the molten salt configuration, the concentrated solar energy heats molten salt to store thermal energy for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{osti|1025891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Module===
eSolar's field layout design is built around the concept of [[scalable]] modules. In the direct-steam configuration, each module comprises over 20,000 square meters &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610214006195 | doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.165 | volume=49 | title=eSolar's Modular, Scalable Molten Salt Power Tower Reference Plant Design | journal=Energy Procedia | pages=1563–1572}}&lt;/ref&gt; of heliostats arranged in two subfields - north and south - which track the sun and concentrate solar energy to the tower mounted receiver. The field layout is a simple, regular design that eliminates precision surveying and ground penetration.  In the molten salt configuration a hexagonal solar field consists of over 100,000 square meters of reflector area.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A 46&amp;nbsp;MW eSolar power unit consists of sixteen heliostat fields and towers, a single steam turbine generator set, and a steam condenser, with a typical footprint of approximately 100 hectares (250 acres). These basic 46&amp;nbsp;MW units are designed to be scaled up to fit specific power requirements.  In the molten salt configuration, 10 modules may be aggregated to build a 100MW, 50% capacity factor solar power plant.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Plants of various electric output and capacity factor may be assembled through use or varying numbers of molten salt modules.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Sierra SunTower==
[[File:Sierra SunTower Power Plant.jpg|thumb|300px|The Sierra SunTower power plant in Lancaster, California.]]
{{main article|Sierra SunTower}}
In the summer of 2009, eSolar unveiled the 5 MW Sierra SunTower plant, a commercial facility in [[Lancaster, California]] that demonstrates the company's technology. Sierra SunTower is interconnected to the [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) grid and, as of spring 2010, is the only commercial CSP tower facility in North America.

Sierra SunTower includes two eSolar modules. 24,000 heliostats, divided between four sub-fields, track the sun and focus its energy onto two tower-mounted receivers.  The focused heat converts feedwater piped to the receivers into [[superheated steam]] that drives a reconditioned 1947 [[GE]] turbine generator to produce electricity. The steam passes through a steam condenser, reverts to water through cooling, and the process repeats.

During the 12 months of construction, [[Sierra SunTower]] created over 300 temporary jobs. In operation, the site employs 21 permanent employees.

Sierra Suntower has been certified by the [[California Energy Commission]] as a renewable energy facility. Power from the facility is sold under a [[Power Purchase Agreement]] (PPA) with SCE, providing  renewable energy for up to 4,000 homes.

The 5 MW output from [[Sierra SunTower]] reduces {{CO2}} emissions by 7,000 tons per year, an amount equivalent to planting {{convert|5265|acre|km2}} of trees, removing 1,368 automobiles from the road, or saving 650,000 gallons of gasoline.

==Performance Data from US Treasury Dept.- Performance Report and Certification Form==

The eSolar Sierra SunTower generated 539 MWh (MegaWatt-hour) of electricity from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2011. A total of 539 MWh of gross electrical energy has been generated at Sierra during the period Aug 1, 2010 and July 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guntherportfolio.com/2013/04/esolar-sierra-suntower-a-history-of-concentrating-solar-power-underperformance/|title=eSolar Sierra SunTower: a History of Concentrating Solar Power Underperformance - GUNTHER Portfolio|website=guntherportfolio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately 12.6% of the expected power generation of the initial estimate of 4270 MWh, a dismal result.

==Molten salt-based solar plant==
eSolar, with its partner, [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox|Babcock &amp; Wilcox Power Generation Group]], has been working on the design of a modular [[Molten salt thermal storage|molten salt-based]] concentrating solar power plant since 2010. With the support from the U. S. Department of Energy, the companies try to come up with a design for plants with flexibility of the sizes from 50 to 200 MW by replicating the basic module without a redesign. Each module uses hexagonal heliostat field to reflect sunlight to the salt-in-tube external thermal receiver on top of the tower at the center. With many modules working together, the receivers heat the 285&amp;nbsp;°C cold salt input and return 565&amp;nbsp;°C hot salt to centrally located storage. The hot salt will then be used in the generator system to generate electricity. The new system incorporates the experience from the Sierra SunTower which uses a Babcock &amp; Wilcox's water-based receiver, and the finding from the [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eSolar’s Modular and Scalable Baseload Molten Salt Plant Design and Feasibility Project|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/58484.pdf|work=SunShot Concentrating Solar Power Program Review 2013|publisher=SunShot Initiative, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==

===NRG===
[[NRG Energy, Inc.]] partnered with eSolar in February 2009 to develop solar power plants with a total generation capacity of up to 500 MW at sites within California and across the Southwestern United States. Additionally, NRG invested approximately $10 million for equity and associated development rights for three projects and a portfolio of PPAs to develop, build, own, and operate up to 11 eSolar modular solar generating units at these sites. The development assets will use eSolar's concentrating solar power (CSP) technology to sell renewable electricity under contracted PPAs with local utilities seeking competitively priced, zero-carbon solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10169532-54.html|title=eSolar, NRG Energy to build solar power plants|date=23 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penglai Electric===
In January 2010, eSolar announced a partnership with Penglai Electric, a privately owned Chinese electrical power equipment manufacturer, to build 2,000 MW of solar thermal power plants in China by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/01/11/esolar-hits-it-big-becomes-first-solar-thermal-player-to-land-china-deal|title=ESolar hits it big, becomes first solar thermal player to land China deal|date=11 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal represents China's largest CSP project to date (Spring 2010) and has a total potential capital investment of more than $5 billion. Under the master licensing agreement, Penglai Electric will use eSolar's solar thermal technology. The first plant of 92 MW will break ground in 2010. The plants will be co-located with biomass electricity generation facilities, together eliminating 15 million tons of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/09/business/la-fi-solar9-2010jan09|title=Pasadena's ESolar lands 2,000-megawatt deal in China|first=Todd|last=Woody|date=9 January 2010|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that this partnership is no longer progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guntherportfolio.com/2013/05/esolar-concentrating-solar-power-partner-update/|title=eSolar Concentrating Solar Power Partner Update - GUNTHER Portfolio|website=guntherportfolio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferrostaal===
In February 2010, [[Ferrostaal]], a global power and industrial plant developer, partnered with eSolar to deploy turnkey solar power plants in countries including Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa. Under the partnership, eSolar will provide solar field and receiver technology, while Ferrostaal will supply the power block, act as general contractor, and manage financing activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/california-solar-startup-and-german-industrial-giant-forge-partnership|title=California Solar Startup and German Industrial Giant Forge Partnership|first=Todd|last=Woody|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Electric===
In August 2011 General Electric(GE) made a strategic investment of up to $40 million in eSolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/ge-invests-up-to-40-million-in-esolar-takes-partnership-to-next-level.html|title=GE Invests Up to $40 Million in eSolar, Takes Partnership to Next Level|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aalborg CSP A/S===
In December 2014, eSolar was awarded a commercial contract by [[Aalborg CSP]] to provide a solar collector system (SCS) solution for the [[Seawater greenhouse#Sundrop Farms, Australia|Sundrop Farms]] Port Augusta expansion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/12/prweb12385483.htm|title=eSolar Announces Commercial Contract for Product Deployment in Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This expansion will increase the greenhouses by 20 hectares in support of a 10-year tomato supply contract with [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Coles-Partners-with-Sundrop-Farms.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224214026/http://www.sundropfarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Coles-Partners-with-Sundrop-Farms.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==
When eSolar's Sierra SunTower was unveiled in August 2009, California governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] praised the company for, "...proving that California’s energy and environmental leadership are advancing carbon-free, cost-effective energy that can be used around the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarserver.com/news/news-e-881.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, eSolar was honored by the [[World Economic Forum]] as a 2010 Technology Pioneer. The award recognizes eSolar’s technological innovation and global commitment to delivering a clean, low-cost energy alternative to fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/dec2009/gb2009123_706120.htm/ |title=Terms of Service Violation |publisher=Businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interview with [[Bill T.

In December 2009, editors of ''Power Engineering'' magazine selected Sierra SunTower as the winner of the "Best Renewable Project", recognizing the facility as an exceptional power generation project toward meeting growing global demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powergenworldwide.com/index/display/articledisplay/372671/articles/power-engineering/volume-114/issue-1/features/2009-projects-of-the-year.html/|title=2009 Projects of the Year|website=www.powergenworldwide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Sierra SunTower won Renewable Energy World’s "Renewable Project of the Year" award. The award recognized eSolar's achievements in the clean energy industry by naming Sierra SunTower an exceptional breakthrough in the commercialization of solar thermal technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/02/excellence-in-renewable-energy-award-winners-announced|title=Excellence in Renewable Energy Award Winners Announced|website=www.renewableenergyworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fan''' is a powered [[machine]] used to create flow within a [[fluid]], typically a [[gas]] such as [[air]].
A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades which act on the air. The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller, a rotor, or a runner. Usually, it is contained within some form of housing or case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/201417/fan|title=Fan|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may direct the airflow or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades. Most fans are powered by [[electricity|electric]] motors, but other sources of power may be used, including [[hydraulic motor]]s, [[handcrank]]s, [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]], and [[Solar power|solar power]].

Mechanically, a fan can be any revolving [[wikt:vane#English|vane]] or vanes used for producing [[air current|currents of air]]. Fans produce air flows with high [[volume]] and low [[pressure]] (although higher than [[ambient pressure]]), as opposed to [[gas compressor|compressors]] which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume. A fan [[blade]] will often rotate when exposed to an air fluid stream, and devices that take advantage of this, such as [[anemometer]]s and [[wind turbine]]s, often have designs similar to that of a fan.
{{details|centrifugal compressor}}
Typical applications include [[HVAC#Ventilation|climate control]] and personal [[thermal comfort]] (e.g., an electric table or floor fan), vehicle engine cooling systems (e.g., in front of a [[radiator]]), machinery cooling systems (e.g., inside computers and [[audio power amplifier]]s), ventilation, fume extraction, [[winnowing]] (e.g., separating chaff of [[cereal]] grains), removing [[dust]] (e.g. [[sucking]] as in a [[vacuum cleaner]]), drying (usually in combination with a heat source) and to provide draft for a [[fire]].

While fans are often used to cool people, they do not actually cool air (if anything, electric fans warm it slightly due to the warming of their motors), but work by [[evaporative cooling]] of [[sweat]] and increased heat [[convection]] into the surrounding air due to the airflow from the fans. Thus, fans may become ineffective at cooling the body if the surrounding air is near body temperature and contains high humidity. {{citation needed span|text=During periods of very high heat and humidity, governments actually advise against the use of fans.|date=July 2018}}

== History ==
The [[punkah]] fan was used in [[India]] about 500 BCE. It was a handheld fan made from bamboo strips or other plant fibre, that could be rotated or fanned to move air. During [[British India|British rule]], the word came to be used by Anglo-Indians to mean a large swinging flat fan, fixed to the ceiling, and pulled by a servant, called the [[punkawallah]].
[[File:Patent, Mechanical Fan, 1830.png|thumb|left|225px|[[Patent drawing]] for a ''Fan Moved by Mechanism'', 27 November 1830]]

For purposes of [[air conditioning]], the Han Dynasty craftsman and engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 CE) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied [[Hydraulics|hydraulic power]] to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan became even more common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 99, 134, 151, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the experiments of scientists including [[Otto von Guericke]], [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]], established the basic principles of vacuum and airflow. The English architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]] applied an early ventilation system in the [[Houses of Parliament]] that used bellows to circulate air. Wren's design would be the catalyst for much later improvement and innovation. The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by [[Georg Agricola]] (1494–1555).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 154"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], a British engineer, demonstrated a successful use of a fan system to draw out stagnant air from coal mines in 1727 and soon afterwards he installed a similar apparatus in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanmakers.com/text.aspx?id=26 |title=A Short History of Mechanical Fans |publisher=The Worshipful Company of Fan Makers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080959/http://www.fanmakers.com/text.aspx?id=26 |archivedate=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Good ventilation was particularly important in coal mines to reduce casualties from asphyxiation. The civil engineer [[John Smeaton]], and later [[John Buddle]] installed reciprocating air pumps in the mines in the North of [[England]]. However, this arrangement was not ideal as the machinery was liable to breaking down.

=== Steam ===
With the advent of practical [[steam power]], fans could finally be used for ventilation. In 1837 William Fourness of England installed a steam-driven fan at [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AHp8K45uCmwC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Fourness+Steam+Fan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZwLjft83QAhUHAsAKHc9SDc4Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fourness%20Steam%20Fan&amp;f=false Collieries of Wales: Engineering and Architecture], By Stephen R. Hughes, Page 97&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 a 6&amp;nbsp;m radius steam driven fan, designed by [[William Brunton]], was made operational in the Gelly Gaer [[Colliery]] of [[South Wales]]. The model was exhibited at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Also in 1851 [[David Boswell Reid]], a Scottish doctor, installed four steam powered fans in the ceiling of [[St George's Hospital]] in [[Liverpool]], so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/8_Engineers%20Contractors%20and%20Industrial%20Construction/Bruegmann_Central.pdf|title=Central Heating and Ventilation:Origins and Effects on Architectural Design|author=Robert Bruegmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/heating-ventilation/heatingventilation.pdf/ HISTORIC BUILDING ENGINEERING SYSTEMS &amp; EQUIPMENT HEATING &amp; VENTILATION], By Brian Roberts, CIBSE Heritage Group&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the technology were made by [[James Nasmyth]], Frenchman Theophile Guibal and J. R. Waddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x-pL19ro-qsC|title=Fans and Ventilation: A practical guide|author=Cory, William|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080531588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical ===
Between 1882 and 1886 [[Schuyler Wheeler]] invented a fan powered by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B. A. C. (Before Air Conditioning)|publisher=New Orleans Bar Association|url=http://www.neworleansbar.org/documents/BeforeA.C.8-5_000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercially marketed by the American firm Crocker &amp; Curtis electric motor company. In 1882, [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]] developed the world's first electric [[ceiling fan]].  During this intense period of innovation, fans powered by alcohol, oil, or kerosene were common around the turn of the 20th century.
In 1909, [[KDK]] of Japan pioneered the invention of mass-produced electric fans for home use. In the 1920s, industrial advances allowed steel fans to be mass-produced in different shapes, bringing fan prices down and allowing more homeowners to afford them. In the 1930s, the first art deco fan (the "swan fan") was designed. By the 1940s, [[Crompton Greaves]] of India became the world's largest manufacturer of electric ceiling fans mainly for sale in India, Asia and the Middle East. By the 1950s, table and stand fans were manufactured in colors that were bright and eye catching.

Window and central [[air conditioning]] in the 1960s caused many companies to discontinue production of fans.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Fans"&gt;[http://www.fancollectors.org/fanhistory.htm Fancollectors.org – A Brief History of Fans] Information Provided by Steve Cunningham – retrieved July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the mid 1970s, with an increasing awareness of the cost of electricity and the amount of energy used to heat and cool homes, turn-of-the-century styled ceiling fans became immensely popular again as both decorative and energy efficient units.

In 1998, Walter K. Boyd invented the [[High-volume low-speed fan|HVLS ceiling fan]]. A lifelong inventor, Boyd was charged with developing a system to cool dairy cattle. Dairy cattle, when overheated, decrease milk production. Using the laws of physics and airflow, Boyd developed a slow moving fan that incorporated 10 aluminum blades and was 8-feet diameter. Unlike traditional ceiling fans that move quickly, this large fan moved slowly. Due to its diameter size, the fan moved a large column of air down and out 360 degrees and continuously mixed fresh air with the stale air inside the barn. They are used in many industrial and agricultural settings, because of their energy efficiency. It also cooled the inside of the barn without causing the dairy cattle undue stress or kicking up dust.

After much testing, Boyd discovered HVLS fan technology to be energy efficient as it costs less to run one HVLS fan than it did to run 50 small high-speed fans. Due to the skyrocketing costs of energy, HVLS commercial ceiling fans are used today to supplement HVAC systems in industrial and commercial settings, including warehouses, manufacturing facilities and malls, as HVLS fans help lower heating and cooling costs.&lt;ref name="Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101227180929/http://www.designnews.com/blog/Automation_and_Control/40243-Industrial_Fan_Designer_Finds_Niche_in_Energy_Efficiency.php Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency – Automation and Control], By David Greenfield, December 20, 2010, Blog on Design News,  Information provided by Dianna Huff – retrieved May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Two box fans.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Two c. 1980 box fans]]
[[File:Ceiling fan with lamp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ceiling fan with a lamp.]]
Mechanical revolving blade fans are made in a wide range of designs. They are used on the floor, table, desk, or hung from the ceiling (ceiling fan). They can also be built into a [[Window fan|window]], wall, roof, chimney, etc. Most electronic systems such as [[computer]]s include fans to cool the circuits inside, and in appliances such as hair dryers and portable space heaters and mounted/installed wall heaters. They are also used for moving air in air-conditioning systems, and in automotive engines, where they are driven by belts or by direct motor. Fans used for comfort create a [[wind chill]] by increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient]], but do not lower temperatures directly. Fans used to cool electrical equipment or in engines or other machines do cool the equipment directly by forcing hot air into the cooler environment outside of the machine.

There are three main types of fans used for moving air, ''axial'', ''centrifugal'' (also called ''radial'') and ''cross flow'' (also called ''tangential''). [[ASME|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] Performance Testing Code 11 (PTC)&lt;ref name="PTC 11 – Fans"&gt;[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-11-2008-fans ASME PTC 11 – Fans].&lt;/ref&gt; provides standard procedures for conducting and reporting tests on fans, including those of the centrifugal, axial, and mixed flows.

=== Axial-flow ===
[[File:Luefter y.s.tech pd1270153b-2f.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An axial box fan for cooling electrical equipment.]]
Axial-flow fans have blades that force air to move [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the shaft about which the blades rotate. This type of fan is used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from small cooling fans for electronics to the giant fans used in [[wind tunnel]]s. Axial flow fans are applied in air conditioning and industrial process applications. Standard axial flow fans have diameters from 300–400&amp;nbsp;mm or 1800 to 2000&amp;nbsp;mm and work under pressures up to 800 Pa. Special types of fans are used as low pressure compressor stages in aircraft engines.
Examples of axial fans are:
* Table fan: Basic elements of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, armature and lead [[wire]]s, motor, blade [[safety barrier|guard]], motor housing, [[oscillator]] gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that motions the fan from side to side. The armature axle shaft comes out on both ends of the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.
[[File:Ceiling fan with light.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[Ceiling fan]] is an example of an axial fan.]]
*Domestic Extractor Fan: Wall or ceiling mounted, the domestic extractor fan is employed to remove moisture and stale air from domestic dwellings. Bathroom extractor fans typically utilize a four inch (100mm) impeller, whilst kitchen extractor fans typically use a six inch (150mm) impeller as the room itself is often bigger. Axial fans with 125mm impellers are also used in larger bathrooms though are much less common. Domestic axial extractor fans are not suitable for duct runs over 3m or 4m, depending on the number of bends in the run, as the increased air pressure in longer pipework inhibits the performance of the fan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/choosing-a-bathroom-extractor-fan-123-c.asp|title=Choosing a Bathroom Extractor Fan|last=|first=|date=10 July 2018|website=Extarctor Fan World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Electro-mechanical fans: Among collectors, are rated according to their condition, size, age, and number of blades. Four-blade designs are the most common. Five-blade or six-blade designs are rare. The materials from which the components are made, such as brass, are important factors in fan desirability.
*[[Ceiling fan]]: A fan suspended from the ceiling of a room is a ceiling fan. Most ceiling fans rotate at relatively low speeds and do not have blade guards. Ceiling fans can be found in both residential and industrial/commercial settings.
* In [[automobile]]s, a mechanical fan provides [[engine cooling]] and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a [[coolant]]-filled [[radiator]]. The fan may be driven with a [[pulley#Belt and pulley systems|belt and pulley]] off the [[internal-combustion engine|engine]]'s [[crankshaft]] or an electric motor switched on or off by a [[thermostat]]ic [[switch]].
* [[Computer fan|Computer cooling fan]] for cooling electrical components
* Fans inside [[audio power amplifier]]s help to draw heat away from the electrical components.
* [[Variable pitch fan|variable-pitch fan]]: A variable-pitch fan is used where precise control of static pressure within supply ducts is required. The blades are arranged to rotate upon a control-pitch hub. The fan wheel will spin at a constant  speed. The blades follow the control pitch hub. As the hub moves toward the rotor, the blades increase their angle of attack and an increase in flow results.

=== Centrifugal ===
{{Main|centrifugal fan}}
[[File:CentrifugalFan.png|thumb|right|upright|Typical centrifugal fan.]]
[[File:Centrifugal fan.png|thumb|left|200px|A diagram of a centrifugal fan, with top view to show airflow.]]
Often called a "squirrel cage" (because of its general similarity in appearance to [[Hamster wheel|exercise wheels]] for pet rodents) or "scroll fan", the centrifugal fan has a moving component (called an [[impeller]]) that consists of a central shaft about which a set of blades form a [[spiral]], or ribs, are positioned. Centrifugal fans blow air at right angles to the intake of the fan, and spin the air outwards to the outlet (by deflection and [[centrifugal force]]). The impeller rotates, causing air to enter the fan near the shaft and move [[perpendicular]]ly from the shaft to the opening in the scroll-shaped fan casing. A centrifugal fan produces more pressure for a given air volume, and is used where this is desirable such as in [[leaf blower]]s, [[blowdryer]]s, air mattress inflators, [[inflatable structure]]s, [[climate control]], and various industrial purposes. They are typically quieter than comparable axial fans.

=== Cross-flow fan ===
[[File:Cross-flow fan schematic patent.png|thumb|Cross-section of cross-flow fan, from the 1893 patent. The rotation is clock-wise. The stream guide ''F'' is usually not present in modern implementations.]]
[[File:Tangential-flow-coloured-labels.png|thumb|right|upright|Cross-flow fan]]
The ''cross-flow'' or ''tangential'' fan, sometimes known as a ''tubular'' fan, was patented in 1893 by Paul Mortier,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mortier. ''Fan or Blowing apparatus''. [https://www.google.com/patents/US507445 US Pat. No. 507,445]&lt;/ref&gt; and is used extensively in the [[HVAC]] industry. The fan is usually long in relation to the diameter, so the flow approximately remains two-dimensional away from the ends. The CFF uses an impeller with forward curved blades, placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and vortex wall. Unlike radial machines, the main flow moves transversely across the impeller, passing the blading twice.

The flow within a cross-flow fan may be broken up into three distinct regions: a vortex region near the fan discharge, called an eccentric vortex, the through-flow region, and a paddling region directly opposite. Both the vortex and paddling regions are dissipative, and as a result, only a portion of the impeller imparts usable work on the flow. The cross-flow fan, or transverse fan, is thus a two-stage partial admission machine. The popularity of the crossflow fan in the HVAC industry comes from its compactness, shape, quiet operation, and ability to provide high pressure coefficient. Effectively a rectangular fan in terms of inlet and outlet geometry, the diameter readily scales to fit the available space, and the length is adjustable to meet flow rate requirements for the particular application.

Common household tower fans are also cross-flow fans. Much of the early work focused on developing the cross-flow fan for both high and low-flow-rate conditions, and resulted in numerous patents. Key contributions were made by Coester, Ilberg and Sadeh, Porter and Markland, and Eck. One interesting phenomenon particular to the cross-flow fan is that, as the blades rotate, the local air incidence angle changes. The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors (pressure increase), while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as [[turbine]]s (pressure decrease).

Since the flow both enters and exits the impeller radially, the crossflow fan is well suited for aircraft applications. Due to the 2D nature of the flow, the fan readily integrates into a wing for use in both thrust production and boundary-layer control. A configuration that utilizes a crossflow fan is located at the wing [[leading edge]] is the [[fanwing]]. This design creates lift by deflecting the wake downward due to the rotational direction of the fan, causing large Magnus force, similar to a spinning leading-edge cylinder. Another configuration utilizing a crossflow fan for thrust and flow control is the propulsive wing. In this design, the crossflow fan is placed near the [[trailing edge]] of a thick wing, and draws the air off the wing's suction (top) surface. By doing this, the propulsive wing is nearly stall-free, even at extremely high angles of attack, producing very high lift. The external links section provides links to these concepts.

A cross flow fan, is a centrifugal fan in which the air flows through the fan, rather than through an inlet. The rotor of a cross flow fan is covered to create a pressure differential. When used in household fans, cross flow fans have smaller opening on one side and a larger opening on the other. Cross flow fans have openings of different sizes on the front and rear sides. The resultant pressure difference allows air to flow straight through the fan, even though the fan blades counter the flow of air on one side of the rotation. Cross flow fans give airflow along the entire width of the fan, however, they are noiser than ordinary centrifugal fans presumedly because the fan blades fight the flow of air on one side of the rotation unlike normal squirrel cage fans. Cross flow fans are often used in [[air conditioner]]s, automobile ventilation systems, and for cooling in medium-sized equipment such as [[photocopier]]s.

The action of a fan or blower causes pressures slightly above atmospheric, which are called [[Plenum chamber|plenum]]s.

== Bladeless Indirect viscous-shear fan ==
{{Cleanup-jargon|section|date=December 2010}}
This is an indirect blower system which collects pressurized airflow from a standard blower device that can be of any type mentioned in this article, and directs the collected airflow through a hollow tube or toroid, blowing a thin high-velocity laminar airflow from holes or a continuous slot across the surface of the tube or toroid. These fans have a 3-dimensional mixed-flow impeller in a lower compartment. Air is drawn in and compressed, before being expelled  through an annulus, and accelerated over an airfoil lamp. Inducing and entraining ambient air through viscous shearing, the loop-shaped upper section multiplies the total airflow many times. The high velocity laminar airflow tends to drag ambient air along with it, due to [[viscous shear]]. Only around 7% of the total airflow actually passes through the fan itself.

== Uncommon types of fans ==

=== Bellows ===
{{Main|Bellows}}
[[File:Bellows (PSF).svg|thumb|Diagram of a single-acting hand bellows]]
[[Bellows]] are also used to move air, although not generally considered fans. A hand-operated bellows is essentially a bag with a nozzle and handles, which can be filled with air by one movement, and the air expelled by another. Typically it would comprise two rigid flat surfaces hinged at one end, where a nozzle is fitted, and with handles at the other.

The sides of the surfaces are joined by a flexible and air-proof material such as leather; the surfaces and joining material comprise a bag sealed everywhere but at the nozzle. (The joining material typically has a characteristic pleated construction that is so common that similar expanding fabric arrangements not used for moving air, such as on a [[folding camera]], are called [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]].) Separating the handles expands the bag, which fills with air; squeezing them together expels the air. A simple [[valve]] (e.g., a flap) may be fitted so that air enters without having to come from the nozzle, which may be close to a fire.

Bellows produce a directed pressurized stream of air; the airflow volume is typically low with moderate pressure. They are an older technology, used mainly to produce a strong and directed airflow unlike non-electric bladed mechanical fans, before the introduction of electricity.
* A single-acting bellows will only produce airflow during the exhaust stroke.
* A double-acting bellows is a pair of bellows capable of blowing out air from one while inhaling air into the other, but airflow still temporarily ceases when the stroke direction is reversed.
* Combining multiple bellows at third-cycle or quarter-cycle arrangements on a crank arm allows for nearly continuous airflow from several bellows at once; each is in a different phase of inhaling and exhausting during the cycle.

=== Coandă effect ===
[[File:XinHui 新會碧桂園 Country Garden 大潤發 RT-Mart Fresh Food 01.JPG|thumb|An open-face supermarket freezer with an air curtain. Cooling air circulates across the food through the dark slot seen at the rear of the freezer, and through another grille not visible along the front.]]
The [[Dyson Air Multiplier]] fans, and the Imperial C2000 series range hood fans, have no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts except their oscillating and tilting head. The airflow is generated using the [[Coandă effect]]; a small quantity of air from a high-pressure-bladed impeller fan, contained in the base rather than exposed, drives a large airmass via a low-pressure area created by the [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6377644/Dyson-fan-was-it-invented-30-years-ago.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=Dyson fan: was it invented 30 years ago? | date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5379890/dyson-air-multiplier-review-making-a-300-fan-takes-cojones Dyson Air Multiplier Review: Making a $300 Fan Takes Cojones]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/10/12/video-review-the-dyson-air-multiplier/ Video Review: The Dyson Air Multiplier], Posted Oct 12, 2009, by John Biggs, TechCrunch&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Patent &amp; Trademark Office initially ruled that Dyson's patent was not an improvement on the [[Toshiba]] patent on a nearly identical bladeless desktop fan granted in 1981.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;
[[Air door|Air curtains and air doors]] also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or door. Air curtains are commonly used on open-face dairy, freezer, and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening. The airflow is typically generated by a mechanical fan of any type described in this article hidden in the base of the display cabinet.

=== Convective ===
Differences in air temperature will affect the density of air and can be used to induce air circulation through the mere act of heating or cooling an air mass. This effect is so subtle and works at such low air pressures that it does not appear to fit the definition of a fan technology. However, prior to the development of electricity, convective airflow was the primary method of inducing airflow in living spaces.
Old fashioned oil and coal furnaces were not electric and operated simply on the principle of convection to move the warm air. Very large volume air ducts were sloped upwards away from the top of the furnace towards floor and wall registers above the furnace. Cool air was returned through similar large ducts leading to the bottom of the furnace.
Older houses from before electrification often had open duct grilles leading from the ceiling of a lower level to the floor of an upper level, to allow convective airflow to slowly rise up the building from one floor to the next.
[[Outhouse]]s commonly rely on a simple enclosed air channel in a corner of the structure to exhaust offensive odors. Exposed to sunlight, the channel is warmed and a slow convective air current is vented out the top of the building, while fresh air enters the pit through the seat hole.

=== Electrostatic ===
An [[electrostatic fluid accelerator]] propels airflow by inducing motion in airborne charged particles.  A high voltage electric field (commonly 25,000 to 50,000 volts) formed between exposed charged [[anode]] and [[cathode]] surfaces is capable of inducing airflow through a principle referred to as [[ionic wind]]. The airflow pressure is typically very low but the air volume can be large. However, a sufficiently high voltage potential can also cause the formation of [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]], which are reactive and irritating to [[mucous membrane]]s.

== Noise ==
Fans generate noise from the rapid flow of air around blades and obstacles, and sometimes from the motor. Fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 [[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safetey Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fan motor drive methods ==
[[File:UMA 2.JPG|thumb|Building heating and cooling systems commonly use a squirrel cage fan driven by belt from a separate electric motor.]]
[[File:1989 Toyota 1HD-T Type engine front.jpg|thumb|[[Internal combustion engine]]s sometimes drive an engine cooling fan directly, or may use a separate electric motor.]]
[[File:Silniki by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Large electric motors may have a cooling fan either on the back or inside the case. (Shown with black rear cover removed.)]]
[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|Dual shaft fan motor in a window air conditioner.]]
Standalone fans are usually powered by an [[electric motor]]s, often attached directly to the motor's output, with no gears or belts. The motor is either hidden in the fan's center hub or extends behind it. For big industrial fans, three-phase asynchronous motors are commonly used, placed near the fan and driving it through a [[Pulley#Belt and pulley systems|belt and pulleys]]. Smaller fans are often powered by [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded pole AC motors]], or [[Brushed DC Electric Motor|brushed]] or [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motors]]. AC-powered fans usually use mains voltage, while DC-powered fans use low voltage, typically 24V, 12V, or 5 V. Cooling fans for computer equipment always use brushless DC motors, which generate much less [[electromagnetic interference]] than other types.

In machines with a rotating part, the fan is often connected to it rather than being powered separately. This is commonly seen in motor vehicles with [[internal combustion engine]]s, large cooling systems, locomotives, and winnowing machines, where the fan is connected to the [[drive shaft]] or through a belt and pulleys. Another common configuration is a dual-shaft motor, where one end of the shaft drives a mechanism, while the other has a fan mounted on it to cool the motor itself. Window [[air conditioner]]s commonly use a dual-shaft fan to operate separate blowers for the interior and exterior parts of the device.

Where electrical power or rotating parts are not readily available, fans may be driven by other methods. High-pressure gases such as steam can be used to drive a small [[turbine]], and high-pressure liquids can be used to drive a [[pelton wheel]], either which can provide the rotational drive for a fan. 

Large, slow-moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a [[water wheel]] and a series of step-down gears or pulleys to increase the rotational speed to that which is required for efficient fan operation.

== Solar powered fan ==
Electric fans used for ventilation may be powered by [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s instead of mains current. This is an attractive option because once the capital costs of the solar panel have been covered, the resulting electricity is free. In addition, electricity is always available when the sun is shining and the fan needs to run.

A typical example uses a detached 10-[[watt]], 12x12 [[inch]] (30x30 [[metre|cm]]) solar panel and is supplied with appropriate brackets, [[Power cable|cables]], and [[Electrical connector|connector]]s. It can be used to ventilate up to 1,250 [[square feet]] (100 m2) of [[area]] and can move air at up to 800 [[cubic feet]] per minute (400 L/s). Because of the wide availability of 12 V [[brushless DC electric motor]]s and the convenience of wiring such a low voltage, such fans usually operate on 12 [[volt]]s.

The detached solar panel is typically installed in the spot which gets most of the sun light and then connected to the fan mounted as far as 20 to 25 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (6 to 7 m) away. Other permanently-mounted and small portable fans include an integrated (non-detachable) solar panel.

The '''HVDC Three Gorges – Changzhou''' is an {{convert|940|km|adj=on}} long bipolar [[HVDC]] transmission line in [[China]] for the transmission of electric power from the [[Three Gorges Dam|Three Gorges]] power plant to the area of [[Changzhou]].

The transmission line went into service in 2004. It runs from the static [[inverter station]], [[Longquan]], {{convert|31|mi}}  away from the Three Gorges [[power plant]] to the static inverter plant, Zhengping, near Changzhou. The HVDC Three Gorges-Changzhou is a [[Bipolar electricity transmission|bipolar]] 500&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|kV]] powerline with a maximum [[transmission power rating]] of 3,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]]s.

A part of the line is the [[Yangtze River Crossing#Wuhu|Yangtze River Crossing Wuhu]] over Yangtze River using {{convert|229|m|adj=on}} tall [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s.

The electrode at Chujiahu is also used by HVDC Hubei - Shanghai for grounding.

{{Electromagnetism|Topic=Hall effect}}
The '''Hall effect''' is the production of a [[voltage]] difference (the '''Hall voltage''') across an [[electrical conductor]], transverse to an [[electric current]] in the conductor and to an applied [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by [[Edwin Hall]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents|author = [[Edwin Hall]]|journal = American Journal of Mathematics|volume = 2|year = 1879|pages = 287–92|url = http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|accessdate = 2008-02-28|doi = 10.2307/2369245|issue = 3|jstor = 2369245 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010116/http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|archivedate=2011-07-27 |ref = hallpdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For clarity, the original effect is sometimes called the '''ordinary Hall effect''' to distinguish it from other "Hall effects" which have different physical mechanisms.

The Hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced [[electric field]] to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field. It is a characteristic of  the material from which the conductor is made, since its value depends on the type, number, and properties of the [[charge carriers]] that constitute the current.

==Discovery==
The Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by [[Edwin Hall]] while he was working on his doctoral degree at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name=bridgeman-momoir&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridgeman|first=P. W.|title=Biographical Memoir of Edwin Herbert Hall|year=1939|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qWPFjF1DGJcJ:books.nap.edu/html/biomems/ehall.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiwi2QsmBBlJQ-CGCqOI-5jo7JVHR8KlVBUlYQg7o3jZTM3Hf2pSa3VeYGFgqCsepNg2dtCFeumBvFAX35h7vFrDq29vFqmPQsXXinsEp4aY1iC4-Tyws_IxDAUX0Gacg8xWCGQ&amp;sig=AHIEtbSYLSS-LvLf1yfIKBflgxKm-7Qwdw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteen years before the [[electron]] was discovered, his measurements of the tiny effect produced in the apparatus he used were an experimental [[wikt:tour de force|tour de force]], published under the name "On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hall Effect History|url = http://phareselectronics.com/products/hall-effect-sensors/hall-effect-history/|accessdate = 2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hall-Effect Sensors|last = Ramsden|first = Edward|publisher = Elsevier Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-7506-7934-3|location = |pages = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The Hall effect is due to the nature of the current in a conductor. Current consists of the movement of many small [[charge carrier]]s, typically [[electron]]s, [[Electron hole|holes]], [[ion]]s (see [[Electromigration]]) or all three. When a magnetic field is present, these charges experience a force, called the [[Lorentz force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeel.nist.gov/812/effe.htm|accessdate=2008-02-28|title=The Hall Effect|publisher=[[NIST]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight, 'line of sight' paths between collisions with impurities, [[phonons]], etc. However, when a  magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied, their paths between collisions are curved, thus moving charges accumulate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density across the Hall element, arising from a force that is perpendicular to both the 'line of sight' path and the applied magnetic field. The separation of charge establishes an [[electric field]] that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady [[electric potential]] is established for as long as the charge is flowing.

In [[classical electromagnetism]] electrons move in the opposite direction of the current {{math|''I''}} (by [[Electric current#Conventions|convention]] "current" describes a theoretical "hole flow"). In some semiconductors it ''appears'' "holes" are actually flowing because the direction of the voltage is opposite to the derivation below.

[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Electrons.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for electrons. Initially, the electrons follow the curved arrow, due to the magnetic force. At some distance from the current-introducing contacts, electrons pile up on the left side and deplete from the right side, which creates an electric field {{math|''ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in the direction of the assigned {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}}. {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} is negative for some semiconductors where "holes" appear to flow. In steady-state, {{math|''ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} will be strong enough to exactly cancel out the magnetic force, thus the electrons follow the straight arrow (dashed).]]
[[File:Hall Sensor.webm|thumb|Animation showing the simplified principle]]
For a simple metal where there is only one type of [[charge carrier]] (electrons), the Hall voltage {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be derived by using the [[Lorentz force]] and seeing that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the {{math|''y''}}-axis direction. Thus, the magnetic force on each electron in the {{math|''y''}}-axis direction is cancelled by a {{math|''y''}}-axis electrical force due to the buildup of charges. The {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} term is the [[drift velocity]] of the current which is assumed at this point to be holes by convention. The {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} term is negative in the {{math|''y''}}-axis direction by the right hand rule.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\bigl(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\bigl)&lt;/math&gt;

In steady state, {{math|'''F''' {{=}} '''0'''}}, so {{math|0 {{=}} ''E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is assigned in the direction of the {{math|''y''}}-axis, (and not with the arrow of the induced electric field {{math|''ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as in the image (pointing in the {{math|−''y''}} direction), which tells you where the field caused by the electrons is pointing).

In wires, electrons instead of holes are flowing, so {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' → −''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''q'' → −''q''}}.  Also {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|''V''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;|''w''}}}}. Substituting these changes gives

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{H}= v_x B_z w&lt;/math&gt;

The conventional "hole" current is in the negative direction of the electron current and the negative of the electrical charge which gives {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''ntw''(−''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'')(−''e'')}} where {{math|''n''}} is [[charge carrier density]], {{math|''tw''}} is the cross-sectional area, and {{math|−''e''}} is the charge of each electron.  Solving for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and plugging into the above gives the Hall voltage:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{H} = \frac{I_x B_z}{n t e}&lt;/math&gt;

If the charge build up had been positive (as it appears in some semiconductors), then the {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} assigned in the image would have been negative (positive charge would have built up on the left side).

The Hall coefficient is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{H} =\frac{E_y}{j_x B_z}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j''}} is the [[current density]] of the carrier electrons, and {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the induced electric field. In SI units, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{H} =\frac{E_y}{j_x B}= \frac{V_\mathrm{H} t}{IB}=-\frac{1}{ne}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The units of {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} are usually expressed as m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/C, or Ω·cm/[[Gauss (unit)|G]], or other variants.) As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field.

One very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the opposite. The Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. The Hall effect also showed that in some substances (especially [[p-type semiconductor]]s), it is more appropriate to think of the current as positive "[[Electron hole|holes]]" moving rather than negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall effect is that holes moving to the left are really electrons moving to the right, so one expects the same sign of the Hall coefficient for both electrons and holes. This confusion, however, can only be resolved by modern quantum mechanical theory of transport in solids.&lt;ref&gt;N.W. Ashcroft and N.D. Mermin "Solid State Physics" {{ISBN|978-0-03-083993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample inhomogeneity might result in spurious sign of the Hall effect, even in ideal [[Van der Pauw method|van der Pauw]] configuration of electrodes. For example, positive Hall effect was observed in evidently n-type semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1557/JMR.2008.0300|bibcode = 2008JMatR..23.2293O|title = Positive Hall coefficients obtained from contact misplacement on evident ''n''-type ZnO films and crystals| journal=Journal of Materials Research| volume=23| issue=9| pages=2293|last1 = Ohgaki|first1 = Takeshi| last2=Ohashi| first2=Naoki| last3=Sugimura| first3=Shigeaki| last4=Ryoken| first4=Haruki| last5=Sakaguchi| first5=Isao| last6=Adachi| first6=Yutaka| last7=Haneda| first7=Hajime| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of artifact, in uniform materials, occurs when the sample's aspect ratio is not long enough: the full Hall voltage only develops far away from the current-introducing contacts, since at the contacts the transverse voltage is shorted out to zero.

===Hall effect in semiconductors===
When a current-carrying [[semiconductor]] is kept in a magnetic field, the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges.

The simple formula for the Hall coefficient given above is usually a good explanation when conduction is dominated by a single [[charge carrier]]. However, in semiconductors the theory is more complex, because in these materials conduction can involve significant, simultaneous contributions from both [[electrons]] and [[Electron hole|holes]], which may be present in different concentrations and have different [[Electron mobility|mobilities]]. For moderate magnetic fields the Hall coefficient is&lt;ref name='Kasap2001'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mems.caltech.edu/courses/EE40%20Web%20Files/Supplements/02_Hall_Effect_Derivation.pdf |title=Hall Effect in Semiconductors |accessdate= |last=Kasap |first=Safa |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5c0UeBBsZ |archivedate=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- O.V.

For large applied fields the simpler expression analogous to that for a single carrier type holds.

===Relationship with star formation===
Although it is well known that magnetic fields play an important role in star formation, research models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Star Formation and the Hall Effect|author = Mark Wardle|journal = Astrophysics and Space Science|volume = 292|year = 2004|pages = 317–323|doi = 10.1023/B:ASTR.0000045033.80068.1f|issue = 1|arxiv = astro-ph/0307086 |bibcode = 2004Ap&amp;SS.292..317W |citeseerx = 10.1.1.746.8082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1109.1370|bibcode = 2012MNRAS.422..261B|title = The Hall effect in star formation|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume = 422|issue = 1|pages = 261|last1 = Braiding|first1 = C.

===Quantum Hall effect===
{{Main|Quantum Hall effect}}
For a two-dimensional electron system which can be produced in a [[MOSFET]], in the presence of large [[magnetic field]] strength and low [[temperature]], one can observe the quantum Hall effect, in which the Hall [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] {{math|''σ''}} undergoes [[quantum Hall transitions]] to take on the quantized values.

===Spin Hall effect===
{{Main|Spin Hall effect}}
The spin Hall effect consists in the spin accumulation on the lateral boundaries of a current-carrying sample. No magnetic field is needed. It was predicted by [[M. I. Dyakonov]] and [[V. I. Perel]] in 1971 and observed experimentally more than 30 years later, both in semiconductors and in metals, at cryogenic as well as at room temperatures.

===Quantum spin Hall effect===
{{Main|Quantum spin Hall effect}}
For [[mercury telluride]] two dimensional quantum wells with strong spin-orbit coupling, in zero magnetic field, at low temperature, the quantum spin Hall effect has been recently observed.

===Anomalous Hall effect===
In [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials (and [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] materials in a [[magnetic field]]), the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, known as the '''anomalous Hall effect''' (or the '''extraordinary Hall effect'''), which depends directly on the [[magnetization]] of the material, and is often much larger than the ordinary Hall effect. (Note that this effect is ''not'' due to the contribution of the [[magnetization]] to the total [[magnetic field]].) For example, in nickel, the anomalous Hall coefficient is about 100 times larger than the ordinary Hall coefficient near the Curie temperature, but the two are similar at very low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=95 |pages=1154–1160 |year=1954 |author=Robert Karplus and J. M. Luttinger |title=Hall Effect in Ferromagnetics |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.1154| issue=5|bibcode = 1954PhRv...95.1154K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a well-recognized phenomenon, there is still debate about its origins in the various materials. The anomalous Hall effect can be either an ''extrinsic'' (disorder-related) effect due to [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent [[scattering]] of the [[charge carrier]]s, or an ''intrinsic'' effect which can be described in terms of the [[geometric phase|Berry phase]] effect in the crystal momentum space ({{math|''k''}}-space).&lt;ref name="sinitsyn-08jpa"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Semiclassical Theories of the Anomalous Hall Effect|author=N.

Sinitsyn 2008 J. Phys.: Condens. Mater. '''20''' 023201 --&gt;

=== Hall effect in ionized gases ===
The Hall effect in an ionized gas ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) is significantly different from the Hall effect in solids (where the '''Hall parameter''' is always much less than unity). In a plasma, the Hall parameter can take any value. The Hall parameter, {{math|''β''}}, in a plasma is the ratio between the electron [[Gyroradius|gyrofrequency]], {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the electron-heavy particle collision frequency, {{math|''ν''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac {\Omega_\mathrm{e}}{\nu}=\frac {eB}{m_\mathrm{e}\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]] (approximately {{val|1.6e-19|ul=C}})
* {{math|''B''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]])
* {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electron|electron mass]] (approximately {{val|9.1e-31|u=kg}}).

The Hall parameter value increases with the magnetic field strength.

Physically, the trajectories of electrons are curved by the [[Lorentz force]]. Nevertheless, when the Hall parameter is low, their motion between two encounters with heavy particles ([[Neutral particle|neutral]] or [[ion]]) is almost linear. But if the Hall parameter is high, the electron movements are highly curved. The [[current density]] vector, {{math|'''J'''}}, is no longer collinear with the [[electric field]] vector, {{math|'''E'''}}. The two vectors {{math|'''J'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} make the '''Hall angle''', {{math|''θ''}}, which also gives the Hall parameter:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \tan(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
[[Hall probe]]s are often used as [[magnetometer]]s, i.e. to measure magnetic fields, or inspect materials (such as tubing or pipelines) using the principles of [[magnetic flux leakage]].

Hall effect devices produce a very low signal level and thus require amplification. While suitable for laboratory instruments, the [[vacuum tube]] [[amplifier]]s available in the first half of the 20th century were too expensive, power consuming, and unreliable for everyday applications. It was only with the development of the low cost [[integrated circuit]] that the Hall effect sensor became suitable for mass application. Many devices now sold as [[Hall effect sensor]]s in fact contain both the sensor as described above plus a high gain [[integrated circuit]] (IC) amplifier in a single package. Recent advances have further added into one package an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[I²C]] (Inter-integrated circuit communication protocol) IC for direct connection to a [[microcontroller]]'s I/O port.

===Advantages over other methods===
Hall effect devices (when appropriately packaged) are immune to dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.
[[Image:HallEffCurrentSense.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hall effect current sensor with internal integrated circuit amplifier. 8 mm opening. Zero current output voltage is midway between the supply voltages that maintain a 4 to 8 volt differential. Non-zero current response is proportional to the voltage supplied and is linear to 60 amperes for this particular (25&amp;nbsp;A) device.]]
When electrons flow through a conductor, a magnetic field is produced. Thus, it is possible to create a non-contacting current sensor. The device has three terminals.
A sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several advantages; no additional resistance (a [[Shunt (electrical)|''shunt'']], required for the most common current sensing method) need to be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor, which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.

===Disadvantages compared with other methods===
Magnetic flux from the surroundings (such as other wires) may diminish or enhance the field the Hall probe intends to detect, rendering the results inaccurate. Also, as Hall voltage is often on the order of millivolts, the output from this type of sensor cannot be used to directly drive actuators but instead must be amplified by a [[transistor]]-based circuit.

Ways to measure mechanical positions within an electromagnetic system, such as a brushless direct current motor, include (1) the Hall effect, (2) optical position encoder (e.g., absolute and [[incremental encoder]]s) and (3) induced voltage by moving the amount of metal core inserted into a transformer. When Hall is compared to photo-sensitive methods, it is harder to get absolute position with Hall. Hall detection is also sensitive to stray magnetic fields.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Contemporary applications===
Hall effect sensors are readily available from a number of different manufacturers, and may be used in various sensors such as rotating speed sensors (bicycle wheels, gear-teeth, automotive speedometers, electronic ignition systems), fluid [[flow sensor]]s, [[current sensor]]s, and [[pressure sensor]]s. Common applications are often found where a robust and contactless switch or potentiometer is required. These include: electric [[airsoft]] guns, triggers of electropneumatic [[paintball marker|paintball guns]], go-cart speed controls, smart phones, and some global positioning systems.

====Ferrite toroid Hall effect current transducer====
[[Image:RAZC-GENARRv1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram of Hall effect current transducer integrated into ferrite ring.]]

Hall sensors can detect stray magnetic fields easily, including that of Earth, so they work well as electronic compasses: but this also means that such stray fields can hinder accurate measurements of small magnetic fields. To solve this problem, Hall sensors are often integrated with magnetic shielding of some kind. For example, a Hall sensor integrated into a ferrite ring (as shown) can reduce the detection of stray fields by a factor of 100 or better (as the external magnetic fields cancel across the ring, giving no residual [[magnetic flux]]). This configuration also provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and drift effects of over 20 times that of a bare Hall device.

The range of a given feedthrough sensor may be extended upward and downward by appropriate wiring. To extend the range to lower currents, multiple turns of the current-carrying wire may be made through the opening, each turn adding to the sensor output the same quantity; when the sensor is installed onto a printed circuit board, the turns can be carried out by a staple on the board. To extend the range to higher currents, a current divider may be used. The divider splits the current across two wires of differing widths and the thinner wire, carrying a smaller proportion of the total current, passes through the sensor.

[[Image:Ampere-Turnsv1.jpg|thumb|250px|Multiple 'turns' and corresponding transfer function.]]

====Split ring clamp-on sensor====
A variation on the ring sensor uses a [[Current clamp#Hall effect|split sensor]] which is clamped onto the line enabling the device to be used in temporary test equipment. If used in a permanent installation, a split sensor allows the electric current to be tested without dismantling the existing circuit.

====Analog multiplication====
The output is proportional to both the applied magnetic field and the applied sensor voltage.  If the magnetic field is applied by a solenoid, the sensor output is proportional to the product of the current through the solenoid and the sensor voltage. As most applications requiring computation are now performed by small [[computer|digital computers]], the remaining useful application is in power sensing, which combines current sensing with voltage sensing in a single Hall effect device.

====Power measurement====
By sensing the current provided to a load and using the device's applied voltage as a sensor voltage it is possible to determine the power dissipated by a device.

====Position and motion sensing====
Hall effect devices used in motion sensing and motion limit switches can offer enhanced reliability in extreme environments. As there are no moving parts involved within the sensor or magnet, typical life expectancy is improved compared to traditional electromechanical switches. Additionally, the sensor and magnet may be encapsulated in an appropriate protective material. This application is used in [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motors]].

Hall effect sensors, affixed to mechanical gauges that have magnetized indicator needles, can translate the physical position or orientation of the mechanical indicator needle into an electrical signal that can be used by electronic indicators, controls or communications devices.&lt;ref name="esi_tank_sensors"&gt;[http://www.leveldevilsensors.com/main/electronic-sensors-inc-esi-level-devil-american-made-tank-monitors-and-tank-monitoring-systems/tabk-sensor/ Tank Sensors &amp; Probes], Electronic Sensors, Inc., retrieved August 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Automotive ignition and fuel injection====
Commonly used in distributors for ignition timing (and in some types of crank and camshaft position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor is used as a direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing through the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an [[open collector]] and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.

====Wheel rotation sensing====
The sensing of wheel rotation is especially useful in [[anti-lock braking system]]s. The principles of such systems have been extended and refined to offer more than anti-skid functions, now providing extended vehicle [[automobile handling|handling]] enhancements.

====Electric motor control====
Some types of [[brushless DC electric motor]]s use Hall effect sensors to detect the position of the rotor and feed that information to the motor controller. This allows for more precise motor control.

====Industrial applications====
Applications for Hall effect sensing have also expanded to industrial applications, which now use Hall effect [[Joystick#Industrial applications|joysticks]] to control hydraulic valves, replacing the traditional mechanical levers with contactless sensing. Such applications include mining trucks, backhoe loaders, cranes, diggers, scissor lifts, etc.

====Spacecraft propulsion====
A [[Hall-effect thruster]] (HET) is a relatively low power device that is used to propel some [[spacecraft]], after it gets into [[orbit]] or farther out into space. In the HET, [[atom]]s are [[ionization|ionized]] and accelerated by an [[electric field]]. A radial magnetic field established by magnets on the thruster is used to trap [[electron]]s which then orbit and create an [[electric field]] due to the Hall effect. A large potential is established between the end of the thruster where neutral propellant is fed, and the part where electrons are produced; so, electrons trapped in the magnetic field cannot drop to the lower potential.  They are thus extremely energetic, which means that they can ionize neutral atoms. Neutral propellant is pumped into the chamber and is ionized by the trapped electrons.  Positive ions and electrons are then ejected from the thruster as a quasineutral [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], creating thrust.

==The Corbino effect==
[[File:Corbino disc by Zureks.svg|thumb|Corbino disc – dashed curves represent [[logarithmic spiral]] paths of deflected electrons]]

The [[Orso Mario Corbino|Corbino]] effect is a phenomenon involving the Hall effect, but a disc-shaped metal sample is used in place of a rectangular one. Because of its shape the Corbino disc allows the observation of Hall effect–based [[magnetoresistance]] without the associated Hall voltage.

A radial current through a circular disc, subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the disc, produces a "circular" current through the disc.&lt;ref name="Adams1915"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hall and Corbino effects|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|year=1915|first=E. P.|last=Adams|volume=54|issue=216|pages=47–51|id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA47|format=|accessdate=2009-01-24|isbn=978-1-4223-7256-2 |bibcode=1916PhDT.........2C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of the free transverse boundaries renders the interpretation of the Corbino effect simpler than that of the Hall effect.

The '''house energy rating''' (HER) is a standard measure of comparison by which one can evaluate the [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of a new or an existing [[building]]. The comparison is generally done for energy requirements for [[heating]] and [[cooling]] of indoor space. The energy is the main criterion considered by any international building energy rating scheme but there are some other important factors such as production of greenhouse gases emission, indoor environment quality, cost efficiency and thermal comfort, which are considered by some schemes. Basically, the energy rating of a residential building provides detailed information on the energy consumption and the relative energy efficiency of the building. Hence, HERs inform consumers about the relative energy efficiency of homes and encourage them to use this information in making their house purchase decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kordjamshidi|first=Maria|author-link=Maria kordjamshidi|title=House rating schemes|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many energy rating tools by which one can calculate the energy performance of a building. Basically all these tools involve a numerical description or prepare a computer-based model for the rating of a building against standard occupancy and activity templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy and Building | pages = 249–254 | first=Patxi.| last=Hernandez| year=2008| title=Development of energy performance benchmarks and building energy ratings for non-domestic buildings: An example for Irish primary schools | doi= 10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.02.020 | last2= Burke | first2= Kevin | last3= Lewis | first3= J. Owen | volume= 40 | issue= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, HERS uses a computer-simulation based methods for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings under standard conditions and its potential for improvement.

==House energy rating scheme==
HERS is a standardized scheme for evaluation of a home's energy efficiency and expected energy costs.Basically a HERS represents the guideline of a House energy rating. In all countries, HERS show variations in objectives, assessment methodologies &amp; measurement criteria but after all this variation, the goal of all HERS is approximately same and these generate the output in same way.

===HERS outputs===
Basically HERS generates three types of outputs&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy  , Pages: 339-354 | first=Jeff Ross| last=Stein| year=2000| title=Accuracy of home energy rating systems | doi= 10.1016/S0360-5442(99)00072-9 | last2= Meier | first2= Alan | volume= 25 | issue= 4 | pages= 339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 Rating score.
* 2 Energy use/Cost prediction.
* 3 Recommendations.  
&lt;br /&gt;
# Rating Scores: The energy performance rating is a type of energy assessment how efficiently the buildings use energy, relative to similar buildings. The performance scores use generally a scale ranging from 0 to 100 or 1 to 5 stars. The value of score is based on the comparison made between the rated house and a reference house that meets a desired energy code or standards.A rating of 50 indicates average energy performance, while a rating of 75 or more indicates best performance. More the score obtained by a house more will be the energy efficiency of the house and the high rating scores have many direct applications, such as it permits a buyer to quality for more mortgage comparatively.
# Energy use/Cost prediction:HERS generate [[energy use]] and cost predictions for specific end uses like s heating/cooling, hot water and for whole house. These outputs are obtained in absolute measures and unlike to score rating these outputs can be used to compare houses like that of miles-per-gallon ratings are used to compare the cars.
# Recommendations:HERS can produce a list of recommended improvements based on some life cycle's effective cost analysis. These recommendations may be pertaining to any of the inefficient components of a building i.e. insulation layer in the composite wall of building, air conditioning equipment, water heating unit, Double-glazed windows, etc.

==HERS types==
As per the national energy policies, the HERS are known by different names in different countries. The implementation and promotion of HERS in a country depends upon the national energy policy. Beside all this, the aim of all HERS is almost same and it can be classified into three types.
# Perspective HERS : This HERS provides minimum standards for the materials, equipments and methods of efficient design and construction that must be met to qualify for an energy efficiency rating. 
# Calculation based HERS: This HERS uses computer based modeling for the prediction of energy performance relative to the requirements/standards.
# Performance based HERS:In this HERS, the energy efficiency of building is checked by comparing the actual energy consumption data against the set standards.

==Need for HERS==
Increase in [[population]], [[Economic issues]] are the some factors which have escalated the energy demand across the world. In [[developed countries]], the growth rate of energy consumption rate is 1.1%/year while in [[developing countries]] the energy consumption growth rate approximately 3 time to that of developed countries. Beside this high growth in energy consumption it also causes to increase the production of [[green house gases]] to the [[atmosphere]]. The increase in demand of energy, limited resource of convention energy sources, hike in conventional fuel prices, [[global warming]] are some important factors which Impetus us to adopt energy saving techniques and alternative sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy and buildings , Pages: 897-905| first=Guy R.| last=Newsham| year=2009| title=Do [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified buildings save energy? Yes, but. | doi= 10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014 | last2= Mancini | first2= Sandra | last3= Birt | first3= Benjamin J. | volume= 41 | issue= 8 | pages= 897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building sector consumes one third of world's resources. Building currently shares approximately 40% of energy in most of the countries and are considered among the largest end-use sector. As per [[International energy agency]] (IEA) [[world energy consumption]] and green house gases level is going to increase rapidly every year. IEA recognize the building sector as one of the most cost effective sector where energy consumption can be reduced . It is estimated that the energy consumption can be reduced to 1509 million tonnes of equivalent (Mtoe) and at the same time it will cause to reduce the green house gases production up to 12.6 gigatonnes(Gt) by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/buildings_certification.pdf Energy performance certification of buildings&lt;/ref&gt; The international energy outlook report reveals that the energy consumption is increasing in each year and the energy increment trends are shown in fig. 1[[File:World market past, present and future energy consumption scenario.png|thumb|right|Worlds past, present and future energy consumption scenario]].

So, we conclude that the building sector is one of the largest sector where energy consumption and green house gases emission can be reduced effectively by improving the energy efficiency of buildings and hence HERS can play a vital role in achieving all this.

==In different countries==
=== Australia ===
[[Star (classification)|Five star]] is the first house-rating scheme of [[Australia]], which was developed in 1980 by the GMI council of Australia. This scheme was basically based on the three basic elements, glass, mass and insulation of [[dwelling]]. Due to many limitation this system get failed in attaining popularity and in 1990s they develop Victorian scheme. This scheme attains some popularity but it was also not suitable for all climate of Australia.In 1993 a more flexible HERE, known by Graded five star rating system was developed. This rating scheme was much flexible and was suitable to all climatic conditions of Australia. Presently there are different HERS available in Australia which are used in different state of this country.Some of HERS used in this country are :
* NatHERS[[File:NatHERS.jpg|thumb|right|Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme]]
* AccuRate
* FirstRate
* Quick Rate 
* BERS
* Q Rare

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], the first national program for energy efficiency in buildings (HERS), PROCEL EDIFICA was developed in 2003.The use of this rating scheme was extended to public and commercial sector in 2007 and from 2012 the operational rating is mandatory for both residential and commercial buildings. The rating system consist of a scale ranging from A to E basis, where A represent the most efficient and E represent the least efficient rating. The rating scheme consider three aspects of buildings;
*1) Building envelop thermal performance
*2) Lighting system efficiency
*3) Installed power and air conditioning system efficiency
The three groups are evaluate individually and the combined results of these indicates the level of efficiency of a building.

===Canada===
Home energy ratings in [[Canada]] have been in existence since 1997. The two government energy rating programs in Canada are
* Ener Guide for houses (EGH) 
* Ener guide for new houses (EGNH)
Both of these programs use HOT2XP and HOT 2000 as their rating tools.
Beside the aforesaid government rating programs in Canada, there are two standard bases are available for evaluating the building are;
*1) R-2000: as per this rating, 80-85 points are needed to meet Canadian specification code. 
*2) Model national energy code of Canada (MNECB): as per this rating, 70-75 points are needed to meet Canadian specification code.  
* Other HERS in Canada 
LEED is used in Canada as one of home rating scheme. This rating scheme is an adaption of the US green building council’s LEED and has been modified as per the Canadian climate, construction and regulation policies.

===[[China]]===
In China, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) develop a national building energy rating and labeling HERS in 2008. This HERS is mandatory for government buildings, big commercial complexes and those buildings applying for public retrofit funding or green label. this HERS consist a star rating scheme, ranging from 1 to 5 star. As per this HERS, more the star, more will be the energy efficiency of the building. The rating level of buildings is determined in three parameters;
*1) Basic Items : refers to the regulated energy use per square meter, obtained by [[computer modeling]] or measurements.
*2) Required Items : refers to minimum performance requirements for building envelop and Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC).
*3) Optional Items : refers to the additional energy management system which are not mandatory in the rating scheme. it covers, the application of [[renewable energy]], innovative energy efficient technologies.

===[[Denmark]]===
In Denmark, the energy rating scheme are in existence since 1981. Denmark is the first country in Europe(EU) to begin issuing Energy Performance certificates (EPCs). The EPCs are mandatory in all types of buildings in Denmark. The rating system in Denmark includes three parts.
# The first part of rating consists reports on water consumption, energy consumption and GHGs emission per year, which are compared against a standard building of same type on a scale ranging from A1-C5.
# Second part of the system, proposes the different possible ways for saving of energy and water consumption with respect to the cost involved
# This part of report provides the present state of buildings in term of size, heating system, energy usage and the cost of energy and heating.

===France===
In France, "Diagnostic de performance energetique" (DPE) is used as HERS. This scheme was developed in November 2006 and in July 2007 its use becomes mandatory for all those buildings whose registration had been filed after 1 July 2007. This rating scheme consist of two types of measurements.
* Energy consumption 
* Greenhouse gas emission
Both of the measurements comprises 7-label ratings, ranging from A (best) to G (worst) which are presented by the color coding. In ratings, the green color represents A and red color represents G label. In both cases of measurements, the buildings are evaluated in terms of necessary resource for heating, hot water production and air conditioning. The PDE of a building remains valid for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://uniondesconsommateurs.ca/docu/energie/EEratingHouses.pdf FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY(EE):A HomeEnergy Rating System&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], the building energy ratings are in existence since 2007. In this country Building Energy Rating (BER) is used as EPC.  The scheme was mandatory for new dwelling and in 2008, its use was extended to non-residential and public buildings, in 2009 the HERS cover the all types of buildings.  BER is a calculation based HERS.  Due to transparency in this HERS, there is a more awareness among the people and is accepted widely.

===Portugal===
In [[Portugal]], the EPCs scheme was launched in July 2007 and was implemented for new buildings. The use of this scheme was extended to existing buildings in January 2009. This rating scheme covers mainly the indoor air quality and energy performance of the buildings. This rating scheme is also a calculation based HERS. The compliance in the country is high and the EPC is issued only when 90% of building completion and transaction observed. There is a national database who covers all EPCs registration record and this is available for all countrymen.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] (UK) is one of the countries where HERS has been developed and implemented strongly from a very long time ago. In UK, Currently National Home Energy Rating (NHER) scheme is used widely. NHER scheme measure the [[thermal efficiency]] of the dwellings on a scale of 0-10 in terms of energy running cost. The dwelling rating is done through computer modeling which uses a computer program based on Building Research Establishment Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM). Basically NHER measure the energy efficiency of dwellings as a function of energy cost per square meter.The energy usage is calculated by considering the all aspects of buildings (location, design, construction, water heating, cooking, ventilation and appliances, lighting etc.) and for dwelling energy rating it use some standard assumptions, such as occupancy scenario, thermostat setting, occupant stay timings.

===United States===
In the US, HERS are since 1980s.  Among the various HERS energy rated homes of America is used widely.  It is used in more than 18 states of US.  This scheme uses a 100 points scale of efficiency and it is further divided into 10 categories of star rating which ranges from [[Star (classification)|one star]] to [[Star (classification)|five star]] plus. In this rating scheme a higher star rated house represents higher energy efficiency of the house. [[File:Energy star.jpg|thumb|right|ENERGY STAR]] 
The energy efficiency rating in this HERS represents the predicted energy consumption, represents the form of normalized annual energy consumption. This rating scheme consist a detailed measure of CFLs, water heater tanks, ceiling, floors and pipe [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], efficient refrigerator and freezer, high efficient space and water heating equipments, air leakage and controls. 
The other important rating schemes used in US are.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kordjamshidi|first=Maria|author-link=Maria kordjamshidi|title=House rating schemes:from energy to comfort base|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''jumping jack''' is a toy whose origins date back thousands of years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The jointed jumping jack figure is a cross between a [[puppet]] and a [[paper doll]]. The figures are generally made from wood and their limbs are jointed and tied to a [[pull string]]. When the string is pulled and released, the arms and legs move up and down.

==History==
Although the jumping jack is popularly thought of as a European toy, ivory dancer figures made to spin by pulling their strings, which were found at the archaeological site El Lisht and date back to [[ancient Egypt]]ian times, are considered to be among the earliest forms of this family of mechanical toys.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the mid-1700s, jumping jack figures known as “''pantins''” were popular among the French nobility.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1832 the ''Hampelmann'' was created by Carl Malss as a figure for the burlesque at [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Later the jumping jack toy became known as ''Hampelmann'' in [[German language|German]]-speaking countries. They were manufactured in the [[Erzgebirge]] mountain range in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dtv-lexikon'', Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, Munich, 1971, vol. 8, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, in her first year as a student at the famous [[Bauhaus]] design school in [[Dessau]], Germany, the textile designer [[Margaretha Reichardt]] undertook a preliminary course run by [[Josef Albers]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.com/the-bauhaus/people/students/margaretha-reichardt/ Bauhaus100.com. Margaretha Reichardt] Retrieved 31 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the course she designed a modern version of the ''Hampelmann'', which was later produced commercially by Naef, a Swiss toy company. Her version is set in a wooden frame, but like traditional ''Hampelmänner'' he has articulated limbs that move when a string is pulled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.formost.de/designer/d.19.margaretha-reichardt/ Formost.de. Margaretha Reichardt]. Retrieved 31 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quockerwodger==
Oxford Reference cites the word "quockerwodger" as "a wooden puppet which can be made to 'dance' by pulling its strings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199829941.001.0001/acref-9780199829941-e-37584 Oxford Reference.

'''Langley Park Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] near [[Langley Park, County Durham|Langley Park]], [[County Durham]], [[England]]. It was developed by [[EDF Energy]] and is operated by [[Cumbria Wind Farms]], the farm has a [[Intermittent energy source#Terminology|nameplate capacity]] of 8.2 [[Megawatt|MW]], containing four REpower Systems' MM82 [[Wind turbine|turbines]] each rated at 2.05MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp |title=RenewableUK |first=RenewableUK |last=Association |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102132011/http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 EDF accepted that it had failed to check the impact of the turbines on [[Freeview (UK)|digital television]] reception, after residents of villages where the turbines lay on a line-of-site to the local TV transmitter complained of a loss of signal strength and severe Freeview Digital Services disruption, particularly when the turbine blades rotate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2008/11/06/company-admits-wind-farms-ruined-tv-reception-72703-22196802/|title=Company admits wind farms ruined TV reception|first=Kerry|last=Wood|date=6 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/lawrie.milner/digitaltv/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328121400/http://freespace.virgin.net/lawrie.milner/digitaltv/ |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">'''Lindsay Hunt''' is a [[South Africa]]n hunter turned conservationist who played an important role in a project to produce [[Cape Buffalo]] breeding stock free of [[bovine tuberculosis]] and [[foot-and-mouth disease]]. This project has resulted in the establishing of disease-free herds in all nine provinces of South Africa, away from the TB-ravaged areas of the [[Kruger National Park]].

Discovered in 1990, buffalo bovine tuberculosis is an airborne bacterial disease. Infected buffalo may carry the disease for long periods, becoming emaciated and eventually succumbing to predation. Tuberculosis has had a devastating effect on wild buffalo herds, crossing the species barrier and widely contaminating predators, scavengers and herbivores, such as lion, leopard, cheetah, baboon, kudu, eland, bongo, oryx, sable antelope and waterbuck.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bT1pn2HUjhcC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Jeremy+Anderson%22+%22White+River%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vj5CdMppwg&amp;sig=7rWcX-s8w5EM78xUqEEEDHAgaKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA239,M1 A Certain Curve of Horn - John Frederick Walker]&lt;/ref&gt; Bovine tuberculosis, first reported in South Africa in 1880 in domestic cattle and in 1928 in wildlife in the [[Eastern Cape]], probably arrived with European settlers and their livestock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.agric.za/home.asp?pid=605 Agricultural Research Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011004358/http://www.arc.agric.za/home.asp?pid=605 |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African National Parks Board felt the only practical solution to the epidemic, was to breed disease-free buffalo. Lindsay Hunt sourced his first buffalo breeding stock from the gene pool of the Kruger Park and developed systems that have been acclaimed in wildlife management circles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviva-sa.com/projects/wildlife/buffalo/index.htm AVIVA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512020455/http://www.aviva-sa.com/projects/wildlife/buffalo/index.htm |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnet.co.za/Mnet/Shows/carteblanche/story.asp?Id=1910 Mnet - Where Magic Lives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120904040107/http://www.mnet.co.za/Mnet/Shows/carteblanche/story.asp?Id=1910 |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of all [[tornado]]es that were confirmed throughout [[Europe]] by the European Severe Storms Laboratory and local meteorological agencies during [[Tornadoes of 2014|2014]]. Unlike the [[United States]], the original [[Fujita Scale]] and the [[TORRO scale]] are used to rank tornadoes across the continent.

[[File:Luminol.jpg|right|thumb|[[Luminol]] and [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]], an example of [[chemiluminescence]]]]
'''Luminescence''' is [[spontaneous emission]] of [[light]] by a substance not resulting from heat; it is thus a form of cold-body [[radiation]]. It can be caused by [[chemical reaction]]s, [[electric potential energy|electrical energy]], subatomic motions or [[piezoelectricity|stress on a crystal]]. This distinguishes luminescence from [[incandescence]], which is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating. Historically, [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]] was thought of as a form of "radio-luminescence", although it is today considered to be separate since it involves more than electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref&gt;The term 'luminescence' was introduced in 1888 by Q.C Lum (1888) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_D0bAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA446#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Über Fluorescenz und Phosphorescenz, I. Abhandlung"] (On fluorescence and phosphorescence, first paper), ''Annalen der Physik'', '''34''': 446-463. From page 447: "Ich möchte für diese zweite Art der Lichterregung, für die uns eine einheitliche Benennung fehlt, den Namen Luminescenz vorschlagen, und Körper, die in dieser Weise leuchten, luminescirende nennen." [For this second type of light excitation, for which we lack a consistent name, I would like to suggest the name of "luminescence", and call "luminescing" [any] bodies that glow in this way.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief History of Fluorescence and Phosphorescence before the Emergence of Quantum Theory'' Bernard Valeur and Mario N. Berberan-Santos J. Chem. Educ., 2011, 88 (6), pp 731–738 {{DOI|10.1021/ed100182h}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chording mycobacterium tuberculesis culture.jpg|thumb|UV-photoluminescence in the microbiological diagnostics]]
The dials, hands, scales, and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as "luminising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Radioactive Releases in the Environment: Impact and Assessment |first1= John R. |last1= Cooper |first2= Keith |last2= Randle |first3= Ranjeet S. |last3= Sokhi |publisher= Wiley |year= 2003 |page= 192 |isbn= 9780471899242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The following are types of luminescence:
*[[Chemiluminescence]], the emission of light as a result of a [[chemical reaction]]
**[[Bioluminescence]], a result of biochemical reactions in a living organism
**[[Electrochemiluminescence]], a result of an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical reaction]]
**[[Lyoluminescence]], a result of dissolving a solid (usually heavily irradiated) in a liquid solvent
**[[Candoluminescence]], is light emitted by certain materials at elevated temperatures, which differs from the [[blackbody]] emission expected at the temperature in question.
*[[Crystalloluminescence]], produced during [[crystallization]]
*[[Electroluminescence]], a result of an electric current passed through a substance
**[[Cathodoluminescence]], a result of a luminescent material being struck by electrons
*[[Mechanoluminescence]], a result of a mechanical action on a solid
**[[Triboluminescence]], generated when bonds in a material are broken when that material is scratched, crushed, or rubbed
**[[Triboluminescence#Fractoluminescence|Fractoluminescence]], generated when bonds in certain crystals are broken by fractures
**[[Piezoluminescence]], produced by the action of pressure on certain solids&lt;ref&gt;''Piezoluminescence phenomenon'' N. A. Atari Physics Letters A Volume 90, Issues 1-2, 21 June 1982, Pages 93-96 {{doi|10.1016/0375-9601(82)90060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Sonoluminescence]], a result of imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound
*[[Photoluminescence]], a result of absorption of photons
**[[Fluorescence]], photoluminescence as a result of [[singlet state|singlet]]–singlet electronic [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] (typical [[exponential decay|lifetime]]: nanoseconds)
**[[Phosphorescence]], photoluminescence as a result of [[triplet state|triplet]]–singlet electronic relaxation (typical lifetime: milliseconds to hours)
**[[Raman scattering|Raman emission]], photoluminescence as a result of inelastic light scattering, (lifetime: nanoseconds)
*[[Radioluminescence]], a result of bombardment by ionizing radiation
*[[Thermoluminescence]], the re-emission of absorbed energy when a substance is heated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meetei|first1=Sanoujam Dhiren|title=Synthesis, Characterization and Photoluminescence of ZrO2:Eu3+ Nanocrystals|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/26604/6/06_chapter%201.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luminescence occurs in some [[mineral]]s when they are exposed to low-powered sources of [[ultraviolet]] or [[infrared]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] (for example, [[Ultraviolet#Artificial sources|portable UV lamp]]s), at [[atmospheric pressure]] and atmospheric temperatures. This property of these minerals can be used during the process of mineral identification at rock [[outcrop]]s in the [[Field research|field]], or in the laboratory.

'''Lutsk compact overhead line''' in [[Volyn Oblast]], [[Ukraine]] is a technically unique 10 kV [[overhead power line|power transmission line]] that connects a [[thermal power plant]] in '''[[Lutsk]]''' ({{Coord|50.7752278|25.3743893|display=inline}}) to the Lutsk-Pivnichna substation ({{Coord|50.7746936|25.3852308|display=inline}}).

The 978 meter long line has 2 [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]s. Both circuits use, what is unique at this [[voltage]] level, bundles of 6 wires as [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s. The bundle conductors of each circuit are combined by separation [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s in the span and at the [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s to a strand, which is mounted on suspension insulators at the pylons. This construction method gives a more narrow [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]], as a conventional power line with 6 conductors. The line has no ground wire attached to the main towers themselves; these wires are attached to adjacent lightning rod towers and parallel both sides of the route.

'''MANWEB''' (Merseyside And North Wales Electricity Board) was the [[regional electricity company|regional electricity]] supplier and distributor for [[Merseyside]], [[North Wales]] and parts of [[Cheshire]]. It is now part of [[SP Energy Networks]], itself a subsidiary of the [[Spain|Spanish]] energy company [[Iberdrola]]. In September 1994, MANWEB announced plans to slash five hundred jobs in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/manweb-plans-to-cut-staff-by-500-1447291.html|title=Manweb plans to cut staff by 500|publisher=www.independent.co.uk|date=7 September 1994|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade, the research and development of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) system technology has been accelerated due to its free of pollution, silent operation, long life time and low maintenance cost and the improvement of solar cell technologies and the increasing demand for PV systems have led to a reduction of the price of PV module, the costs of PV systems are still too high. Therefore, it is an important to design the PV systems which can maximize energy production from Sun through [[solar modules]]. The output power of solar module is a function of solar radiance, temperature and operating point because of its nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) relationship. Therefore, the maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is widely used to maximize the power output of the solar module. As such, many MPPT techniques have been developed and implemented. The techniques used generally are Hill Climbing, Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O), Incremental Conductance (INC), Factional Open-Circuit Voltage and Fractional Short-Circuit Current. The past results show that P&amp;O and Incremental Conductance are in general the most efficient techniques. For these two techniques, the derivatives of voltage and power measured from the solar module are still required.

'''Bisection Search Method:''' Now a novel MPPT technique based on bisection search theorem (BST) is proposed without the necessity of derivative computation. Thus, the new technique is even simpler in computation, cheaper in implementation and faster in tracking. The experimental results from solar array simulator in the laboratory show that the proposed technique can track maximum power point very fast within a few steps. The Feasibility of the proposed technique is also verified under real solar modules at the presence of natural environmental conditions. Thus, it is expected to be widely used to replace conventional MPPT techniques in PV systems. This technique is very efficient for [[maximum power point tracking]] of the solar PV array. The schematic diagram is as given below in the figure.

[[File:Maximum power point tracking of the solar PV array.png|thumb|maximum power point tracking of the solar PV array]]

'''Bisection Search Theorem:''' The bisection search theorem is one of the bracketing methods for finding roots of equations. Assume that function y= f(x) and an interval [a, b] which contains a root x* of f(x) that lies somewhere in the interval such that f(c)= 0. The BST systematically moves the end points of the interval closer and closer together in the pace of halving interval for each step until an interval of arbitrarily small width that brackets the zero is obtained. The decision step for this process is first to choose the midpoint c =(a+b) / 2 and then to analyze the three possibilities that might rise. If f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, a zero lies in [a, c]. If f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, a zero lies in [c, b]. If f (c)=0, then the zero is c. If either case (1) or (2) occurs, an interval half as wide as the original interval that contains the root.

'''Maximum Power Point Tracking Using Bisection Search Method:''' In order to apply the BST into the MPPT technique in PV systems, the function of y= f(x) and the variable x should be chosen carefully. Fig. 2 shows a power-voltage (P -V) curve. From the (P -V) curve, it can be observed that the change in power with respect to voltage approaches zero at the maximum power point. Obviously, the powers at short circuit voltage (0 V) and open circuit voltage (Voc ) are zero, so maximum power should not happen in these two particular points even though the changes in power at these two points are also zero, which is caused by the small powers around these two points. Thus, tracking the maximum power point is essential to find the root in the function dP by regulating the voltage of solar module or solar array. As a result, the function y= f(x) can be regarded as the change in power dP, where the variable x is the voltage of solar module or solar array.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8906">Materials that are used for [[biomedical]] or clinical applications are known as [[biomaterials]]. The following article deals with fifth generation biomaterials that are used for bone structure replacement. For any material to be classified for biomedical application three requirements must be met. The first requirement is that the material must be [[biocompatible]]; it means that the organism should not treat it as a foreign object. Secondly, the material should be biodegradable (for in-graft only); the material should harmlessly degrade or dissolve in the body of the organism to allow it to resume natural functioning. Thirdly, the material should be mechanically sound; for the replacement of load  bearing structures, the material should possess equivalent or greater mechanical stability to ensure high reliability of the graft.

==Introduction==

The biomaterial term is used for materials that can be used in biomedical and clinical applications. They are bioactive and biocompatible in nature. Currently, many types of metals and alloys ([[stainless steel]], [[titanium]], [[nickel]], [[magnesium]], Co–Cr alloys, Ti alloys),&lt;ref name=Katti&gt;Katti, K. S. (2004). Biomaterials in total joint replacement. Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 39(3), 133-142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] ([[zirconia]], [[bioglass]], [[alumina]], [[hydroxyapatite]]) &lt;ref name=Katti/&gt; and [[polymers]] (acrylic, nylon, silicone, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, polyanhydrides) &lt;ref name=Katti/&gt; are used for load bearing application. This includes dental replacement and bone joining or replacement for medical and clinical application. Therefore their mechanical properties are very important. Mechanical properties of some biomaterials and bone are summarized in table 1.&lt;ref name=wang&gt;Wang, R. Z., Cui, F. Z., Lu, H. B., Wen, H. B., Ma, C. L., &amp; Li, H. D. (1995). Synthesis of nanophase hydroxyapatite/collagen composite. Journal of materials science letters, 14(7), 490-492.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them hydroxyapatite is most widely studied bioactive and biocompatible material. However, it has lower [[young’s modulus]] and [[fracture toughness]] with [[brittle]] nature. Hence, it is required to produce a biomaterial with good mechanical properties.

==Elastic modulus==

[[Elastic modulus]] is simply defined as the ratio of stress to strain within the proportional limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material it is going to replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.&lt;ref name=kokubo&gt;Kokubo, T. (Ed.). (2008). Bioceramics and their clinical applications. Woodhead Pub. and Maney Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardness==

Hardness is one of the most important parameters for comparing properties of materials. It is used for finding the suitability of the clinical use of biomaterials. Biomaterial hardness is desirable as equal to bone hardness. If higher than the biomaterial, then it penetrates in the bone. As above said, biomaterials sample are very small therefore, micro and nano scale hardness test (Diamond Knoop and Vickers indenters) are used.&lt;ref name=kokubo/&gt;

==Fracture strength==

Strength of materials is defined as the maximum stress that can be endured before fracture occurs. Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In brittle materials like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to tensile loading,  unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength of materials, such as the bending flexural test, the biaxial [[flexural strength]] test and the [[weibull]] approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal [[sintering]] and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability,  rather than high strength.

==Fracture toughness==

Fracture toughness is required to alter the crack propagation in ceramics. It is helpful to evaluate the serviceability, performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high fracture toughness material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low fracture toughness.&lt;ref name=fischer&gt;Fischer, H., &amp; Marx, R. (2002). Fracture toughness of dental ceramics: comparison of bending and indentation method. Dental Materials, 18(1), 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.

==Fatigue==

Fatigue is defined as failure of a material due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It is also an important parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.&lt;ref name=kokubo/&gt;

'''Ming Yang Wind Power Group Limited''' ("Ming Yang", {{zh|c=明阳风电}}) is the largest private [[wind turbine]] [[manufacturer]] in China and the fifth largest overall in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeller Jr.|first1=Tom|title=Wind Power for Boston, Made in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/business/energy-environment/16windside.html?_r=1|accessdate=17 December 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 December 2010|first2=Keith |last2 = Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1 October 2010, the company was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] until 2016, June 22.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/IPO_2010.html IPO Showcase]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is focusing on designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing megawatt-class wind turbines. Ming Yang cooperates with [[aerodyn Energiesysteme]], a leading wind turbine design firm based in Germany.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  Ming Yang's key customers include the five largest state-owned power producers in China, with an aggregate installed capacity accounting for more than 5.5% of China's newly installed capacity in 2010.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The company started wind turbine production in 2007, with a prototype of 1.5MW designed by aerodyn Energiesysteme.

In 2010 Ming Yang started SCD production (2.75MW and 3.0MW).
The SCD (Super Compact Drive) is an innovative two blade turbine by aerodyn (Husum WindEnergy AWARD 2009).
In 2013, the new offshore wind turbine SCD 6.5 was presented. A two bladed downwind offshore turbine with helicopter deck. The first was connected to the grid in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;David Weston.

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===
{{multiple image

   | direction = vertical
   | footer    =

   | image2    = Negative temperature beta of E.png
   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E. M. |last2=Pound |first2=R.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

'''Novotext''' is a trade name for [[cotton]] [[textile]]-[[phenolic resin]], essentially cotton-reinforced [[Bakelite]].  It was often used in car engines for [[gear wheel]]s used to provide a direct drive to the [[camshaft]] as it is flexible and quiet-running.&lt;ref&gt;The Aeronautical Journal
by Royal Aeronautical Society - Aeronautics - 1927&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first luxury cars to use this material for its [[camshaft]] drive gears was the [[Maybach Zeppelin]] of 1928.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Maybach Zeppelin" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material is known under various other names such as '''Turbax''', '''Resitex''', '''Celoron''' and '''Textolit'''.&lt;ref&gt;US patent 1812552&lt;/ref&gt;  In bar form it is also known as Cartatextiel and Ferrozell and in sheet form as Harex, Tufnol and Micarta.

==Tufnol==
[[Tufnol]] is a [[composite material]] comprising phenolic resin and another material (paper, cotton fabric etc.). The two materials together complement each other's qualities. It is inherently water resistant and some grades are used as a lining in loaded bearings (e.g. [[stave bearing]]s) where [[lubricating oil]] use is not feasible. Rather, it can be lubricated with water. It has very low friction characteristics; thus it finds its use in dusty, chemically sensitive environments. The ability to work without oil makes it a preferable choice for design engineers. Unfortunately, the preparation is not as environmentally friendly.

==Production==
Production is achieved through the use of [[Glass-reinforced_plastic#Chopped_strand_mat|chopped strand mat]] (CSM) technique.

An '''OE Buoy''' or Ocean Energy Buoy is a [[wave power]] device that uses an [[Oscillating Water Column]] design. It was deployed in half-scale test mode in [[Spiddal]] near [[Galway]] in [[Ireland]] for over two years between 2007 and 2009. As of the 5th of March 2011 the model has been redeployed at the same site, primarily as a data collector for the [[European Union|EU]] funded Cores Project.

It was developed by the [http://hmrc.ucc.ie HMRC] in Cork and is now owned and developed by the spun off [https://web.archive.org/web/20091115111614/http://www.oceanenergy.ie/oe-technology/platform.html Oceanenergy].

The '''OE Buoy''' is a version of a device known as the '''Backward Bent Duct Buoy''' (BBDB) which was invented in 1986 by wave energy pioneer and Japanese naval commander [[Yoshio Masuda]].

==Description==
[[File:Papaya flower 02.jpg|thumb|Papaya flower]]
The papaya is a small, sparsely branched tree, usually with a single [[Plant stem|stem]] growing from {{convert|5|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with spirally arranged [[leaf|leaves]] confined to the top of the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]. The lower trunk is conspicuously [[scar]]red where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, {{convert|50|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]], deeply [[Glossary of leaf shapes|palmate]]ly lobed, with seven lobes. All parts of the plant contain latex in articulated laticifers.&lt;ref name=Heywood/&gt; Papayas are [[dioecious]]. The [[flower]]s are 5-parted and highly dimorphic, the male flowers with the stamens fused to the petals. The female flowers have a superior ovary and five contorted petals loosely connected at the base.&lt;ref name="RonseDeCraene"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Ronse De Craene |first = L.P. |date = 2010 |title = Floral diagrams: an aid to understanding flower morphology and evolution |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |isbn = 978-0-521-49346-8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=24p-LgWPA50C }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|235}} Male and female flowers are borne in the leaf axils, the males in multiflowered [[Glossary of botanical terms#Dichasium|dichasia]], the female flowers is few-flowered dichasia.

==Origin and distribution==
[[native plant|Native]] to Mexico and northern [[South America]],&lt;ref name=grin/&gt;&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood/&gt; papaya has become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] throughout the [[Caribbean Islands]], [[Florida]], [[Texas]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], and other [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of the world.&lt;ref name=grin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papayas|url=https://www.wifss.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Papayas_PDF.pdf|publisher=University of California at Davis|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==

Papaya plants grow in three sexes: male, female, and [[hermaphrodite]]. The male produces only pollen, never fruit. The female produces small, inedible fruits unless pollinated. The hermaphrodite can self-pollinate since its flowers contain both male [[stamen]]s and female [[ovary (botany)|ovaries]]. Almost all commercial papaya orchards contain only hermaphrodites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/F_N-5.pdf |title=Why Some Papaya Plants Fail to Fruit |authors=C. L. Chia and Richard M. Manshardt, |work=Department of Tropical Plant and Soil Sciences |date=2001 |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from southern Mexico (particularly [[Chiapas]] and [[Veracruz]]), [[Central America]], and northern [[South America]],&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; the papaya is now cultivated in most tropical countries. In cultivation, it grows rapidly, fruiting within 3 years. It is, however, highly frost-sensitive, limiting its production to [[tropics|tropical climates]]. Temperatures below {{convert|29|F|C|order=flip}} are greatly harmful if not fatal. In Florida, California, and Texas, growth is generally limited to southern parts of the states. It prefers sandy, well-drained soil, as standing water will kill the plant within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boning|first=Charles R.|title=Florida's Best Fruiting Plants: Native and Exotic Trees, Shrubs, and Vines|year=2006|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For cultivation, however, only female plants are used, since they give off a single flower each time, and close to the base of the plant, while the male gives off multiple flowers in long stems, which result in poorer quality fruit.{{clarify|reason=how can a male plant produce a fruit anyway?|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;

===Cultivars===
[[File:Papaya.jpg|thumb|upright|Papayas with yellow flesh]]

Two kinds of papayas are commonly grown. One has sweet, red or orange flesh, and the other has yellow flesh; in Australia, these are called "red papaya" and "yellow papaw", respectively.&lt;ref name=HortAustralia&gt;{{cite web|title=Papaya Varieties|url=http://australianpapaya.com.au/about/varieties/|date=2015|publisher=Papaya Australia|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either kind, picked green, is called a "green papaya".

The large-fruited, red-fleshed 'Maradol', 'Sunrise', and 'Caribbean Red' papayas often sold in U.S. markets are commonly grown in Mexico and Belize.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sagon|first=Candy|title=Maradol Papaya|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26970-2004Oct12.html|work=Market Watch (13 Oct 2004)|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 July 2011|date=13 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Philippine researchers reported that by [[hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] papaya with ''[[Vasconcellea quercifolia]]'', they had developed conventionally bred, nongenetically engineered papaya resistant to PRV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/48t805l7w7564288 |title=Euphytica, Volume 181, Number 2 |doi=10.1007/s10681-011-0388-z |publisher=SpringerLink |accessdate=2012-06-29 |volume=181 |issue=2 |journal=Euphytica |pages=159–168|year=2011 |last1=Siar |first1=S. V. |last2=Beligan |first2=G. A. |last3=Sajise |first3=A. J. C. |last4=Villegas |first4=V. N. |last5=Drew |first5=R. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetically engineered cultivars====

''Carica papaya'' was the first [[transgenic]] [[fruit tree]] to have its [[genome]] sequenced.&lt;ref name="ugr.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canal.ugr.es/life-sciences/item/6354-scientists-decipher-fruit-tree-genome-for-the-first-time|title=Scientists decipher fruit tree genome for the first time|work=ugr.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the [[papaya ringspot virus]] (PRV) outbreak in Hawaii, in 1998, genetically altered papaya were approved and brought to market (including 'SunUp' and 'Rainbow' varieties.) Varieties resistant to PRV have some DNA of this virus incorporated into the DNA of the plant.&lt;ref name="mhhe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/botany/botany_map/articles/article_03.html|title= Genetically Altered Papayas Save the Harvest|work=mhhe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiipapaya.com/rainbow.htm |title=Hawaiipapaya.com |publisher=Hawaiipapaya.com |accessdate=2013-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107073644/http://www.hawaiipapaya.com/rainbow.htm |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 80% of Hawaiian papaya plants were genetically modified. The modifications were made by [[University of Hawaii]] scientists who made the modified seeds available to farmers without charge.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald, Pamela and McWilliams, James (14 May 2010) [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/opinion/15ronald.html?_r=2&amp;ref=opinion Genetically Engineered Distortions] The New York Times, accessed 1 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harc-hspa.com/publications/TF5.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331180723/http://www.harc-hspa.com/publications/TF5.pdf |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diseases and pests===

====Viruses====
[[Papaya ringspot virus]] is a well-known virus within plants in Florida.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; The first signs of the virus are yellowing and vein-clearing of younger leaves, as well as mottling yellow leaves. Infected leaves may obtain blisters, roughen or narrow, with blades sticking upwards from the middle of the leaves. The petioles and stems may develop dark green greasy streaks and in time become shorter. The ringspots are circular, C-shaped markings that are darker green than the fruit itself. In the later stages of the virus, the markings may become gray and crusty. Viral infections impact growth and reduce the fruit's quality. One of the biggest effects that viral infections have on papaya is the taste. As of 2010, the only way to protect papaya from this virus is genetic modification.&lt;ref name="papaya ringspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/viruses/Pages/PapayaRingspotvirus.aspx |authors=Gonsalves, D., S.

The [[papaya mosaic virus]] destroys the plant until only a small tuft of leaves are left. The virus affects both the leaves of the plant and the fruit. Leaves show thin, irregular, dark-green lines around the borders and clear areas around the veins. The more severely affected leaves are irregular and linear in shape. The virus can infect the fruit at any stage of its maturity. Fruits as young as 2 weeks old have been spotted with dark-green ringspots about 1 inch in diameter. Rings on the fruit are most likely seen on either the stem end or the blossom end. In the early stages of the ringspots, the rings tend to be many closed circles, but as the disease develops, the rings will increase in diameter consisting of one large ring. The difference between the ringspot and the mosaic viruses is the ripe fruit in the ringspot has mottling of colors and mosaic does not.&lt;ref name="papaya mosaic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/B-136.pdf |last1= Hine |first1=B.R. |last2=Holtsmann |first2=O.V. |last3=Raabe |first3=R.D. |date=July 1965 |title=Disease of papaya in Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fungi====
The fungus [[anthracnose]] is known to specifically attack papaya, especially the mature fruits. The disease starts out small with very few signs, such as water-soaked spots on ripening fruits. The spots become sunken, turn brown or black, and may get bigger. In some of the older spots, the fungus may produce pink spores. The fruit ends up being soft and having an off flavor because the fungus grows into the fruit.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

The fungus [[powdery mildew]] occurs as a superficial white presence on the surface of the leaf in which it is easily recognized. Tiny, light yellow spots begin on the lower surfaces of the leaf as the disease starts to make its way. The spots enlarge and white powdery growth appears on the leaves. The infection usually appears at the upper leaf surface as white fungal growth. Powdery mildew is not as severe as other diseases.&lt;ref name="powdery mildew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/PD-90.pdf |authors=Cunningham, B. &amp; Nelson, S. (2012, June) |title=Powdery mildew of papaya in Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungus [[phytophthora]] [[blight]] causes damping-off, [[root rot]], stem rot, stem girdling, and fruit rot. Damping-off happens in young plants by wilting and death. The spots on established plants start out as white, water-soaked lesions at the fruit and branch scars. These spots enlarge and eventually cause death. The most dangerous feature of the disease is the infection of the fruit which may be toxic to consumers.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; The roots can also be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to brown and wilt away, collapsing within days.

The papaya fruit fly lays its eggs inside of the fruit, possibly up to 100 or more eggs.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; The eggs usually hatch within 12 days when they begin to feed on seeds and interior parts of the fruit. When the [[larva]]e mature usually 16 days after being hatched, they eat their way out of the fruit, drop to the ground, and [[pupa]]te in the soil to emerge within one to two weeks later as mature flies. The infected papaya will turn yellow and drop to the ground after infestation by the papaya fruit fly.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

The [[two-spotted spider mite]] is a 0.5-mm-long brown or orange-red or a green, greenish yellow translucent oval pest. They all have needle-like piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by piercing the plant tissue with their mouthparts, usually on the underside of the plant. The spider mites spin fine threads of webbing on the host plant, and when they remove the sap, the mesophyll tissue collapses and a small chlorotic spot forms at the feeding sites. The leaves of the papaya fruit turn yellow, gray, or bronze. If the spider mites are not controlled, they can cause the death of the fruit.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05300.pdf |last1=Mossler |first1=M.A. |last2=Crane |first2=J. |date=September 2002 |title=Florida crop/pest management profile: papaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The papaya whitefly lays yellow, oval eggs that appear dusted on the undersides of the leaves. They eat papaya leaves, therefore damaging the fruit. There, the eggs developed into flies in three stages called instars. The first instar has well-developed legs and is the only mobile immature life stage. The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage. The next instars are flattened, oval, and scale-like. In the final stage, the pupal whiteflies are more convex, with large, conspicuously red eyes.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Production==

In 2016, global production of papayas was 13.05 million [[tonne]]s, led by India with 44% of the world total (table). Global papaya production grew significantly over the early 21st century, mainly as a result of increased production in India and demand by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fe913|title=An Overview of Global Papaya Production, Trade, and Consumption|publisher=Electronic Data Information Source, University of Florida|accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw papaya pulp contains 88% water, 11% [[carbohydrates]], and negligible [[fat]] and [[protein]] (table). In a 100 gram amount, papaya fruit provides 43 [[calories|kilocalories]] and is a significant source of [[vitamin C]] (75% of the [[Daily Value]], DV) and a moderate source of [[folate]] (10% DV), but otherwise has low content of [[nutrients]] (see table).

==Culinary uses==

The ripe fruit of the papaya is usually eaten raw, without skin or [[seed]]s. The unripe green fruit can be eaten [[cooking|cook]]ed, usually in [[curry|curries]], [[salad]]s, and [[stew]]s. Green papaya is used in [[Southeast Asia]]n cooking, both raw and cooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natty Netsuwan |url=http://www.thaitable.com/Thai/recipes/Green_Papaya_Salad.htm |title=Green Papaya Salad Recipe |publisher=ThaiTable.com |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thai cuisine]], papaya is used to make [[Thai salads]] such as ''[[som tam]]'' and [[Thai curries]] such as ''[[kaeng som]]'' when still not fully ripe. In [[Indonesian cuisine]], the unripe green fruits and young leaves are boiled for use as part of ''[[lalab]]'' salad, while the flower buds are [[Sautéing|sautéed]] and [[Stir frying|stir-fried]] with chillies and green tomatoes as [[Minahasa people#Cuisine|Minahasan]] papaya flower vegetable dish. Papayas have a relatively high amount of [[pectin]], which can be used to make [[Fruit preserves|jellies]]. The smell of ripe, fresh papaya flesh can strike some people as unpleasant. In Brazil, the unripe fruits are often used to make sweets or [[fruit preserves|preserves]].

The black seeds of the papaya are edible and have a sharp, spicy taste.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; They are sometimes ground and used as a substitute for [[black pepper]].

In some parts of [[Asia]], the young leaves of the papaya are [[steaming|steamed]] and eaten like [[spinach]].

===Meat tenderizing===
Both green papaya fruit and the plant's [[latex]] are rich in [[papain]],&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; a [[protease]] used for [[tenderizing]] [[meat]] and other proteins, as practiced currently by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] Americans and people of the Caribbean region.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; It is now included as a component in some powdered meat tenderizers.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt;

==Phytochemicals==

Papaya skin, pulp and seeds contain a variety of [[phytochemical]]s, including [[carotenoid]]s and [[polyphenol]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Sci Food Agric|year=2010|volume=90|issue=14|pages=2358–65|doi=10.1002/jsfa.4092|pmid=20632382|title=Phenolic and carotenoid profiles of papaya fruit (Carica papaya L.) and their contents under low temperature storage|authors=Rivera-Pastrana DM, Yahia EM, González-Aguilar GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[benzyl isothiocyanate]]s and benzyl glucosinates, with skin and pulp levels that increase during ripening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Benzylglucosinolate, benzylisothiocyanate, and myrosinase activity in papaya fruit during development and ripening | vauthors=Rossetto MR, Oliveira do Nascimento JR, Purgatto E, Fabi JP, Lajolo FM, Cordenunsi BR | journal=J Agric Food Chem | year=2008 | volume=56 | issue=20 | pages=9592–9 | doi=10.1021/jf801934x | pmid=18826320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papaya seeds also contain the [[cyanogenic]] substance [[prunasin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cyanogenic allosides and glucosides from Passiflora edulis and Carica papaya | vauthors=Seigler DS, Pauli GF, Nahrstedt A, Leen R | journal=Phytochemistry | year=2002 | volume=60 | issue=8 | pages=873–82 | pmid=12150815 | doi=10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00170-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional medicine==
In some parts of the world, papaya leaves are made into tea as a treatment for [[malaria]], but the mechanism is not understood and no treatment method based on these results has been scientifically proven.&lt;ref name=Titanji&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Titanji, V.P. |author2=Zofou, D. |author3=Ngemenya, M.N. |year=2008 |title= The Antimalarial Potential of Medicinal Plants Used for the Treatment of Malaria in Cameroonian Folk Medicine |journal=African Journal of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicines |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=302–321 |pmc=2816552 |pmid=20161952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allergies and side effects==
Papaya releases a latex fluid when not ripe, possibly causing irritation and an allergic reaction in some people.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4329">A '''plasma railgun''' is a linear accelerator which, like a projectile [[railgun]], uses two long parallel electrodes to accelerate a "sliding short" armature. However, in a plasma railgun, the armature and ejected projectile consists of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], or hot, ionized, gas-like particles, instead of a solid slug of material. Scientific plasma railguns are typically operated in vacuum and not at air pressure. They are of value because they produce muzzle velocities of up to several hundreds of kilometers per second. Because of this, these devices have applications in [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MCF), [[magneto-inertial fusion]] (MIF), '''[[High energy density physics|High Energy Density Physics]]''' research (HEDP), laboratory [[astrophysics]], and as a [[plasma propulsion engine]] for spacecraft.

== Theory ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

Plasma railguns appear in two principle topologies, linear and coaxial. Linear railguns consist of two flat plate electrodes separated by insulating spacers and accelerate sheet armatures. Coaxial railguns accelerate toroidal plasma armatures using a hollow outer conductor and a central, concentric, inner conductor.

Linear plasma railguns place extreme demands on their insulators, as they must be an electrically insulating, plasma-facing vacuum component which can withstand both thermal and acoustic shocks. Additionally, a complex triple joint seal may exist at the breech of the bore, which can often pose an extreme engineering challenge. Coaxial accelerators require insulators only at the breech, but the plasma armature in that case is subject to the "blow-by" instability. This is an instability in which the magnetic pressure front can out-run or "blow-by" the plasma armature due to the radial dependence of acceleration current density, drastically reducing device efficiency. Coaxial accelerators use various techniques to mitigate this instability. In either design, a plasma armature is formed at the breech. As plasma railguns are an open area of research, the method of armature formation varies. However, techniques including exploding foils, gas cell burst disk injection, neutral gas injection via fast gas valve, and plasma capillary injection have been employed.

After armature formation, the plasmoid is then accelerated down the length of the railgun by a current pulse driven through one electrode, through the armature, and out the other electrode, creating a large magnetic field behind the armature. Since the driver current through the armature is also moving through and normal to a self-generated magnetic field, the armature particles experience a [[Lorentz force]], accelerating them down the length of the gun. Accelerator electrode geometry and materials are also open areas of research.

== Applications ==

Plasma rail guns are capable of producing controlled jets of given densities and velocities ranging from at least peak densities 1e13 to 1e16 particles/m^3 with velocities from 5 to 200&amp;nbsp;km/s dependent on device design configuration and operating parameters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Plasma rail guns are being evaluated for applications in magnetic confinement fusion for disruption mitigation and tokamak refueling.&lt;ref&gt;R. Raman and K. Itami [http://jasosx.ils.uec.ac.jp/JSPF/JSPF_TEXT/jspf2000/jspf2000_10/jspf2000_10-1079.pdf Conceptual Design Description of a CT Fueler for JT-60U](2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magneto-inertial fusion]] seeks to implode a magnetized D-T fusion target using a spherically-symmetric, collapsing, conducting liner. Plasma railguns are being evaluated as a possible method of implosion linear formation for fusion.

Arrays of plasma railguns could be used to create pulsed implosions of ~1 Megabar peak pressure, allowing more access to chart this opening area of plasma physics

High velocity jets of controllable density and temperature allow astrophysical phenomena such as solar wind, galactic jets, solar events and astrophysical plasma to be partially simulated in the laboratory and measured directly, in addition to astronomic and satellite observations.

When discussing [[weapons in science fiction]], a '''plasma weapon''' is a type of [[raygun]] that fires a stream, bolt(s), pulse or [[toroid]] of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (i.e. very hot, very energetic excited matter). The primary damage mechanism of these fictional weapons is usually [[thermal transfer]]; it typically causes serious burns, and often immediate death of living creatures, and melts or evaporates other materials. In certain fiction, plasma weapons may also have a significant kinetic energy component, that is to say the ionized material is projected with sufficient momentum to cause some secondary impact damage in addition to causing high thermal damage. In some fictions, like Star Wars, plasma is highly effective against mechanical targets such as droids. The ionized gas disrupts their systems.

Fictional plasma weapons are often visually analogous to real-life [[plasma torches]] that cut into materials for industrial use purposes; however, said torches currently only produce a plasma jet of several inches at most.

Plasma weapons are often, especially in video games, depicted as very powerful, but short-ranged and/or less energy-efficient than other weapon types.

== Real-life devices ==
[[File:TorchCuttingCloseup.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close up of a [[Hypertherm]] HyPerformance plasma torch cutting metal.]]

Currently, there are several real tools that are somewhat related to fictional plasma weapons:
* The [[MARAUDER]] (''Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed-Energy and Radiation'') project.
* [[Plasma cutting|Plasma torches]], which have existed for some years, project [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] streams a [[Foot (length)|foot]] at most, and are used to cut metal and concrete.
* The [[Dense plasma focus|plasma gun]] as used in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]].
* [[Shiva Star]] is an attempt to make a real plasma-firing [[directed-energy weapon]] for use in space.
* Microscopic, very short plasma bursts from [[Nd:YAG laser]]s are used in medicine, most widely in [[ophthalmology]].
* There are several [[Tesla Coil]]-based devices ([http://www.rmcybernetics.com/projects/DIY_Devices/plasma-gun-2.htm DIY Plasma Gun] and [http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?140268 Arc Attack]) that produce electrical currents but only for entertainment and general interest.
* The [[Electrolaser]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">The '''Poynting effect''' may refer to two unrelated physical phenomena.  Neither should be confused with the [[Poynting–Robertson effect]].  All of these effects are named after [[John Henry Poynting]], an English physicist.

== Solid mechanics ==
In solid mechanics, the Poynting effect is a [[Finite strain theory|large strain]] effect observed when an elastic cube is sheared between two plates and stress is developed in the direction normal to the sheared faces, or when a cylinder is subjected to torsion and the axial length changes.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Truesdell, A programme of physical research in classical mechanics, Zeitschrift f¨ur Angewandte Mathematik und Physik 3 (1952) 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Janmey, M. E. McCormick, S. Rammensee, J. L. Leight, P. C. Georges, and F. C. MacKintosh, [http://www.nat.vu.nl/~fcm/Papers/NatMatSub2.pdf Negative normal stress in semiflexible biopolymer gels], Nature Materials 6 (2006) 48-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Mihai and A. Goriely, [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/467/2136/3633 Positive or negative Poynting effect? The role of adscititious inequalities in hyperelastic materials], Proceedings of the Royal Society A 467 (2011) 3633-3646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Mihai and A. Goriely,  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020746212001400 Numerical simulation of shear and the Poynting effects by the finite element method: An application of the generalised empirical inequalities in nonlinear elasticity], International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics 49 (2013) 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Poynting phenomenon in torsion was noticed experimentally by [[John Henry Poynting|J. H. Poynting]].&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Poynting, Radiation-pressure, ''Philosophical Magazine'' 9 (1905) 393-406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Poynting, [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/82/557/546.full.pdf+html On pressure perpendicular to the shear-planes in finite pure shears, and on the lengthening of loaded wires when twisted], Proceedings of the Royal Society A 82 (1909) 546-559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Poynting, The changes in length and volume of an Indian-rubber cord when twisted, ''India-Rubber Journal'', October 4 (1913) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemistry and thermodynamics ==
In thermodynamics, the Poynting effect generally refers to the change in the vapor pressure of a liquid when a non-condensable gas is mixed with the vapor at saturated conditions.  If one assumes that the vapor and the non-condensable gas behave as ideal gases and an ideal mixture, it can be shown that:&lt;ref&gt;Wark, Kenneth ''Advanced Thermodynamics for Engineers''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ln \frac{ p_v}{p_{v,o}}  = \frac{ v_{liq} }{ R T } ( P - p_{v,o} ) \!&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_v&lt;/math&gt; is the modified vapor pressure
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_{v,o}&lt;/math&gt; is the unmodified vapor pressure
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;v_{liq}&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid molar volume
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid/vapor's gas constant
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the total pressure (vapor pressure + non-condensable gas)

As a common example, the ability to combine [[nitrous oxide]] and [[oxygen]] at high [[pressure]] while remaining in the gaseous form is due to the Poynting effect.

[[Entonox]] is a 50:50 combination of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide and oxygen. This combination is useful because it can provide a sufficient concentration of nitrous oxide to provide analgesia (pain relief) in sufficient oxygen so that the risk of [[hypoxemia]] is eliminated. This makes it safe to use by para-medical staff such as [[ambulance officers]]. However the ability to combine these two gases at the temperature and pressure in the cylinder while remaining in the gaseous form is unexpected based on the known properties of the two gases.

The Poynting effect involves the dissolution of gaseous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when bubbled through liquid N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with vaporisation of the liquid to form a gaseous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9525">In [[mathematics]], a '''Priestley space''' is an [[partial order|ordered]] [[topological space]] with special properties. Priestley spaces are named after [[Hilary Priestley]] who introduced and investigated them.&lt;ref&gt;
Priestley, (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley spaces play a fundamental role in the study of [[distributive lattice]]s. In particular, there is a [[duality theory for distributive lattices|duality]] ("'''Priestley duality'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Order (journal)|Order]] | date=September 1991 | volume=8 | number=3 | pages=299–315 | title=Remarks on Priestley duality for distributive lattices | first1=R. | last1=Cignoli | first2=S. | last2=Lafalce | first3=A. | last3=Petrovich | doi=10.1007/BF00383451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) between the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of Priestley spaces and the category of bounded distributive lattices.&lt;ref&gt;
Cornish, (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A ''Priestley space'' is an ''ordered topological space'' {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, i. e. a set {{math|''X''}} equipped with a [[partial order]] {{math|&amp;le;}} and a [[topological space#Definition|topology]] {{math|''&amp;tau;''}}, satisfying 
the following two conditions:

# {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is [[Compact space|compact]].
# If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a [[clopen set|clopen]] [[up-set]] {{math|''U''}} of {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt;''U''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;notin; ''U''}}. (This condition is known as the ''Priestley separation axiom''.)

==Properties of Priestley spaces==
* Each Priestley space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. Indeed, given two points {{math|''x'',''y''}} of a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, if {{math|''x''&amp;ne; ''y''}}, then as {{math|&amp;le;}} is a partial order, either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\,\not\le\, x&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming, without loss of generality, that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt;, (ii) provides a clopen up-set {{math|''U''}} of {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''U''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;notin; ''U''}}. Therefore, {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}} are disjoint open subsets of {{math|''X''}} separating {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.
* Each Priestley space is also [[zero-dimensional]]; that is, each [[open neighborhood]] {{math|''U''}} of a point {{math|''x''}} of a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} contains a clopen neighborhood {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''x''}}. To see this, one proceeds as follows. For each {{math|''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}, either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\,\not\le\, x&lt;/math&gt;. By the Priestley separation axiom, there exists a clopen up-set or a clopen [[down-set]] containing {{math|''x''}} and missing {{math|''y''}}. Obviously the intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of {{math|''x''}} does not meet {{math|''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}. Therefore, as {{math|''X''}} is compact, there exists a finite intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of {{math|''x''}} missing {{math|''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}. This finite intersection is the desired clopen neighborhood {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''x''}} contained in {{math|''U''}}.

It follows that for each Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, the topological space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is a [[Stone space]]; that is, it is a compact Hausdorff zero-dimensional space.

Some further useful properties of Priestley spaces are listed below.

Let {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} be a Priestley space.

::(a) For each closed subset {{math|''F''}} of {{math|''X''}}, both {{math|&amp;uarr; ''F'' {{=}} {''x'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X''&amp;nbsp; :&amp;nbsp; ''y'' &amp;le; ''x'' for some ''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''F''} }} and {{math|&amp;darr; ''F'' {{=}} { ''x'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' &amp;nbsp; :&amp;nbsp; ''x'' &amp;le; ''y'' for some ''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''F''} }} are closed subsets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(b) Each open up-set of {{math|''X''}} is a union of clopen up-sets of {{math|''X''}} and each open down-set of {{math|''X''}} is a union of clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(c) Each closed up-set of {{math|''X''}} is an intersection of clopen up-sets of {{math|''X''}} and each closed down-set of {{math|''X''}} is an intersection of clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(d) Clopen up-sets and clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}} form a [[subbasis]] for {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}.

::(e) For each pair of closed subsets {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} of {{math|''X''}}, if {{math|&amp;uarr;''F'' &amp;cap; &amp;darr;''G'' {{=}} &amp;empty;}}, then there exists a clopen up-set {{math|''U''}} such that {{math|''F'' &amp;sube; ''U''}} and {{math|''U'' &amp;cap; ''G'' {{=}} &amp;empty;}}.

A '''Priestley morphism''' from a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} to another Priestley space {{math|(''X''&amp;prime;,''&amp;tau;''&amp;prime;,&amp;le;&amp;prime;)}} is a map {{math|f  :  ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X''&amp;prime;}} which is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] and [[order-preserving]].

Let '''Pries''' denote the category of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms.

==Connection with spectral spaces==
Priestley spaces are closely related to [[spectral space]]s. For a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the collection of all open up-sets of {{math|''X''}}. Similarly, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the collection of all open down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, then both {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)}} are spectral spaces.

Conversely, given a spectral space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the [[patch topology]] on {{math|''X''}}; that is, the topology generated by the subbasis consisting of compact open subsets of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} and their [[Complement (set theory)|complement]]s. Let also {{math|&amp;le;}} denote the [[specialization order]] of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is a spectral space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space.

In fact, this correspondence between Priestley spaces and spectral spaces is [[functorial]] and yields an [[isomorphism]] between '''Pries''' and the category '''Spec''' of spectral spaces and [[spectral space|spectral map]]s.

==Connection with bitopological spaces==
Priestley spaces are also closely related to [[bitopological space]]s.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a [[pairwise Stone space]]. Conversely, if {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a pairwise Stone space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, where {{math|''&amp;tau;''}} is the join of {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&amp;le;}} is the specialization order of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

The correspondence between Priestley spaces and pairwise Stone spaces is functorial and yields an isomorphism between the category '''Pries''' of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms and the category '''PStone''' of pairwise Stone spaces and [[bitopological space#Bi-continuity|bi-continuous map]]s.

Thus, one has the following isomorphisms of categories:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Spec}\cong \mathbf{Pries}\cong \mathbf{PStone}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

One of the main consequences of the [[duality theory for distributive lattices]] is that each of these categories is dually equivalent to the category of bounded [[distributive lattice]]s.

'''Red Leaf Resources, Inc''', is an [[oil-shale]] company based in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], United States. It is a developer of the [[shale oil extraction]] technology EcoShale In-Capsule Process. The company is affiliated with [[Questerre Energy]].&lt;ref name=reuters161211&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
In the Red Leaf Resources EcoShale In-Capsule Process a hot gas is generated by burning [[natural gas]] or pyrolysis gas.  Generated hot gas is then circulated through [[oil shale]] [[rubble]] using sets of parallel pipes.  The heat is transferred to the shale through the pipe walls rather than being injected directly into the rubble, thereby avoiding dilution of the product [[hydrocarbons]] with the heating gas.  The oil shale rubble is enclosed by a low-cost earthen impoundment structure to prevent environmental contamination and to provide easier and more rapid reclamation after the extraction process is finished.  Heat from the [[spent shale]] is recovered for enhancing the process's energy efficiency by passing cool gas through pipes and then using it for preheating adjacent capsules.&lt;ref name=DOE&gt;

'''Reverse leakage current''' in a [[semiconductor]] device is the [[Electric current|current]] from that semiconductor device when the device is [[P-n junction|reverse bias]]ed. 

When a [[semiconductor]] device is [[P-n junction|reverse bias]]ed it should not conduct any [[Electric current|current]], however, due to an increased barrier potential, the free electrons on the p side are dragged to the battery's positive terminal, while holes on the n side are dragged to the battery's negative terminal.
This produces a current of minority charge carriers and hence its magnitude is extremely small.
For constant temperatures, the reverse current is almost constant although the applied reverse voltage is increased up to a certain limit. Hence, it is also called reverse saturation current.

The term is particularly applicable to mostly semiconductor junctions, especially [[diode|diodes]] and [[thyristor|thyristors]].

{{DEFAULTSORT:Reverse Leakage Current}}
[[Category:Semiconductors]]

Reverse leakage current is also known as "zero gate voltage-drain current" with MOSFETs. The leakage current increased with temperature. As an example, the Fairchild Semiconductor FDV303N has a reverse leakage of up to 1 microamp at room temperature rising to 10 microamps with a junction temperature of 50 degrees Celsius.
For all basic purposes, leakage currents are very small, and, thus, are normally negligible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2323">'''Sludge incineration''' (German: Klärschlammverbrennung, Chinese: 污泥焚烧发电) is a [[sewage sludge treatment]] process using [[incineration]]. It generates [[thermal energy]] from [[sewage sludge]] produced in [[sewage treatment]] plants. The process is in operation in [[Germany]] where Klärschlammverbrennung GmbH in [[Hamburg]] incinerates 1.3m tonnes of [[sludge]] annually.

Sewage sludge can be incinerated in mono-incineration or co-inceneration plants. In co-inceneration, sewage sludge is not the only fuel and it can be processed at coal fired power plants, cement plants and in some waste incineration facility.&lt;ref name=":1&amp;quot;" /&gt;

{{Infobox strontium}}
'''Strontium''' is the [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Sr''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;38. An [[alkaline earth metal]], strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish [[metal]]lic element that is highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemically reactive]]. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, [[calcium]] and [[barium]]. It occurs naturally mainly in the [[minerals]] [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] and [[strontianite]], and is mostly mined from these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic [[strontium-90|&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]] [[isotope]] is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of [[nuclear fallout]], as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.

Both strontium and strontianite are named after [[Strontian]], a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by [[Adair Crawford]] and [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruickshank]]; it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson-red [[flame test]] color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by [[Humphry Davy]] using the then-newly discovered process of [[electrolysis]]. During the 19th century, Strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from [[sugar beet]] (see [[strontian process]]). At the peak of production of television [[cathode ray tubes]], as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/mineral-resource-month-strontium|title=Mineral Resource of the Month: Strontium|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|access-date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the replacement of cathode ray tubes with other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Strontium 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Oxidized [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendritic]] strontium]]
Strontium is a [[divalent]] silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and similar to those of its group neighbors [[calcium]] and [[barium]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood112&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 112–13&lt;/ref&gt; It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777&amp;nbsp;°C) and boiling (1655&amp;nbsp;°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842&amp;nbsp;°C and 1757&amp;nbsp;°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727&amp;nbsp;°C), but not in the boiling point (2170&amp;nbsp;°C). The density of strontium (2.64&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and barium (3.594&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;C. R. Hammond ''The elements'' (pp. 4–35) in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[Allotropy|allotropes]] of metallic strontium exist, with [[transition point]]s at 235 and 540&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&amp;pg=PA16| page = 16 | title = Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds | isbn = 978-0-444-59553-9 | author1 = Ropp | first1 = Richard C. | date = 31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=qJJrYnpT2pYC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117--&gt;

The [[standard electrode potential]] for the Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Sr couple is −2.89&amp;nbsp;V, approximately midway between those of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca (−2.84&amp;nbsp;V) and Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ba (−2.92&amp;nbsp;V) couples, and close to those of the neighboring [[alkali metal]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood111/&gt; Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce [[strontium hydroxide]] and [[hydrogen]] gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both [[strontium oxide]] and [[strontium nitride]], but since it does not react with [[nitrogen]] below 380&amp;nbsp;°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Besides the simple oxide SrO, the [[peroxide]] SrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow [[superoxide]] Sr(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strontium hydroxide]], Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; All four dihalides of strontium are known.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the large size of the heavy [[s-block]] elements, including strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 all the way to 22 or 24 in SrCd&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and SrZn&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;. The Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with [[denticity|polydentate]] [[macrocycle|macrocyclic]] ligands such as [[crown ether]]s: for example, while [[18-crown-6]] forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Organostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium–carbon bonds. They have been reported as intermediates in [[Barbier reaction|Barbier-type]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1246/bcsj.77.341| title = The Barbier-Type Alkylation of Aldehydes with Alkyl Halides in the Presence of Metallic Strontium| year = 2004| last1 = Miyoshi | first1 = N.| last2 = Kamiura | first2 = K.| last3 = Oka | first3 = H.| last4 = Kita | first4 = A.| last5 = Kuwata | first5 = R.| last6 = Ikehara | first6 = D.| last7 = Wada | first7 = M.| journal = Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan| volume = 77| issue = 2| page = 341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1246/cl.2005.760| title = The Chemistry of Alkylstrontium Halide Analogues: Barbier-type Alkylation of Imines with Alkyl Halides| year = 2005| last1 = Miyoshi | first1 = N.| last2 = Ikehara | first2 = D.| last3 = Kohno | first3 = T.| last4 = Matsui | first4 = A.| last5 = Wada | first5 = M.| journal = Chemistry Letters| volume = 34| issue = 6| page = 760 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/ejoc.200500484| title = The Chemistry of Alkylstrontium Halide Analogues, Part 2: Barbier-Type Dialkylation of Esters with Alkyl Halides| year = 2005| last1 = Miyoshi | first1 = N.| last2 = Matsuo | first2 = T.| last3 = Wada | first3 = M.| journal = European Journal of Organic Chemistry| volume = 2005| issue = 20| page = 4253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although strontium is in the same group as magnesium, and [[organomagnesium compound]]s are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organo[[europium]] or organo[[samarium]] compounds due to the similar [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of these elements (Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 118&amp;nbsp;pm; Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 117&amp;nbsp;pm; Sm&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 122&amp;nbsp;pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, strontium di[[cyclopentadienyl]], Sr(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with [[mercurocene]] or [[cyclopentadiene]] itself; replacing the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand with the bulkier C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its extreme reactivity with [[oxygen]] and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, such as in the minerals [[strontianite]] and [[celestine (mineral)|celestine]]. It is kept under a liquid [[hydrocarbon]] such as [[mineral oil]] or [[kerosene]] to prevent [[oxidation]]; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is [[pyrophoric]], meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in [[pyrotechnic]]s and in the production of [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent [[lanthanide]]s [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]], strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid [[ammonia]] to give a dark blue solution.&lt;ref name=Greenwood112/&gt;

===Isotopes===
Natural strontium is a mixture of four stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, &lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, and &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Sr.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Their abundance increases with increasing [[mass number]] and the heaviest, &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;[[rubidium|Rb]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Sr is [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]] to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Sr is [[electron emission]] to isotopes of [[yttrium]]. Of special note are [[strontium-89|&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]] and [[strontium-90|&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]]. The former has a half-life of 50.6&amp;nbsp;days and is used to treat [[bone cancer]] due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium.&lt;ref name="HalperinPerez2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halperin|first1=Edward C.|last2=Perez|first2=Carlos A.|last3=Brady|first3=Luther W.|title=Perez and Brady's principles and practice of radiation oncology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyeE6-aKnSYC&amp;pg=PA1997|accessdate=19 July 2011|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6369-1|pages=1997–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaumanCharette2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauman|first1=Glenn|last2=Charette|first2=Manya|last3=Reid|first3=Robert|last4=Sathya|first4=Jinka|title=Radiopharmaceuticals for the palliation of painful bone metastases – a systematic review|journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology|volume=75|issue=3|year=2005|pages=258.E1–258.E13|doi=10.1016/j.radonc.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr (half-life 28.90&amp;nbsp;years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear accidents]] due to its production as a [[fission product]].

==History==
[[Image:FlammenfärbungSr.png|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Flame test for strontium]]
Strontium is named after the Scottish village of [[Strontian]] (Gaelic ''Sròn an t-Sìthein''), where it was discovered in the ores of the lead mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Murray, W. H. |date=1977| title= The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland |location= London |publisher= Collins |isbn=0-00-211135-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named strontianite by [[Thomas Charles Hope]] the name was soon after shortened to strontium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.ed.ac.uk/about-us/history/professors/thomas-charles-hope&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Adair Crawford]], a physician engaged in the preparation of barium, and his colleague [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruickshank]], recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other "heavy spars" sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Adair | last = Crawford | date= 1790 | title = On the medicinal properties of the muriated barytes | journal = Medical Communications| volume =  2 | pages = 301–59 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bHI_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=P301}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 "...&amp;nbsp;it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined." The physician and mineral collector [[Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer]] analysed together with [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the [[witherite]] and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=gCY7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA433 | journal =Bergmännisches Journal | title = Über den Strontianit, ein Schottisches Foßil, das ebenfalls eine neue Grunderde zu enthalten scheint| last1 =Sulzer| first1 =Friedrich Gabriel | first2 = Johann Friedrich | last2 = Blumenbach| date =1791 | pages = 433–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 [[Thomas Charles Hope]], a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name   ''strontites''.&lt;ref&gt;Although Thomas C.

The element was eventually isolated by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in 1808 by the [[electrolysis]] of a mixture containing [[strontium chloride]] and [[mercuric oxide]], and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davy | first1 = H. | date = 1808 | title = Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | pages = 333–70 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to ''strontium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lochaber-news.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/2644/Strontian_gets_set_for_anniversary.html|author=Taylor, Stuart|title=Strontian gets set for anniversary|publisher=Lochaber News|date=19 June 2008|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113005443/http://www.lochaber-news.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/2644/Strontian_gets_set_for_anniversary.html|archivedate=13 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Weeks, Mary Elvira |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|title = The discovery of the elements: X.

The first large-scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from [[sugar beet]]. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by [[Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut]] in 1849&lt;ref name="Metalle in der Elektrochemie"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=xDkoAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=dubrunfaut+strontium&amp;dq=dubrunfaut+strontium| title =Metalle in der Elektrochemie | pages = 158–62 | author1 = Fachgruppe Geschichte Der Chemie, Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker | date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German [[sugar industry]] used the process well into the 20th century.

During atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]], it was observed that strontium-90 is one of the [[nuclear fission product]]s with a relative high yield.

Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.&lt;ref name="usgs10"&gt;{{cite web |publisher = United States Geological Survey |accessdate = 14 May 2010 |title = Mineral Commodity Summaries 2010: Strontium |first = Joyce A. |last = Ober |url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/strontium/mcs-2010-stron.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In groundwater strontium behaves chemically much like calcium. At intermediate to acidic [[pH]] Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the dominant strontium species. In the presence of calcium ions, strontium commonly forms [[Coprecipitation|coprecipitates]] with calcium minerals such as [[calcite]] and anhydrite at an increased pH. At intermediate to acidic pH, dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by [[Cation-exchange capacity|cation exchange]].&lt;ref name=Heuel-Fabianek&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Berichte des Forschungszentrums Jülich |volume=4375 |date=2014 |author=Heuel-Fabianek, B. |title= Partition Coefficients (Kd) for the Modelling of Transport Processes of Radionuclides in Groundwater | url = http://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/154001/files/FZJ-2014-03430.pdf |format=PDF| issn=0944-2952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three major producers of strontium as celestine as of 2015 are China (150,000&amp;nbsp;t), Spain (90,000&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton|t]]), and Mexico (70,000&amp;nbsp;t); Argentina (10,000&amp;nbsp;t) and Morocco (2,500&amp;nbsp;t) are smaller producers. Although strontium deposits occur widely in the United States, they have not been mined since 1959.&lt;ref name="usgs15"/&gt;

A large proportion of mined celestine (SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted to the carbonate by two processes. Either the celestine is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or the celestine is roasted with coal to form the sulfide. The second stage produces a dark-coloured material containing mostly [[strontium sulfide]]. This so-called "black ash" is dissolved in water and filtered. Strontium carbonate is precipitated from the strontium sulfide solution by introduction of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5smDPzkw0wEC&amp;pg=PA401 | title = Production of SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by black ash process: Determination of reductive roasting parameters| page = 401 | isbn = 978-90-5410-829-0 | author1 = Kemal | first1 = Mevlüt | last2 = Arslan | first2 = V. | last3 = Akar | first3 = A. | last4 = Canbazoglu | first4 = M. | date = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sulfate is [[Redox|reduced]] to the [[sulfide]] by the [[carbothermic reduction]]:
:SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 C   →   SrS  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
About 300,000 tons are processed in this way annually.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

The metal is produced commercially by reducing strontium [[oxide]] with [[aluminium]].  The strontium is [[distillation|distilled]] from the mixture.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Strontium metal can also be prepared on a small scale by [[electrolysis]] of a solution of [[strontium chloride]] in molten [[potassium chloride]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood111/&gt;

In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to the interaction of the X-rays with the glass.

Because strontium is so similar to calcium, it is incorporated in the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another.

The '''Alliance for Solar Choice''' ('''TASC''') leads [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop]] [[solar power]] advocacy efforts across the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]].

Founded by the largest rooftop solar energy companies in the United States of America, TASC represents the vast majority of the rooftop solar market. Its members include: [http://www.demeterpower.com Demeter Power Group], SunTime Energy, Geostellar, Inc., LGCY Power, [[Sunrun]], and [[Solar Universe]].&lt;ref name="TASC About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allianceforsolarchoice.com/about-us/|title=TASC About Us|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=allianceforsolarchoice.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103203631/http://allianceforsolarchoice.com/about-us/|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TASC member companies are responsible for thousands of jobs and hundreds of thousands of rooftop solar installations on homes, schools, businesses, and government buildings across the country.&lt;ref name="TASC About Us"/&gt; According to recent Center for American Progress (CAP) studies, rooftop solar systems are now seeing overwhelming adoption in middle-class neighborhoods with median incomes ranging from $40,000 to $90,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle Income Homeowners are a Driving Force|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2014/05/30/90652/release-middle-class-homeowners-are-a-major-force-in-driving-rooftop-solar-in-emerging-markets/|publisher=American Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2013/10/21/76013/solar-power-to-the-people-the-rise-of-rooftop-solar-among-the-middle-class/|title=Solar Power to the People|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=americanprogress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
=== EEI Publishes "Disruptive Challenges" ===
In January 2013, the utility trade association [[Edison Electric Institute]] (EEI) issued a report titled “Disruptive Challenges: Financial Implications and Strategic Responses to a Changing Retail Electric Business”.&lt;ref name="eei.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eei.org/ourissues/finance/documents/disruptivechallenges.pdf|title=Disruptive Challenges: Financial Implications and Strategic Responses to a Changing Retail Electric Business|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report describes the increasing popularity of consumer-driven rooftop solar, energy efficiency, and demand response as a “vicious cycle.” It details how utilities view rooftop solar as a “disruption” to their current business model, which guarantees utilities specific profit margins from large infrastructure projects funded by ratepayers.&lt;ref name="eei.org"/&gt; Peter Kind of Energy Infrastructure Advocates, the author of the report, makes recommendations on how electric utilities can defend against these ‘disruptive challenges.’ TASC and others in the solar industry have been working since 2013 to defend against utility attacks on core rooftop solar policies across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/climate-energy/solar-panels-could-destroy-u-s-utilities-according-to-u-s-utilities/|title=Solar Panels Could Destroy US Utilities According to US Utilities|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=grist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Targeted Attacks ===
A primary target of utility attacks is [[net energy metering]], or ‘NEM’. Net metering provides full retail credit to residents, businesses, schools, and other public agencies when their solar systems export surplus energy to the grid. The utility then sells this surplus energy to other customers nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allianceforsolarchoice.com/about-net-metering/|title=TASC About Net Metering|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=allianceforsolarchoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utility companies are attacking NEM to block the growth of rooftop solar, a strategy that has been highly publicized in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/17/nation/la-na-hawaii-solar-20121118|title=Hawaii's solar power flare-up: Too much of a good thing?|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=articles.latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/business/energy-environment/utilities-confront-fresh-threat-do-it-yourself-power.html?_r=0|title=On Rooftops, a Rival for Utilities|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another utility strategy is to introduce legislation to monopolize the rooftop solar market. In 2014, utilities in South Carolina and Washington pushed legislation with this intention. TASC successfully lead efforts to defeat both attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/big-utilities-pushing-booming-home-solar-market-112015170--finance.html|title=Big utilities pushing into booming home solar market|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=news.yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VOSTs, FITs and Their Weaknesses ===
Utilities also advocate for Value of Solar Tariffs (VOSTs) and Feed-in Tariffs (FITs). As revealed by national law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, VOSTs create hidden taxes for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabagoenergy.com/blog/files/tasc-arizona-tax-memo-on-fits.pdf|title=Tax Memo on FITs|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, VOSTs create annual market uncertainty that can hurt solar businesses, and they eliminate a customer’s right to actually use the power they generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/article/why-solar-net-metering-beats-a-value-of-solar-tariff-every-time/|title=Why solar net metering beats a value-of-solar tariff every time|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=grist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right to use the power produced from solar panels on-site is philosophically important for many solar customers. With VOSTs and FITs, utilities control a homeowner’s solar energy. The homeowner has to sell all of their solar power to the utility as it’s produced. They buy all of the electricity they consume from the utility. The utility determines the price the homeowner receives for the solar power, and the homeowner – as indicated by the Skadden tax memo from – could be required to pay taxes on these payments. The payment price fluctuates according to utility calculations, so it is unpredictable from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/03/29/value-solar-tariff-vost-formula-benefits-solar/|title=Is A Value Of Solar Tariff (VOST) Really Better Than Net Metering?|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=cleantechnica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barclays PLC Downgrade ===
Following the recent, concerted attacks from utilities, in May 2014, Barclays PLC downgraded the entire electric utility sector due to a confluence of declining cost trends in distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation and because residential-scale power storage is likely to disrupt the status quo. The Barclays report highlights that "regulators are ultimately answerable to voters, and the latter are unlikely to tolerate a long halt in their ability to access a clearly beneficial product." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/incomeinvesting/2014/05/23/barclays-downgrades-electric-utility-bonds-sees-viable-solar-competition/|title=Barclays Downgrades Electric Utility Bonds, Sees Viable Solar Competition|date=|accessdate=2015-02-03|publisher=blogs.barrons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''triple point''' of a substance is the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] at which the three [[Phase (matter)|phases]] ([[gas]], [[liquid]], and [[solid]]) of that substance coexist in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title=Triple point |file=T06502 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the triple point of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] occurs at a temperature of −38.83440&amp;nbsp;°C and a pressure of 0.2 [[Milli|m]][[Pascal (unit)|Pa]].

In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]. [[Helium-4]] is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases ([[lambda point]]).&lt;ref name=gold/&gt;

The triple point of [[water]] was used to define the [[kelvin]], the [[SI base unit|base unit]] of thermodynamic temperature in the [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/ Definition of the kelvin] at BIPM&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the triple point of water was fixed by definition, rather than measured, but that changed with the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units]]. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in the [[ITS-90]] international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K, 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C, or 32.018&amp;nbsp;°F).

The term "triple point" was coined in 1873 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], brother of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;James Thomson (1873) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044106377062;view=1up;seq=47 "A quantitative investigation of certain relations between the gaseous, the liquid, and the solid states of water-substance,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'', '''22''' :  27–36.  From a footnote on page 28:  " … the three curves would meet or cross each other in one point, which I have called the ''triple point''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triple point of water==

===Gas–liquid–solid triple point===
{{see also|Properties of water#Triple point}}
[[Image:Phase-diag2.svg|thumb|350px|A typical [[phase diagram]]. The solid green line applies to most substances; the dotted green line gives the anomalous behavior of water]]
The single combination of pressure and temperature at which liquid [[water]], solid [[ice]], and [[water vapor]] can coexist in a stable equilibrium occurs at exactly {{convert|273.1600|K|C F}}&lt;!--After the 2018 redefinition, the relative uncertainty of the triple point is 3.7e-7, which works out to 0.0001K, so 4 digits is appropriate--&gt; and a partial vapor pressure of {{convert|611.657|Pa|mbar atm}}.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/srd/upload/jpcrd477.pdf International Equations for the Pressure along the Melting and along the Sublimation Curve of Ordinary Water Substance] W. Wagner, A. Saul and A. Pruss (1994), J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, '''23''', 515.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1256/qj.04.94 | volume=131 | issue=608 | title=Review of the vapour pressures of ice and supercooled water for atmospheric applications | year=2005 | journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society | pages=1539–1565 | last1 = Murphy | first1 = D. M.| bibcode=2005QJRMS.131.1539M }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, it is possible to change all of the substance to ice, water, or vapor by making arbitrarily small changes in pressure and temperature. Even if the total pressure of a system is well above the triple point of water, provided that the [[partial pressure]] of the water vapor is 611.657&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|pascals]], then the system can still be brought to the triple point of water. Strictly speaking, the surfaces separating the different phases should also be perfectly flat, to negate the effects of surface tension.

The gas–liquid–solid triple point of water corresponds to the minimum pressure at which liquid water can exist. At pressures below the triple point (as in [[outer space]]), solid ice when heated at constant pressure is converted directly into water vapor in a process known as [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. Above the triple point, solid ice when heated at constant pressure first melts to form liquid water, and then evaporates or boils to form vapor at a higher temperature.

For most substances the gas–liquid–solid triple point is also the minimum temperature at which the liquid can exist. For water, however, this is not true because the melting point of ordinary ice decreases as a function of pressure, as shown by the dotted green line in the [[phase diagram]]. At temperatures just below the triple point, compression at constant temperature transforms water vapor first to solid and then to liquid (water ice has lower density than liquid water, so increasing pressure leads to a [[liquefaction]]).

The triple point pressure of water was used during the [[Mariner 9]] mission to [[Mars]] as a reference point to define "sea level". More recent missions use [[laser altimetry]] and gravity measurements instead of pressure to define elevation on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael H. |last=Carr |title=The Surface of Mars |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=5 |isbn=0-521-87201-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High pressure phases===
At high pressures, water has a complex [[phase diagram]] with 15 known [[Ice#Phases|phases of ice]] and several triple points including ten whose coordinates are shown in the diagram. For example, the triple point at 251 K (−22&amp;nbsp;°C) and 210 MPa (2070 atm) corresponds to the conditions for the coexistence of [[ice Ih]] (ordinary ice), [[ice III]] and liquid water, all at equilibrium. There are also triple points for the coexistence of three solid phases, for example [[ice II]], ice V and ice VI at 218 K (−55&amp;nbsp;°C) and 620 MPa (6120 atm).

For those high-pressure forms of ice which can exist in equilibrium with liquid, the diagram shows that melting points increase with pressure. At temperatures above {{val|273|u=K}} (0&amp;nbsp;°C), increasing the pressure on water vapor results first in liquid water and then a high-pressure form of ice. In the range {{val|251|-|273|u=K}}, ice I is formed first, followed by liquid water and then ice III or ice V, followed by other still denser high-pressure forms.

==Triple point cells==
Triple point cells are used in the [[calibration]] of [[thermometer]]s.  For exacting work, triple point cells are typically filled with a highly pure chemical substance such as hydrogen, argon, mercury, or water (depending on the desired temperature).  The purity of these substances can be such that only one part in a million is a contaminant, called "six nines" because it is 99.9999% pure.  When it is a water-based cell, a special [[isotope|isotopic]] composition called [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|VSMOW]] is used because it is very pure and produces temperatures that are more comparable from lab to lab.  Triple point cells are so effective at achieving highly precise, reproducible temperatures, an international calibration standard for thermometers called [[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS–90]] relies upon triple point cells of [[hydrogen]], [[neon]], [[oxygen]], [[argon]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[water (molecule)|water]] for delineating six of its defined temperature points.

==Table of triple points==
This table lists the gas–liquid–solid triple points of several substances. Unless otherwise noted, the data come from the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now [[NIST]], National Institute of Standards and Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yunus A. |last=Cengel |first2=Robert H. |last2=Turner |title=Fundamentals of thermal-fluid sciences |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2004 |page=78 |isbn=0-07-297675-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--a good alternate: File:SantralIstanbul turbine hall foto2.jpg--&gt;
The '''turbine hall''', '''generating hall''' or '''turbine building''' is a building or room in any steam cycle or hydroelectric [[power plant]] which houses a number of components vital to the generation of electricity from the steam that comes from the [[boiler]], or from the water coming from the reservoir.  The components in the turbine hall typically are the [[turbines]] and [[electric generators]], and in the case of steam cycle plants, [[moisture separators]] and [[reheaters]]. A turbine hall is typically extremely [[noise|loud]], and in the case of steam cycle plants, hot.

In nuclear power plants, [[boiling water reactor]]s present unique challenges since the steam going through the turbines may be [[radioactive]].  This means that the turbine hall has to be slightly [[containment building|contained]] and much unique maintenance must be performed. A typical plant will house one high-pressure turbine and two low-pressure turbines.

'''Verd antique''' (obsolete [[French language|French]], from [[Italian language|Italian]], ''verde antico'', "ancient green"), also called  '''verde antique''' or '''Ophite''', is a [[serpentinite]] [[breccia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert David Hager|Hager, Albert D.]] and Billings, E. ''Report on the Economical Geology, Physical Geography and Scenery of Vermont.'' Claremont, N.H.: Claremont Manufacturing Co., 1862, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; popular since ancient times as a decorative facing stone. It is a dark, dull green, white-mottled (or white-veined) [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], mixed with [[calcite]], [[dolomite]], or [[magnesite]], which takes a high polish.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, Walter. ''Gemstones of the World.'' Rev. and exp. 4th ed. New York: Sterling Publishing Company, 2009, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes classed, erroneously, as a variety of [[marble]] ("serpentine marble", "[[Connemara]] marble", "Moriah stone", etc.). It has also been called and marketed as "ophicalcite" or "ophite".&lt;ref&gt;Dedyne, Roger and Quintens, Ivo. ''Tables of Gemstone Identification.'' Gent, Belgium: Glirico, 2007, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-[[brecciated]] varieties of a very similar serpentinite, sometimes also called "verd antique", have been quarried at [[Victorville, California]];&lt;ref&gt;MacFall, Russell P. ''Gem Hunter's Guide.'' New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1975, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardiff, Maryland]];&lt;ref&gt;"Notes From the Stone Fields." ''Stone.'' 35:1 (January 1914), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rochester in [[Addison County, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock, Edward. ''Report on the Geology of Vermont: Descriptive, Theoretical, Economical, and Scenographical.'' Proctorsville, Vt.: Vermont State Legislature, 1861, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Verd antique is used like marble especially in interior decoration and occasionally as outdoor trim, although the masses are frequently jointed and often only small slabs can be secured. It was known to the ancient Romans and was quarried especially at [[Larissa|Casambala, near Larissa]], [[Thessaly]], in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;DeJongh, Brian; Gandon, John; and Graham-Bell, Geoffrey. ''The Companion Guide to Mainland Greece.'' Woodbridge, Conn.: Companion Guides, 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Verd antique was much used by the monumental builders of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and by the [[Ottomans]] after them. The term "verd antique" has been documented in English texts as early as 1745.

==In culture==
Verd antique is the national gemstone of Ireland, where it is referred to as Connemara marble. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.today.com/parents/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-ireland-461721&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3622">'''Wanda Jablonski''' (23 August 1920, in [[Czechoslovakia]] – 28 January 1992, in [[New York City]]) was an American journalist who covered the global [[petroleum]] industry.

She was the daughter of Polish petroleum geologist Eugene Jablonski, and was immersed in the oil industry throughout her childhood.  She was at [[St George's School, Harpenden]] in England until July 1937; she gained her school certificate and got the form prize in July 1938 before leaving to study in America.  She and her parents traveled widely, and although she became an American citizen, she developed great sympathy for other cultures – an attribute which as an adult enabled her to make deep contacts across the world oil industry, from the multinational oil companies to the leaders of oil-producing countries. She earned a B.A. from [[Cornell University]] in 1942 and an M.A. from the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] the following year.

Jablonski began as the oil editor at the ''[[Journal of Commerce]]'', where she made her mark  with a 1948 interview in [[Caracas]] with [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]], then the [[Venezuela]]n oil minister, which cleverly synthesized the developing nations' viewpoint, in those days rarely heard in the Western hemisphere. She moved to ''[[Petroleum Week]]'' journal in 1954 and cemented her reputation, speaking on equal terms with oil ministers and company chairmen. A rare woman in a man's world, she was known throughout the oil industry simply as "Wanda".

She is credited with arranging the 1959 Cairo meeting where [[Abdullah Tariki]], [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]], and other oil ministers of Middle East signed the "Gentleman’s Agreement," a precursor of [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), the international organization whose mission is to coordinate the policies of the oil-producing countries. In 1960, Jablonski reported to oil company executives that there was a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against "absentee landlordism" in the Middle East. "From offices in London, New York and Pittsburgh, top executives of oil companies were controlling destinies of Middle East oil-producing states."&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |title=[[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power]] |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|503}} Ignoring her warning, in August 1960 the major oil companies unilaterally reduced the prices that were used to calculate how much revenue the producing countries received. As a direct result, in September 1960, representatives from oil-producing countries met and formed OPEC.

She then founded ''[[Petroleum Intelligence Weekly]]'' in 1961, the journal which came to be known as "the bible of the oil industry", and ran it until 1988.

The '''Wiltshire Museum''', formerly known as '''Wiltshire Heritage Museum''' and '''Devizes Museum''', is a museum, archive and library and art gallery in [[Devizes]], [[Wiltshire]], England. The museum was established and is still run by, the [[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]] (WANHS), a registered charity founded in 1853.  After the purchase of an old grammar school the museum was opened in 1873.  Subsequently, it expanded into two [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] houses on either side and still occupies this location today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Wiltshire Museum|url=http://www.wiltshiremuseum.org.uk/about/|publisher=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum maintains a collection covering the [[archaeology]], [[art]], [[history]] and [[natural history]] of Wiltshire.  This collection covers periods of history from as far back as the [[Palaeolithic]] and also includes [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Saxon]], [[Mediaeval]] and more recent historical artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crooks|first1=Jill|title=Wiltshire museum bids to shed stuffy image|url=http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/news/headlines/4225172.Wiltshire_museum_bids_to_shed_stuffy_image/|website=This is Wiltshire|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prehistoric collections are items from the [[Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="collections"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Designated Collections 2008 |url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/resources/assets//D/designation_list_july08_13493.pdf |publisher=The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council |date=July 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of the collections have been [[Designation Scheme|designated]] as being a significant part of England’s [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref name="collections" /&gt;

One of the most important collections at the museum is the finds from [[Bush Barrow]], an early Bronze Age [[Tumulus|burial mound]] in Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The barrow was excavated by [[William Cunnington]] in 1808 and produced the richest and most important finds from a Bronze Age grave in the Stonehenge Landscape to date. The finds were acquired by the museum in 1883 and were displayed there until 1922 when they were indefinitely loaned to the [[British Museum]]. After a controversial [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] of the largest piece that may not reflect its original finish, the pieces were returned to Devizes in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caple|first1=Chris|author1-link=Chris Caple|title=Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415188814}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on display in the Gold from the Time of Stonehenge exhibition, opened in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stonehenge period gold on display at Wiltshire Heritage Museum|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-24519846|website=BBC News|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural history collection includes remains of a [[plesiosaur]] called [[Bathyspondylus]] found at [[Swindon]] in 1774. ''Bathyspondylus swindoniensis'' was first described in 1982 from the Museum's specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2010 the Museum ran a community bus service, the [http://www.stonehenge-avebury-bus.org.uk Henge Hopper], linking [[Avebury]] with [[Amesbury]] and [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bus from Avebury to Devizes circles historic sites|url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/towns/marlboroughheadlines/9009111.Bus_from_Avebury_to_Devizes_circles_historic_sites/|website=Gazette &amp; Herald|accessdate=20 October 2015|location=Marlborough|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
