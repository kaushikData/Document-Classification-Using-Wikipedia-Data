The '''1980 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] [[motor race]] held at [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]] on 18 May 1980. It was the sixth round of the [[1980 Formula One season]]. The race was the 38th [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. The race was held over 76 laps of the 3.34-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 254 kilometres.

It was won by [[Carlos Reutemann]] driving a [[Williams FW07B]]. The win was the Argentine Reutemann's tenth Formula One victory and his first since the [[1978 United States Grand Prix]]. He also became the fifth winner in six races of the 1980 season. Reutemann won by 1 minute and 13 seconds over French driver [[Jacques Laffite]] driving [[Ligier JS11/15]]. Third was Brazilian driver [[Nelson Piquet]] driving a [[Brabham BT49]]. Piquet's third place moved him past [[René Arnoux]] and [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] into the lead of the world championship for the first time.

The race however is remembered for a memorable and spectacular crash at the start of the race when [[Derek Daly]] collided with [[Bruno Giacomelli]]'s [[Alfa Romeo 179]], which sent Daly's [[Tyrrell 010]] flying over Giacomelli and landing between teammate [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] and [[Alain Prost]]'s [[McLaren M29]]. All four drivers were out on the spot, but none suffered any serious injury. [[Jan Lammers]] also collected damage in his [[ATS D4]] but was able to continue. The accident was particularly disappointing for McLaren after [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] failed to qualify for Monaco's shortened 20 car grid.

Fourth was West German driver [[Jochen Mass]] driving an [[Arrows A3]] one lap down on Reutemann ahead of Canadian [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in a [[Ferrari 312T5]]. A further lap down in sixth was dual-World Champion [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] in a [[Fittipaldi F7]]. For Mass and Fittipaldi it would be last world championship points they would collect.

Reutemann's win put [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in the lead of the constructor's points race by five points over Ligier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16462">[[Image:Niger river map.PNG|right|thumb|250px|The source of the Niger River and the location of Timbuktu weren't known to Europeans.]]

The '''Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa''' (commonly known as the '''African Association'''), founded in [[London]] on 9 June 1788,&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Cawthorn, ''The Modern Traveller Vol. II, Travels of Ledyard, Lucas, and Sonnini'', London: British Library, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] club dedicated to the exploration of [[West Africa]], with the mission of discovering the origin and course of the [[Niger River]] and the location of [[Timbuktu]], the "lost city" of gold. The formation of this group was effectively the "beginning of the age of [[European exploration of Africa|African exploration]]".&lt;ref&gt;Frank T. Kryza, ''The Race for Timbuktu: In Search of Africa’s City of Gold'', New York: HarperCollins, 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized by a dozen titled members of London’s upper-class establishment and led by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], the African Association felt that it was the great failing of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that, in a time when men could sail around the world, the [[geography]] of the [[Africa|Dark Continent]] remained almost entirely uncharted. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[List of topics related to ancient Rome|Romans]] knew more about the interior of [[Africa]] than did the British of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.12"&gt;Kryza p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by sincere desires for scientific knowledge and the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]], yet not averse to gaining opportunities for British [[commerce]], the wealthy members each pledged to contribute five [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] per year to recruiting and funding [[Exploration|expeditions]] from [[England]] to Africa.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.12"/&gt;

== Background and incentives ==

The [[Mali Empire]], from the 13th to 15th centuries, dominated the region which stretched from the [[West Africa]]n coast between the [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Sénégal River|Senegal]] rivers almost to [[Sokoto]] in the east, and from 150 miles north of Timbuktu to the headwaters of the Niger.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brent, ''Black Nile: Mungo Park and the Search for the Niger'', London: Gordon &amp; Cremonesi, 1977, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; From Timbuktu flowed exports of gold and [[Slavery|slaves]] in such quantities that the city took on the reputation in the outside world of possessing endless wealth. To [[Culture of Europe|Europeans]] fascinated by the discovery of new worlds, Timbuktu was too great a temptation to resist.

The Scotsman [[James Bruce]] had ventured to [[Ethiopia]] in 1769 and reached the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. His account of his travels provoked enthusiasm for further exploration into Africa by Europeans, and the men of the African Association were especially inspired in their own goals.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The location and course of the Niger River were almost completely unknown by Europeans in the 18th century, and most of their maps charting it were mere guesses.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson Nicol, "Mungo Park and the River Niger", ''African Affairs'' 55, no. 218, January 1956, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Abioseh Nicol|Davidson Nicol]],

{{quotation|''The most popular description from the 16th to 18th century was one in which the river rose from a lake near the [[Equator]] in the centre of Africa, the Lacus Niger. From this point it was supposed to flow northwards almost in a straight line to reach another large lake, the Lacus Bornu. Before reaching this, it was said to flow underground for a distance variously given as being between 18 and 60 miles. After Lake Bornu, it took a bend of 90 deg. and flowed westwards through another lake, Sigisma, or Guarde, to break eventually after another lake system into four rivers, amongst which were the Senegal and the Gambia, which all emptied into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] at the western-most point of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

Almost all the European theories of the river’s course hypothesized that it flowed east to west, which contradicted reality. Up to this point, no [[Western world|white man]] had ever seen the river itself.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.12"/&gt; In fact, many Europeans were not even convinced of its existence, though it had been well-known and well-traveled by [[Muslim]]s for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="Brent p.46"&gt;Brent p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Niger had long been the major highway of commerce between the kingdoms of Africa’s interior and traders from as far away as [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="Brent p.46"/&gt; and offered significant trade opportunities for Europe. According to Peter Brent’s ''Black Nile'',
 
{{quotation|''The state that controlled the Niger traffic controlled the flow of trade; with the western [[Sahara]] route disused, shipments loaded or unloaded at Timbuctu could be carried along the central and eastern desert routes connecting the Niger with the [[Mediterranean]] countries. Domination of the Niger clearly was worth fighting for….&lt;ref&gt;Brent p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

== The explorers and expeditions ==

===John Ledyard===
The first explorer recruited for travel to Africa was an [[United States|American]] named [[John Ledyard]]. He had traveled around the world with [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] and been acquainted with [[Thomas Jefferson]] before attempting a voyage across [[Russia]], [[Siberia]], and [[North America]]. Having failed to complete his journey, he called on Sir Joseph and the African Association, who thought him a perfect fit for their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After setting sail from England on 30 June 1788 he arrived in August at [[Cairo]]. While preparing for his westward journey inland in search of the Niger, however, he fell ill and, trying to relieve his "[[Bile|bilious]] complaint", inadvertently poisoned himself with a fatal dose of [[sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref name="Kryza p.16"&gt;Kryza p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simon Lucas===
While Ledyard was still traveling, the African Association had enlisted [[Simon Lucas]] to attempt a mission from the northern end of the continent, starting at [[Tripoli]]. He spoke fluent [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and, having spent time in [[Morocco]], was already friendly with the Tripolitanian ambassador.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.16"/&gt; After arriving in Tripoli in October 1788, Lucas found guides to take him across the [[Libyan Desert]] but their journey was continually delayed by [[ethnic conflict|tribal wars]] blocking the route. Soon his guides abandoned him, and he was forced to limp back to England. He had, however, acquired some valuable information about the southern Libyan region.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Beaufoy, the Association's recordkeeper, wrote down in the ''Proceedings'' of 1790 what little information had been gleaned from these two ill-fated journeys: that the [[Niger]] was reputed to be practically non-navigable, and what was known about [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] and the edges of the Sahara.&lt;ref&gt;Brent p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The club’s curiosity had been further stimulated and they quickly renewed their search for explorers.

===Daniel Houghton===
In autumn of 1790, an [[irish people|Irish]] major named [[Daniel Houghton]] was commissioned to proceed from the mouth of the river Gambia on Africa’s western coast, moving inland towards (hopefully) the Niger. He penetrated farther into Africa than any European before him.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.18"&gt;Kryza p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; From the highest navigable point on the Gambia he continued on foot northeast toward Bundu, where the local authorities delayed his passage. Houghton eventually made his way as far as the north Saharan village of Simbing, 160 miles north of the Niger and 500 miles short of Timbuktu, but in September 1791, he was lured into the desert, robbed, and killed.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.18"/&gt;

In May 1792 the African Association decided to capitalize on their discoveries and enlisted the support of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]]. They authorized their committee to make "whatever application to Government they may think advisable for rendering the late discoveries of Major Houghton effectually serviceable to the Commercial Interests of the [[British Empire|Empire]]." &lt;ref&gt;Brent p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; A British presence on the Gambia would "strengthen the bonds of trade", so they proposed to install James Willis as consul in [[Senegambia Confederation|Senegambia]]. He was to develop good relations with the king of [[Bambouk]] by a gift of muskets, thereby opening up communication between the Niger and the Gambia and make inroads for trade with all the "gold-rich lands of the interior which undoubtedly lined the Niger’s banks".&lt;ref&gt;Brent p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mungo Park===
[[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] country doctor, was to travel with Willis to Senegambia, but when Willis’ departure was held up by [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and logistical problems,&lt;ref&gt;Brent p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Park left England on the trade ship ''Endeavour'' and arrived on the Africa coast on June 4, 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Park followed Houghton’s route along the Gambia, and after surviving near-fatal encounters in Muslim territory he reached the land of the friendly [[Bambara people]], who helped guide him to the Niger. The doctor was the first European to lay eyes on the Niger and the first to record that it did in fact flow inland to the east. He vowed to follow the river until it led him to Timbuktu, but the intense heat and besetting of thieves stopped him, and he had to return to England. Upon his return he was an instant national hero, and membership in the African Association swelled dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mungo Park’s travels and discoveries had the greatest impact upon Western knowledge of the African continent to that point. Frank T. Kryza (''The Race for Timbuktu'', 2006), writes:

{{quotation|''News of Park’s accomplishments thrilled the African Association (and indeed all of England). He was the first white man to penetrate the forbidding interior of Africa for the sole purpose of finding out what lay there, and to come back alive. He invented a new and glorious calling, creating an adventurous species of hero: the lone, brave African explorer: the African traveler. This beau ideal soon captured the imagination, fed the fantasies, and filled the literature of Europe.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.20"&gt;Kryza p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

Park’s expedition lasted two and a half years, and he published the account of the mission in his book, ''[[Travels into the Interior Districts of Africa]]'' (1799), which was devoured by readers across Europe.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.20"/&gt; Park would take attempt a second expedition to find Timbuktu in 1805, but died before returning.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza pp. 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Niger had been found and its direction recorded, but its final termination had not been discovered. The "golden city" itself, was discovered by Park, but he died before he was able to share his discovery with the world and so it remained undiscovered.

===Friedrich Hornemann===
During Park’s first journey, Banks had recruited [[Friedrich Hornemann]] to make another trip to Africa. He left in summer of 1797 and planned to travel the Cairo path across the Sahara toward Timbuktu while disguised as a Muslim. After finally joining a caravan from Cairo in 1800, he was never heard from again. Nearly 20 years later other explorers learned that Hornemann had died of [[dysentery]] after apparently reaching the Niger.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza pp. 44-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johann Ludwig Burckhardt===
Refusing to give up their quest, the African Association sent out a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] explorer, [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] in 1809, tasking him to follow the same route from Cairo. Under orders to maintain a Muslim appearance, Burckhardt spent eight years traveling in [[Syria]], learning the language and customs while waiting for a caravan to form. Just as some [[Arab]] merchants were ready to depart for the interior in 1817, the perfectly disguised “Euro-Muslim” died of dysentery before leaving Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry Nicholls===
The most bizarre story of the African Association was that of Henry Nicholls in 1804. Kryza writes, "Having failed in assaults from the north (Tripoli), the east (Cairo), and the west (Gambia), the membership now proposed that an effort be made from the south. The site chosen from which to strike inland was a British [[trading post]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]".&lt;ref name="Kryza p.46"&gt;Kryza p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cruelest of ironies, the river mouth that emptied into the Gulf, from whence Nicholls was to set out in search of the Niger, was precisely the end of the Niger itself—only the Europeans did not know it yet. The starting point of the expedition was in fact its destination.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.46"/&gt; By 1805 Nicholls had died, probably of [[malaria]].

Meanwhile England was preoccupied with its [[Napoleonic Wars|rivalry]] with [[France]], and the government decided to take on a larger role in Africa’s exploration in order to establish a commercial dominance there before the French. Sir Joseph Banks was growing ill, and slowly the African Association’s influence began to diminish. "The torch was passed from the private to the public sector," though the Association continued its involvement in British exploration until it was absorbed by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1831.&lt;ref name="Kryza p.46"/&gt;

== The Influence ==
No explorer sent expressly by the African Association ever did find Timbuktu, though it was a major in the [[Royal African Corps]] named [[Alexander Gordon Laing]] who finally walked through its gates in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Kryza p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the Association’s recruits, however, accomplished much for European knowledge of Africa and its people. Peter Brent describes the common perception of Africa in the years preceding the African Association:

{{quotation|''Jungle, desert, mountain and savannah swam into one disagreeable continuity…all the peoples and sub-divisions of the peoples, all the cultures and languages and religions, were forced by the European imagination into [[Ethnic stereotype|one mould]]. Out of it stepped the “native,” the “savage,” offering the blood of sacrifice to grinning gods, dancing in lunatic abandon around flames and…making a meal of his enemies.&lt;ref name="Brent p.169"&gt;Brent p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

In contrast, according to Brent, "the explorers themselves had no such view of Africans, no simple picture that rejected African reality and denied to Africans their full humanity."&lt;ref name="Brent p.169"/&gt; Mungo Park’s description in particular contributed to a balanced perspective. George Shepperson writes that, beyond Park's romanticized travel exploits, "his writing indicated that Africans were human beings with their own [[culture]]s and commerce (and not monstrous creatures), with whom constructive relations would be possible."&lt;ref&gt;George Shepperson, "Mungo Park and the Scottish Contribution to Africa", ''African Affairs'' 70, no. 280, July 1971, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "humanizing" of the African people in the minds of Europeans was no doubt a boon to the abolition of the slave trade, since many of the African Association’s members were [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] and had ties to [[William Wilberforce]]. "By the beginning of the 19th century," Brent writes, "the attack on the whole appalling business had sharpened, and Africa had become the subject of the day. And still, despite everything, the European ignorance about most of the continent’s interior remained almost unaltered. It was a situation that had to be put right."&lt;ref&gt;Brent p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The relentless efforts of the African Association over forty-three years certainly contributed to this enlightenment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2918">[[File:LiMuri-pjt.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Circular graves of ''[[Necropolis of Li Muri|Li Muri]]'' at Arzachena]]

The '''Arzachena culture''' was a late [[Neolithic]] [[Pre-Nuragic Sardinia|pre-Nuragic]] culture occupying the northeastern part of [[Sardinia]] ([[Gallura]]) and part of [[southern Corsica]] from roughly the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] to the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Antona, ''Il complesso nuragico di Su Brandali e i monumenti archeologici di Santa Teresa di Gallura'', p. 13: Il sincronismo culturale e cronologico del megalitismo in Gallura e Corsica fa ipotizzare, con sufficienti margini di certezza, che proprio il braccio di mare delle Bocche di Bonifacio possa aver rappresentato un trait d’union fra le due isole, nell’ambito di attività di scambio delle quali il territorio teresino doveva essere attivamente partecipe.{{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from the Sardinian town of [[Arzachena]]. 

The Arzachena culture is best known for its [[megalithic]] structures, suchs as the characteristic "circular graves" and [[menhir]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2442140/PAGLIETTI_G._2009._Allorigine_del_megalitismo_nel_mediterraneo_occidentale_le_tombe_a_circolo_-_THE_ORIGINS_OF_MEGALITHISM_IN_THE_WEST_MEDITERRANEAN_AREA_THE_ENCIRCLED_TOMBS Giacomo Paglietti All’origine del megalitismo nell’occidente mediterraneo: le tombe a circolo]{{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas, L'alba dei Nuraghi (2005) p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Both the funerary architecture and the material culture show similarities with contemporary contexts of [[Catalonia]], [[Languedoc]], [[Provence]] and [[Corsica]].&lt;ref&gt;Paola Mancini, ''Gallura preistorica'', 2011 p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

Differently from the people of the contemporary [[Ozieri culture]] of the rest of Sardinia, the people of the Arzachena culture were organized in an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] and individualistic society focused on [[pastoralism]] rather than farming [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Lilliu2&gt;Giovanni Lilliu, La società in Sardegna nei secoli, Prima dei nuraghi, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic groups buried their dead in megalithic monuments in the shape of a circle, with a central chamber containing a single individual,&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Lilliu, La società in Sardegna nei secoli, Prima dei nuraghi, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; while on the rest of the island the Ozieri people buried their dead in collective [[hypogeum]] tombs called [[Domus de Janas]].&lt;ref name="Lilliu2"/&gt;

{{merge to|Asian Parliamentary Assembly|date=April 2018}}
The '''Association of Asian Parliaments for Peace''' ('''AAPP''') in [[Asia]] to promote [[peace]] in general and in the Asian region, in particular was established in September 1999 by Sheikh Hasina.

In 2006 it was transformed into '''Asian Parliamentary Assembly''' (APA) while broadening areas of cooperation toward [[regional integration]] with the long term perspective to eventually reach the status of an Asian common [[legislature|legislative mechanism]]. Unlike AAPP, members of the APA Plenary must be elected by members of member parliaments.{{Clarify|how are elected the AAPP members?|date=September 2010}}

==Membership==
[[File:Asia Parliamentary Assembly.png|thumb|right|334px|{{legend|#008000|member states}} {{legend|#00FF00|observer states}}]]

The APA comprises, in 2007, of 41 Member Parliaments and 17 observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianparl.net/members.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-24 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/615QTeigy?url=http://www.asianparl.net/members.html |archive-date=2011-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Tyndaris''' was a naval battle of the [[First Punic War]] that took place off Tyndaris (modern [[Tindari]]) in 257 BC. Tyndaris was a Sicilian town founded as a Greek colony in 396 BC located on the high ground overlooking the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] in the Gulf of Patti. [[Hiero II]], the tyrant of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], allowed Tyndaris to become a base for the [[Carthaginians]]. The battle took place in the waters between Tyndaris and the [[Aeolian Islands]], with [[Gaius Atilius Regulus]] in command of the Roman fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#25 1:25.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the town fell to [[Rome]].

==The battle==
Gaius Atilius Regulus' fleet was anchored off Tyndaris when he observed the Carthaginian fleet sailing past, without it being arranged in a tactical formation. He gave orders for the main body of his ships to follow the leading ships. He then took an advance guard of ten ships and sailed towards the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians noticed that the advance guard had managed to outdistance the main body of the Roman fleet and that other Romans were still boarding their ships. Taking the initiative, the Carthaginians turned and engaged the Roman squadron and sank nine Roman ships.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#25 1:25.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the rest of the Roman fleet arrived and formed a line. The Romans then engaged the Carthaginians, sinking eight and capturing ten of their ships. The remainder of the Carthaginian ships retreated the Aeolian Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#25 1:25.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

This naval engagement was followed by the [[battle of Cape Ecnomus]].

A '''Brixham trawler''' is a type of wooden, deep-sea [[fishing trawler]] first built in [[Brixham]] in Devon, England, in the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/12718.html|title=A Brixham trawler - National Maritime Museum|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum|Royal Museums Greenwich]]|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known for its high speed.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysailing.org/vessels/brixham-trawler/|title=Brixham deep sea trawlers|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was copied by [[boat builder]]s around Britain, and some were sold to fishermen in other countries on the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="TS" /&gt;

The Brixham trawler was a heavy displacement boat of some 60–80&amp;nbsp;ft length on the deck, with a long straight keel, a straight vertical stem, usually a fantail stern, and a low freeboard to ease the handling of the nets, though this feature was disguised by high bulwarks.&lt;ref name="Tiller Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchaj|first1=Czesław|title=Seaworthiness, the forgotten factor|date=1996|publisher=Tiller Press|location=St Michaels, MD|isbn=1-888671-09-2|page=18|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brixham trawlers carried a tall [[gaff rig]], often [[ketch|ketch rigged]] though also simply a large [[sloop]], that was powerful enough to carry them quickly to and from the fishing grounds and to tow large [[trawling|trawls.]]&lt;ref name="Brixham Trawlers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trinity Sailing Foundation|title=Brixham Trawlers|url=http://www.trinitysailing.org/vessels/brixham-trawler/|website=Trinity Sailing|publisher=rinity Sailing Foundation|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Renowned yacht aerodynamicist and sailor [[Czesław Marchaj|C. A. Marchaj]] commented on the type, "With little area of keel surface, these boats lacked weatherliness as compared with the [[Falmouth Quay Punt|Quay Punt]]… Not without reason, fishermen of the north-east coast swore that the forefoot took them to windward."&lt;ref name="Tiller Press"/&gt;

Brixham once had a fleet of 400 such vessels,&lt;ref name="KJH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjappeal.org/history.html|title=Kenya Jacaranda History|accessdate=7 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202015738/http://kjappeal.org/history.html|archivedate=2 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose distinctive red sails were coated with local [[red ochre]] for protection. Other fleets were at Lowestoft with 375 trawlers, 450 at Hull, 625 at Great Yarmouth and 840 at Grimsby, with smaller numbers at other places.&lt;ref name="Brixham Trawlers"/&gt;  Only five remain afloat. One of them, ''Provident (BM28)'', took part in the [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant]].&lt;ref name=List&gt;Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, ''List of vessels taking part''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rescue ==
On 1 January 1915 the crew of ''Provident BM291'' rescued 71 sailors from {{HMS|Formidable|1898|6}}, torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine in the English Channel during the night in a gale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warandsecurity.com/2015/02/03/the-sinking-of-hms-formidable-1-january-1915/|title=The Sinking of HMS Formidable 1 January 1915|last=|first=|date=|website=War and Security|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zealandia, topographic map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographic map of Zealandia showing the Campbell Plateau]]
The '''Campbell Plateau''' is a large [[oceanic plateau]] south of [[New Zealand]] and the [[Chatham Rise]]. It originated in the [[Gondwana]]n breakup and is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a largely submerged [[continent]]. The above sea level parts of the plateau&amp;nbsp;— the [[Bounty Islands]], [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]] and [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]]&amp;nbsp;— form part of the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]] which were declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="MichLesch-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaux|Leschen|2005|loc=Introduction, pp. 95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Large parts of the Campbell Plateau lie less than 1000&amp;nbsp;m below sea level.  It rises to 500&amp;nbsp;m at the Pukaki Rise and emerges above sea level at the Auckland and Campbell Islands.&lt;ref name="Grob-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grobys|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Davy|2009|loc=Introduction, pp. 213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering an area of {{Convert|800000|km2|abbr=on}}, the Campbell Plateau has a gently undulating bathymetry with major rises trending east-west: Campbell Island Rise, Pukaki Rise, and Bounty Island Ridge.  There are two near-parallel rises on the western margin: Stewart Island–Snare Island Rise and Auckland Island platform.  The continental slopes are steep on western and southern margins while the northern margin slowly falls into the Bounty Trough.&lt;ref name="Davey-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davey|Houtz|1977|loc=Introduction, pp. 61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The Campbell Plateau is a roughly triangular, [[craton]]ic [[microcontinent]] which formed during the break-up of Gondwana around 80&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Large parts of the plateau are made of [[Palaeozoic]] or older [[granite]]s overlain by much younger [[shield volcano]]es who form the Auckland and Campbell Islands.&lt;ref name="MichLesch-intro" /&gt;

The Campbell Plateau is made of continental crust, but, as such, is unusually thin.  The reason for this is debated, but there are two likely candidates: either an Early Cretaceous extensional events or the Late Cretaceous break-up between New Zealand and Antarctica.  Cretaceous [[Extensional tectonics|extension]] between the South Island and the Campbell Plateau created the [[Great South Basin]] in which 8&amp;nbsp;km of sediments have since accumulated.  The [[Bounty Trough]] was created during the same process.  The Campbell Plateau can have been affected by this extension or an earlier event.&lt;ref name="Grob-intro" /&gt;

The islands are composed of continental rocks.  The western islands, Auckland, Snares, and Stewart, have a 100–120&amp;nbsp;Ma-old Middle Cretaceous basement made of granites.  On Snares and Stewart islands schists of similar age suggest metamorphism ceased about this time.
The basement of Campbell Island and Fiordland are both made of Palaeozoic schists.
Bounty Islands are made of 189&amp;nbsp;Ma-old [[granodiorite]] and Precambrian-Cambrian [[greywacke]]s have been dredge near the island.
The Antipodes Islands, in contrast, are composed of Quaternary alkaline olivine basalts.
&lt;ref name="Davey-intro" /&gt;

Most plate-tectonic reconstructions place the Campbell Plateau together with the Lord Howe Rise, the Challenger Plateau, and the Ross Sea before the break-up of Gondwana.  These four structures have similar crustal thickness and underwent the same pre-break-up process of crustal thinning and underplating during the Early Cretaceous or Jurassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grobys|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Davy|2009|loc=Origin of CMAS and SMAS, pp. 223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The southern margin of the plateau was located next to the continental shelves of the eastern Ross Sea and Marie Byrd Land.&lt;ref name="Davey-intro" /&gt;

There are two systems of [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] on the Campbell Plateau: the Stokes Magnetic Anomaly System (SMAS) and the Campbell Magnetic Anomaly System (CMAS).  The origin and relationship of these anomalies remain unclear.&lt;ref name="Grob-intro" /&gt;

===Biogeology===
The islands are important breeding centres for both endemic and circumpolar species, including the [[royal albatross]], [[crested penguin]], and [[Hooker's sea lion]].&lt;ref name="MichLesch-intro" /&gt;

The southern part of [[South Island]] ([[Fiordland]], [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]) can be considered part of the Campbell Plateau, both biologically and geologically.  Endemic taxa include the spider genus ''[[Gohia]]'', the frog species ''[[Puhuruhuru patersoni]]'', and nine genera of beetles. The order [[Lepidoptera]] (moths and butterflies) also link the southern South Island to the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands.&lt;ref name="MichLesch-geography"&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaux|Leschen|2005|loc=Geographical limits of the Campbell Plateau, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macquarie Island]] is biologically but not geologically related to the Campbell Plateau.  The island is made of [[oceanic crust]] that formed at the [[Macquarie Triple Junction]].  This [[triple junction]] was originally located adjacent to the Campbell Plateau but is now isolated south of it due to sea floor spreading.  The plateau and the island share several endemic taxa, including six beetle species, a fly genus (''[[Schoenophilus]]'') and a vascular plant genus (''[[Pleurophyllum]]'').  Further support for this connection comes from the aralia genus ''[[Stilbocarpa]]'' and possibly the [[cormorant]].&lt;ref name="MichLesch-geography" /&gt;

==Oceanography==
South of the Campbell Plateau, the eastward-flowing [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC) is bounded by the [[Antarctic Convergence|Antarctic Polar Front]] (APF) and the [[Subantarctic Front]] (SAF).  It reaches New Zealand with an average volume of c. 130×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.  South of New Zealand it is partly deflected in the [[Tasman Sea]] as a broad, weak flow.  The main part of the ACC, however, passes around the [[Macquarie Ridge]] together with the SAF and then flows north along the eastern margin of the Campbell Plateau.  At 55°S and 50°S the ACC turns eastward again.  There is, however, a wind-driven [[Ekman transport]] of surface water across the Campbell Plateau.
At the [[Subtropical Convergence]] the [[Southland Current]] rounds the South Island and flows north-east along the island's east coast.  From there it entrains Subantarctic and subtropical waters across the north-western Campbell Plateau before branching over the Chatman Rise north of the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weaver|Carter|Neil|1998|loc=Circulation, p. 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UJSC-badge.jpg|thumb|UJSC badge]]The '''Congolese Socialist Youth Union''' ({{lang-fr|Union de la jeunesse socialiste congolaise}}, UJSC) was the youth wing of the [[Congolese Party of Labour]] (PCT). From 1969 to 1992, it played a major role in disciplining youth party activists and building up their character with [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideas.

UJSC members were generally seen as the future leaders of their country. Benefits of membership in the UJSC included government-sponsored scholarships, and a guaranteed position in the civil service upon completion of higher education studies. Since the PCT at that time was essentially socialist, a vast majority of UJSC members studied at universities in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Cuba. The UJSC lost prominence after the PCT lost power in the events of 1991&amp;ndash;1992.

Several officials in the current administration of the [[Republic of the Congo]] were members of the UJSC. Its most famous leader was [[Gabriel Oba-Apounou]].

{{History of the European Union}}
The '''flag of the [[Western European Union]]''' (WEU) was dark blue with a semicircle of ten yellow five pointed stars, broken at the top, with the organisation's initials in the centre. Although it is the flag of a military organisation, it has rarely been flown in military situations.

==Design==
[[File:Flag of the Assembly of the Western European Union.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Assembly of the Western European Union]]]]
The flag is dark blue with a semicircle of ten yellow five pointed stars, broken at the top, with the white letters WEU horizontally across the centre and UEO vertically across the centre sharing the letter E with the former set of initials. UEO is the [[French language|French]] abbreviations for Western European Union. The flag's blue colour with yellow stars is taken from the [[Flag of Europe|flag of the Council of Europe and European Union]], however the number of stars is ten due to the WEU membership being of that number.

==Use==
The flag was rarely used, with the WEU being largely dormant before it was succeeded by the [[European Union]]'s (EU) [[European Security and Defence Policy|military activities]]. It was once flown on board an operational [[United States Navy]] warship, the [[USS John Rodgers (DD-983)|USS ''John Rodgers'']], when it was used as the [[flagship]] of an [[Italy|Italian]] [[general]] (with a WEU crew) commanding WEU relief operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. There are variants for its bodies, such as its assembly, used on formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly-weu.org/en/presse/articles/2004/WEU29_1LuxWort_E.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206053228/http://www.assembly-weu.org/en/presse/articles/2004/WEU29_1LuxWort_E.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WEU treaty is now terminated, with WEU activities wound up by June 2011, so no further use of the flag is foreseeable.

==Previous design==
[[File:Flag of the Western European Union (1993-1995).svg|thumb|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] The 9-star design that was used between 1993 and 1995.]]
The current flag was in use only since 1993. Prior to that there was a similar design but with only nine stars (before [[Greece]] became a member) and the stars towards the base of the flag were progressively larger than those at the fringe. This design replaced [[Flag of the Western Union|the flag]] of the [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]], the organisation that was transformed into the WEU upon the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Brussels#Modification|Modified Brussels Treaty]].

'''Global strategy''' as defined in business terms is an organization's strategic guide to [[globalization]]. Such a connected world, allows a business’s revenue to not be to be confined by borders. A business can employ a global business strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inwhatlanguage.com/blog/global-business-strategy/|title=Why A Global Business Strategy Is Necessary For Global Domination!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reap the rewards of trading in a worldwide market. 

==Description==
A sound global strategy should address these questions: what must be (versus what is) the extent of market presence in the world's major markets? How to build the necessary global presence? What must be AND (versus what is) the optimal locations around the world for the various value chain activities? How to run global presence into a global competitive advantage? The “International” classification of a global business strategy is employed by companies who may sell in foreign markets, but their primary focus is on their home market. These companies may include international strategies in their business model to increase sales, but they know that their main target consumer is local.   &lt;ref&gt;Vijay Govindarajan and Anil K. Gupta 'The Quest for Global Dominance: Transforming Global Presence into Global Competitive Advantage' Jossey-Bass. (2008). p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
Academic research on global strategy came during the 1980s, including work by [[Michael Porter]] and Christopher Bartlett &amp; [[Sumantra Ghoshal]]. Among the forces perceived to bring about the globalization of competition were convergences in economic systems and technological change, especially in information technology, that facilitated and required the coordination of a multinational firm's strategy on a worldwide scale.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Porter (ed.) 'Competition in Global Industries' Harvard Business School Press. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher A 1989"&gt;Christopher A. Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal 'Managing across Borders: The Transnational Solution' Harvard Business School Press. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industries==
A global strategy may be appropriate in industries where firms are faced with strong pressures for cost reduction but with weak pressures for local responsiveness. Therefore, it allows these firms to sell a standardized product worldwide. However, [[fixed cost]]s ([[capital (economics)|capital]] equipment) are substantial. Nevertheless, these firms are able to take advantage of scale economies and [[experience curve effects]], because it is able to mass-produce a standard product, which can be exported (providing that demand is greater than the costs involved).

Global strategies require firms to tightly coordinate their product and pricing strategies across international markets and locations, and therefore firms that pursue a global strategy are typically highly centralized.&lt;ref name="Christopher A 1989"/&gt;

==Aspects==
A global strategy involves thinking in an integrated way about all aspects of business-its suppliers, production sites, markets, and competition. It involves assessing every product or service from the perspective of both domestic and international market standards. It means embedding international perspectives in product formulations at the point of design, not as afterthoughts. It means meeting world standards even before seeking world markets and being world class even in local markets. It means deepening the company's understanding of local and cultural differences in order to become truly global. &lt;ref&gt;Kanter, R. M., &amp; Dretler, T. D. (1998, November). "Global strategy" and its impact on local operations. The Academy of Management Executive, 12 (4), pp. 60-68. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IstanbulMemoriesOfACity.jpg|thumb|First edition]]

'''''Istanbul: Memories and the City''''' (''İstanbul: Hatıralar ve Şehir'')  is a largely autobiographical memoir by [[Orhan Pamuk]] that is deeply melancholic. It talks about the vast cultural change that has rocked [[Turkey]] – the unending battle between the modern and the receding past. It is also a eulogy to the lost joint family tradition. Most of all, it is a book about [[Bosphorus]] and [[Istanbul]]'s history with the strait. It was translated into English by [[Maureen Freely]] in 2005.

Pamuk wrote the book when he was on the verge of depression. In an interview he recalled: "My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t want to go into those details: divorce, father dying, professional problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book."&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;[http://www.wildriverreview.com/1/wnt2006-spotlight_pamuk.html Wild River Review - Volume 1 Number 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

His family was furious about their portrayal, especially his brother.&lt;ref name="wild"/&gt; Pamuk said that he lost him because of the book, and agreed that he may have hurt the feelings of his mother also.&lt;ref name="wild"/&gt;

The personal memories of the author are intertwined with literary essays about writers and artists who were connected in some way to Istanbul. A whole chapter is dedicated to [[Antoine Ignace Melling]], a 19th-century Western artist who made engravings about Constantinople. Pamuk's favourite Istanbuli writers, who meant inspiration for him and also became figures of his book, are [[Yahya Kemal Beyatlı]], [[Reşat Ekrem Koçu]], [[Abdülhak Şinasi Hisar]], [[Ahmet Rasim]] and [[Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar]]. His favourite Western travelogue writers play a similar role like [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Gustave Flaubert]].

The book is illustrated by the photographs of [[Ara Güler]], among other professional photographs, chosen by Pamuk because of the melancholic atmosphere of his pictures. Several pictures of Pamuk, alone or with members of his family, are also included.

[[File:Kurbits 1799.jpg|thumb|A painting with kurbits ornamentation, by Winter Carl Hansson from 1799]]
The '''kurbits''' is an invented, fantastical symbol of vegetal fertility based on a gourd or pumpkin of biblical legend, principally used for ornamentation in Swedish [[folk art]] and on painted furniture and domestic objects. Very popular between 1720 and 1870, particularly in Dalarna and southern Norrland, the paintings and murals have mostly biblical motifs, such as "The Triumphant Entry of the Queen of Sheba Into Jerusalem", and the people and buildings depicted are as was locally fashionable at the time of painting. They were done by itinerant painters, mainly from Dalarna, who specialized in the style and whose signatures are to be found in many localities.

[[File:Dalecarlian horse.jpg|thumb|A [[Dalecarlian horse]], from 1950, painted in the kurbits style]]
Today it is still used for decorating tourist memorabilia from Dalarna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7466">San Luis Obispo '''Mothers for Peace''' (SLOMFP) is a participant in the [[anti-nuclear movement in California]] which is depicted in the anti-nuclear documentary film [[Dark Circle (film)|Dark Circle]]  during the early years of protest opposing the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] (DCPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protest Diablo: Living and Dying Under the Shadow of a Nuclear Power Plant  - Living and Dying Under the Shadow of a Nuclear Power Plant|authors=Paul Wolff , Dianne Conn , Judith Evered|publisher=Createspace (12/05/2010)|isbn=1-4536-3619-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCPP was the first nuclear power plant to have its license suspended, which resulted from disclosure that they installed safety systems incorrectly. In ''Dark Circle,'' Mothers for Peace takes credit for delays which prevented the plant from going online prior to the discovery of the errors.

==Current activities==
Interest in issues with which SLOMFP contend have received considerable heightened public interest subsequent to the [[Fukushima nuclear accidents]]. With discovery of the [[Shoreline Fault]], SLOMFP has expressed heightened concern about [[Diablo Canyon earthquake vulnerability]]. The primary current roles of SLOMFP consists of a website, outreach efforts of Jane Swanson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcsb.org/interviews/jane-swanson-of-mothers-for-peace-an-interview-re-diablo-canyon |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927163046/http://www.kcsb.org/interviews/jane-swanson-of-mothers-for-peace-an-interview-re-diablo-canyon |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the current spokesperson, fundraising, and litigation. Discovery of a new earthquake fault near DCPP re-energized the anti-nuclear movement in San Luis Obispo county, and Swanson travelled to Santa Barbara and took part in a forum at the Faulkner Gallery of the Central Library on June 30, 2011. The meeting was attended by Supervisor Janet Wolf and co-hosted by the Nuclear Ages Peace Foundation and the Santa Barbara chapter of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. SLOMFP was traumatized by an alleged embezzlement of $31,000 by their former treasurer, who was prosecuted and appeared in SLO criminal court in November for pre-trial procedures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtimesslo.com/news/3887/ecoslo-exec-charged-with-embezzlement/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, and its history of civil disobedience, SLOMFP contends that it possesses security clearances such that the NRC should grant it access to information on terrorism vulnerabilities of DCPP with respect to nuclear spent fuel storage.&lt;ref&gt;In some contexts, the contention is that their attorney has top secret clearance, but there is no reliable substantiation of that claim. From the SLOMFP website: ''The NRC claimed that security considerations ruled out a hearing, even though at a closed hearing only those with the required security clearance would be present. MFP attorney Diane Curran has the necessary clearance''|http://mothersforpeace.org/newsAndEvents/20100518renewal.&lt;/ref&gt; Swanson frequently discusses various forms of vulnerability, specifically challenging the adequacy of the no-fly zone policies putatively in place over Diablo. For instance, in an interview with KCSB's radio journalist Cathy Murrillo, Swanson contends that according to the FAA it is not a no-fly zone but merely a pilot advisory not to loiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcsb.org/interviews/jane-swanson-of-mothers-for-peace-an-interview-re-diablo-canyon |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927163046/http://www.kcsb.org/interviews/jane-swanson-of-mothers-for-peace-an-interview-re-diablo-canyon |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently cites outside experts such as the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] or the [[National Academy of Science]].

==Litigation==
The SLOMFP commenced litigation of five contentions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2010/03/28/1083768/san-luis-obispo-mothers-for-peace.html#storylink=misearch&lt;/ref&gt; of which four were accepted to proceed. The litigation before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board has been placed on hold as of the Order of June 7, 2011. This delay has no bearing on the merits but has been proclaimed as a victory by anti-nuclear activists even though it had originally been requested by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2011/04/11/1558606/pge-asks-for-delay-in-license.html#storylink=mirelated&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary coordinator of the litigation is Elizabeth Apfelberg, who is also Treasurer, whom their website bills as a "lay attorney". Apfelberg has been with SLOMFP since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Murrillo interview, KCSB, prior to June 30, 2010 Faulkner appearance&lt;/ref&gt; They also employ attorney Diane Curran.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mothersforpeace.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723112526/http://www.mothersforpeace.org/ |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swanson was quoted by an environmentally oriented online journalist as summarizing their intent as follows: "Our goal, with the services of our attorney in Washington D.C., Diane Curran, is to ensure that safety issues pertaining to both the reactors and the radioactive wastes at Diablo Canyon are fully studied before the NRC considers PG&amp;E's application for license renewal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crisisjones.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/crisis-jones-special-report-spotlight-mothers-for-peace/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814022520/http://crisisjones.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/crisis-jones-special-report-spotlight-mothers-for-peace/ |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four contentions==
The SLOMFP litigation claims that:
 	
*PG&amp;E 's application lacks crucial information on the seismic risks to Diablo.
	
Seismic studies of the newly discovered fault are due to be done in 2013.
	 	
SLOMFP contends that those reports must be complete before any calls are made regarding earthquake risks.		
		
*PG&amp;E has an "adverse trend" of chronic errors in the management and cannot
	  	
identify and correct current problems, despite elaborate measures undertaken
	 	
by PG&amp;E as documented on public TV hearings at which SLOMFP members posed numerous questions.
	 	
SLOMFP claims that aging effects (corrosion, degradation) will defeat the engineers.
	  		 	
*PG&amp;E is not dealing with airborne environmental impacts of potential spent
	 	
fuel pool accidents, and is thus in violation of NEPA (the National Environmental Policy Act).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/02/15/08-75058.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nemanjina Street''' ({{lang-sr|Немањина улица}} / ''Nemanjina ulica'', {{lang-en|Nemanja Street}}) is a very important thoroughfare in downtown [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], in the [[Savski Venac]] municipality. After the completion of the construction of the Railway station in 1884, it became one of the city's main infrastructure links. The street got its name in 1896, when it was named after a Serbian ruler from the 12th century, [[Stefan Nemanja]].

== Location ==

[[Image:Central_bank,_Belgrade,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|200 px|The new headquarters of the [[National bank of Serbia]] in Nemanjina Street]]
The street stretches from the [[Slavija (Belgrade)|Slavija Square]], downhill to the [[Savamala]] neighborhood. It passes through the neighborhood of [[West Vračar]], next to the parks of [[Manjež]] and [[Park Gavrilo Princip]] and numerous administrative buildings including the government, ministries, army headquarters and hospitals. On the lower end it finishes at the [[Belgrade Main railway station]]. It crosses several other important city streets, like [[Kneza Miloša street]] and [[Balkanska street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Tamara Marinković-Radošević | title = Beograd - plan i vodič |date = 2007 |publisher = Geokarta | location = Belgrade |isbn = 86-459-0006-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Beograd - plan grada | date = 2006 | publisher = M@gic M@p | location = Smedrevska Palanka | isbn = 86-83501-53-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally, direction of the future street, due to its steepness, was a creek through which the pond on Slavija drained down into the [[Bara Venecija|Gypsy Pond]] in Savamala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Dragoljub Acković| title = Šest vekova Roma u Beograde – part XV, Veselje do kasno u noć | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = December 2008 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stream was named ''Vračarski potok''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Dragana Jokić Stamenković| title = Beograd na dvesta sputanih voda| newspaper = Politika | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 28 May 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/178840/Beograd-na-dvesta-sputanih-voda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005-06 reconstruction ===
In the winter of 2005, the reconstruction of the street began. It was one of the most important projects for the City of [[Belgrade]]. Not only did it have to close one of the most populous streets, but workers had to work at great speeds to complete the projects. It was an unprecedented case that such a massive work was done during the winter. The closing of the Nemanjina caused a major disturbance in the traffic, especially in the routes of the public transportation lines. After 5 months, when the project was finished in the spring of 2006, the new tram rails have been put in, the new pathways constructed, a new parking lot was opened in the street, and the drainage underneath the street was changed and modernized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Dejan Aleksić | title = Gunđalo se i kada su sređivane Nemanjina, „Gazela”... | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 18 September 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/389011/Gundalo-se-i-kada-su-sredivane-Nemanjina-Gazela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Nemanjina Street is located in one of the most important places in Belgrade. It connects Belgrade's main railway station with the popular Slavija Square. Many of the most important administrative buildings in Belgrade are located in Nemanjina Street. The [[Yugoslav Ministry of Defence building]] that was bombed in 1999 during the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], as well as the new building of the [[National Bank of Serbia]] are placed here. The building of [[Government of Serbia|Serbian Government]] in front of which Serbian prime minister [[Zoran Đinđić]] was [[Assassination of Zoran Đinđić|assassinated]] March 12, 2003 is also located in this street.

=== Monument to Stefan Nemanja ===
In December 2015, prime minister [[Aleksandar Vučić]] asked, as a "citizen", for a monument to Stefan Nemanja to be erected in the Manjež park, which is located at the central part of the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author = [[Tanjug]] | title = Vučić moli Beograd da podigne spomenik Stefanu Nemanji | trans-title = Vučić pleads the city of Belgrade to erect the monument to Stefan Nemanja | newspaper = [[N1 (television)|N1]] | language = Serbian | date = 17 December 2015 | url = http://rs.n1info.com/a118765/Vesti/Vucic-za-spomenik-Stefanu-Nemanji.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promptly, in less than two weeks, city hall voted to construct the monument and even formed a committee for this specific monument. Dedication was scheduled for 2016 or early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author = Tanjug | title = Stefan Nemanja dobija spomenik u parku Manjež | trans-title = Stefan Nemanja gets a monument in the Manjež park | newspaper = N1 | language = Serbian | date = 28 December 2015 | url = http://rs.n1info.com/a121840/Vesti/Stefan-Nemanja-dobija-spomenik-u-Beogradu.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 it was announced that the monument will be located {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} down the street, in the clearing in front of the demolished Yugoslav Ministry of Defense building. International design competition was also announced. In September 2017 city administration decided that the monument will be located at the lower ending section of the street, on the square of Savski Trg across the Main railway station which is envisioned as the future Museum of the [[Medieval Serbia]]. International design competition was finished only in March 2018 and the winner was Russian sculptor {{ill|Aleksandr Rukavishnikov|ru|Рукавишников, Александр Иулианович}}. The monument should be dedicated in the first half of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Spomen-obeležje Stefanu Nemanji radiće ruski vajar | trans-title = A memorial to Stefan Nemanja will be sculptured by the Russian sculptor | newspaper = Politika | page = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 17 March 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/400232/Spomen-obelezje-Stefanu-Nemanji-radice-ruski-vajar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Ninki Nanka''' is a legendary creature in [[West Africa]]n [[folklore]]. Descriptions of the creature vary, but most contend that the animal is [[reptile|reptilian]] and possibly [[dragon]]-like.

According to tradition, the Ninki Nanka lives in the swamps of West Africa. The animal is said to be extremely large and very dangerous. It is said that when children get too confident and feel they can disobey their parents and go into the swamp they will be taken by the Ninki Nanka. This creature's tales were never recorded in any sort of non-modern text but the story of it has spread from tribe to tribe all over Africa. There is a song called "Ninki Nanka" on the album ''Casamance au clair de lune'' (1984) by the Senegalese music group [[Touré Kunda]].

A group of "dragon hunters" from the [[Centre for Fortean Zoology]] (CFZ) went to [[Gambia]] in the summer of 2006 to investigate the Ninki Nanka and take testimony from those who have claimed to have seen the mythical creature. One interviewee who claimed to have had an encounter with a Ninki Nanka said it looked similar to an image of a [[Chinese dragon]]. The expedition, known as the "J. T. Downes Memorial Gambia Expedition 2006", received a fair amount of media attention, including coverage in a BBC Online article.

'''Orchestra Kristal''' (Bulgarian: оркестър Кристал) are a popular Bulgarian pop-folk or [[chalga]] band from [[Yambol]]. It is one of two bands, the other being the similarly named Orchestra Kristali from [[Mihailovgrad]], symbolizing the pop-folk genre in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Anne Buchanan ''Balkan Popular Culture and the Ottoman Ecumene: Music, Image, and Regional Political Discourse'' (Europea: Ethnomusicologies and Modernities) 2007  "1992-93, the genre referred to now (2005) as pop-folk or chalga by the Bulgarian public lacked a single label. A few friends in Sofia initially termed it kristal in relation to two popular bands: Orchestra Kristal, from Yambol, and Orchestra Kristali, based in Montana (formerly the city of Mihailovgrad). Orchestra Kristal' s director, Krasimir Hristov, produced every aspect of the band's recordings in his own studio, which may also account for how its name came to signify the genre (Dimov 1995 : 16). These two bands helped inspire the formation of myriad other groups whose recordings, like those of Kristal and Kristali themselves, incline toward a regionally amalgamated sound, thus defying easy categorization."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tijuana River''' ({{lang-es|'''Río Tijuana'''}}) is an [[intermittent river]],  120&amp;nbsp;mi (195&amp;nbsp;km) long, near the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of northern [[Baja California]] state in northwestern [[Mexico]] and [[Southern California]] in the western [[United States]].

==Location==

The Tijuana River drains an [[arid area]] along the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.—Mexico border]], flowing through Mexico for most its course then crossing the border into [[Southern California]] for its lower 5&amp;nbsp;mi (8&amp;nbsp;km) to empty into the ocean in an [[estuary]] on the southern edge of [[San Diego]].

The Tijuana River has two main [[tributary|tributaries]].  One, the Arroyo de Alamar or [[Rio Alamar]], runs in its upper reaches in the United States as [[Cottonwood Creek (San Diego County)|Cottonwood Creek]].  It runs from its source in the [[Laguna Mountains]] southwestward where it is impounded by two dams, [[Barrett Dam|Barrett]] and [[Morena Dam|Morena]], to supply water to the city of San Diego.  Cottonwood Creek is joined by the [[Tecate Creek]] before it enters Mexico where it is known as the Arroyo de Alamar from the point where it enters Mexico to its confluence with the larger tributary, the Arroyo de las Palmas, that forms the headwaters of the Tijuana River within the city.

The Arroyo de las Palmas, the main tributary of the Tijuana River, flows out of the mountains to the east into the reservoir behind the Abelardo L. Rodríguez Dam.  Downstream from the Rodríguez Dam, water flows through Tijuana in a concrete channel to the international border; there it continues west through the Tijuana River Valley for a distance of about nine miles to the estuary and then to the Pacific Ocean.

Its lower reaches provide the last undeveloped coast [[wetland]]s in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of [[Imperial Beach, California|Imperial Beach]].  The river has been the subject of great controversy in recent decades regarding [[pollution]], [[flood|flood control]], and U.S. border protection.

==Description==
[[Image:Tijuana river.jpg|thumb|left|Tijuana River seen from a pedestrian bridge in [[Tijuana]] (Mexico).]]
[[File:Tijuana River Estuary.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tijuana River Estuary]].]]
The Tijuana River rises in the [[Sierra de Juárez]] of northern Baja California, approximately 45&amp;nbsp;mi (70&amp;nbsp;km) ENE of [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]. It flows WNW through [[Tijuana]], crossing the border approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mi (8&amp;nbsp;km) from the Pacific. It flows west, just skirting the international border south of the San Ysidro section of San Diego. The lower 2&amp;nbsp;mi (3&amp;nbsp;km) of the river form the broad mud flat [[estuary]], and the [[Tijuana River Estuary]] is a rich habitat for wildlife, including over 370 species of birds;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=669 Parks.ca.gov: Tijuana Estuary]. accessed 6.16.2012&lt;/ref&gt; one of these species is the [[Ridgway's rail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Erik |date=7 September 2017 |title=Tijuana River Estuary Endures In Face Of Many Ecological Challenges |url=https://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/sep/07/tijuana-estuary-endures-face-many-ecological-chall/ |work=KPBS |location=San Diego |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Southern California]]'s largest coastal wetland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Zaragoza|title=San Ysidro and The Tijuana River Valley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhyaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4396-4592-5|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is naturally prone to flooding during heavy rains. The Tijuana River enters the Pacific 10&amp;nbsp;mi (15&amp;nbsp;km) south of downtown San Diego at the southern city limits of [[Imperial Beach, California|Imperial Beach]].

The river is an intermittent river, flowing naturally only during rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Troxel |first=Luan |date=21 February 2018 |title=Tijuana River Spill as Pump Station on Mexican Side Shut Down with no Prior Notification |url=https://coronadotimes.com/news/2018/02/21/tijuana-river-spill-pump-station-mexican-side-shut-down/ |work=Coronado Times |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|title=Proposed Construction, Operation, and Maintenance of Tactical Infrastructure, U.S. Border Patrol San Diego Sector: Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQgzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA321|year=2007|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is impounded in Mexico southeast of Tijuana by the Abelardo L. Rodríguez Dam for [[drinking water]] and [[irrigation]]. Former [[Baja California Governor]] [[Milton Castellanos Everardo]] constructed concrete barriers along the riverbank to prevent flooding during his tenure.&lt;ref name=mexicano&gt;{{cite news |first=Victor|last=Islas Parra |title=Murió ayer Milton Castellanos |url=http://www.el-mexicano.com.mx/informacion/noticias/1/3/estatal/2011/10/11/509326/murio-ayer-milton-castellanos.aspx |work=[[El Mexicano]] |publisher= |date=2011-10-11 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was supposed to build a complementary system of barriers to ensure flooding waters didn't flow back into Mexico, but instead adopted a dissipator flood control plan under the direction of the [[San Diego City Council]], supported by [[Environmental movement in the United States|ecologists]], which preserved the estuary, which was then designated a wildlife sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Herzog1990" /&gt;

The majority of its watershed is within Mexico, between [[Mesa de Otay]] to the east, and hills to the west.&lt;ref name="Herzog1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence A. Herzog|title=Where North Meets South: Cities, Space, and Politics on the United States-Mexico Border|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZrzy6F763QC&amp;pg=PA194|year=1990|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79053-7|page=194-201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
===Flooding===
Flooding in the Tijuana River had been a concern for both the United States and Mexico because it would lead to sewage runoff and would ultimately caused property damage to the surrounding area. In 1944, the United States-Mexico Water Treaty was signed, this dealt with "utilization of waters in the Colorado and Tijuana rivers and of the Rio Grande."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBWC Treaties|url=https://www.ibwc.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html|website=International Boundary and Water Commission|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty appointed the [[International Boundary and Water Commission]] to handle several issues such as border sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tijuana River Flood Control Project (TRFCP)|url=https://www.ibwc.gov/Mission_Operations/TJ_River_FCP.html|website=International Boundary and Water Commission|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBWC went on to create the Tijuana River Flood Control Project in 1966 in order to create a flood control channels along the river. Mexico had completely complied by 1976 while the U.S. implementation stalled due to opposition at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=William|title="Ecology and the Border: The Case of the Tijuana Flood Control Chan|journal=Environmental Problems Along the Bor|date=1979|issue=7|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite preventive measures, flooding in 1980 caused 11 deaths and property damage in bordering cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bath|first1=Richard|title=Resolving Water Disputes|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science|date=1981|volume=34|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding due to high rainfall and sewage blockage continues to be a concern that endangers surrounding areas because of the wastewater pollution found in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Debbi|title=Tijuana River reopened after blockage kills sharks, floods streets|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/whats-now/sdut-tijuana-river-mouth-dredged-after-blockage-2016apr12-story.html|publisher=The San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature reserves===
The [[Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve]] protects {{convert|2293|acre|ha}} and studies the [[Tijuana River Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://trnerr.org/ TRNERR — Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve] at the Tijuana Estuary. accessed 6.16.2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as part of the [[National Estuarine Research Reserve]] system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerrs.noaa.gov/Reserve.aspx?ResID=TJR National Estuarine Research Reserve System: Tijuana River]. accessed 6.16.2012&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve is managed in part as a Biological Field Station by the [[San Diego State University|San Diego State University (SDSU)]] [[San Diego State University College of Sciences|College of Sciences]], which also protects part of the estuary near the ocean within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fs.sdsu.edu/kf/reserves/trnerr/ SDSU Field Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608080208/http://fs.sdsu.edu/kf/reserves/trnerr/ |date=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge]] is part of the [[San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex]], and is also within the Estuarine Research Reserve. The Tijuana Slough Refuge protects one of southern California's largest remaining [[salt marsh]]es without a road or railroad [[trestle]] running through it. Designated as a Globally Important Bird Area by the [[American Bird Conservancy]], over 370 species of birds have been sighted on the refuge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/Refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=81681 Refuge profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
The river has been used as a wastewater conduit since at least the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=SDM2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herzog1990" /&gt; As such, the issue of sewage in the Tijuana River predates other news stories about the [[Mexico-United States border]] within the [[San Diego–Tijuana]] region by several decades.&lt;ref name="Herzog1990" /&gt;  Raw-sewage overflows on the Mexican side, from canyons along the river, are a recurring problem despite cross-border efforts to clean it up.&lt;ref name=SDM2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="TurtonHattingh2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony R.

'''Ugland House''' is a building located in [[George Town, Cayman Islands]]. Located at 121 South Church Street, the building is occupied by the [[law firm]] [[Maples and Calder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.maplesandcalder.com/locations/cayman-islands/ |title=Cayman Islands – Maples and Calder }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the [[registered office]] address for 20,000 entities, including many major investment funds, international joint ventures and capital market issuers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.uglandhouse.ky/overview.html | title = Ugland house explained | publisher=Maples and Calder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation by the U.S. government==

During his first presidential campaign, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] referred to Ugland House, raising questions over the number of companies with a registered office in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Tax spotlight worries Cayman Islands|newspaper=BBC News|date=31 March 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7972695.stm|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Offshore Haven Considers a Heresy: Taxation|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 October 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/business/globa/04cayman.html|accessdate = 15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

President Obama subsequently nominated [[Jack Lew]] to Treasury Secretary in 2013, despite objections that Mr. Lew had invested heavily in funds in Ugland House while he worked as an investment banker at Citigroup during the 2008 financial meltdown, with President Obama stating that he was not concerned about Mr. Lew's past financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=From the Citi to the Caymans|newspaper=WSJ News|date=12 February 2012 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323696404578298352191611608?mod=hp_opinion=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]], an independent body of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], investigated the nature of entities registered in the [[Cayman Islands]] and at Ugland House.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. GAO Report to Senate Finance Committee. [http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/locate?searched=1&amp;o=0&amp;order_by=rel&amp;search_type=publications&amp;keyword=cayman+islands “Cayman Islands: Business and Tax Advantages Attract U.S. Persons and Enforcement Challenges Exist.”]&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation involved reviews of documentation as well as interviews with officials from the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]], and the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes |url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency | publisher=OECD | accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO found that 5% of the entities with a registered office address at Ugland House are wholly owned by U.S. persons. Also, the GAO validated the reasons why the Cayman Islands has become a popular [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] for [[international finance]] and [[international business|business]], including the country’s reputation "as having a stable and internationally compliant legal and regulatory system." In an interview with the GAO, representatives from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) cited "the Cayman Islands’ reputation for regulatory sophistication" and "legal protections for creditors and investors" as factors that might attract legal financial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GAO 08-778: Cayman islands - Business and Tax Advantages Attract U.S. Persons and Enforcement Challenges Exist | url=https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-778 | publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office | accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the GAO report explained how U.S. government trade promotion agencies use the Cayman Islands and entities registered at Ugland House. The Export-Import Bank told the GAO that it has used the Cayman Islands to support the sale of [[aircraft]] manufactured in the [[United States]]. Between 2003 and the time of the GAO investigation, the Export-Import Bank had been involved in supporting 42 aircraft financing deals in the Cayman Islands. Also, officials from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), another U.S. government agency, told the GAO that "one-third to half of private-equity funds in which it has invested have been organized in the Cayman Islands." OPIC officials also said that "foreign investors in [[private equity fund|private-equity funds]] that they are involved with value the Cayman Islands' reputation for legal neutrality towards investors from different jurisdictions."

The Cayman Islands have worked to promote governance and regulation and have over the years collaborated with governments in the major economies to introduce tax information agreements such as FATCA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caymans &amp; Costa Rica Sign U.S. Tax Evasion Pact-FATCA Gets Even Fatter|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2013/11/29/caymans-costa-rica-sign-u-s-tax-evasion-pact-fatca-gets-even-fatter/|accessdate=20 June 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-operation agreements with securities regulators, aimed at promoting a transparent legal regime for global business.

'''Verve International''' is a Nigerian Pan-African and [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] financial technology and payment card brand owned by [[Interswitch]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venturesafrica.com/verve-microsoft-lumia-partner-on-mobile-payment-competition-nigeria/ |title=VERVE, MICROSOFT, LUMIA PARTNER ON MOBILE PAYMENT COMPETITION |publisher=Ventures Africa |author=Oluwaseun Oyeniyi |date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2008, as a subsidiary of [[Interswitch]]. In 2013, it became an autonomous business entity in a restructuring exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nigeriacommunicationsweek.com.ng/e-financial/interswitch-restructures-creates-2-divisions-for-regional-intl-growth |title=Interswitch Restructures, Creates 2 Divisions for Regional &amp; Intl.

In 2005 the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]]'s issued a mandate to the Nigerian payment industry that operators should migrate from magnetic strip to EMV chip and PIN platform by 2009. The CBN migration policy was adopted to phase out the magnetic strip when the technology became susceptible to fraudulent transactions. It initially issued six million cards in partnership with several Nigerian banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vrl-financial-news.com/cards--payments/cards-international/issues/ci-2009/ci427/nigeria-drives-african-card-gr.aspx |title=Nigeria Drives African Card Growth |publisher=Cards International |author=Victoria Conroy |date=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solawopo.blogspot.com.ng/2013/04/verve-making-of-glocal-payment-card.html |title=Verve: The Making of a Glocal Payment Card |publisher=Value-Conflict |author=Sola Fanawopo |date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeriacommunicationsweek.com.ng/e-business/verve-zap-otherstop-10-african-fin-service-tech-products-in-2009 |title=Verve, Zap, OthersTop 10 African Fin.

'''Vincenti Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri Vinċenti}}) is a [[tower]] in [[Mqabba]], [[Malta]]. It was built in 1726 by Fra Orfeo de Vincenzo, a Prior of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]]. It forms part of a countryside residence, which also includes a palace/farmhouse known as ''Ta' Torri Spero'', and a garden between the palace and the tower.&lt;ref name="southwestmalta"&gt;{{cite web|date=10 April 1996|first=Carmen|last=Lia|title=Imqabba: The Tower of Vincenti|url=http://southwestmalta.info/VillagesSub/villages/mqabba.html|website=southwestmalta.info|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621133002/http://southwestmalta.info/VillagesSub/villages/mqabba.html|archivedate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower was originally four stories high, with a balcony on its second floor, and it had a scarped base which made it somewhat similar to coastal watchtowers such as the [[De Redin towers]]. The tower had a coat of arms and a inscription commemorating its construction, but these are now lost.&lt;ref name="southwestmalta"/&gt;

On 2 June 1941, during [[World War II]], the British military requisitioned the tower from its owner Sir William John England, and used it as an Observation Post. It was prone to aerial bombardment due to its proximity to the [[RAF Luqa]] airfield. It was hit on 12 April 1942, and the bottom floor was damaged although the structure did not collapse.&lt;ref name="southwestmalta"/&gt;

However, the [[Royal Air Force]] later decided to pull down the tower since it was deemed dangerous to the nearby airfield. The upper sections were pulled down, but the scarped ground floor and part of the first floor were retained.&lt;ref name="southwestmalta"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1809">'''Álvaro X Nimi a Mvemba Água Rosada''' was a ruler of Kibangu and was the first Água Rosada [[List of Rulers of Kongo|claimant]] to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] during its [[Kongo Civil War|civil war]]. He ruled the Kingdom of Kibangu from 1688 to 1695.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaAngola.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule==

During the reign of the previous King of Kibangu, Álvaro and his brother led a faction that was unsatisfied by his rule. They managed to overthrow [[Manuel Afonso of Kibangu|Manuel I]] in 1688 and Álvaro took the throne. During his reign, the king was able to keep the forces of the other two claimants to the Kingdom of Kongo at bay. The king was the first civil war claimant to Kongo to be of the Água Rosada house where there was a parent from each of the main houses of [[Kinlaza]] and [[Kimpanzu]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706", page 20. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a real house at the time of Álvaro's rule, and was only after his death in 1695 when his successor, [[Pedro IV of Kongo|Pedro IV]] formed it as a house to end the civil war and reform the Kingdom of Kongo.
