'''''An Introduction to Zen Buddhism''''' is a 1934 book about [[Zen Buddhism]] by [[D.T. Suzuki|Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]]. First published in [[Kyoto]] by the [[Eastern Buddhist Society]], it was soon published in other nations and languages, with an added preface by [[Carl Jung]]. The book has come to be regarded as "one of the most influential books on Zen in the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Complete Book of Zen | author = Wong Kiew Kit | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8048-3441-5 | page = 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book grew out of Suzuki's 1914 publications for the Japanese journal ''New East''. Although the editor, Robertson Scott, suggested that Suzuki publish them in book form, he did not decide to do so until after the 1927 publication of his book ''Zen Essays'', which he decided would be "too heavy" as an introduction to Zen for beginners.&lt;ref name=Preface&gt;{{cite book | last = Suzuki | first = Daisetz Teitaro | publisher = Grove Press | year = 1991 | edition = reissue |title=An Introduction to Zen Buddhism |isbn=0-8021-3055-0 | page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzuki intended the resultant volume, 1934's ''An Introduction to Zen Buddhism'', to be used as a companion with the contemporaneously published ''Manual of Zen Buddhism''.&lt;ref name=Preface/&gt;

'''Avatar's Abode''' is a {{convert|99|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] about 115&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Brisbane]], Australia dedicated to [[Meher Baba]].

==Founding==
In 1956 Ena Lemmon sent Baba a formal invitation to visit Australia, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, (1986), p. 5087&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of establishing a place dedicated to Meher Baba in the warmer climate of Australia grew out of a letter from Meher Baba's sister and disciple, Mani Irani.&lt;ref&gt;Kerkhove, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1958, she wrote to the Australian group of followers, indicating that Meher Baba wished to give his [[Sahavas]] (company) in Australia at one place only, and that Baba would "like [[Queensland]] if the climate is good during June, and if the place is practical."&lt;ref&gt;"Mani S Irani, letter to Bill Le Page et al, 11 January 1958" Kerkhove, 2008 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, using money inherited from the Australian [[Sufism|Sufi]] leader [[Friedrich von Frankenberg|Baron Von Frankenburg]], Brabazon found and finalised the purchase of an eighty-two-acre pineapple farm on [[Kiels Mountain, Queensland|Kiels Mountain]], [[Woombye, Queensland]], after receiving Meher Babas' approval by telegram. Baba wrote on the telegram on 2 February 1958 'Place secured by you excellently suitable'.&lt;ref&gt;Le Page (1993) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brabazon (1990) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1958, [[Francis Brabazon]] and Bill Le Page, along with three paid workers from Queensland and with the help of several people from Sydney and Melbourne, worked hard (often in the rain) to have the site ready in time to welcome Baba.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, (1986), p. 5458&lt;/ref&gt; While he was there in 1958, Baba named the area Avatar's Abode and said it would become a place of world pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Grant (1986) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Avatar's Abode is one of three main centres set up worldwide, the other being [[Meher Spiritual Center]] and the ''[[Samadhi of Meher Baba|samadhi]]'' (tomb-shrine) in [[Meherabad]], India.

==Transition==

[[File:Meher Babas Bed.jpg|thumb|left|Meher Baba's bedroom at Avatars Abode]]

Brabazon lived in India for ten years with Meher Baba from 1959 to 1969; as a result he was released from the work associated with Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Brabazon (1990) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Baba told Brabazon to 'transfer Avatar's Abode to Bill Le Page who will, when the time is ripe, form a trust of which he will be chairman and turn the place over to it'.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, (1986), p. 6497&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francis Brabazon, Bill Le Page Meher Baba.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francis Brabazon]] being greeted by Meher Baba. Bill Le Page behind.]]

==Development==
Baba gave clear cut objectives to Le Page for Avatar's Abode's development, setting an objective of making Avatar's Abode universally known and one of the great places of pilgrimage in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, (1986), p. 6499&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, (1986), p. 5460&lt;/ref&gt; Baba was consulted about the legal structure and approved a [[Proprietary company|proprietary limited company]]; he also chose the name ''Meher Holdings'' and approved the directors, Brabazon and Le Page.&lt;ref&gt;Le Page (1993) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 significant numbers of the Baba community started a petition questioning Le Pages methods &lt;ref&gt;Le Page (1993) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of stalemate, a deal was brokered in 1984 by Eruch Jessawala and a new company "Avatar's Abode Pty. Ltd." was created to accommodate local concerns brought about by the petition. ''Meher Baba Foundation Australia'' functioned concurrently with the new company after discussions with Eruch Jessawala in India.&lt;ref&gt;Le Page (1993) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he was elected to the [[World Academy of Art and Science]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comillas.edu/en/comillas-news/507-noticias-home-a/6674-un-profesor-de-comillas-miembro-de-la-world-academy-of-arts-and-sciences-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldacademy.org/view/general_listing&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a member of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro-acad.eu/members?filter=b&amp;page=8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Carlos Blanco began to speak when he was seven months old and by age two he learned to read. At eight he started to learn ancient languages, studying on his own [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]. He attended local state school in Coslada, "C.P. [[Pablo Neruda]]". In 1997, when he was eleven years old, he was admitted to the ''Spanish Association of Egyptology''.

In May 1998, after getting the highest mark in the course on [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] offered by the Spanish Association of Egyptology, he was regarded as the youngest Egyptologist in Europe and the youngest hieroglyphs decipherer in the world by the Spanish newspaper [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], and by age 12 he was named honorary member of "Fundación Arqueológica Clos" ([[Barcelona]]), giving his first lectures at "Museo Egipcio" in Barcelona. He was also invited to visit Egypt by the Egyptian Government and he was awarded a scholarship to study [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at "Instituto Egipcio de Estudios Islámicos" (Madrid).

In 1999 he became popular in Spain for his interventions at ''Crónicas Marcianas'', one of the leading TV programs of the moment, where under the label of "superdotado" (in Spanish, name referring to highly gifted children) he spoke about science, philosophy, history and politics every week. He was invited for a second time to Egypt, where he was interviewed for "Good Evening, Egypt", and he went to Argentina, where he was interviewed by [[Samuel Gelblung|Samuel “Chiche” Gelblung]] in [[Buenos Aires]].

In 2000 he got a scholarship to study at [[Westminster School]], London, where he was interested in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. In 2001 he was given a grant to attend lessons at [[University of Navarra]] (Spain). He took three degrees ("licenciaturas") at the same time: Philosophy (M.A. 2006), Chemistry (M.Sc.2007) and Theology (M.A.2007), continuing his studies on Russian and Chinese.

Blanco has been a member of the ''International Association of Egyptologists'', "Sociedad Española Leibniz" and ''Asociación Española de Superdotados y con Talento''.

As of 2009, he studies as a Visiting Fellow in the Committee on the Study of Religion at [[Harvard University]]. As of 2011, he holds two doctorates: Philosophy and Theology. He is a faculty member of the Pontifical University of Comillas, a Jesuit institution in Madrid, where he teaches philosophy, and he is a founding member of [http://altius-society.com/index.php/web/consilium The Altius Society], a global association of young leaders which organizes an annual conference at Oxford University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21031">Compartments can be simply defined as separate, different, adjacent cell populations, which upon juxtaposition, create a lineage boundary.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.189 |vauthors=Irvine KD, Rauskolb C |title= Boundaries in development: formation and function. |journal= Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol |volume= 17 |pages= 189–214 |year= 2001 |pmid= 11687488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This boundary prevents [[Cell (biology)|cell movement]] from cells from different lineages across this barrier, restricting them to their '''compartment'''.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia-Bellido A, Ripoll P, Morata G|authorlink3=Ginés Morata |title= Developmental compartmentalisation of the wing disk of Drosophila. |journal= Nat New Biol |volume= 245 |pages= 251–3 |year= 1973 |pmid= 4518369 | issue=147 |doi=10.1038/newbio245251a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subdivisions are established by [[Morphogen|morphogen gradients]] and maintained by local [[cell-cell interaction]]s, providing functional units with domains of different [[Regulator gene|regulatory genes]], which give rise to distinct [[Cell fate determination|fates]].&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt;
Compartment boundaries are found across [[species]]. In the [[rhombencephalon|hindbrain]] of [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]s, [[Rhombomere|rhobomeres]] are compartments of common lineage &lt;ref name="Lumsden"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0166-2236(90)90144-Y |author= Lumsden A. |title= The cellular basis of segmentation in the developing hindbrain. |journal= Trends Neurosci |volume= 13 |pages= 329–35 |year= 1990 |pmid= 1699318 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by expression of [[Hox gene]]s.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/344431a0 |vauthors=Fraser S, Keynes R, Lumsden A |title= Segmentation in the chick embryo hindbrain is defined by cell lineage restrictions. |journal= Nature |volume= 344 |pages= 431–5 |year= 1990 |pmid= 2320110 | issue=6265|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..431F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[invertebrate]]s, the wing [[imaginal disc]] of ''[[Drosophila]]'' provides an excellent model for the study of compartments. Although other [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], such as the abdomen,&lt;ref name="Dahmann"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01774-6 |vauthors=Dahmann C, Basler K |title= Compartment boundaries: at the edge of development. |journal= Trends Genet. |volume= 15 |pages= 320–6 |year= 1999 |pmid= 10431194 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even other imaginal discs are compartmentalized, much of our understanding of key concepts and [[Molecular biology|molecular mechanisms]] involved in compartment boundaries has been derived from experimentation in the wing disc of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].

== Function ==

By separating different cell populations, the [[Cell fate determination|fate]] of these compartments are highly organized and regulated.&lt;ref name="Vincent Irons"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vincent JP, Irons D |title= Developmental biology: tension at the border. |journal= Curr Biol |volume= 19 |pages= 1028–30 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19948137 | issue=22 |doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2009.10.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this separation creates a region of specialized cells close to the boundary,&lt;ref name="Blair SS"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/bies.950170406 |author= Blair SS. |title= Compartments and appendage development in Drosophila. |journal= BioEssays |volume= 17 |pages= 299–309 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7741723 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as a signaling center for the [[Pattern formation|patterning]], polarizing and [[Cell growth|proliferation]] &lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81297-0 |vauthors=Lawrence PA, Struhl G |title= Morphogens, compartments, and pattern: lessons from drosophila?. |journal= Cell |volume= 85 |pages= 951–61 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8674123 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the entire disc. Compartment boundaries establish these organizing centers &lt;ref name="Dahmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair SS"/&gt; by providing the source of [[morphogen]]s &lt;ref name="Meinhardt H"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Meinhardt H. |title= A boundary model for pattern formation in vertebrate limbs. |journal= J Embryol Exp Morphol |volume= 76 |pages= 115–37 |year= 1983 |pmid= 6631316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are responsible for the positional information required for [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].&lt;ref name="Meinhardt H"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meinhardt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0012-1606(83)90175-6 |author= Meinhardt H. |title= Cell determination boundaries as organizing regions for secondary embryonic fields. |journal= Dev Biol |volume= 96 |pages= 375–85 |year= 1983 |pmid= 6832478 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inability of cell competition to occur across the boundary, indicates that each compartment serves as an autonomous unit of [[Cell growth|growth]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0012-1606(81)90261-X |vauthors=Simpson P, Morata G|authorlink2=Ginés Morata |title= Differential mitotic rates and patterns of growth in compartments in the Drosophila wing. |journal= Dev Biol |volume= 85 |pages= 299–308 |year= 1981 |pmid= 7262460 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in growth rates and [[Pattern formation|patterns]] in each compartment, maintain the two lineages separated &lt;ref name="Morata"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/255614a0 |vauthors=Morata G, Lawrence PA|authorlink1=Ginés Morata|authorlink2=Peter Anthony Lawrence |title= Control of compartment development by the engrailed gene in Drosophila. |journal= Nature |volume= 255 |pages= 614–7 |year= 1975 |pmid= 1134551 | issue=5510 |bibcode=1975Natur.255..614M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each control the precise size of the imaginal discs.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blair SS, Ralston A |title= Smoothened-mediated Hedgehog signalling is required for the maintenance of the anterior-posterior lineage restriction in the developing wing of Drosophila. |journal= Development |volume= 124 |pages= 4053–63 |year= 1997 |pmid= 9374402 | issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cell Separation ==

These two cell populations are kept separate by a mechanism of cell segregation linked to the [[Heredity|heritable expression]] of a [[Homeotic selector gene|selector gene]].&lt;ref name="Blair SS"/&gt; A selector gene is one that is expressed in one group of cells but not the other,&lt;ref name="Dahmann"/&gt; giving the founder cells and their descendants different instructions.&lt;ref name="Morata"/&gt; Eventually these selector genes become fixed in either an expressed or unexpressed state and are stably [[Heredity|inherited]] to the descendants,&lt;ref name="Dahmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt; specifying the identity of the compartment and preventing these genetically different cell populations from intermixing.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt; Therefore, these selector genes are key for the formation and maintenance of lineage compartments.&lt;ref name="García-Bellido A"&gt;{{cite journal |author= García-Bellido A.|authorlink=Antonio Garcia-Bellido |title= Genetic control of wing disc development in Drosophila. |journal= Ciba Found Symp |volume= 0 |pages= 161–82 |year= 1975 |pmid= 1039909 | issue=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central Dogma ==

The difference in selector gene activity not only establishes two compartments, but also leads to the formation of a boundary between these two that serves as a source of [[Morphogen|morphogen gradients]]. In the central dogma of compartments, first, morphogen gradients position founder compartment cells.&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt; Then, active/inactive [[Homeotic selector gene|selector genes]] give a unique genetic identity to cells within a compartment, instructing their [[Cell fate determination|fate]] and their interactions with the neighboring compartment.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="García-Bellido A"/&gt; Finally, border cells, established by [[Signal transduction|short-range signaling]] from one compartment to its neighboring compartment &lt;ref name="Basler"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/368208a0 |vauthors=Basler K, Struhl G |title= Compartment boundaries and the control of Drosophila limb pattern by hedgehog protein |journal= Nature |volume= 368 |pages= 208–14 |year= 1994 |pmid= 8145818 | issue=6468|bibcode = 1994Natur.368..208B }}&lt;/ref&gt; emit [[Signal transduction|long-range signals]] that spread to both compartments to regulate the [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Pattern formation|pattering]] of the entire [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zecca"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zecca M, Basler K, Struhl G |title= Sequential organizing activities of engrailed, hedgehog and decapentaplegic in the Drosophila wing |journal= Development |volume= 121 |pages= 2265–78 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7671794 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A/P Boundary ==

In 1970, by means of [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]] analysis, the Anterior-Posterior boundary was identified.&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; The founder cells, found at the border between [[Drosophila embryogenesis|parasegments 4 and 5 of embryo]], are already determined at the early [[Blastoderm|blastoderm stage]] and defined into the two populations they will generate by stripes of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed gene]].&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vincent"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vincent JP.. |title= Compartment boundaries: where, why and how? |journal= Int J Dev Biol |volume= 42 |pages= 311–5 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9654014 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Homeotic selector gene|selector gene]], [[Engrailed (gene)|''engrailed (en)'']], is a key [[Cell fate determination|determinant]] in boundary formation between the [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior and posterior]] compartments.&lt;ref name="Morata"/&gt; As the wing [[imaginal disc]] expands, posterior, but not anterior cells will express engrailed and maintain this expression state as they expand and form the disc.&lt;ref name="Vincent"/&gt; Engrailed mutant [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of posterior origin will gain anterior affinity and move towards the anterior compartment and intermix with those cells. Within the posterior compartment these clones will sort out and form an [[Ectopic expression|ectopic]]border where they meet other posterior cells.&lt;ref name="Morata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zecca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabata"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabata T, Schwartz C, Gustavson E, Ali Z, Kornberg TB |title= Creating a Drosophila wing de novo, the role of engrailed, and the compartment border hypothesis |journal= Development |volume= 121 |pages= 3359–69 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7588069 | issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a clone of anterior cells expressing engrailed will gain posterior identity and create an ectopic boundary where the clone meets other anterior cells in this compartment.&lt;ref name="Zecca"/&gt;
In addition,to its cell autonomous role in [[Regional specification|specifying]] posterior compartment identity, ''engrailed'' also has a non-cell autonomous function in the general growth and patterning of the wing disc, through the activation of signaling pathways such as [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hedgehog]] (Hh) and [[Decapentaplegic]] (Dpp).&lt;ref name="Tabata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guillén"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guillén I, Mullor JL, Capdevila J, Sánchez-Herrero E, Morata G, Guerrero|authorlink5=Ginés Morata  |title= The function of engrailed and the specification of Drosophila wing pattern |journal= Development |volume= 121 |pages= 3447–56 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7588077 | issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabata T"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0092-8674(94)90175-9 |vauthors=Tabata T, Kornberg TB |title= Hedgehog is a signaling protein with a key role in patterning Drosophila imaginal discs |journal= Cell |volume= 76 |pages= 89–102 |year= 1994 |pmid= 8287482 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of engrailed in the posterior cells leads to the secretion of the short-range inducer Hh &lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt; which can cross over to the anterior compartment to activate the long-range morphogen, Dpp.&lt;ref name="Basler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zecca"/&gt; Cells in the posterior compartment produce Hh, but only anterior cells can transduce the signal.&lt;ref name="Vincent Irons"/&gt;
[[Decapentaplegic|''Optomotor-blind]] (omb)'' is involved in the transcriptional response of Dpp, which is only required in the anterior cells to interpret Hh signaling for boundary formation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.033 |vauthors=Shen J, Dahmann C |title= The role of Dpp signaling in maintaining the Drosophila anteroposterior compartment boundary |journal= Dev Biol |volume= 279 |pages= 31–43 |year= 2005 |pmid= 15708556 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, [[Ci protein|Cubitus interruptus]] ''(Ci)'', the [[Signal transduction|signal transducer]] of the Hh signal, is expressed throughout the anterior compartment, particularly in anterior border cells.&lt;ref name="Tabata"/&gt; In posterior cells engrailed  prevents the expression of ''Ci'', such it is only expressed in anterior cells and hence only these cells can respond to Hh signaling by up-regulating the expression of ''dpp''.&lt;ref name="Basler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Végh"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Végh M, Basler K |title= A genetic screen for hedgehog targets involved in the maintenance of the Drosophila anteroposterior compartment boundary |journal= Genetics |volume= 163 |pages= 1427–38 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12702686| issue=4 |pmc= 1462513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Loss of engrailed function in posterior cells, results in anterior transformation, where Hh expression is decreased and ''dpp'', ''ci'' and  ''patched'' (ptc) is increased, resulting in the formation of a new A/P boundary, suggesting that ''en'' positively regulates'' hh'', while negatively regulating ''ci'','' ptc'' and ''dpp''.&lt;ref name="Tabata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guillén"/&gt;

== Cell Segregation ==

To explain how anterior and posterior cells are kept separated, the differential [[adhesion]] hypothesis proposes that these two cell populations express different [[Cell adhesion molecule|adhesion molecules]], producing different affinities for each other that minimize their contact.&lt;ref name="Vincent Irons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;
The selector affinity model proposes that difference in cell affinity between compartments is a result of differential [[Homeotic selector gene|selector gene]] expression.&lt;ref name="García-Bellido A"/&gt; The presence or absence of selector genes in a given compartment produces compartment-specific adhesion or recognition molecules that are different from those in its counterpart.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt;
For example, ''engrailed'' expressed in the posterior, but not the anterior, cells provides the differential affinity that keeps these compartments separately.
It is also possible that this difference in cell adhesion/affinity is not directly due to ''en'' expression, but rather to the ability to receive [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hh signaling]].&lt;ref name="Zecca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabata"/&gt; Anterior cells, capable of Hh transduction, will express given adhesive molecules that would differ from those present in posterior cells, creating differential affinity that would prevent them from intermixing.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt;
This signaling-affinity model is supported by experiments that demonstrate the importance of Hh signaling. Clones mutant for the [[Smoothened|''Smoothened (smo)'']], the gene responsible for transducing Hh signaling, retain anterior-like features, but move into the posterior compartment without any changes in the expression ''engrailed'' or invected.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt; This demonstrates that Hh signaling, rather than the absence of en, is what gives cells their compartmental identity.&lt;ref name="Zecca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabata"/&gt; Nonetheless, this signaling-affinity model is incomplete: ''smo'' mutant clones of anterior origin that migrate into the posterior compartment, do not completely associate with these cells, but rather form a smooth boundary with these posterior cells. If signaling-affinity were the only factor determining compartment identity, then these clones, which are no longer receiving Hh signaling, would have the same affinity as the other posterior cells in that compartment and be able to intermix with them.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt;
These experiments indicate that although Hh signaling could be having an effect in adhesive properties, this effect is limited to the border cells rather than throughout both compartments.&lt;ref name="Dahmann"/&gt;
It is also possible that both compartments produce the same cell [[adhesion molecules]], but a difference in its abundance or activity could result in sorting between the two compartments. In vitro, transfected cells with high levels of a given adhesion molecule will segregate from cells that expressing lower levels of  this same molecule.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.1.206 |vauthors=Steinberg MS, Takeichi M |title= Experimental specification of cell sorting, tissue spreading, and specific spatial patterning by quantitative differences in cadherin expression |journal= Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume= 91 |pages= 206–9 |year= 1994 |pmid= 8278366 | issue=1 |pmc= 42915|bibcode = 1994PNAS...91..206S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, differences in cell bond [[Tension (physics)|tension]] could also play a role in the establishment of the boundary and the separation of the two different cell populations. Experimental data has shown that [[Myosin|Myosin-II]] is up-regulated along both the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal-ventral]] and [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior-posterior]] boundaries in the imaginal wing disc.&lt;ref name="Landsberg"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2009.10.021 |vauthors=Landsberg KP, Farhadifar R, Ranft J, Umetsu D, Widmann TJ, Bittig T, Said A, Jülicher F, Dahmann C |title= Increased cell bond tension governs cell sorting at the Drosophila anteroposterior compartment boundary |journal= Curr Biol |volume= 19 |pages= 1950–5 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19879142 | issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Major"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/dvdy.20966 |vauthors=Major RJ, Irvine KD |title= Localization and requirement for Myosin II at the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary of the Drosophila wing |journal= Dev Dyn |volume= 235 |pages= 3051–8 |year= 2006 |pmid= 17013876 | issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D/V boundary is characterized by the presence of [[Cytoskeleton|filamentous actin]] and mutations in [[Myosin-heavy-chain kinase|Myosin-II heavy chain]] impairs D/V compartmentalization.&lt;ref name="Major"/&gt; Similarly, both F-actin and Myosin-II are increased along the A/P boundary, accompanied by a decrease of ''Bazooka'', which was also observed in the D/V border. The [[Rho kinase|Rho-kinase]] inhibitor [[Y-27632]], of which Myosin-II is the main target, significantly reduces cell bond [[tension (physics)|tension]], suggesting that Myosin-II could be the main effector of this process. In support of the signaling-affinity model, creating an artificial interface between cells with active vs. inactive Hh signaling induces a junctional behavior that aligns the cell bonds of where these opposing cell types meet.&lt;ref name="Landsberg"/&gt; Moreover, a 2.5-fold increase in mechanical tension is observed along the A/P boundary, compared to the rest of the tissue. Simulations using a [[vertex model]] demonstrate that this increase in cell bond tension is enough to maintain proliferating cell populations in separate compartment boundaries.&lt;ref name="Landsberg"/&gt; Parameters used to measure cell bond tension are based cell-cell [[adhesion]] and cortical tension input.&lt;ref name="Vincent Irons"/&gt;
It has also been suggested that boundary formation is not a result of differential mechanical tension between the two cell populations, but could be a result of the mechanical properties of the boundary itself.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/ncb0110-5 |vauthors=Martin AC, Wieschaus EF |title= Tensions divide |journal= Nat Cell Biol |volume= 12 |pages= 5–7 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20027198 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The level the adhesion molecule, [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherin]], was unaltered and the biophysical properties of cells between the two compartments were the same. Changes in cell properties, such as an enlarged apical cross-section area, are only observed in anterior and posterior border cells.&lt;ref name="Landsberg"/&gt; Along the boundary, orientation of [[cell division]]s was random and there is no evidence that increased [[Programmed cell death|cell death]] or zones of non-proliferating cells are important for maintaining the A/P or D/V boundary.&lt;ref name="Dahmann"/&gt;

== Future Directions ==

Despite many attempts to identify the adhesion molecules important for the establishment and maintenance of compartment boundaries, none have been identified.&lt;ref name="Vincent Irons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Végh"/&gt; Continuation of our understanding of this process will benefit from further experimental data on cell bonds and cortical tension, as well as [[Genetic screen|screens]] to identify molecules regulating differential cell affinity.

[[File:Dušan Pirjevec-Ahac.jpg|thumbnail|Dušan Pirjevec]]
'''Dušan Pirjevec''', known by his [[Pseudonym#Noms de guerre|nom de guerre]] '''Ahac''' (20 March 1921 – 4 August 1977), was a [[Slovenia]]n [[resistance fighter]], [[literary historian]] and [[philosopher]]. He was one of the most influential [[public intellectuals]] in post-[[World War II]] Slovenia.

== Early years and revolutionary activity ==
Dušan Pirjevec was born in [[Solkan]], which was then a suburb of the [[Italy|Italian]] town of [[Gorizia]]. His birth house is now located in the [[Slovenia]]n town of [[Nova Gorica]]. His father was the literary historian [[Avgust Pirjevec]] from Gorizia; his mother, Iva née Mozetič, came from a wealthy merchant family from Solkan.&lt;ref&gt;Dušan Pirjevec: slovenska kultura in literarna veda (Ljubljana: FF, 2011), 312&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, [[Ivica Pirjevec]], later became a famous anti-Nazi resistance hero and was captured and killed by the Nazis in 1944 (a street in the Ljubljana neighbourhood of [[Tacen]] in the [[Šmarna Gora District]] bears her name). Soon after Dušan's birth, the family moved to [[Ljubljana]], in what was then the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], where his father worked as the chief librarian of the [[National and University Library of Slovenia|National Research Library]]. Dušan attended the Ljubljana Technical High School, and in 1939 he enrolled in the [[University of Zagreb]], where he studied [[agronomy]]. In 1940, he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]].

Already in his teenage years, Pirjevec developed an interest in literature, especially in the French [[poète maudit|poètes maudits]]. In the years before [[World War II]], he published several articles under different pseudonyms in the distinguished liberal-progressive literary journal ''[[Ljubljanski zvon]]''. Together with the young poet [[Karel Destovnik Kajuh]], he was the co-editor of the radical magazine ''Svobodna mladina'' ("The Free Youth").

In the early 1940s, he took part of the "Conflict on the Literary Left", a polemics involving the critical Croatian left-wing writer [[Miroslav Krleža]] against the Communist Party's ideological hardliners around [[Boris Ziherl]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]]. In the polemics, was largely evolving around the relation between personal artistic freedom and collective revolutionary engagement, Pirjevec defended Krleža's insistence on artistic freedom, trying to show that it is not in conflict with a Marxist Leninist position.

== Resistance fighter ==

Soon after the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, Pirjevec joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan]] resistance in the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]], adopting the battle name Ahac, by which he remained known for the rest of his life. In late 1941, he was involved in the fight against the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] occupation regime in the so-called [[Province of Ljubljana]]. He chose the fighting name ''Ahac'' (Agathius). The choice was highly symbolic: since the late 16th, [[Saint Agathius]] was venerated in the [[Slovene Lands]] as the [[patron saint]] against [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] invasions, and in the 17th century he was also venerated as the saint protector of [[Carniola]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uzivajmozdravo.si/prosti_cas/pobeg/clanek?aid=2271&lt;/ref&gt;

His talent in organization was spotted by the Communist leader [[Aleš Bebler]] who secured Pirjevec's promotion to the rank of [[political commissar]] in the military units active in [[Lower Carniola]]. During this time, he became notorious for his bellicosity and brutal treatment of opponents. In a highly controversial memoir published posthumously in 1990, fellow fighter and famous essayist [[Jože Javoršek]] even accused Pirjevec of burning war prisoners alive.&lt;ref&gt;Jože Javoršek, Spomini na Slovence III. Ljubljana: Adit, 1990. 92&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in an internal enquiry over the massacre of a group of [[Romani people]] in the region of [[White Carniola]] in 1942, but was acquitted. In 1943, he was sent to organize the resistance fight to the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and to [[Friulian Slovenia]] in [[Italy]], and in 1944 to southern [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].

After the end of the War, Pirjevec was placed in the [[propaganda]] units of the newly established Communist regime in Slovenia. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked as the editor of the daily journal ''Ljudska pravica'' ("People's Justice"), the main Communist newspaper in Slovenia. There, he met the literary critic [[Bojan Štih]], who introduced him to contemporary trends in literature. In 1947, Pirjevec became the chairman of the [[Agitprop]] section at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. During this period, he became a close personal friend with [[Vitomil Zupan]], with whom he engaged in several provocations of what they saw as the "reactionary and petit bourgeoise" cultural scene in Ljubljana. In summer 1948, he was arrested and trialed in a [[show trial]] for numerous severe crimes, such as subversive activity, immoral acts and rape. Unlike his close personal friend  who was arrested and accused of the same crimes in the same trial, Pirjevec was sentenced to a relatively mild sentence of two years in prison. He was released already after half a year, and put on probation. He was excluded from the Communist Party and stripped of all his war honours.

== The scholar ==

Between 1948 and 1952, Pirjevec studied [[French language]] and [[comparative literature]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]] under the supervision of the famous literary historian [[Anton Ocvirk]]. Between 1952 and 1961, he was employed as a clerk at the Institute for Literature of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], later rising to the position of personal assistant to the Institute's president [[Josip Vidmar]].

In 1958, Pirjevec became an assistant at the Department for Comparative Literature of the University of Ljubljana. In 1959, he was actively involved the so-called "Slodnjak affair", when the conservative-minded literary historian [[Anton Slodnjak]] was dismissed from his post of professor of Slovene literature for having published an anthology of Slovene literature in [[Germany]], which included several authors which were not well viewed by the Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demokracija.si/index.php?sekcija=clanki&amp;clanek=1088&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lit.ijs.si/okmeclu.html&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Pirjevec was admitted again to the Communist Party.

Between 1961 and 1962, Pirjevec started a long polemic with the [[Serbia]]n writer [[Dobrica Ćosić]] regarding the cultural policies in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In contrast to Ćosić, who argued for a more unified and centralized cultural policy in Yugoslavia, Pirjevec defended the cultural autonomy of the single republics in the Yugoslav federation. The polemic gave Pirjevec a high degree of public visibility.

In 1961, Pirjevec achieved his PhD in comparative literature and in 1963 he became a professor at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. In the late 1960s, he rose to prominence among students as a charismatic professor. The Department of Comparative Literature, where he taught, became one of the most vibrant centers of Slovene intellectual scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Among Pirjevec's pupils were [[Dimitrij Rupel]], [[Niko Grafenauer]], [[Rudi Šeligo]], [[Andrej Inkret]] and many other intellectuals who later formed the core of the intellectual movement focused around the alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. In this period, Pirjevec also developed a close friendship with literary historian [[Taras Kermauner]] and philosopher [[Ivo Urbančič]], who represented critical positions towards the existing Communist system. In 1964, Pirjevec criticized the regime's decision to prohibit the publication of the alternative journal ''[[Perspektive]]'', and was again expulsed from the Party for this reason.

In the 1960s, Pirjevec published several monographs on modern Slovene literature, focusing especially on the [[fin-de-siecle]] period. Most famous were his studies on the writer and essayist [[Ivan Cankar]]. He also published numerous studies of classical works of the [[western canon]], in which the most famous is his treatise on the problem of evil in the works of [[Dostoyevski]]. He based his scholarly research on the esthetic theories of [[Hegel]], [[Georg Lukács]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], but also on [[Sartre]]'s existential philosophy and [[Roman Ingarden]] phenomenology of the literary science. He was also receptive to currents coming from the [[new historicism]].

During this period, Pirjevec maintained close contacts with the [[Praxis School]], which was trying to formulate an alternative and humanist vision of [[Marxism]]. He was also member of the Committee of the famous [[Korčula]] Summer School organized by the ''Praxis'' group. Between 1969 and 1971, he served as editor of the Slovenian journal ''[[Sodobnost]]''.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pirjevec was sympathetic to the [[student movement]] that developed at the University of Ljubljana. In 1971, he joined the protests against the arrest of two students of the University, [[Frane Adam]] and [[Milan Jesih]], which escalated in the occupation of the Faculty of Arts by the students.

From the 1970s, Pirjevec gradually left his previous Marxist positions. Under the influence of the philosopher [[Ivan Urbančič]], he grew increasingly closer to the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]], whom he personally met in 1974.

He died in Ljubljana on August 4, 1977 and was buried in the cemetery of [[Šmartno pod Šmarno goro]].

== Personal life ==
Pirjevec was married twice. His first wife was his partisan co-fighter, the university professor of French language [[Marjeta Vasič]], the second was the actress and later writer [[Nedeljka Kacin]]. His daughter [[Alenka Pirjevec]] is a famous theatre actress and puppeteer. His second daughter with Slovenian journalist [[Olga Ratej]] is a Slovenian dramaturg [[Ira Ratej]].

== Influence and legacy ==

Together with [[Edvard Kocbek]], Pirjevec is considered one of the most influential intellectuals in Slovenia in the period between 1945 and 1980. He influenced not only literary critic and history, but also philosophers such as [[Tine Hribar]], [[Ivan Urbančič]], [[Dean Komel]] and Croatian philosopher [[Mario Kopić]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pogledi.si/knjiga/pirjevec-aktualen-na-hrvaskem&lt;/ref&gt; He was crucial in the intellectual development of several public figures, among whom the most famous was writer and sociologist [[Dimitrij Rupel]], who later became the first Slovenian foreign minister. Pirjevec was portrayed in several novels and memoirs, including [[Gert Hofmann]]'s ''Die Fistelstimme'' (1982) [[Milan Dekleva]]'s ''Oko v zraku'' ("The Eye in the Air"), [[Iztok Osojnik]]'s ''Braşow'' in [[Rudi Šeligo]]'s ''Izgubljeni sveženj'' ("The Lost Bundle"), and [[Taras Kermauner]]'s ''Navzkrižna srečavanja'' ("Crossed Encounters").

Pirjevec's view on the national question, articulated in polemics with the ideologue of Yugoslav Socialism [[Edvard Kardelj]], was particularly influential among the dissident Slovene intellectuals of the late 1970s and 1980s. Pirjevec was the single most quoted author in the "[[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]]", a public manifesto written by 16 non-Communist intellectuals in 1987, which is frequently seen as the beginning of the Slovene movement for independence that culminated in the declaration of independence of Slovenia in 1991.

In 1997, a bust of Pirjevec was erected in the hall of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. In 1998, a memorial plaque was placed in his native house in [[Nova Gorica]].

'''Eugène (Eugeniusz) Minkowski''' ({{IPA-fr|øʒɛn mɛ̃kɔwski}}; 17 April 1885 – 17 November 1972) was a French [[psychiatrist]] of Jewish Polish origin, known for his incorporation of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] into [[psychopathology]] and for exploring the notion of "lived time". A student of [[Eugen Bleuler]], he was also associated with the work of [[Ludwig Binswanger]] and [[Henri Ey]]. He was influenced by the phenomenological philosophy and the vitalistic philosophy of [[Henri Bergson]], and by the phenomenologists [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Max Scheler]]; therefore his work departed from classical [[Medical model|medical]] and psychological models. He was a prolific author in several languages and regarded as a great humanitarian. Minkowski accepted the phenomenological essence of schizophrenia as the “trouble générateur” ("generating disorder") as he thought that it consists in a loss of “vital contact with reality” and shows itself as autism&lt;ref name="UrferPhen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Annick Urfer | title=Phenomenology and Psychopathology of Schizophrenia: The Views of Eugene Minkowski | journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=8 | issue=4 | year=2001 | issn=1086-3303 | doi=10.1353/ppp.2002.0029 | pages=279—289}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Life and career==
Minkowski was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], the capital of the [[Russian Empire]], into a Jewish Polish family. He was second of the four sons of August Minkowski, a [[Warsaw]] banker and his wife, Tekla, née Lichtenbaum. When he was 7 years old, the family returned to the Polish capital where he attended school and started his medical studies at the [[Imperial University of Warsaw]]. However, due to political repression from the czarist government, the university was temporarily closed in 1905. He was obliged to continue his studies at [[Breslau University]] (3 semesters), at [[Göttingen University]] (2 semesters) and finally, at [[Munich University]] (3 semesters)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/index.php/a/eugeniusz-minkowski, Polish National Dictionary of Biography, accessed 26 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained his medical degree in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis|url=http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/minkowski-eugene|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Russian subject, he went on to practice medicine in [[Kazan]] to obtain Russian certification, and while there, met his future wife, [[Françoise Minkowska|Franciszka Brokman]], also a doctor and later known as 'Françoise'. They married in 1913. The couple settled in Munich, where Françoise pursued further work in psychiatry while Eugène took up the study of mathematics and philosophy, attending lectures by [[Alexander Pfänder]] and [[Moritz Geiger]], pupils of [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spiegelberg |first=Herbert |title=Phenomenology in Psychology and Psychiatry |publisher=Northwestern University Press |year=1972 |page=237 |isbn=978-0-8101-0357-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Munich he became acquainted with [[German philosophy|Germanic philosophy]]. The outbreak of World War I forced them to seek refuge in [[Zürich]] with Minkowski's brother, Mieczysław (Michel). There, Minkowski and his wife both became assistants to [[Eugen Bleuler]] at the [[Burghölzli]], a university clinic where [[Carl Gustav Jung]] and [[Ludwig Binswanger]] had practised earlier. In 1914 he finished a work entitled ''"Les éléments essentiels du temps-qualité"'' – "The Essential Elements of Time-Quality". At the beginning of the [[World War I]] Minkowski volunteered in the [[French Army]] in 1915 as a military medic. In 1915, the couple had a son, [[Alexandre Minkowski]], later a pioneer of French [[neonatology]] and father of the noted orchestra conductor, [[Marc Minkowski]], followed in 1918 by a daughter, Jeannine, a lawyer. In the war he saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme]] and at [[Battle of Verdun]], where his bravery earned him several citations and military decorations, including the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. He became an officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] and obtained French nationality. In France Minkowski came under the influence of the famous French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], whose views are considered unscientific and opposing the secular.&lt;ref name="Broome2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew R. Broome |title=The Maudsley Reader in Phenomenological Psychiatry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htp45ezTFQUC&amp;pg=PA89 |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-88275-0 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minkowski was convinced that [[psychopathology]] should be closer to [[philosophy]] and closer to individual philosopher's views.&lt;ref name="Broome2013"/&gt; For Minkowski this philosopher was Bergson.&lt;ref name="Broome2013"/&gt; 

After the war he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"During the war we were waiting for peace, hoping to take up again the life that we had abandoned. In reality, a new period began, a period of difficulties and deceptions, of setbacks and painful, often fruitless efforts to adapt oneself to new problems of existence. The calm propitious to philosophic thought was far from reborn. Long, arid, and somber years followed the war. My work lay dormant at the bottom of my drawer".&lt;ref&gt;''Lived Time: Phenomenological and Psychopathological Studies'', translation by Nancy Metzel, Northwestern University Press, Evanston. 1970. pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After World War I, when his enlistment came to an end, he adopted French nationality. The family moved again to Paris permanently and Minkowski returned to [[medicine]] and partially abandoned his philosophical pursuits. He worked on the [[perception of time]] as a vector in psychopathology, drawing heavily on his unpublished work on [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]], whom he had known personally. In 1925 he became one of the co-founders of a movement and a French journal in psychiatry, known as ''"L'Évolution psychiatrique"'' – "The Psychiatric Evolution". ''"L'Évolution psychiatrique"'' introduced the work of [[Eugen Bleuler]] and several other psychiatrists, such as [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Ludwig Binswanger]]. Directors of ''"l'Ėvolution psychiatrique"'' were [[Angelo Hesnard|A. Hesnard]] and [[René Laforgue|R. Laforgue]].&lt;ref name="Evolution1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minkowski E. |year=1925 |title=La Génèse de la Notion de Schizophrénie et ses Caractères Essentiels (une page d’histoire contemporaine de la psychiatrie) = [The Genesis of the Schizophrenia Notion and its Essential Characteristics (a page of contemporary history of psychiatry)] |language=French |place=Paris |journal=L'Évolution psychiatrique = [The Psychiatric Evolution] |volume=1 |pages=193–236 |publisher=Payot |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6536271v}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original works and critical studies in the journal have been made by messieurs [[René Allendy|R.

In 1926 he wrote a doctoral thesis on ""La notion de perte de contact avec la réalité et ses applications en psychopathologie""  – ''The Notion of Loss of Contact with Reality and its Applications in Psychopathology'', which was based on the works of [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Eugen Bleuler]], and began work at Sainte-Anne's Psychiatric Hospital, a leading mental hospital in Paris. By the way, he also supported Bleuler's concept of the schizophrenic autism. Eugène Minkowski thought that autism is the patient's loss of vital contact with reality (''perte de contact vital avec la réalité''). He distinguished two types of the schizophrenic autism: 'rich or florid autism' (''autisme riche'') &amp; 'poor autism' (''autisme pauvre''), i.e. autism characterized by affective and cognitive "poverty".&lt;ref name="Feinstein2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adam Feinstein |title=A History of Autism: Conversations with the Pioneers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-UztWdBkPkC&amp;pg=PA6 |date=7 July 2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-5167-5 |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But Minkowski disagreed with Eugen Bleuler on several points. First, he didn't believe that the necessary component of autism is "the predominance of the inner [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] life". In truth, he claimed that a typical schizophrenic patient has the "poor autism" which he described by the poverty of affective and cognitive processes. On that subject, he also criticized Bleuler's description of schizophrenic autism together with [[Emil Kraepelin]]. Minkowski claimed that "rich autism" happened only when a schizophrenic patient was equipped with an autism-independent inclination towards affective and cognitive expressivity. Just as important, Minkowski considered autism as a both fundamental and primary disorder of schizophrenia. Other psychopathological features of schizophrenia could be comprehended ("trouble générateur").

In 1927 he published ''"La Schizophrénie"'' on schizophrenia, followed in 1933, by ''"Le Temps vécu. Études phénoménologique et psychopathologiques"'' – "Lived Time. Phenomenological and Psychopathological Studies". In this, his only book published in English, Minkowski sought to use phenomenology as an approach to psychopathology. He proposed that the pathology of patients should always be interpreted in light of their subjective experience of time. Unable initially to find a publisher he funded a thousand copies himself. It was eventually published by J.L.L. d'Artrey to whom Minkowski dedicated the new edition of the work.
Minkowski was in the [[Resistance during World War II]] and directed the work of a charity to protect children from the [[Shoah]], which saved thousands of Jewish children. In 1946 he gave one of the first Basel lectures on the psychological suffering during Nazi persecution and went on to testify as an expert witness in numerous subsequent lawsuits. He was the author of some 250 clinical papers and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minkowska.com/sites/default/files/pdf/eugene_minkowski_biography.pdf|title=Eugène Minkowski (1885–1972)|author=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugène Minkowski died in 1972. His funeral was attended by a large crowd, including his psychiatrist friend and collaborator, [[Henri Ey]].

==Philosophy and psychopathology==
Philosophically, Minkowski was influenced by Bergson and the phenomenologist Max Scheler, who had developed separate accounts of Time, (see Bergson's 1889 work ''[[Time and Free Will]]'' and his analyses of the irrational nature of time). Following Bergson's account of [[élan vital]], Minkowski developed what he named as ''vital energy'', an account of the essence of time.
He was also attracted by the practice of the Swiss psychiatrist, [[Eugen Bleuler]] and attempted to synthesize ideas from psychiatry with philosophy, taking an approach similar to [[Karl Jaspers]]. He introduced phenomenology as part of his investigations into psychopathology. He sought thereby to explain the experience of patients who appeared to suffer from distortions of time and/or space. Minkowski's first research into the psychopathology of schizophrenia was inspired by Bergson and appeared in his 1927 work ''La Schizophrénie'', which he thought was "due to a deficiency of intuition, a sense of time and to a progressive hypertrophy of the grasp of spatial factors".&lt;ref&gt;''Lived Time'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his dissertation, he considered that schizophrenic patients display a "loss of vital contact with reality" unlike others who experienced life as a "lived synchronism" or what he called "syntony", a notion borrowed from [[Ernst Kretschmer]]. According to [[Ronald David Laing|R.D. Laing]], Minkowski made "the first serious attempt in psychiatry to reconstruct the other person's lived experience" and was "the first figure in psychiatry to bring the nature of phenomenological investigations clearly into view".&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Laing, "Minkowski and Schizophrenia," ''Review of Existential Psychology'' XI (1963), 207.&lt;/ref&gt; He is quoted on the first page of Laing's classic ''The Divided Self'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Je donne une œuvre subjective ici, œuvre cependant qui tend de toutes ses forces vers l'objectivité." I offer you a subjective work, but a work which nevertheless struggles with all its might towards objectivity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[University of Zurich]] in 1955 and the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1965.

[[Image:Cherso Petrisevic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Franciscus Patricius in [[Cres]].]]
'''Franciscus Patricius''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Francesco Patrizi'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Franjo Petriš'' or ''Frane Petrić''; 25 April 1529 – 6 February 1597) was a [[philosopher]] and [[scientist]] from the [[Republic of Venice]] of [[Croat]]ian descent. He was known as a defender of [[Platonism]] and an opponent of [[Aristotelianism]]. In Croatia he is mostly referred to as Franjo Petriš or Frane Petrić (sometimes ''Petris'', ''Petrišević'' and ''Petričević''). His family name in Cres was known as Petris.

==Life and family==
Franciscus Patricius was born in [[Cres]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Cherso''), today in Croatia, then the territory of the [[Republic of Venice]]. According to the family legend, the Petriš family (Patricius was his Latin name) was of noble (patrician) origin from [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] and was forced to flee from the crumbling Bosnian kingdom after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion.

As a young man, he traveled the Mediterranean with his uncle [[Juraj Petriš|Georgius (Juraj) Patricius]], who commanded a [[galley]] in the wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He gained the patronage of the Greek Orthodox Bishop of [[Cyprus]], who brought him to Venice, where his abilities were immediately recognized. He studied economy in [[Venice]], then he moved to study in [[Ingolstadt]] under the patronage of his cousin [[Matthias Flacius|Matthias Flacius (Matija Vlačić)]]. Then he went to study medicine and philosophy at the [[University of Padova]]. Here he was elected twice as a representative of the students from [[Dalmatia]].

After graduation he lived in different cities in Italy: [[Ancona]], [[Rome]], [[Bologna]], [[Ferrara]], [[Venice]]. He later moved to [[Cyprus]] where he spent seven years. Here he attended upon the Bishop of Cyprus who send him back to Italy, where he traveled to [[Venice]], [[Padova]], [[Genoa]], and even to [[Barcelona]].

He finally went to live in [[Ferrara]], a center of Platonism in Italy, where he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Ferrara]] by Duke [[Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso II]]. He was subsequently invited in [[Rome]] by [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1592, where he spent five years as the chair of Platonic philosophy. Here he became a member of the Council of St. Jerome, at the [[Illyrian College of St. Jerome]].

Patricius died in Rome, and he was buried in the church of [[Sant'Onofrio (Rome)|Sant'Onofrio]], in the tomb of his colleague [[Torquato Tasso]].

==Work==
In spite of his continual controversies with the [[Aristotle|Aristotelians]], Patricius managed to make a comprehensive study of contemporary science, publishing in 15 books a treatise on the ''New Geometry'' (1587), as well as works on history, rhetoric and the art of war. He studied ancient theories of music, and is said to have invented the thirteen-syllable verse form known subsequently as ''versi martelliani''. In his philosophy he was mainly concerned to defend [[Plato]] against the followers of [[Aristotle]].

His two great works, ''Discussionum peripateticorum libri XV'' (Basel, 1571), and ''Nova de universis philosophia'' (''New Philosophy of Universes'', Basel, 1591), developed the view that, whereas Aristotle's teaching was in direct opposition to [[Christianity]], Plato, on the contrary, foreshadowed the Christian revelation and prepared the way for its acceptance. In the earlier treatise he attacks the life and character of Aristotle, impugns the authenticity of almost all his works, and attempts to refute his doctrines from a theological standpoint. In the second and greater work he goes back to the theories and methods of the Ionians and [[the Presocratics]] in general.

Patricius' theory of the universe is that, from [[God]] there emanated [[Light]] which extends throughout space and is the explanation of all development. This Light is not corporeal and yet is the fundamental reality of things. From Light came [[Heat]] and [[Fluid]]ity; these three together with [[Space]] make up the [[classical element|element]]s out of which all things are constructed. This cosmic theory is a curious combination of materialistic and [[abstraction|abstract]] ideas; the influence of his master [[Bernardino Telesio]], generally predominant, is not strong enough to overcome his inherent disbelief in the adequacy of purely scientific explanation.

His practical work included a scheme for diverting a river to protect Ferrara and military strategy.

In [[popular culture]], the '''friend zone''' is a situation in which one member of a friendship wishes to enter into a romantic or sexual relationship, while the other does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = friend zone | title = Oxford English Dictionary | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/friend-zone | access-date = 22 January 2014 | quote = ...a situation in which a friendship exists between two people, one of whom has an unrequited romantic or sexual interest in the other... }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally considered to be an undesirable situation for the rejected person.&lt;ref name="twsFebX19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taoofdating.com/how-to-stay-out-of-friend-zone/|title=How to stay out of the Friend Zone|last=Binazir|first=Ali|date=February 2011|website=taoofdating.com|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sense of ''zone'' is one of being stuck in an unwanted and distant relationship. The rejected person is said to have been put "in" the object of their affection's "friend zone". The concept of the friend zone has been criticized as [[misogynistic]], because of a belief that the concept implies an expectation that women should have sex with men in whom they have no interest, simply because the men were nice to them.&lt;ref name="6 reasons"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2013/10/12/6_reasons_the_friend_zone_needs_to_die/ | title=6 reasons the “friend zone” needs to die | website=[[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] | publisher = Salon Media Group Inc. | date=12 October 2013 | accessdate=26 April 2015 | last=Dickson |first= E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcotte"&gt;{{cite web|title=The dangerous discourse of "the friend zone"|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/05/27/the-dangerous-discourse-of-the-friend-zone/|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda | website = [[The Raw Story|rawstory.com]] |date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely associated with so-called "[[nice guy syndrome]]".

The term friendzone can be [[verbing|verbified]], as in the sentence "So, she's friendzoned you."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thejambar.com/the-friend-zone-less-innocuous-than-it-seems/&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term is apparently gender-neutral, friend zone is often used to describe a situation in a male-female relationship in which the male is in the friend zone and the female is the object of his unrequited desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/10/12/6_reasons_the_friend_zone_needs_to_die/|title=6 reasons the “friend zone” needs to die|date=2013-10-12|work=Salon|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person who does the friendzoning is referred to as the ''friendzoner'', whereas the person who gets friendzoned is called the ''friend-zonee''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iowastatedaily.com/self/article_adca5ed2-355e-11e4-99e3-0019bb2963f4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "friend zone" is sometimes used in [[seduction community|pick up artist (PUA)]] literature, where it forms part of PUA theories about female sexual attraction to males.

== Background ==

Writer Jeremy Nicholson in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' suggested that a romantic pursuer, in order to avoid being rejected up front, uses a ploy of acting friendly as a "back door" way into a hoped-for relationship. When this method does not work, the pursuer consequently is placed in the ''friend zone''.&lt;ref name="twsPsychToday5"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nicholson | first = Jeremy | title = Avoiding the Friend Zone: Becoming a Boyfriend or a Girlfriend | journal = [[Psychology Today]] | page = 3 | publisher = Sussex Publishers | date = 1 March 2013 | url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-attraction-doctor/201302/avoiding-the-friend-zone-becoming-girlfriend-or-boyfriend | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to some psychologists, the man in a cross-gender friendship is more likely to be attracted to his woman friend than she is to him, and he is more likely to overestimate her interest in a romantic or sexual relationship.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Somers|first2=Erin|last3=Micke|first3=Cierra|last4=Erickson|first4=Leah|last5=Matteson|first5=Lindsay|last6=Stocco|first6=Corey|last7=Schumacher|first7=Brittany|last8=Ritchie|first8=Laura|date=August 2012|title=Benefit or burden?

==Criticism of the term==

Feminist writers have argued that the friend zone concept is misogynistic&lt;ref name="Marcotte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jezebel.com/hey-dude-youre-not-stuck-in-the-friendzone-cuz-you-dre-1653403664 | title=Hey Dude, You're Not Stuck in the Friendzone Cuz You Dress Shitty (blog) | website =[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] | publisher = [[Univision Communications]] | date=2 November 2014 | accessdate=26 April 2015 | last=Moore | first = Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="6 reasons"/&gt; and rooted in [[male narcissism]]. The ''[[nice guy]]'' concept has been criticized as a [[gender role|gender trope]] with an underlying message that kind acts demand a sexual or romantic reward, and that this concept implies that if a woman and a man have a platonic friendship and the man becomes romantically attracted to the woman, then the woman has an obligation to return his affection. A woman who does not return her "nice guy" male friend's affection is viewed negatively or seen to be at fault.

''[[TheGuardian.com]]'' contributor Ally Fogg argues that while the friend zone does not exist in a literal sense, men who use the term "friend zone" are not necessarily misogynists who feel entitled to sex. He states the term's usage reflects a genuine emotional experience for straight men with low self-esteem and self-confidence. He places blame on ingrained gender roles.&lt;ref name=twsTheGuardian2&gt;{{cite news | last = Fogg | first = Ally | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/08/friends-friend-zone | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | title = Not all men in the 'friend zone' are bad guys | date = 8 January 2013 | accessdate = 29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The term was popularized by a 1994 episode of the American [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' entitled "[[The One with the Blackout]]", where the character [[Ross Geller]], who was [[Love sickness|lovesick]] for [[Rachel Green]], was described by character [[Joey Tribbiani]] as being the "mayor of the friend zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 film ''[[Just Friends]]'' features a main character (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) reunited after ten years with his friend (played by [[Amy Smart]]), who informs him that she loves him "like a brother", essentially dashing any hopes of him having her as a girlfriend.

[[MTV]] aired a reality show entitled ''[[Friendzone (MTV series)|FriendZone]]'' from 2011 to 2013. Each episode is based around "crushers" who are friends with the "crushees", but want to begin relationships with them.

The [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Regular Show]]'' brings up and shows the friend zone on a regular basis, as one of the show's main characters, Mordecai, and his friend Margaret experience shifts in their relationship.

[[File:Sophokles Trauerspiele (Ast).djvu|thumb|''[[Sophokles]]: Trauerspiele'' translated by Friedrich Ast]]

'''Georg Anton Friedrich Ast''' ({{IPA-de|ast|lang}}; 29 December 1778 – 31 October 1841) was a German philosopher and [[philologist]].

==Biography==
Ast was born in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]]. Educated there and at the [[University of Jena]], he became a ''[[privatdozent]]'' at [[Jena]] in 1802. In 1805 he became professor of [[classical literature]] in the [[University of Landshut]], where he remained until 1826, when it was transferred to [[Munich]]. He lived there until his death in 1841. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In recognition of his work, the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]] made him a member and aulic councillor. He is known principally for his work during the last twenty-five years of his life on the dialogues of [[Plato]]. His ''Plato's Leben and Schriften'' (1816)—which originated in the ''Introductions'' of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and the historical scepticism of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf|Wolf]]—was the first of those critical inquiries into the life and works of Plato.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Distrusting tradition, he took a few of the finest dialogues as his standard, and from internal evidence denounced as spurious not only those  generally admitted to be so (''[[Epinomis]], [[Minos]], [[Theages]], [[Rival Lovers|Rivales]], [[Clitophon (dialogue)|Clitophon]], [[Hipparchus (dialogue)|Hipparchus]], [[Eryxias]]'', ''Letters and Definitions''), but also the ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]], [[Euthydemus (dialogue)|Euthydemus]], [[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]], [[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]], [[Laches (dialogue)|Laches]]'', ''First'' and ''Second Alcibiades'', ''[[Hippias Major]]'' and ''Minor'', ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]], [[Euthyphro]], [[Apology (Plato)|Apology]], [[Crito]]'', and even (against [[Aristotle]]'s explicit assertion) ''[[Laws (dialogue)|The Laws]]''. The genuine dialogues he divides into three series:

# the earliest, marked chiefly by the poetical and dramatic element, i.e. ''Protagoras, Phaedrus, Gorgias, Phaedo'';
# the second, marked by [[dialectic]] subtlety, i.e. ''Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Parmenides, Cratylus''; and
# the third group, combining both qualities harmoniously, i.e., the ''Philebus, Symposium, Republic, Timaeus, Critias''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The work was followed by a complete edition of Plato's works (2 vols., 1819–1832) with a [[Latin language|Latin]] translation and commentary. His last work was the ''Lexicon Platonicum ''(3 vols., 1834–1839), which is both valuable and comprehensive. In his works on [[aesthetics]] he combined the views of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] with those of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Schiller]] and others. His histories of philosophy are marked more by critical scholarship than by originality of thought, though they are interesting as asserting the now familiar principle that the [[history of philosophy]] is not the history of opinions, but of [[reason]] as a whole; he was among the first to attempt to formulate a principle of the development of [[thought]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Beside his works on Plato, he wrote, on aesthetics, ''System der Kunstlehre'' (1805) and ''Grundriß der Aesthetik''&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; (1807); on the history of philosophy, ''Grundlinien der Philosophie'' (1807, republished 1809, but soon forgotten), ''Grundriß einer Geschichte der Philosophie'' (1807 and 1825), and ''Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie'' (1829); in philology, ''Grundlinien der Philologie'' (1808), and ''Grundlinien der Grammatik, Hermeneutik und Kritik'' (1808).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He died in Munich.

'''Giovanni Reale''' (15 April 1931 – 15 October 2014) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] historian of philosophy.

==Biography==
Reale was born in [[Candia Lomellina]], [[Pavia]]. He attended the Gymnasium and the [[Liceo classico]] of [[Casale Monferrato]], and was then educated at the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] of [[Milan]], where he graduated. He later continued his studies in [[Marburg an der Lahn]] and [[Munich]].

After a period of teaching in high schools, he won a professorship at the [[University of Parma]], where he taught courses in [[moral philosophy]] and the [[history of philosophy]]. He then returned to the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore of Milan, where he was professor of the history of [[ancient philosophy]] for many years, and where he also founded the Centro di Ricerche di Metafisica. In 2005 he moved to teach at the new faculty of philosophy at [[Vita-Salute San Raffaele University]] of Milan.

He died on 15 October 2014 in his home in [[Luino]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/2014/10/15/cultura/addio-a-giovanni-reale-grande-interprete-di-platone-zqhYewBu29hzGvmpsYJBHL/pagina.html La Stampa]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
His main argument is that categories of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] and its particular way of thinking led to the birth and development of the science and technology in the [[Western world|West]].

His research interests range throughout the ancient [[Paganism|pagan]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] thought, and his most significant contributions have touched gradually [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Socrates]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. He studied each of these authors from an [[wikt:against the grain|against-the-grain]] perspective, inaugurating, in the opinion of Cornelia de Vogel, a new reading of these authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelia |last=de Vogel |authorlink= |year=1990 |title=Ripensando Platone e il Platonismo|publisher=Vita e Pensiero|isbn = 9788834302965|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reale's reinterpretation of Aristotle disputes the [[Positivism|positivist]]-influenced interpretation of [[Werner Jaeger]], according to which the writings of Aristotle are informed by a progression of dominant beliefs: at first, [[theology]], where debate is in reference to [[God]]; then metaphysics, where the universal rights of man are the focus; and finally arriving at the viewpoint of [[science]]. Reale argued instead the fundamental unity of the metaphysical thought of Aristotle.

==Life==
He was a student of [[Godfrey of Fontaines]], and teacher of [[John Baconthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge J. E. Gracia, Timothy B. Noone (editors), ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (2003), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[prior-general of the Carmelites]] in 1318,&lt;ref name="Pennington"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/1298c-g.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307022407/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/1298c-g.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Majorca|bishop of Mallorca]], and [[bishop of Elna]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Williman, ''The Right of Spoil of the Popes of Avignon, 1316-1415'' (1988), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://symploke.trujaman.org/index.php?title=Guido_de_Terrena|title=Guido de Terrena - Enciclopedia Symploké|website=Symploke.trujaman.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atlantis/2572/ObispadoElna.htm|title=OBISPADO DE ELNA|date=26 October 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=14 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026220045/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atlantis/2572/ObispadoElna.htm|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As bishop of Elna he opposed [[Adhémar IV de Mosset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/jean.pares/seigneur/mosset/21mosset.htm|title=Orange|website=Pagesperso-orange.fr|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong proponent of [[Aristotle]], he taught at [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jotischky, ''The Carmelites and Antiquity: Mendicants and Their Pasts in the Middle Ages'' (2002), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He was an early infallibilist;&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Pelikan, ''The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine'' (1989), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[papal infallibility]] is thought to occur first in a work he wrote concerning the conflict of [[Pope John XXII]] (1316–34) and the [[Franciscan Spirituals]].&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Levillain,''The Papacy: An Encyclopedia'' (2002), p. 776.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he adapted this doctrine to papal needs, rather than originating it,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Misner, ''Papacy and Development: Newman and the Primacy of the Pope'' (1976), note p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; and before 1328.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Gogan, ''The Common Corps of Christendom'' (1982), note p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a leading member of a small group of infallibilists at the court of Pope John XXII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/03044181/v01i0001/71_iitcopjx.xml|title=Infallibilists in the curia of Pope John XXII|first=Thomas|last=Turley=|journal=Journal of Medieval History|volume=1|issue=1|pages=71–101|accessdate=14 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0304-4181(75)90032-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position on papal infallibility "so closely anticipated the doctrine of Vatican I that in the judgment of  B.M. Xiberta, the Carmelite scholar who edited [Terreni's] work, 'if he had written it after Vatican I he would have to add or change hardly a single word.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Powell+%22change+hardly+a+single%22&amp;btnG= Mark E. Powell, ''Papal Infallibility: A Protestant Evaluation of an Ecumenical Issue''] (Eerdmans 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6284-6}}), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "We are not asking whether a pope can be a heretic in himself but whether he can err in defining anything in the church and obliging the faithful to believe, so that his error does not concern the person of the pope alone but concerns all the faithful and the whole church of Christ. For an error concerning his person can inhere in the pope, but not an error concerning the whole church."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn4eAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249 Brian Tierney, ''Origins of papal infallibility, 1150-1350''] (Brill 1972), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of those opposing the views of [[Arnold of Villanova]] on the [[Antichrist]];&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Reeves, ''The Influence of Prophecy in the Later Middle Ages: A Study in Joachimism'' (1969), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Burrow, Ian P. Wei, ''Medieval Futures: Attitudes to the Future in the Middle Ages'' (2000), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and he first dubbed [[Joachim of Fiore]] a heretic.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He was asked, with [[Pierre de la Palud]], to report on [[Peter John Olivi]]'s apocalyptic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6367568/From-black-magic-to-heresy.html|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=Goliath.ecnext.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Leff]], ''Heresy in the Later Middle Ages'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote [[commentaries on Aristotle]]'s ''[[De anima]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', and ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.

{{Hinduism small}}
{{Hinduism by country}}
[[Hinduism]] is a minority religion in the [[United States]]. The vast majority of American Hindus are immigrants from [[South Asia]] (mainly [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Bangladesh]], some from [[Bhutan]], [[Maldives]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Indonesia]] (mainly [[Bali]] and [[Java]]), the [[Caribbean]] (mainly [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Jamaica]]), [[Fiji]], [[Africa]] (mainly [[Southern Africa]] and [[East Africa|Eastern African]]), and [[Mauritius]] and other countries and their descendants.  Additionally, the United States has a number of [[Convert to Hinduism|converts to Hinduism]]. There are also about 900 ethnic [[Chams|Cham]] people of [[Vietnam]], living in America. 55% of whom are Hindus. They are one of the few remaining non-Indic Hindus in the World.&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/11688/US&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were isolated sojourns by Hindus in the United States during the 19th century, Hindu presence in the United States was extremely limited until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].

Currently, Hindu-Americans hold the highest education levels among all religious communities in the United States. This is mostly due to strong US immigration policies that favor educated and highly skilled migrants.&lt;ref name="voanews.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hinds_most_educated_highest_earning_religion/1449355.html|title=Hindu-Americans Rank Top in Education, Income|accessdate=Dec 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defenceforumindia.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://defenceforumindia.com/forum/religion-culture/44091-hindu-americans-rank-top-education-income.html|title=Hindu-Americans Rank Top in Education, Income|accessdate=Dec 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many concepts of Hinduism, such as [[karma]], [[reincarnation]] and [[yoga]], have entered into mainstream American vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-08-18/news/27651181_1_americans-hindus-white-evangelicals|title=Americans turn to Hindu beliefs|accessdate=Dec 1, 2012 | work=The Times Of India|date=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life survey of 2009, 24% of Americans believe in reincarnation, a core concept of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2015/10/21/25-percent-us-christians-believe-reincarnation-whats-wrong-picture|title=25 percent of US Christians believe in reincarnation.

==Demographics==
The [[United States Department of State]]'s Religious Freedom Report 2004&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/ International Religious Freedom Report 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; found some 1.5 million adherents of Hinduism, corresponding to 0.50% of the total population. The Hindu population of USA is the world's [[hinduism by country|eighth-largest]]; 10% of [[Asian Americans]] who together account for 5.8% of US population, are followers of the Hindu faith.&lt;ref name="JUL12PRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/Asian-Americans-A-Mosaic-of-Faiths-overview.aspx |title=Asian Americans: A Mosaic of Faiths |date=19 July 2012 |work=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hinduism is practised mainly by immigrants from [[India]],[[Guyana]] etc,a sizeble  amount of Hindus in United States were converts to Hinduism.According to the Pew research estimates, 9% of the Hindus in United States belong to a non-Asian ethnicity - 4% of the Hindus in United States were [[White]], 2% were [[black]], 1% [[latino]] and 2% Mixed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/hindu/#trend-5&lt;/ref&gt;
Converts to Hinduism include Hollywood actress [[Julia Roberts]], actor [[Russell Brand]] etc

==Contemporary status and Public Opinion==

==History==
[[Anandibai Joshi]] is believed to be the first [[Hinduism|Hindu]] woman to set foot on American soil, arriving in New York in June 1883 at the age of 19. She graduated with an MD from the [[Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania]] on 11 March 1886, becoming the first female of South Asian origin to graduate with a degree in Western medicine from the United States.  Joshi returned to India in late 1886 but died within months of her return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pri.org/stories/2013-07-12/historical-photos-depict-women-medical-pioneers |title=Historical Photos Depict Women Medical Pioneers |publisher=Public Radio International |date=12 July 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swami Vivekananda at Parliament of Religions.jpg|thumb |left| [[Swami Vivekananda]] on the Platform of the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893]]
One of the first major discussions of Hinduism in the United States was [[Swami Vivekananda]]'s address to the [[World's Parliament of Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893. He spent two years in the United States, and lectured in several cities including Detroit, Boston, and New York. In 1902 [[Swami Rama Tirtha]] visited the US for about two years lecturing on the philosophy of [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Arora, R.K. (1978), Swami Ram Tirath, his life and works, page 56, Rajesh Publications, New Delhi, India&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] was India's delegate at the International Congress of Religious Liberals held in Boston.

Prior to 1965, Hindu immigration to the United States was minuscule and isolated, with fewer than fifty thousand Indians immigrating before 1965. It is worth noting that although most of these immigrants were [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]]s, they were incorrectly and derogatorily referred to as "Hindoo" by many Americans, as well as in some official immigration documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asian Americans: An Interpretive History|last = Chan|first = Sucheng|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bellingham Riots]] in [[Bellingham, Washington]] on September 5, 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the USA for Indians and Hindus. In the 1923 case [[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]], the Supreme Court ruled that Thind and other South Asians were not "free white persons" according to a 1790 federal law that stated that only white immigrants could apply for naturalized citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coulson|first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v. Thind Revisited|journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Modern Critical Race Perspectives|date=2015|volume=7|pages=1–42|ssrn=2610266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] prohibited the immigration of Asians such as Middle Easterners and Indians.  This further prevented Hindus from immigrating to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann, Numrich, Williams|first=Gurinder, Paul, Raymond|title=Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs in America : A Short History|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC, USA|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite such events, some people, including professionals, stayed and worked until the [[Immigration and Nationality Services (INS) Act of 1965]] was passed. This opened the doors to Hindu immigrants who wished to work and start families in the United States. It included [[Brahmins|Hindu preachers]] as well, who spread awareness of the religion among the people who had little or no contact with it.

Also during the 1960s, Hindu teachers found resonance in the US [[counter-culture]], leading to the formation of a number of [[Hinduism in the West#Hindu-oriented movements in the west after 1950|Neo-Hindu]] movements such as the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] founded by [[Swami Prabhupada]]. People involved in the [[counter-culture]] such as [[Ram Dass]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]] were influential in the spread of Hinduism in the United States. [[Ram Dass]] was a Harvard professor known as [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]] and after being fired from Harvard was receiving a lot of media coverage. He traveled to India and studied under [[Neem Karoli Baba]] and came back to the west as a Hindu teacher and changed his name to [[Ram Dass]] which means servant of [[Rama]] (one of the Hindu gods). A student of [[Ram Dass]], [[Krishna Das (singer)|Jeffery Kagel]], devoted his life to Hinduism in the sixties and is now making many CDs chanting the sacred [[mantra]]s or spiritual verses. He has been very successful and is considered the rock star of yoga. George Harrison was a member of [[The Beatles]] which in its peak of popularity was receiving more media coverage than any other band in the world. He became a devotee of [[Swami Prabhupada]] who is the founder of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] (mentioned above). George Harrison started to record songs with the words "[[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hari Krishna]]" in the lyrics and was widely responsible for popularizing Hinduism in America with the younger generation of the time. [[Allen Ginsberg]], the author of [[Howl]], became a figure in the sixties that was also heavily involved with Hinduism and it was said that he chanted "[[Om]]" at [[Human Be-In|The Human Be-in]] of 1967 for hours on end.

'''''Irrational Man: A Study In Existential Philosophy''''' is a 1958 book by the philosopher [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]], in which the author explains the philosophical background of [[existentialism]] and provides a discussion of several major existentialist thinkers, including [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. ''Irrational Man'' helped to introduce existentialism to the English-speaking world and has been identified as one of the most useful books that discuss the subject, but Barrett has also been criticized for endorsing irrationality and for giving a distorted and misleading account of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

==Summary==
Barrett discusses existentialism and its background, including the philosophical tradition to which existentialism was a reaction. He outlines the views of philosophers from [[Plato]] to Hegel, and tracing the development of ideas about [[being]], [[ontology]], and [[metaphysics]]. He also attempts to explain how developments in science, economics, and religion provided the background to existentialism. According to Barrett, "With [[Protestantism]] begins that long modern struggle, which reaches its culmination in the twentieth century, to strip man naked." In his view, "as the modern world moves onward, it becomes more and more secularized in every department of life; faith consequently becomes attenuated, and Protestant man begins to look more and more like a gaunt skeleton, a sculpture by [[Alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]]. A secular civilization leaves him more starkly naked than the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[Reformation]] had ever dreamed." Barrett writes that during the modern period, there has emerged "an image of man himself that bears a new, stark, more nearly naked, and more questionable aspect. The contraction of man's horizons amounts to a denudation, a stripping down, of this being who has now to confront himself at the center of all his horizons. The labor of modern culture, wherever it has been authentic, has been a labor of denudation." Surveying trends in art, Barrett writes that the [[Dada]] movement was "one of the ''valid'' eruptions of the irrational in this century."{{sfn|Barrett|1977|pages=1–35, 40}}

Four existentialist thinkers - Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre - receive extended discussion from Barrett, who explains their main ideas and philosophical terminology. Barrett more briefly discusses other existentialist thinkers such as [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and [[Albert Camus]], as well as some artists and writers he considers existentialist, such as the Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], whom he compares to Nietzsche, crediting him with anticipating Nietzsche's insights into the [[will to power]] in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866).{{sfn|Barrett|1977|pages=133–234}}

Discussing Kierkegaard, Barrett maintains that the Danish philosopher is relevant even to non-Christians because of his "appeal to their own existence." Barrett writes that, "Being a Christian, after all, is one way of being a man - for Kierkegaard personally it was the only way - and to have this way illumined, to be summoned to its tasks, is also to be called on to be a man, however divergent our own choice of a way may be." Barrett adds that, "Kierkegaard stated the question of [[Christianity]] so nakedly, made it turn so decisively about the individual and his quest for his own eternal happiness, that all religious writers after him seem by comparison to be symbolical, institutional, or metaphorical - in a word, gnostic. Perhaps the very nakedness of Kierkegaard's statement of faith makes it impossible for Christianity to go anywhere but in the direction of some kind of [[gnosticism]]."{{sfn|Barrett|1977|pages=136, 156}}

In his discussion of Nietzsche, Barrett writes that, "Nietzsche's fate is one the great episodes in man's historic effect to know himself. After him, the problem of man could never quite return to its pre-Nietzschean level." Barrett calls ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1883-1891) Nietzsche's "most lyrical book" and "the expression of the loneliest Nietzsche."{{sfn|Barrett|1977|pages=160, 168}}

Finally, Barrett applies existentialist thought to the world of the late 1950s, during the [[Cold War]]. ''Irrational Man'' includes two appendices, "Negation, Finitude, and the Nature of Man", which reprints a 1957 paper by Barrett, and "Existence and Analytic Philosophers", a highly technical discussion of existentialism in relation to [[analytic philosophy]].{{sfn|Barrett|1977|pages=251–271}}

==Publication history==
''Irrational Man'' was first published in 1958 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.]] Later editions include those published by [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press, Inc.]] in 1977 and [[Random House|Anchor Books]] in 1990.{{sfn|Barrett|1977|page=iv}}{{sfn|Barrett|1990|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Irrational Man'' received a positive review from Robert Jordan in ''[[The Nation]]''.{{sfn|Jordan|1958|pages=431–432}} Later discussions of the book include those by Paul Stuewe in ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'',{{sfn|Stuewe|1986|page=50}} Andrew Pulver in ''[[The Guardian]]'',{{sfn|Pulver|2015}} and John Williams in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.{{sfn|Williams|2016|page=4}}

Jordan described the book as a "spirited defense" of the methods and conclusions of existentialist philosophy.{{sfn|Jordan|1958|pages=431–432}} Stuewe described it as "perhaps the best popular book on existentialism".{{sfn|Stuewe|1986|page=50}} Pulver identified the book as an influence on filmmaker [[Woody Allen]], observing that the title of his film ''[[Irrational Man (film)|Irrational Man]]'' (2015) is clearly inspired by Barrett's book, which "no doubt formed part of Allen’s self-taught intellectual life in the late 50s and early 60s".{{sfn|Pulver|2015}}

===Evaluations in books===
The theologian [[John Macquarrie]], writing in ''Existentialism'' (1972), described ''Irrational Man'' as one of the most useful books about existentialism.{{sfn|Macquarrie|1973|page=239}} The [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], writing in  ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'' (1982), presented ''Irrational Man'' as an example of a prominent philosopher endorsing irrationality, citing Barrett's comments about Dada.{{sfn|Peikoff|1982|page=182}} The philosopher [[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Jon Stewart]], writing in his anthology ''The Hegel Myths and Legends'' (1996), accused Barrett of caricaturing, and propagating myths about, Hegel. Stewart deemed Barrett guilty of misrepresenting Hegel as a "cosmic rationalist" who, like [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and some romantics, believed in a metaphysical world soul.{{sfn|Stewart|1996|page=306, 381}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4465">'''Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan''' ({{lang-pt|João Jacinto de Magalhães}}) (1723–1790) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], Portugal.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=17780|title=Magellan, Jean Hyacinthe de|first=R. W.|last=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have been brought up at Lisbon, where he became a monk of the order of St. Augustine, and was pursuing his studies in the Portuguese capital when the city was destroyed by the [[earthquake of 1755]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Magellan, Jean Hyacinthe de|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 40 Magellan abandoned the monastic life. About 1764 he appears to have reached England and was in communication with Da Costa of the [[Royal Society]] in 1766. For some time he acted as tutor on continental tours, and made the acquaintance of leading scholars of the day, especially in the [[Netherlands]]. Magellan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1774, and was a corresponding member of the academies of science in Paris, Madrid, and St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; 
[[File:Astromical pendulum clock.JPG|thumb|Astronomical clock made by Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan, now in Helsinki]]

In June 1778 Magellan was at [[Ermenonville]], the seat of the Marquis de Gerardin, and there, with M. du Presle, he visited [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] a few days before his death on 2 July. He added a postscript describing his visit to Du Presle's ''Relation des derniers Jours de J. J. Rousseau'', London, 1778. Magellan settled in London soon afterwards. He was for some time engaged in superintending the construction of a set of astronomical and meteorological instruments for the court of Madrid, which he described in 1779. He devoted his last years to the construction of instruments including thermometers and barometers. He made a clock for the blind [[Louis Engelbert, 6th Duke of Arenberg]], which indicated by bells the hours and other readings.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Among Magellan's friends was the Hungarian count [[Maurice Benyovszky]]. About 1784 the count borrowed a large sum from  Magellan, and was soon afterwards shot as a pirate by the French in [[Madagascar]]. Magellan never recovered the money. He died on 7 February 1790, after more than a year's illness and was buried in Islington churchyard. Although there are claims that, due to his laxity and unorthodoxy, he renounced his faith, his correspondence and other sources confirm he never gave up Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;The Private Life and Character of Physicist John Hyacinth de Magellan (1722-1790) http://www.sbhc.org.br/arquivo/download?ID_ARQUIVO=54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Magellan's major works were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Collection de différens Traités sur des Instrumens d'Astronomie'',  1775–80. 
* ''Description des Octants et Sextants Anglois'', dedicated to [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], 1775. 
* ''Description of a Glass Apparatus for Making Mineral Waters'', 1777; 3rd edit. 1783. 
* ''Description et Usages des nouveaux Baromètres pour mesurer la Hauteur des Montagnes et la Profondeur des Mines'', 1779. 
* ''Essai sur la nouvelle Théorie du Feu élémentaire, et de la Chaleur des Corps'', 1780. 
* ''An Essay towards a System of Mineralogy'', 1788. 
* ''Mémoires de Maurice Auguste, Comte de Benyowsky''.

Magellan also wrote articles in the ''Journal de Physique'', 1778–83. On the title-page of his translation of [[Axel Fredrik Cronstedt]]'s ''System of Mineralogy'', 1788, he assumed the appellation "Talabrico-Lusitanus".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Magellan gave Count Benyovszky's memoirs to [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], who published them in English in 1790. Magellan's French version of the memoirs appeared after his death, and letters of Magellan to Benyowsky were published in [[Mór Jókai]]'s edition of the count's memoirs.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

The [[Magellanic Premium]], a prize given for advances in navigation, was established in 1786 by a grant given by him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/exhibits/magellan/magprem.htm The Magellanic Premium]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32654">[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]] in 1800]]
'''Jeffersonian democracy''', named after its advocate [[Thomas Jefferson]], was one of two dominant political outlooks and movements in the United States from the 1790s to the 1820s. The term was commonly used to refer to the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] (formally named the "Republican Party"), which Jefferson founded in opposition to the [[Federalist Party]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Jeffersonians were deeply committed to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], which meant opposition to aristocracy of any form, opposition to corruption, and insistence on virtue, with a priority for the "[[yeoman farmer]]", "[[Plantations in the American South|planters]]", and the [[Plain Folk of the Old South|"plain folk"]].

They were antagonistic to the aristocratic elitism of merchants, bankers, and manufacturers, distrusted factory workers, and were on the watch for supporters of the dreaded British system of government.  Jeffersonian democracy persisted as an element of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] into the early 20th century, as exemplified by the rise of [[Jacksonian democracy]] and the three presidential candidacies of [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Its themes continue to echo in the 21st century, particularly among the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William S. Dietrich|first=|title=In the Shadow of the Rising Sun: The Political Roots of American Economic Decline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8dBZ5n1gGsAC&amp;pg=PA165|year=2008|publisher=Penn State Press|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Taylor, ''Where Did the Party Go?: William Jennings Bryan, Hubert Humphrey, and the Jeffersonian Legacy'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Jeffersonian era, only two states (Vermont and Kentucky) had established universal white male suffrage by abolishing property requirements. By the end of the period, more than half of the states had followed suit, including virtually all of the states in the [[Old Northwest]]. States then also moved on to allowing popular votes for presidential elections, canvassing voters in a more modern style. Jefferson's party, known today as the Democratic-Republican Party, was then in full control of the apparatus of government''—''from the state legislature and city hall to the White House.

==Positions==
{{Periods in US history}}
Jefferson has been called "the most democratic of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding fathers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, et al. eds. ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeffersonians advocated a narrow interpretation of the Constitution's [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] provisions granting powers to the federal government. They strenuously opposed the [[Federalist Party]], led by Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]]. President [[George Washington]] generally supported Hamilton's program for a financially strong national government. The [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of Jefferson in 1800]], which he called "the revolution of 1800", brought in the [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson]] and the permanent eclipse of the Federalists, apart from the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Horn, Jan Ellen Lewis and Peter S. Onuf, eds. ''The Revolution of 1800: Democracy, Race, and the New Republic'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jeffersonian democracy" is an umbrella term and some factions favored some positions more than others. While principled, with vehemently held core beliefs, the Jeffersonians had factions that disputed the true meaning of their creed. For example, during the [[War of 1812]] it became apparent that independent state militia units were inadequate for conducting a serious war against a major country. The new Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]], a Jeffersonian, proposed to build up the Army. With the support of most Republicans in Congress, he got his way.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard D. White, ''The Jeffersonians: A study in administrative history 1801–1829'' (1951) pp. 214, 248–49&lt;/ref&gt; However, the "Old Republican" faction, claiming to be true to the Jeffersonian [[Principles of '98]], fought him and reduced the size of the Army after Spain sold Florida to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael S. |last=Fitzgerald |title=Rejecting Calhoun's Expansible Army Plan: the Army Reduction Act of 1821 |journal=War in History |year=1996 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=161–85 |doi=10.1177/096834459600300202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians characterize Jeffersonian democracy as including the following core ideals:
* The core political value of America is [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]''—''citizens have a civic duty to aid the state and resist corruption, especially monarchism and aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Banning, ''Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology'' (1978) pp. 79–90&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jeffersonian values are best expressed through an organized political party. The Jeffersonian party was officially the "Republican Party" (political scientists later called it the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] to differentiate it from the later Republican Party of Lincoln).&lt;ref&gt;Noble E. Cunningham, ''The Jeffersonian party to 1801: a study of the formation of a party organization'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was the duty of citizens to vote and the Jeffersonians invented many modern campaign techniques designed to get out the vote. Turnout indeed soared across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz,  ''The Rise of American democracy'' (2006) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[John J. Beckley]], Jefferson's agent in Pennsylvania, set new standards in the 1790s. In the 1796 presidential election, he blanketed the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). Historians consider Beckley to be one of the first American professional campaign managers and his techniques were quickly adopted in other states.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Pasley, "'A Journeyman, Either in Law or Politics': John Beckley and the Social Origins of Political Campaigning," ''Journal of the Early Republic'' Vol. 16, No. 4 (Winter, 1996), pp. 531–69 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3124417 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Federalist Party]], especially its leader [[Alexander Hamilton]], was the arch-foe because of its acceptance of aristocracy and British methods.
* The national government is a dangerous necessity to be instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or community''—''it should be watched closely and circumscribed in its powers. Most [[Anti-Federalism|anti-Federalists]] from 1787–1788 joined the Jeffersonians.&lt;ref&gt;Banning (1978) pp. 105–15&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Separation of church and state]] is the best method to keep government free of religious disputes and religion free from corruption by government.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hamburger, ''Separation of church and state'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The federal government must not violate the [[individual liberty|rights of individuals]]. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] is a central theme.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allen Rutland; ''The Birth of the Bill of Rights, 1776–1791'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The federal government must not violate the [[States' rights|rights of the states]]. The [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] of 1798 (written secretly by Jefferson and [[James Madison]]) proclaim these principles.&lt;ref&gt;Banning (1978) pp. 264–66&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|the press]] are the best methods to prevent tyranny over the people by their own government.  The Federalists' violation of this freedom through the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] of 1798 became a major issue.&lt;ref&gt;Banning (1978) pp. 255–66&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[yeoman]] farmer best exemplifies [[civic virtue]] and independence from corrupting city influences''—''government policy should be for his benefit. Financiers, bankers and industrialists make cities the "cesspools of corruption" and should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick.  (1995) ch 5; Wallace Hettle, ''The Peculiar Democracy: Southern Democrats in Peace and Civil War'' (2001)  p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Constitution We the People.jpg|thumb|220px|"[[We the People]]" in an original edition of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]]]
* The [[United States Constitution]] was written in order to ensure the freedom of the people. However, as Jefferson wrote to James Madison in 1789, "no society can make a perpetual constitution or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation".&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson letter to James Madison, September 6, 1789  | http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl81.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* All men have the right to be informed and thus to have a say in the government.  The protection and expansion of human liberty was one of the chief goals of the Jeffersonians. They also reformed their respective state systems of education. They believed that their citizens had a right to an education no matter their circumstance or status in life.&lt;ref&gt;Roy J. Honeywell, "A Note on the Educational Work of Thomas Jefferson," ''History of Education Quarterly,'' Winter 1969, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp. 64–72 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/367130 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* The judiciary should be subservient to the elected branches and the Supreme Court should not have the power to strike down laws passed by Congress. The Jeffersonians lost this battle to Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], a Federalist, who dominated the Court from 1801 to his death in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kent Newmyer, ''John Marshall and the Heroic Age of the Supreme Court'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Jeffersonians also had a distinct foreign policy:&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson, ''Empire of Liberty: The Statecraft of Thomas Jefferson'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
** Americans had a duty to spread what Jefferson called the "[[Empire of Liberty]]" to the world, but should avoid "[[United States non-interventionism|entangling alliances]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Kaplan, ''Entangling alliances with none: American foreign policy in the age of Jefferson'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
** Britain was the greatest threat, especially its monarchy, aristocracy, corruption and business methods''—''the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794 was much too favorable to Britain and thus threatened American values.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Estes, ''The Jay Treaty Debate, Public Opinion, and the Evolution of Early American Political Culture'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
** At least in the early stages of the [[French Revolution]], France was the ideal European nation. According to Michael Hardt, "Jefferson's support of the French Revolution often serves in his mind as a defense of republicanism against the monarchism of the Anglophiles".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardt, "Jefferson and Democracy,"  ''American Quarterly'' 59.1 (2007) pp. 41–78, quote on p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Napoleon was the antithesis of republicanism and could not be supported.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill D. Peterson, "Thomas Jefferson and the French Revolution," ''Tocqueville Review – La Revue Tocqueville,'' Jan 1987, Vol. 9, pp. 15–25&lt;/ref&gt;
** Louisiana and the Mississippi River were critical to American national interests. Control by Spain was tolerable''—''control by France was unacceptable. See [[Louisiana Purchase]].
** A [[standing army]] and navy are dangerous to liberty and should be avoided''—''much better was to use [[economic coercion]] such as the [[embargo]].&lt;ref&gt;Banning (1978) pp. 292–93&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Embargo Act of 1807]].
** The militia was adequate to defend the nation. During the Revolutionary War previously, a national conflict, in this case the [[War of 1812]], required the creation of a national army for the duration of international hostilities.

===Westward expansion===
[[Territorial expansion of the United States of America|Territorial expansion of the United States]] was a major goal of the Jeffersonians because it would produce new farm lands for yeomen farmers. The Jeffersonians wanted to integrate the Indians into American society, or remove further west those tribes that refused to integrate. However Sheehan (1974) argues that the Jeffersonians, with the best of goodwill toward the Indians, destroyed their distinctive cultures with its misguided benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard W. Sheehan, ''Seeds of Extinction: Jeffersonian Philanthropy and the American Indian'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:louisiana purchase treaty.jpg|thumb|The original treaty of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]]]
The Jeffersonians took enormous pride in the bargain they reached with France in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. It opened up vast new fertile farmlands from Louisiana to Montana. Jefferson saw the West as an economic safety valve which would allow people in the crowded East to own farms.&lt;ref&gt;The Lewis &amp; Clark, Fort Mandan Foundation.  "Show 1048 – Redistribution." ''The Thomas Jefferson Hour''.  Prairie Public Radio: 27 October 2013.  Web.  30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, established New England political interests feared the growth of the West and a majority in the [[Federalist Party]] opposed the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez, ''The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia'' (2002) pp. 106, 253–54&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffersonians thought the new territory would help maintain their vision of the ideal republican society, based on agricultural commerce, governed lightly and promoting self-reliance and virtue.&lt;ref name="White1991"&gt;{{cite book

The Jeffersonians' dream did not come to pass as the Louisiana Purchase was a turning point in the history of [[American imperialism]]. The farmers with whom Jefferson identified conquered the West, often through violence against Native Americans. Jefferson himself sympathized with Native Americans, but that did not stop him from enacting policies that would continue the trend towards the dispossession of their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson. [http://jeffersonhour.com/blog/1247 "#1247 On My Doorstep."] Podcast.  The Thomas Jefferson Hour.  The Thomas Jefferson Hour, 15 August 2017.  Web.  17 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Jeffersonian agrarians held that the [[economy of the United States]] should rely more on [[agriculture]] for strategic commodities than on [[industry]]. Jefferson specifically believed: "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if He ever had a chosen people, whose breast He has made His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue".&lt;ref name="Jefferson1900"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Jefferson|editor=John P. Foley|title=The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia: A Comprehensive Collection Of The Views Of Thomas Jefferson Classified And Arranged In Alphabetical Order Under Nine Thousand Titles Relating To Government, Politics, Law, Education, Political Economy, Finance, Science, Art, Literature, Religious Freedom, Morals, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2D0gAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA532|accessdate=26 March 2010|year=1900|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls company|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jeffersonian ideals are not opposed to all manufacturing, rather he believed that all people have the right to work to provide for their own subsistence and that an economic system which undermines that right is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's belief was that unlimited expansion of commerce and industry would lead to the growth of a class of wage laborers who relied on others for income and sustenance. The workers would no longer be independent voters. Such a situation, Jefferson feared, would leave the American people vulnerable to political subjugation and economic manipulation. The solution Jefferson came up with was, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, "a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward" as well as tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2D0gAAAAIAAJ "The Jeffersonian cyclopedia."] &lt;blockquote&gt;These revenues will be levied entirely on the rich . ... The Rich alone use imported article, and on these alone the whole taxes of the General Government are levied. The poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the General Government, but on his salt; and should we go into that manufacture also, as is probable, he will pay nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Jefferson was against international trade. He believed that not only would economic dependence on Europe diminish the virtue of the republic, but that the United States had an abundance of natural resources that Americans should be able to cultivate and use to tend to their own needs. Furthermore, exporting goods by merchant ships created risks of capture by foreign pirates and armies, which would require an expensive navy for protection.&lt;ref name = "Jenkinson1253" /&gt;

===Limited government===
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|175px|right|
Jefferson's thoughts on limited government were influenced by the 17th century English political philosopher [[John Locke]] (pictured).
]]
While the Federalists advocated for a strong central government, Jeffersonians argued for strong state and local governments and a weak federal government.&lt;ref name="Ketcham" /&gt; Self-sufficiency, self-government and individual responsibility were in the Jeffersonian worldview among the most important ideals that formed the basis of the [[American Revolution]]. In Jefferson's opinion, nothing that could feasibly be accomplished by individuals at the local level ought to be accomplished by the federal government.  The federal government would concentrate its efforts solely on national and international projects.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson36" /&gt; Jefferson's advocacy of limited government led to sharp disagreements with [[Federalist]] figures such as [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Jefferson felt that Hamilton favored [[plutocracy]] and the creation of a powerful aristocracy in the United States which would accumulate increasingly greater power until the political and social order of the United States became indistinguishable from those of the Old World.&lt;ref name="Ketcham" /&gt;

After initial skepticism, Jefferson supported the [[ratification of the United States Constitution]] and especially supported its stress on [[checks and balances]]. The ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], especially the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], gave Jefferson even greater confidence in the document.&lt;ref name="Ketcham"&gt;Ketcham, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffersonians favored a [[strict constructionism|strict construction]] interpretation of federal government powers described in Article I of the Constitution. For example, Jefferson once wrote a letter to [[Charles Willson Peale]] explaining that although a Smithsonian-style national museum would be a wonderful resource, he could not support the use of federal funds to construct and maintain such a project.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson36"&gt;Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; The "strict constructionism" of today is a remote descendant of Jefferson's views.

==Politics and factions==
[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of James Madison|[[James Madison]]]]
[[File:James Monroe White House portrait 1819.jpg|thumb|[[James Monroe]]]]
The spirit of Jeffersonian democracy dominated American politics from 1800 to 1824, the [[First Party System]], under Jefferson and succeeding presidents [[James Madison]] and [[James Monroe]]. The Jeffersonians proved much more successful than the Federalists in building state and local party organizations that united various factions.&lt;ref&gt;Noble E. Cunningham Jr. ''The Jeffersonian Republicans in Power: Party Operations, 1801–1809'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; Voters in every state formed blocs loyal to the Jeffersonian coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Andrew W.|title=Afterword: Reconceptualizing Jeffersonian Democracy|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|date=Summer 2013|volume=33|issue=2|pages=317–334|url= https://muse.jhu.edu/article/504777|doi=10.1353/jer.2013.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent spokesmen for Jeffersonian principles included Madison, [[Albert Gallatin]], [[John Randolph of Roanoke]],  [[Nathaniel Macon]], [[John Taylor of Caroline]]&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin F. Wright, "The Philosopher of Jeffersonian Democracy," ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 22, No. 4 (Nov. 1928), pp. 870–92 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1945352 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Monroe]], as well as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]] (with the last three taking new paths after 1828).

Randolph was the Jeffersonian leader in Congress from 1801 to 1815, but he later broke with Jefferson and formed his own "[[Tertium Quids]]" faction because he thought the president no longer adhered to the true Jeffersonian principles of 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carson|first1=David A.|title=That Ground Called Quiddism: John Randolph's War with the Jefferson Administration|journal=Journal of American Studies|date=April 1986|volume=20|issue=1|pages=71–92|jstor=27554706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quids wanted to actively punish and discharge Federalists in the government and in the courts. Jefferson himself sided with the moderate faction exemplified by figures such as Madison, who were much more conciliatory towards Federalism.&lt;ref name = "Jenkinson1253"&gt;Jenkinson. [http://jeffersonhour.com/blog/1253 "#1253 Second Term."] Podcast. The Thomas Jefferson Hour. The Thomas Jefferson Hour, 26 September 2017. Web. 26 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Madison administration experienced serious trouble financing the [[War of 1812]] and discovered the Army and militia were unable to make war effectively, a new generation of Republican nationalists emerged. They were supported by President [[James Monroe]], an original Jeffersonian; and included [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Henry Clay]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]. In 1824, Adams defeated [[Andrew Jackson]], who had support from the Quids; and in a few years two successor parties had emerged, the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which  formulated [[Jacksonian democracy]] and which still exists; and Henry Clay's [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. Their competition marked the [[Second Party System]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McCormick, ''The Second American Party System: Party Formation in the Jacksonian Era'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1830, the principles were still talked about but did not form the basis of a political party, thus editor [[Horace Greeley]] in 1838 started a magazine, ''The Jeffersonian,'' that he said "would exhibit a practical regard for that cardinal principle of Jeffersonian Democracy, and the People are the sole and safe depository of all power, principles and opinions which are to direct the Government".&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''The Jeffersonian'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3YZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22jeffersonian+democracy%22&amp;dq=%22jeffersonian+democracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4gxqTtqeDcSPsQKfrpTSBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ 1838 vol. 1 p. 287]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jefferson and Jeffersonian principles==
Jeffersonian democracy was not a one-man operation. It was a large political party with many local and state leaders and various factions, and they did not always agree with Jefferson or with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Padraig Riley, ''Northern Republicans and southern slavery: Democracy in the age of Jefferson, 1800–1819'' (2007) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson was accused of inconsistencies by his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Johnstone, ''Jefferson and the Presidency: leadership in the young Republic'' (1978) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The "Old Republicans" said that he abandoned the Principles of 1798. He believed the national security concerns were so urgent that it was necessary to purchase Louisiana without waiting for a Constitutional amendment. He enlarged federal power through the intrusively-enforced [[Embargo Act of 1807]]. He idealized the "yeoman farmer" despite being himself a gentleman plantation owner.  The disparities between Jefferson's philosophy and practice have been noted by numerous historians. Staaloff proposed that it was due to his being a proto-[[Romanticism|Romantic]];&lt;ref&gt;Staaloff, ''Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson'', pp.&amp;nbsp;285–92&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Quincy Adams]] claimed that it was a manifestation of pure hypocrisy, or "pliability of principle";&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''To Begin the World Anew: The Genius and Ambiguities of the American Founders'' (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;38&lt;/ref&gt; and Bailyn asserts it simply represented a contradiction with Jefferson, that he was "simultaneously a radical utopian idealist and a hardheaded, adroit, at times cunning politician".&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jenkinson argued that Jefferson's personal failings ought not to influence present day thinkers to disregard Jeffersonian ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kuehnelt-Leddihn]], a European nobleman who opposed democracy, argues that "Jeffersonian democracy" is a misnomer because Jefferson was not a democrat, but in fact believed in rule by an elite: "Jefferson actually was an Agrarian Romantic who dreamt of a republic governed by an elite of character and intellect".&lt;ref name="Erik"&gt;[[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]].  [https://mises.org/books/liberty.pdf ''Liberty or Equality: The Challenge of Our Time''] (1952) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Sean Wilentz]] argues that as a practical politician elected to serve the people Jefferson had to negotiate solutions, not insist on his own version of abstract positions. The result, Wilentz argues, was "flexible responses to unforeseen events ... in pursuit of ideals ranging from the enlargement of opportunities for the mass of ordinary, industrious Americans to the principled avoidance of war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean Wilentz]], ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2006) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have long portrayed the contest between Jefferson and Hamilton as iconic for the politics, political philosophy, economic policies and future direction of the United States. In 2010, [[Sean Wilentz|Wilentz]] identified a scholarly trend in Hamilton's favor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years, Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars who portray him as the visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by an energetic executive. Jefferson and his allies, by contrast, have come across as naïve, dreamy idealists. At best according to many historians, the Jeffersonians were reactionary utopians who resisted the onrush of capitalist modernity in hopes of turning America into a yeoman farmers' [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadia]]. At worst, they were proslavery racists who wish to rid the West of Indians, expand the empire of slavery, and keep political power in local hands – all the better to expand the institution of slavery and protect slaveholders' rights to own human property.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean Wilentz]], "Book Reviews", ''Journal of American History'' Sept. 2010 v. 97# 2 p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jeremy Nicholas Butterfield''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 1954) is a philosopher at the [[University of Cambridge]], noted particularly for his work on philosophical aspects of [[quantum field theory|quantum theory]], [[relativity theory]] and [[classical mechanics]].

==Biography==
Butterfield obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1984; he was supervised by [[D.H. Mellor|Hugh Mellor]] and [[David Malament]]. He was a lecturer in the philosophy faculty at Cambridge University and was later promoted to reader in 1997. In 1998, he became a senior research fellow at [[All Souls College]] at the [[University of Oxford]]; he returned to the University of Cambridge in his present position in 2006. He has held visiting positions at [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Sydney]].

Butterfield is a fellow of the [[British Academy]] and a senior research fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He is a past president of the [[British Society for the Philosophy of Science]], and of the [[Mind Association]]. He previously served on the governing board of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] and on the executive committee of the British Philosophical Association. He co-founded the journal ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', and edited it until 2001. He serves on the editorial boards of several journals and book series.

==Research==
Butterfield's research centres around a variety of topics in the [[philosophy of physics]] and [[philosophy of science]], and he has also made contributions to the [[philosophy of language]] and [[logic]], particularly with regard to the treatment of time and tense. In this regard, he has argued in several papers for a ''detensed'' theory of time, according to which the present is a merely subjective or indexical notion, on analogy with one's spatial location.

In the philosophy of quantum theory, Butterfield has proposed several clarifications of the notions of locality operative in algebraic quantum field theories (especially 'stochastic Einstein locality'), and has investigated which of these clarified versions of locality hold in those theories.  He has also investigated the impact of the [[Bell inequalities]] in the light of [[Hans Reichenbach|Reichenbach]]'s principle of the common cause, and has argued that the violation of these inequalities implies causation between the space-like separated wings of a Bell experiment.  In addition, he has written on the [[quantum measurement problem]], and the implications for it due to, and of it for, the philosophy and science of consciousness. He has also investigated the problems of localizability in relativistic quantum theories, in collaboration with Gordon Fleming.

In the philosophy of spacetime physics, Butterfield has argued for a resolution of Einstein's 1913 [[hole argument]] that preserves spacetime substantivalism by utilizing [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s theory of modal counterparts.  More recently, he has appealed to tensor calculus, and its use in much of contemporary physics, to argue against the popular view (propounded by David Lewis) that the world may be described in terms of 'local matters of fact'; i.e. in terms of chiefly intrinsic properties instantiated at spatial or spatio-temporal points.

In the philosophy of [[classical mechanics]], Butterfield has investigated the elimination of descriptively redundant formal elements through ''symplectic reduction'', and the interdependence between conserved quantities and conservation laws.  He has also made several appeals in his work, on classical mechanics and other physical theories, to the importance of an appreciation of ''modality'' in physics.

In several papers, Butterfield has collaborated with the theoretical physicist [[Chris Isham]].  These address the role of [[topos theory]] in understanding quantum theory (in particular the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]]), and the status of time in the various quantum gravity research programmes.

In recent years, Butterfield has argued for a reconciliation of the idea of ''emergence'' – the idea that novel structures, not described by "fundamental" theories, appear at a certain level of complexity – with the possibility of inter-theoretic reduction. He has illustrated the reconciliation in various areas such as phase transitions, renormalization, and gauge theories. He has also worked, often in collaboration with research students, on other topics, including: (i) identity and individuation of systems in quantum physics; (ii) dualities especially gauge/gravity duality; (iii) under-determination, and scientific realism, in modern cosmology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5481">'''Leonardo Moledo''' (February 20, 1947 – August 9, 2014) was an Argentine writer and philosopher.

==Life and work==
[[File:200908261632-Special event-Knowledge as a social good and the Library of Babel.ogv|thumb|Leonardo Moledo (left) and Enrique Chaparro  host a symposium on "knowledge as a social asset and the [[Library of Babel]]" during [[Wikimania 2009]], in Buenos Aires.]]
Leonardo Moledo was born in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1947. He enrolled at the public secondary school, the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires|National College of Buenos Aires]]. He was accepted into the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he received a degree from the School of Natural and Exact Sciences.

Moledo was later a research fellow at the [[CONICET|National Research Council]], during which time he earned a History Degree at the University of Buenos Aires. He wrote his first novel ''La mala guita'' (''Dirty Money'') in 1976 and in 1985, ''Verídico informe sobre la ciudad de Bree'' (''True Report on the City of [[Bree, Belgium|Bree]]''). That year, he premiered his first play, ''Las reglas del juego'' (''The Rules of the Game'') at the important [[Centro Cultural General San Martín|San Martín Cultural Centre]]. He premiered his only other published play, ''El regreso al hogar'' (''Returning Home''), in 1987.

Moledo became well-known among local readers for his tales of [[science fiction]], which were regularly published in magazines popular among young readers (''El Péndulo'' and ''Minotauro''), as well as in the cultural sections of leading Buenos Aires dailies such as [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'']] and ''[[Página/12]]''. Some of the most notable among these articles were ''Agenda Científica'' and ''Un viaje por el universo'' (''A Journey Through the Universe''). He also hosted ''Ciencia y Conciencia'' (''Science and Conscience''), a [[Television in Argentina|television]] program on the subject which aired on the public [[Canal 7 Argentina|Channel 13]], in 1989.  The popularity of his articles led Moledo to begin writing books of [[cognitive science]], which he viewed as "furthering science, by other means." &lt;ref name=viva&gt;[http://www.quimicaviva.qb.fcen.uba.ar/v4n1/moledo.htm Entrevista a Leonardo Moledo {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, Moledo has authored numerous books in that genre, including:

*'''''De las Tortugas a las estrellas''''' (''From Tortoises to the Stars'', 1995) 
*'''''La evolución''''' (''Evolution'', 1995) 
*'''''El Big Bang''''' (1995) 
*'''''Dioses y demonios en el átomo''''' (''Gods and Demons in the Atom'', 1996) 
*'''''Curiosidades del Planeta Tierra''''' (''Curiosities of Planet Earth'', 1997) 
*'''''La relatividad del movimiento''''' (''The Relativity of Movement'', 1997) 
*'''''Curiosidades de la ciencia''''' (''Curiosities of Science'', 2000) 
*'''''Diez teorías que conmovieron al mundo'''''  (''Ten Theories that Shook the World - volumes I and II'', with Esteban Magnani, 2006) 
*'''''El café de los científicos, sobre Dios y otros debates''''' (''The Scientists' Café: On God and Other Debates'', with Martín de Ambrosio, 2006) 
*'''''El café de los científicos, de Einstein a la clonación''''' (''The Scientists' Café: From Einstein to Cloning'', with Martín de Ambrosio, 2007) 
*'''''La leyenda de las estrellas''''' (''The Legend of the Stars'', 2007) 
*'''''Lavar los platos''''' (''Back to the Drawing Board', with Ignacio Jawtuschenko, 2008) 
*'''''Los mitos de la ciencia''''' (''Myths of Science'', 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101220010116/http://www.ruidodelasnueces.com.ar/art%C3%ADculoInternetEua.htm El Ruido de las Nueces {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moledo was honored a [[Konex Award]] (the highest in the Argentine cultural realm) in 1994 as the Best Writer in Argentine Science Fiction, and in 1997 as the Man of the Decade in Argentine Journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/ingles/premios/curriculum.asp?ID=2325 Konex Foundation]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Director of the [[Galileo Galilei planetarium|Buenos Aires Planetarium]], in 2000.&lt;ref name=viva/&gt; He served in that capacity until 2007, while also teaching at the Universities of Buenos Aires, [[w:es:Universidad Nacional de Quilmes|Quilmes]] and [[w:es:Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos|Entre Ríos]]. He continues to teach and contribute opinion columns in ''Página/12''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcen.uba.ar/prensa/cable/2008/pdf/Cable_696.pdf ''El Cable'': Leonardo Moledo, irrespetuoso {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

On his interest in science as a philosopher, Moledo once stated that:

{{cquote|''Science is a great story that mankind tells itself about the world, and that the world tells us about ourselves. It is to me as powerful and beautiful as any myth. To think that universe began with a great explosion, deploying itself in gases that became stars - and that they, in turn, became other stars. This is the stuff of myths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaginaria.com.ar/09/4/moledo1.htm Imaginaria: Conocer es resistir {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">'''Life chances''' (''Lebenschancen'' in [[German language|German]]) is a social science theory of the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunities]] each individual has to improve their quality of life. The concept was introduced by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. It is a [[probabilistic]] concept, describing how likely it is, given certain factors, that an individual's life will turn out a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;(Hughes 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, life chances are positively [[correlation|correlated]] with one's [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=black&gt;Blackwell, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Opportunities in this sense refer to the extent to which one has access to resources, both tangible ones such as food, clothing and shelter, and intangible ones such as education and health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Life chances comprise the individual's ability to procure [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], have a [[career]] and obtain inner satisfaction; in other words, the ability to satisfy one's [[needs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cuneo, [http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm Max Weber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161957/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Weberian life chances can be seen as an expansion on some of functionalist [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Both Weber and Marx agreed that economic factors were important in determining one's future, but Weber's concepts of life chances are more complex; inspired by, but different from Marx's views on [[social stratification]] and [[social class]]. Where for Marx the [[class status]] was the most important factor, and he correlated life chances with material wealth, Weber introduced such additional factors as [[social mobility]] and [[social equality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowenna Harrison, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140427/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/lowerSixthA.htm Is an unstratified society possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp Life Chances and Social Mobility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916023204/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include those related to one's socioeconomic status, such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=ffg&gt;Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mark La Gory, ''Unhealthy places: the ecology of risk in the urban landscape'', Psychology Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-92372-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415923727&amp;id=Mh0ZV5fl2cAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=-NoWukzqbmGuxhbpmxpbb402R-4 Google Print, p.90-91]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of those factors, like age, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[gender]], are random,&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification&amp;nbsp;– how [[social class]], [[social status]] and [[political affiliation]] affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain [[group (sociology)|groups]] have in common a specific [[causal]] component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of [[economic]] factors:&lt;ref&gt;William C. Cockerham ''Health and social change in [[Russia]] and Eastern Europe
'', Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-92081-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415920809&amp;id=GOZFhIBmN1gC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=oWGnkOVVG5Ih1IjPG0__6J4t5R8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msop&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o2302.htm Multiple Sources of Power&amp;nbsp;– Class, Status, and Party]&lt;/ref&gt; how the [[power (sociology)|power]] of those with [[property]], compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.&lt;ref name=msop/&gt;

Weber also noted that life chances are to certain extent [[Subjectivity|subjective]]: one's assessment of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of [[society]], that outcome and associated positive results are more likely to become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction.&lt;ref name=hewett&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607123432/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/weber/wclass.htm Weber and Class].&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons without such a belief, especially those who consciously espouse or have unconsciously internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to [[learned helplessness]] and its long-term effects.

In terms of [[agency and structure]], life chances represent the structure, the factors that one has no control over; whereas one's [[life conduct]] - values and beliefs, attitude to risk taking, social skills, or more generally, [[free will]]ed choices about one's [[behavior]] - represent the factors one has control over.&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; According to Weber theories, together with life conduct, life chances are responsible for one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

In [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], life chances may have to be balanced against other goals, such as eliminating [[poverty]], ensuring [[Freedom (political)|personal freedom]] or ensuring equality at birth.

==Ascriptive qualities==
The life chances approach suggests that status is not entirely [[Achieved status|achieved]], but is, to some extent, [[Ascribed status|ascribed]]. Overall, in societies emphasizing [[ascription]], opportunity is relatively low and status (in the sense of prestige in the community) is often inherited.
This means that people are, effectively, given their status as a result of the group into which they are born, rather than earning it entirely on merit.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"&gt;Yeates, Nicola. "Sociology Factsheet&amp;nbsp;– Life Chances."www.curriculum-press.co.uk. Bank House, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ascriptive qualities such as [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[Social class|class]] of origin can all affect one's life chances. In all societies parents pass on whatever advantages and disadvantages they have to their children.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"&gt;Beeghley, Leonard. "Sociology and Stratification." The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States. 5th ed. N.p.: Pearson Education, 2008. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A persons’ class of origin determines one's neighborhood they live in, which in turn will affect [[educational attainment]], the people they socialize with, and ultimately their [[class identification]]. A very important factor affecting life chances is housing. Poorer housing will affect health, available facilities, the likelihood of being a victim of crime, and many other aspects of life. Leisure facilities are often located in middle class areas or near non manual work places. Gym membership is expensive and subsidies are rarely available for lower grade staff. Therefore, in general, the middle and upper classes have far greater life chances available than the less advantaged groups.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"/&gt;

If born into a [[wealthy]] family a person will have access to far more desirable resources that can assist them in further enhancing their life chances to a far greater extent than someone who is born into a [[working class]] poor family. One of these resources includes a family's [[social ties]] and the ability for a person with well connected parents to benefit greatly in the status attainment process. [[Status attainment]] refers to how each individual enters an occupation. This encompasses how both ascribed and achieved factors combine, because each individual enters an occupation based on the way their parents’ status produces advantages and disadvantages, their own efforts and abilities, and a degree of luck.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"/&gt;

An additional dimension is the effect of family dynamics on life chances, such as the presence of biological parents, the quality of family relationships, and sibling configuration. For example, it has been demonstrated that children of divorced parents exhibit lower levels of psychological well-being, more problems in their own relationship, a greater risk of experiencing divorce, and also tend to be less educated.&lt;ref&gt;Gugushvili, Alexi. Ascriptive Inequality and Life Chances in Georgia. www.css.ge. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. [http://www.eui.eu/Personal/Researchers/AlexiGugushvili/sept._2012_ENG.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming bad life chances==
[[Max Weber]] discussed the effects of [[social stratification]] on life chances. He argued that life chances are opportunities and possibilities that make up one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Life chances are affected by a number of factors. Some of which include: [[income]], [[social class]], and [[occupational prestige]]. These factors all affect the availability of resources to an individual. For example, when one has low income, they have low life chances. Their education may not be as great and they may not have a high enough income to attain an advanced level of education.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kevin. "life chances." The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology. Ed. Bryan S. Turner. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 338. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Wout Ultee, education is a major aspect of overcoming life chances.&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"&gt;Ultee, Wout. "Life Chances and Resources." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 15 November 2013 [http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433118_ss1-43]&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an education, it is harder to obtain a job that provides a substantial income to provide for a family of four. “Higher education is the way to stay ahead."&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"/&gt; The higher the education, the higher income and [[occupational prestige]] one will have, which results in more resources for an individual and his family.

Early [[Health intervention|intervention]] is also necessary in improving life chances. Save the Children is a non-governmental group that works in the best interest of children. They promote children's rights and the aid children in [[underdeveloped]] countries that need relief. The UK has started an early intervention program that aids in improving life chances early on a child's life. They believe that "No child should endure poverty and no child's life chances should be shaped by the accident of birth."&lt;ref&gt;"Early Intervention Review." Save the Children. Save the Children, Nov. 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This program was made to ensure that [[Educational inequality|inequalities]] in children's learning are tackled before problems can occur and separate them from peers. In order to do so, this program gives parents in lower classes the expertise they need to effectively help their children's learning in a home environment so that they are well prepared when they enter school. An example would be improving the parents' reading level so that they are able to teach their children how to read and write before kindergarten. This allows children in lower classes to be near the same level as children who are in higher classes with higher educated parents. Early intervention will allow for children to start out their education on the right foot, with skills they will need to succeed and achieve a high level of education, thus improving life chances.

==Class identification and lifestyle effects==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Weber noted that life chances are partially determined by [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors, such as by how one perceives their life chances. How one [[perceives]] their life chances is in large part determined by what one perceives their [[social class]] to be since life chances and social class go hand in hand and both [[reinforce]] each other. According to Weber this is because life chances are largely determined by economic factors such as social class. The phenomenon of how you perceive things actually affecting the [[tangible]] outcomes of life chances is explained by [[Robert K. Merton]]'s theory of "self fulfilling prophecy" which he discusses in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Essentially what it means is that individuals can tell themselves something like, "I'm lower class, my family has always been lower class, there's no chance I'm ever going to be well off" and although this statement had the potential to not end up being true, it became true simply because the individual believed it would be so and through his attitude and lack of self-esteem, made it his reality.

If you identify as low social class and believe you are most likely never going to be anything else, this will affect your life conduct in a myriad of ways. which in turn will affect your life chances. For one, the company you keep can lead to you networking with people that will not help you get out of a low socioeconomic environment. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think you are not qualified enough for anything but [[working class]] jobs. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think that pursuing higher education is not for someone of your social standing, further ensuring that you never get above working class work. The relationship between social class, life conduct, and life chances is a strong one that often decides what a person's fate in life will be like.

'''Maria Ossowska''' (''née'' Maria Niedźwiecka, 16 January 1896, [[Warsaw]] – 13 August 1974, Warsaw) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[social philosophy|social philosopher]]. 

==Life==
A student of the philosopher [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], she originally in 1925 received a doctorate in [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Warsaw]] with a thesis on [[Bertrand Russell]]. In her later work, she focused on the philosophy and sociology of [[ethics]]. Ossowska is often mentioned as a member of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school]].

From 1941 to 1945, Ossowska taught in the Polish [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university system]]. In 1945-48 she was a professor at the [[University of Łódź]], after that at the University of Warsaw. She was banned from teaching between 1952 and 1956, while sociology was removed from Polish universities as a "bourgeois" discipline. From 1952 to 1962, she directed the Institute for the History and Theory of Ethics within the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (PAN). In 1972 the Communist authorities awarded Ossowska a first-degree Polish National Award ''(Polska Nagroda Państwowa I stopnia)'', the highest Polish state accolade.

Ossowska was married to sociologist [[Stanisław Ossowski]], with whom she closely cooperated in research and teaching.

Maria Ossowska and [[Stanisław Ossowski]] are considered among the founders of the field of "science of science" due to their authorship of a seminal 1935 paper titled "The Science of Science."&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in Polish as ''"Nauka o nauce"'' in the Polish journal ''Nauka Polska'' (Polish Science), vol. XX, no. 3, 1935; reprinted in English in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', 1982, pp. 82-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A synonym for "science of science" is the [[back-formation|back-formed]] term "[[Logology (sociology)|logology]]" ([[Christopher Kasparek]], "[[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'':  the Creation of a [[Historical Novel]]", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXIX, no. 1, 1994, note 3, pp. 45–46; [[:pl:Stefan Zamecki|Stefan Zamecki]], ''Komentarze do naukoznawczych poglądów Williama Whewella (1794–1866):  studium historyczno-metodologiczne'' [Commentaries to the [[Logology (sociology)|Logological]] Views of [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866):  A Historical-Methodological Study], Warsaw, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], 2012, [English-language] summary, pp. 741–43).  The term "[[Logology (sociology)|logology]]" provides convenient grammatical variants not available with the earlier terms, "science of science" and "sociology of science":  i.e., "logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maxwell John Cresswell''' (born 19 November 1939, [[Wellington]]) is a New Zealand philosopher and logician, known for his work in [[modal logic]].&lt;ref name=Festschrift&gt;''Festschrift for Max Cresswell on the occasion of his 65th birthday.'' In: ''Logique et Analyse.'' Number 181, March 2003 (published November 2004). See the introduction by Thomas Forster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victoria.ac.nz/hppi/about/staff/max-cresswell Max Cresswell, School of History, Philosophy, Political Science and International Relations, Victoria U. of Wellington]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Cresswell received his B.A. in 1960 and M.A. in 1961 from the [[University of New Zealand]] and then with the support of a Commonwealth Scholarship attended the [[University of Manchester]], where he received in 1964 his PhD with supervisor [[Arthur Norman Prior]]. After returning to New Zealand, Cresswell was at the Victoria University of Wellington in 1963–1967 lecturer, in 1968–1972 senior lecturer (also receiving in 1972 Lit.D. from the Victoria University), in 1973 reader, and in 1974–2000 professor, interrupted by several visiting professorships. In 2001 he became professor emeritus and a member of the Centre for Logic, Language and Computation, Victoria University of Wellington and has been a visiting or fixed-term professor at several universities.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cllc.vuw.ac.nz/max/maxcv.pdf|title=M. J. Cresswell: Curriculum Vitae|website=''Centre for Logic, Language and Computation'',Victoria University of Wellington, NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell's research deals with the philosophy of logic, [[modal logic]] and [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]]. He has also published on [[ancient Greek philosophy]], on the logic of the nineteenth century, and on the philosophy of [[John Locke]].&lt;ref name="LL" /&gt; Cresswell was the co-author with his colleague and former teacher [[George Edward Hughes|G. E. Hughes]], of ''An Introduction to Modal Logic'', London, Methuen, 1968); this was the first modern textbook on modal logic and introduced many students to [[Kripke semantics]].&lt;ref name=Festschrift/&gt; As a standard introduction to the subject it was replaced by ''A New Introduction to Modal Logic'' (London, Routledge, 1996); again with G. E. Hughes, who died prior to publication.

'''Mind monkey''' or '''monkey mind''', from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''xinyuan'' and [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] ''shin'en'' 心猿 [lit. "heart-/mind-monkey"], is a [[Buddhist]] term meaning "unsettled; restless; capricious; whimsical; fanciful; inconstant; confused; indecisive; uncontrollable". In addition to Buddhist writings, including Chan or [[Zen]], [[Consciousness-only]], [[Pure Land]], and [[Shingon]], this "mind-monkey" psychological metaphor was adopted in [[Taoism]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], poetry, drama, and literature. "Mind-monkey" occurs in two reversible [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] with ''yima'' or ''iba'' 意馬 [lit. "thought-/will-horse"], most frequently used in Chinese ''xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 and Japanese ''ibashin'en'' 意馬心猿. The "Monkey King" [[Sun Wukong]] in the ''[[Journey to the West]]'' personifies the mind-monkey. Note that much of the following summarizes Carr (1993).

==Linguistic and cultural background==
"Mind-monkey" 心猿 is an exemplary [[animal metaphor]]. Some figures of speech are cross-linguistically common, verging upon [[linguistic universal]]s; many languages use "monkey" or "ape" words to mean "mimic", for instance, Italian [[Wikt:scimmiottare|scimmiottare]] "to mock; to mimic" &lt; [[Wikt:scimmia|scimmia]] "monkey; ape", Japanese ''sarumane'' 猿真似 [lit. "monkey imitation"] "copycat; superficial imitation", and English ''[[monkey see, monkey do]]'' or ''[[Wikt:ape|to ape]]''). Other animal metaphors have culture-specific meanings; compare English ''[[Wikt:chickenhearted|chickenhearted]]'' "cowardly; timid'; easily frightened" and Chinese ''jixin'' 雞心 [lit. "chicken heart"] "heart-shaped; cordate".

The four [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] elements of Chinese ''xinyuanyima'' or Japanese ''shin'en'iba'' are ''xin'' or ''shin'' 心 "heart; mind", ''yi'' or ''i'' 意 "thought", ''yuan'' or ''en'' 猿 "monkey", and ''ma'' or ''ba'' 馬 "horse"'.

===The 心 "heart; mind" and 意 "idea; will"===
The psychological components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese ''xin'' or Sino-Japanese ''shin'' or ''kokoro'' [[Wikt:心|心]] "heart; mind; feelings, affections; center" and ''yi'' or ''i'' [[Wikt:意|意]] 'thought, idea; opinion, sentiment; will, wish; meaning'. This [[Chinese character]] 心 was graphically simplified from an original [[pictogram]] of a heart, and 意 "thought; think" is an [[ideogram]] combining 心 under ''yin'' [[Wikt:音|音]] "sound; tone; voice" denoting "sound in the mind; thought; idea".

In [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''xin''/''shin'' 心 "heart; mind" generally translates [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Wikt:citta|citta]]'' "the mind; state of mind; consciousness" and ''yi''/''i'' 意 translates Sanskrit ''[[Wikt:manas|manas]]'' "the mental organ; deliberation". Some Buddhist authors have used 心 and 意 interchangeably for "mind; cognition; thought". Compare these ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' glosses 
*心 "Spirit, motive, sense. The mind as the seat of intelligence, mentality, idea. (Skt. ''citta'') … Thought, intellect, feeling; (Skt. ''mānasa'')"
*意 "Thought, intellect; (Skt. ''manas''; Tib. ''yid''); the mind; (Skt. ''citta''; Tib. ''sems'')".
For example, take the Buddhist word Chinese ''xin-yi-shi'' or Japanese ''shin-i-shiki'' 心意識 [lit. "mind, thought, and cognition"] that compounds three near-synonyms. [[Abhidharma]] theory uses this word as a general term for "mind; mentality", but [[Yogacara]] theory of [[Eight Consciousnesses]] distinguishes ''xin''/''shin'' 心 "[[store consciousness]]", ''yi''/''i'' 意 "''manas'' consciousness", and ''shi''/''shiki'' 識 "six object-contingent consciousnesses".

''Xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 [lit. "mind-monkey idea-horse"] "distracted; indecisive; restless" is comparable with some other Chinese [[collocation]]s.
*''xinmanyizu'' 心滿意足 ["heart-full mind-complete"] "perfectly content; fully satisfied"
*''xinhuiyilan'' 心灰意懶 ["heart-ashes mind-sluggish"] "disheartened; discouraged; hopeless" (or ''xinhuiyileng'' 心灰意冷 with ''leng'' "cold; frosty")
*''xinhuangyiluan'' 心慌意亂 ["heart-flustered mind-disordered"] "alarmed and hysterical; perturbed"
*''xinfanyiluan'' 心煩意亂 ["heart-vexed mind-disordered"] "terribly upset; confused and worried"

===The 猿 "monkey" and 馬 "horse"===
[[File:Marbleized Clay, Tri-Color Glazed of Monkey Piggy-Back on Horse.JPG|thumb|[[Sancai|Tri-color glaze]] porcelain, showing 猿 "monkey" and 馬 "horse". [[Tang dynasty]].]]
[[File:Chinesischer Maler des 10. Jahrhunderts (I) 001.jpg|thumb|''Gibbons and horses'', 10th-century [[Song dynasty]] painting]]
The animal components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese ''yuan'' or Japanese ''en'' [[Wikt:猿|猿]] "gibbon; monkey; ape" and ''ma'' or ''ba'' [[Wikt:馬|馬]] "horse".

Chinese ''yuan'' 猿 (''yuan'' [[Wikt:猨|猨]] or ''nao'' [[Wikt:猱|猱]]) originally meant the "[[agile gibbon]], black-handed gibbon, ''Hylobates agilis''" but now generally means "ape; monkey" (e.g., ''yuanren'' 猿人 ["ape-man"] "[[Homo erectus]]; anthropoid apes'"). [[Robert van Gulik]] (1967:33) concludes that until about the 14th century, ''yuan'' designated the gibbon, but due to extensive deforestation, its habitat shrank to remote southern mountains; from then on, "the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids." Other common Chinese "monkey" names include ''feifei'' 狒狒 "[[hamadryas baboon]], ''Papio hamadryas''", ''hou'' [[Wikt:猴|猴]] "monkey; ape", and ''mihou'' 獼猴 (''muhou'' 母猴) or ''husun'' 猢猻 "[[rhesus macaque]], rhesus monkey, ''Macaca mulatta''", [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:36) reconstructs Old Sinitic *''mug-gug'', which "probably ultimately derives from the same African word as English 'macaque'" and is reminiscent of Sanskrit "maraṭāsana ('monkey posture')" (see [[Hanumanasana]]). These "monkey; ape" characters combine the [[Wikt:犭|犭]] "dog [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]" with different [[phonetic]] elements, such as the ''yuan'' [[Wikt:袁|袁]] phonetic in ''yuan'' 猿.

In [[Chinese mythology]], ''yuan'' "gibbons" were supposedly long-lived because they could ''yinqi'' 引氣 ["pull [[qi]]"] "absorb life-force", which is a ''[[Tao Yin|daoyin]]'' 導引 ["guiding and pulling"] "Daoist gymnastic technique". [[Chinese classic texts]] mentioned "monkey leaping" and "monkey bowing" yoga (Miura 1989:354). One of the 2nd-century BCE [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] depicts 28 Daoist gymnastic exercises, many of which are named after animals, including number 22 ''muhou'' "macaque". In the present day, ''houquan'' 猴拳 ["monkey fist/boxing"] "[[Monkey Kung Fu]]" is a [[Chinese martial arts]] style and ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" is a Daoist breath meditation technique. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When one breathes in and out, one's concentration causes the generative force to rise and fall (in the microcosmic orbit) thus slowly turning the wheel of the law. Count from one to ten and then from ten to one hundred breaths with the heart (mind) following the counting to prevent it from wandering outside. When the heart and breathing are in unison, this is called ''locking up the monkey heart'' and ''tying up the running horse of intellect''. (Luk 1990:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Japanese [[kanji]] 猿 is pronounced as Sino-Japanese ''en'' &lt; ''yuan'' or native ''saru'' "monkey", especially the indigenous "[[Japanese macaque]], ''Macaca fuscata''". In Japanese [[Shinto]] tradition, the monkey deity [[Sarutahiko]] was a divine messenger. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:41) contrasts how, "in earlier periods the dominant meaning of the monkey was that of mediator between deities and humans. Later in history, its meaning as a scapegoat became increasingly dominant."

Chinese ''ma'' 馬 "horse", which was the linguistic source for Sino-Japanese ''ba'' or ''ma'' 馬 "horse", originally referred to [[Przewalski's horse]] and later the [[Mongolian horse]], [[Ferghana horse]], etc. Horses were considered divine animals in both China (see Creel 1968) and Japan. For the Chinese, [[Edward H. Schafer]] says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was invested with sanctity by ancient tradition, endowed with prodigious qualities, and visibly stamped with the marks of his divine origin. A revered myth proclaimed him a relative of the dragon, akin to the mysterious powers of water. Indeed, all wonderful horses, such as the steed of the pious Hsüan-tsang which, in later legend [see the ''Xiyouji'' below], carried the sacred scriptures from India, were avatars of dragons, and in antiquity the tallest horses owned by the Chinese were called simply "dragons." (1963:59) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
For the Japanese, the ancient Shinto practice of offering ''shinme'' 神馬 "sacred (esp. white) horses" to shrines has evolved into the modern donation of symbolic ''[[Shinto]] [[Ema (Shinto)|ema]]'' 絵馬 [lit. "picture horse"] "votive tablets"'.

Besides the "mind-monkey idea-horse" metaphor, monkeys and horses have further associations. In [[Chinese astrology]], ''wu'' [[Wikt:午|午]] "[[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]" and ''shen'' [[Wikt:申|申]] "[[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]]" are the 7th and 9th of the 12 zodiacal animals. In Chinese animal mythology, monkeys supposedly bring good health to horses. The ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (tr. Read 1931, no. 400) records the "custom of keeping a female monkey in the horse's stable to ward off sickness (the menstrual discharge of the monkey is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious diseases)".

==Early literary history of "mind-monkeys"==
This section summarizes Chinese and Japanese developments of ''xinyuan'' or ''shin'en'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''yima'' or ''iba'' 意馬 "idea-horse" collocations and their synonyms. The earliest known textual usages are presented chronologically.

===Chinese "mind monkey" collocations===
Chinese authors coined "mind monkey" expressions from the [[Later Qin|Later Qin Dynasty]] (384-417 CE) through the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE). In modern usage, some terms are considered [[Classical Chinese]], but others like ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" are [[Modern Standard Chinese]]. Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:154-159).

The c. 406 ''Weimojie suoshuo jing'' 維摩詰所說經 was [[Kumarajiva]]'s groundbreaking CE Chinese translation of the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]''. It introduced "mind-monkey" in the [[simile]] ''xin ru yuanhou'' 心如猨猴 "heart/mind like a monkey/ape" (with ''yuan'' 猿's [[variant Chinese character]] 猨). "Since the mind of one difficult to convert is like an ape, govern his mind by using certain methods and it can then be broken in" (tr. Dudbridge 1970:168). Carr (1993:169) suggests the subsequent line about ''xiang ma'' 象馬 "elephants and horses" having unruly natures could have affected the later ''yima'' "idea-horse" term.

The ''Mengyu chanhui shi'' 蒙預懺悔詩 "Poem Repenting Foolish Pleasure" is attributed to [[Emperor Jianwen of Liang]] (503-550 CE), who was a renowned author. This poem has the oldest known usage of ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey", but with (the possibly miscopied) ''aima'' 愛馬 "love-horse" instead of ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse". "The [三循/修] three disciplines/cultivations expel the [愛馬] love-horse, and the [六意/念] six recollections/ideas still the [心猿] mind-monkey." This Buddhistic poem has numerous graphic variants, including these ''sanxun'' 三循 "three disciplines" for ''sanxiu'' 三修 "three cultivations" (meditation on impermanence, awareness, and selflessness) and ''liuyi'' 六意 "six ideas" for ''liunian'' 六念 "six recollections" (mindfulness about [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[dharma]], [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]], precepts, almsgiving, and heaven). Based on these contextual graphic inconsistencies, Carr (1993:156) suggests the possibility that a [[scribe]] transposed Jianwen's original ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse" as ''aima'' 愛馬 "love-horse".

The ''Daci'ensi sanzang fashizhuan'' 大慈恩寺三藏法師傳 "Biography of the Tripitaka Dharma Master of the Temple of Great Compassionate Blessings" is a biography of [[Xuanzang]] (see the ''Xiyouji'' below) written by his disciple [[Kuiji]] (or Ci'en, the namesake temple in [[Luoyang]], see [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]]). This record of the Consciousness-Only ([[Yogacara]]) Buddhism, has a memorial dated 657 CE that parallels ''yima'' "idea-/will-horse" with ''qingyuan'' 情猿 "emotion-/feeling-monkey": "Now if you wish to entrust your thoughts to the Chan sect, you must make your mind as pure as still water, control your emotion-monkey's indolence and fidgeting, and restrain your idea-horse's haste and galloping."

The [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Xu Hun]] 許渾 ([[floruit|fl.]] 832-844) wrote the first known parallel between "mind-monkey" and "idea-horse." His ''Zengti Du yinju'' 贈題杜隱居 "Poem Written for Sir Du the Recluse" says: "Nature exhausts the mind-monkey's hiding, spirit disperses the idea-horse's moving/stopping. Guests who come ought to know this: both self and world are unfeeling."

The common ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" phrase dates back to a ''[[bianwen]]'' 變文 "[[Vernacular Chinese]] transformation text" narrative version of the ''Weimojie suoshuo jing'' (above) that was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]]. This ''jiangjingwen'' 講經文 "sutra lecture text" dated 947 CE says: "Within the indeterminable and unfathomable depths, the mind-monkey and idea-horse cease their craziness." 

The 1075 CE ''[[Wuzhen pian]]'', which is a [[Daoist]] classic on ''[[Neidan]]''-style [[internal alchemy]], used ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey" without "horse".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thoroughly understanding the mind-monkey, the machinations in the heart, by three thousand achievements one becomes a peer of heaven. There naturally is a crucible to cook the dragon and tiger; Why is it necessary to support a household and be attached to spouse and children? (tr. Cleary 1987:118) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cleary (1987:198) glosses ''xinyuan'' as "the unruly mind, jumping from one object to another."

The Song Dynasty poet Zhu Yi 朱翌 (1098–1186 CE) reversed the Tang lyrical ''xinyuanyima'' expression into ''yimaxinyuan'' "will-horse mind-monkey". His ''Shuixuanshi'' 睡軒詩 "Sleeping Porch Poem" says: "Haste is useless with the idea-horse and mind-monkey, so take off your baggage someplace deep within dreamland."

The c. 1200 ''Nan Tang shu'' 南唐書 "History of the [[Southern Tang]]" used the simile ''yi ru ma xin ru nao'' 意如馬心如猱 "ideas like a horse and mind like a gibbon/monkey". Congshan 從善 (939-987), seventh son of the figurehead [[Emperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang]], confesses: "Long ago in my youth, my ideas were like a horse and my mind was like a monkey. I was indolent with happiness and enjoyed lust, was pleased with rewards and forgot toil." 

 [[Image:Xiyou.PNG|160px|thumb|illustration of Sun Wukong]]
The c. 1590 ''Xiyouji'' 西遊記 "''[[Journey to the West]]''" (or "''[[Monkey (novel)|Monkey]]''") popularized "mind-monkey" more than any other text. This famous Chinese novel centers upon the pilgrimage of [[Xuanzang]] to India, and frequently uses ''xinyuan'' and ''yima'' expressions (Dudbridge 1970:167, Chang 1983:200). Many are found in the couplet titles of chapters, for instance, 30 "The evil demon attacks the true Dharma; The Horse of the Will recalls the Monkey of the Mind". The preeminent translator [[Anthony C. Yu]] (1977:59) describes controlling the mind-monkey and will-horse as "a theme central to the entire narrative and which receives repeated and varied developments." Chapter 7 has this exemplary poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A monkey's transformed body weds the human mind. Mind is a monkey – this, the truth profound. The Great Sage [Buddha], Equal to Heaven, is no idle thought. For how could the post of [Bima "Assistant of Horses"] justly show his gifts? The Horse works with the Monkey – and this means both Mind and Will, Must firmly be harnessed and not ruled without. All things return to Nirvāna, taking this one course: In union with Tathāgata [Buddha] to live beneath twin trees. (tr. Yu 1977:168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many ''Xiyouji'' scholars allegorically interpret ''xinyuan'' "heart-/mind-monkey" as the protagonist monkey-man [[Sun Wukong]] and ''yima'' "idea-/will-horse" as the dragon prince White Horse that enters the story in chapter 15. There are long-standing scholarly disagreements over whether Sun Wukong evolved from [[Hanuman]], the monkey hero in the (3rd century BCE) ''[[Ramayana]]''. It is "imagistically proper" for Sun to be a monkey, says Mair (1989:662), because "Zen thought symbolizes the restless and unbridled mind of man as an "ape/monkey-mind" 心猿."

Japanese Buddhist monks not only imported [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]] such as ''shin'en'' &lt; ''xinyuan'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''iba'' &lt; ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse", but also invented analogous Japanese words like ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea-monkey" and ''shinba'' 心馬 "mind-horse". Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:159-161). The earliest known usages of relevant "mind-monkey" terminology are shown in the table below.

During the [[Heian period]] (794-1185 CE), the Chinese "mind-monkey" and "idea-horse" were paraphrased as ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea-monkey" and ''shinba'' 心馬 "mind-horse". The 797 CE ''[[Sangō Shiiki]]'' 三教指帰 "Indications of the [[Three teachings]] (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism)" was written by [[Kūkai]], who founded esoteric [[Shingon Buddhism]]. Two passages introduced Japanese "mind-monkey" and "will-horse" [[neologism]]s. One used ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea/will monkey" with the common word ''nouma'' 野馬 "wild horse": "The four great difficulties overexcite the wild horse's fast gallop, the twenty-six contributory causes mislead the plans of the idea-monkey." Another passage used ''shinba'' 心馬 "heart/mind horse" and ''isha'' 意車 "idea-chariot": "Whip the mind-horse to gallop off in the eight directions, grease the idea chariot and gambol within the nine heavens."

[[File:Mori Sosen BaikaEnkou-zu.jpg|thumb|left|''Monkeys in a plum tree'' by [[Mori Sosen]] (1747–1821)]]
During the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333 CE), [[Pure Land Buddhism]] introduced the Sino-Japanese terms ''shin'en'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''iba'' 意馬 "idea-horse", and an early travelogue popularized them. The ''Genkyū hōgo'' 元久法語 "[[Genkyū]] era (1204–1206) Buddhist Sermons" is a collection of writings by [[Hōnen]], the founder of the [[Jodo Shu|Jōdo Shū]]. His c. 1205 "Tozanjō 登山状 "Mountain Climbing Description"  (tr. adapted from Carr 1993:159) uses ''iba'' with ''shin'en'': "When you wish to enter the gate of determined goodness, then your idea-horse runs wild within the bounds of the six sense objects [''rokujin'' 六塵 &lt;  [[Ayatana]]: "form, sound, smell, taste, tangibility, and [[dharma]]"]. When you wish to enter the gate of scattered goodness, then your mind-monkey gambols and jumps across the branches of the ten evil deeds [''jūaku'' 十悪: killing, stealing, adultery, lying, cursing, slandering, equivocating, coveting, anger, and false views]." The 1223 ''Kaidōki'' 海道記 "Record of Coast Road Travels" was a travelogue of the [[Tōkaidō (road)]] from [[Kyoto]] to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. It used ''shinsen'' 心船 "heart/mind boat" meaning "imaginary journey" with ''iba'' 意馬 "idea/will horse" and wrote ''arasaru'' 荒猿 "wild monkey" for ''arasu'' 荒す "treat roughly/wildly": "I rowed the mind-boat for make-believe. As yet, I neither poled across myriad leagues of waves on the Coast Road, nor roughly rode the idea-horse to urge it on through clouds of the distant mountain barrier." 

During the early [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), the four-character Chinese collocations ''yimashinen'' 意馬心猿 and ''shinenyima'' 心猿意馬 were introduced into Japanese. The 1675 ''Man'an kana hōgo'' 卍庵仮名法語, which was a vernacular collection of [[Zen]] sermons, first used ''shin'en'iba'' 意馬心猿. "For this reason, even if you reside somewhere with remote mountain streams and desolate tranquillity, and sit in silent contemplation, you will only be passing idle time because you are isolated from the road of the mind-monkey and idea-horse." The 1699 [[Kabuki]] play ''Wakoku gosuiten'' 和国五翠殿 "Japan's Five Green Palaces" repeatedly used ''ibashin'en''. For instance, the first act described two prisoners tied to a tree: "They are the idea-horse and mind-monkey themselves. So if this pine tree is the pole of Absolute Reality, then these two prisoners are a greedy monkey – no, a cat – and a horse running wild; and they are just like the idea-horse and mind-monkey."

=="Mind-monkey" in English==
'''Mind monkey''' and '''monkey mind''' both occur in English usage, originally as translations of ''xinyuan'' or ''shin'en'' and later as culturally-independent images. Michael Carr concludes,
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Xinyuan-yima'' 心猿意馬 "monkey of the heart/mind and horse of the ideas/will" has been a successful metaphor. What began 1500 years ago as a Buddhist import evolved into a standard Chinese and Japanese literary phrase. Rosenthal (1989:361) says a proverb's success "'depends on certain imponderables," particularly rhythm and phrasing. Of the two animals in this metaphor, the "monkey" phrase was stronger than the "horse" because ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey" was occasionally used alone (e.g., ''Wuzhenpian'') and it had more viable variants (e.g., ''qingyuan'' 情猿 "emotion-monkey" in ''Ci'en zhuan''). The "mental-monkey" choice of words aptly reflects restlessness, curiosity, and mimicry associated with this animal. Dudbridge (1970:168) explains how "the random, uncontrollable movements of the monkey symbolise the waywardness of the native human mind before it achieves a composure which only Buddhist discipline can effect." (1993:166) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Translations===
English translations of Chinese ''xinyuan'' or Japanese ''shin'en'' commonly include "mind monkey", "monkey mind", and "monkey of the mind".

This first list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 5 Chinese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 11 bilingual [[Chinese dictionaries]] translate ''xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 and ''yimaxinyuan'' 意馬心猿.
*【意馬心猿】 his will is like a horse's, and his heart like an ape's; inconstant and strong (''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'', Williams 1874)
*【心猿意馬】 gibbon heart and horse ideas, – unsettled and wandering (''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', Giles 1919)
*【心猿意馬】 irresolute; vacillating; fluctuating ... Inconstant; fickle in the mind (''A Complete Chinese–English Dictionary'', Tsang 1920, cf. next)
*【意馬心猿】 Unsettled in mind; fluctuating; wavering in purpose (''A Complete Chinese–English Dictionary'')
*【意馬心猿】The intents of the mind and heart are like the horse and ape – very difficult to bring under control; undecided (''Zhonghua Han-Ying dacidian'', Lu 1931, cf. next)
*【心猿意馬】 Restless and unsettled (''Zhonghua Han-Ying dacidian'')
*【心猿意馬】 the intents of the mind and heart are like the horse and the ape – very difficult to bring under control; undecided (''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', Mathews 1943)
*【心猿意馬】 cannot make up one's mind; indecision; procrastination (''A New Practical Chinese- English Dictionary'', Liang 1971)
*【心猿意馬】 prone to outside attractions, temptations; in a restless and jumpy mood (''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' 1972)
*【心猿意馬】 restless and whimsical; fanciful and fickle; capricious (''The Chinese–English Dictionary'', Beijing 1979)
*【心猿意馬】 in a restless and jumpy mood / capricious (''A New Chinese–English Dictionary'', Ding 1985)
*【心猿意馬】 restless and whimsical; fanciful and fickle; capricious; when one meant gibbon, he thinks of a horse (''A Modern Chinese–English Dictionary'', Beijing 1988)
*【心猿意馬】 ① capricious; restless ② indecisive (''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', DeFrancis 1996, cf. next)
*【意馬心猿】 indecisive; wavering (''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'')
Six of these 11 Chinese–English dictionaries enter only the common ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey idea-horse," 2 only the reverse ''yimaxinyuan'', and 3 enter both. Three translation equivalents give English "ape" rather than "gibbon" or "monkey" for ''yuan'' 猿, and "ape" sounds metaphorically stronger than "monkey." Note how several of these dictionaries have identical translations. 

This second list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 7 Japanese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 9 bilingual [[Japanese dictionaries]] translate ''ibashin'en'' 意馬心猿, none enters ''shin'en'iba'' 心猿意馬.
*【意馬心猿】 Clamorous demands of passion (''Takenobu's Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takenobu 1918)
*【意馬心猿】 overmastering passion (''A Standard Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takehara 1924)
*【意馬心猿】Passions hard of control; uncontrollable passions (''Saito's Japanese–English Dictionary'', Saito 1930)
*【意馬心猿】Clamorous demands of passion; [uncontrollable] passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takenobu 1931)
*【意馬心猿】 clamorous demands of passion; [uncontrollable] passions; wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Katsumata 1954)
*【意馬心猿】 uncontrollable passions (''The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary'', Nelson 1974)
*【意馬心猿】 clamorous demands of passion; (uncontrollable) passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Masuda 1974)
*【意馬心猿】 (uncontrollable) passions (''Japanese Character Dictionary'', Spahn and Hadamitzky 1989)
*【意馬心猿】 the clamorous demands of passion; (uncontrollable) passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Watanabe 2003)

All 9 Japanese–English dictionaries mention "passion" or "passions." Note how Saito's "uncontrollable passions" first appeared in 1930 and was copied into 6 other dictionaries. The 5 editions of [[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese–English Dictionary]] illustrate lexicographical modifications. Editors copied the "clamorous demands of passion" phrase from the 1st edition (''Takenobu's …'' 1918) into all the subsequent versions. The 2nd (1931) first added "uncontrollable" to "passions," which was copied in later editions. The 3rd edition (1954) included a literal translation "wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires", but this was omitted from the 4th (1974) and 5th (2003, which added the [[definite article]] "the").

===Popular culture===
Examples of "mind monkey" are predictably common in Chinese [[popular culture]]. For instance, ''Sam yuen yi ma'' 心猿意馬 – the [[Cantonese (language)|Cantonese]] pronunciation of ''Xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" –  was a 1999 Hong Kong movie (known in English as "The Accident") by [[Stanley Kwan]]. However, examples of "mind monkey" are surprisingly widespread in modern English culture. For instance, there are [[blog]]s named "Mind Monkey!", "Mind of the Monkey", "Monkey Mind", and "No monkey mind". Author Steve Michael Reedy explores the concept of the Monkey Mind through his collection of children's fantasy stories in [["Tales For Your Monkey's Mind."]]

In English-language publishing, fewer books are titled with "mind monkey", such as ''Master the Mind Monkey'' (Patkar 2007), than "monkey mind". "Taming" is common among ''Taming the Monkey Mind'' (Chodron 1999), ''Taming the Monkey Mind; A Guide to Pure Land Practice'' (Cheng 2000), and ''Taming Our Monkey Mind: Insight, Detachment, Identity'' (Krystal 2007). Other examples of book titles include ''Samba and the Monkey Mind'' (Williams 1965), ''Meeting the Monkey Halfway'' (Sumano and Popp 2000), ''Your Monkey Mind Connection'' (Antoinette 2007), and ''Still the Monkey'' (Alivia 2007). 

The originally Buddhist "mind monkey" metaphor is also known in popular English-language music. "Mad Melancholy Monkey Mind" is a band. There are albums entitled "Mind Monkey" (Bill Foreman 1999), "Monkey Mind" (Wonder Stump, 2003), and "Monkey Mind Control" (Jay Roulston 2003). Song titles include "The Monkey on the Mind" (Dave Wilkerson 1960) and "Monkey Mind" ([[Neil Rolnick]] 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6197">'''Paul Joseph DiMaggio''' (born January 10, 1951 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.princeton.edu/sociology/faculty/dimaggio/dimaggio_cv.pdf | title = DiMaggio's CV | work = http://wagner.nyu.edu/dimaggio | accessdate = February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American educator, and [[professor]] of [[sociology]] at [[New York University]] since 2015. Previously, he was a professor of sociology at [[Princeton University]].

==Biography==
A graduate of [[Swarthmore College]], DiMaggio earned his [[Ph.D.]] in sociology from [[Harvard]] in 1979. He was the executive director of [[Yale University|Yale's]] program on nonprofit organizations (1982–87), and through 1991 he was a professor in the sociology department at the university. He was a fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] (1984–85) and at the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] (1990). He also served on the [[Connecticut]] Commission on the Arts and on the board of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies.

==Work==
DiMaggio's major works have been in the study of institutions and organizations and the formation of "high culture" in the U.S. His recent research explores [[social inequality]] in the Internet.

According to Dimaggio, belief systems and cultural frames are imposed on and adapted by individual actors and organisations. Thus, roles are for a large part determined by larger structures.

In a much-quoted article, DiMaggio and [[Walter W. Powell]] argued that organizations, whether corporate, governmental, or non-profit, adopt business practices not because they are efficient, but because they furnish legitimacy in the eyes of outside stakeholders, e. g. lenders, government regulators, and shareholders, as they need to maintain the confidence of these often poorly-informed outside parties. This makes them less creative and innovative in their practices, and leads to [[isomorphism (sociology)|institutional isomorphism]].

In his cultural studies, DiMaggio's historical research documented the self-conscious creation of "high culture" in the late 19th-century America. DiMaggio argues that, unsettled by the weak [[class (social)|class]] distinctions in growing [[industrial revolution|industrial]] [[cities]], local [[elites]] created a "sophisticated" culture (via the [[arts]], [[universities]], [[social clubs]], and the like) that would separate commoners from those of high standing. DiMaggio says that "high culture" models developed by founders of  [[museums]] and [[orchestras]] were then adopted by patrons of [[opera]], [[dance]], and [[theatre]].

DiMaggio's recent research considers the cultural advent of the Internet. He compares the emergence of the Internet with the rise of [[television]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. DiMaggio and Joseph Nathan Cohen (2005) "Information Inequality and Network Externalities: A Comparative Study in the Diffusion of Television and the Internet" in Richard Swedberg and [[Victor Nee]] (eds.) ''The Economic Sociology of Capitalism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press): 227 - 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Television was introduced to American [[consumer]]s in 1948, and within ten years 90% of [[households]] had TV. In contrast, Internet diffusion (introduced on a large scale in 1994) seems to have stalled at approximately 60% of American households. DiMaggio believes that this difference is the result of the so-called [[digital divide]] - inequalities in Internet usage by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[income]], and [[education]] level. DiMaggio maintains that these inequalities were not found in the adoption of TV in the 1950s, and suggests that differences in Internet usage among social groups will continue. This remains an open question, and some recent data suggest Internet usage is growing, with more than 70% of American adults reporting that they use the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/182/report_display.asp|title=Reports: Internet Evolution|date=2006-04-25|publisher=Pew/Internet|accessdate=2007-09-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909055856/http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/182/report_display.asp|archivedate=September 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eszter.com/research/pubs/dimaggio-etal-digitalinequality.pdf |title=From Unequal Access to Differentiated Use }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(293&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/workpap/WP15%20-%20DiMaggio+Hargittai.pdf |title=From the 'Digital Divide' to `Digital Inequality' }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(237&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peace Magazine''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] magazine on [[disarmament]] and [[peacebuilding]] issues, published by Canadian Disarmanent Information Service (CANDIS).

==History and profile==
''Peace Magazine'' was launched in 1985 as a continuation of an earlier CANDIS publication, ''The Peace Calendar'', which appeared monthly between February 1983 and January 1985. Originally a simple listings sheet for Toronto-area peace events, ''The Peace Calendar'' had expanded into a 12-page tabloid with articles and analysis in addition to Canada-wide listings in the period immediately before the ''Peace Magazine'' launch.

The magazine published monthly from March to December 1985; bimonthly from January–February 1986 to May–June 1999; and quarterly since July–September 1999. There has been formal and informal cooperation with other Canadian and international [[peace]] organizations throughout the magazine's history; from 1993–2006 the magazine included a section produced in collaboration with [[Science for Peace]]. 

''Peace Magazine'' was one of the first Canadian magazines to be produced with desktop publishing software. Its website has been online since 1997, includes a full set of archives from 1983 to the end of the preceding calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemagazine.org/ Peace Magazine homepage], Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has had a strong editorial emphasis on [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and the technical aspects of [[disarmament]]. Its writers are roughly equally distributed between activists and academics, with considerable overlap between these two spheres. The editor is retired sociologist and peace activist [[Metta Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemagazine.org/info.htm Peace Magazine website, "About Peace Magazine"], Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Glassen''' (1920–1986) was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1949 until his death in 1986. He was previously (1948–49) a member of the psychology department at the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. He developed a considerable reputation as an analytic moral philosopher on the basis of a number of articles published in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was also known for his arguments against metaphysical materialism.

==Early years==
Born in [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]] (then the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) on October 19, 1920, Glassen emigrated with his parents to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] in 1929, residing on Gladstone Avenue in the city's west end. He graduated from [[Bloor Collegiate Institute]] in 1940. Among other academic awards, Glassen received the R.W. Leonard Entrance Scholarship for General Proficiency from the [[University of Toronto]], valued at what was then the very substantial sum of $900. He graduated from the university with a B.A. in 1944 and an M.A. in 1945.

==Studies at Harvard==

In 1945, Glassen entered [[Harvard University]], having been awarded the Philip H. Sears scholarship. There he studied with [[Ralph Barton Perry]], [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]], Henry D. Aiken, [[Walter Terence Stace|W. T. Stace]], [[Henry Austryn Wolfson]] and others. In October 1947 he qualified for the A.M. degree and, under Aiken's supervision, continued to work on his doctoral dissertation ("The Ethics of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson", later changed to "The Criterion of Rightness in Action") for several years, but never completed his Ph.D. due to his commitments as an assistant professor.&lt;ref&gt;Most of the biographical details of early life and academic career, etc. are from a copy of a Harvard University form dated October 1, 1947, filled out by Glassen.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at the University of Manitoba==

Glassen's first set of publications consisted in eight papers published in major philosophical journals in 1957, 1958 and 1959. These reflected his core interests: analytic moral theory (where he was a [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]] and champion of [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] analysis), [[value theory]] (particularly the classification of, and distinctions among, moral and non-moral varieties of normative judgment), and [[epistemology]] (notably the question of the possibility of [[synthetic a priori]] knowledge). There followed a period of reduced activity, with two papers on cognitivism in 1962 and 1963, several reviews for ''Dialogue'' from 1963 to 1970, and finally a series of papers on another subject of enduring interest—the refutation of arguments against [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]—between 1976 and 1984. Glassen also authored a number of conference papers, including two that were published in the proceedings of the 12th and 13th meetings of the [[International Congress of Philosophy]], in 1958 and 1963 respectively. Several other papers were unpublished and—with one or two exceptions—are likely lost.

In 1961, Glassen travelled to [[England]] on a [[Canada Council]] grant, meeting with many leading moral philosophers of the time, including [[W. D. Ross|Sir David Ross]], [[H. B. Acton]] and others.

Glassen's early promise was not entirely realized. This was at least partly due to the lasting effects of a personal tragedy. While returning from [[Toronto]] to [[Winnipeg]] for the beginning of the 1965-66 school year, Glassen was involved in a car accident that took the life of the other driver. Though not ultimately found at fault, Glassen never fully recovered from the shock. His scholarly output declined and he turned down an opportunity to move to the more prominent department at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1967. His career might have faded into complete obscurity had it not been for the development of [[eliminative materialism]] by fellow [[University of Manitoba]] philosophers [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] in the 1970s. This aroused his vehement opposition and revived his interest in writing and publishing. After several years of good health, a series of illnesses in 1985-86 brought on a recurrence of depression and alcoholism, leading to his death by suicide on or about March 24, 1986 in [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref&gt;Death notice, "Peter Glassen", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', March 27, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopses of Major Articles==

''Some Questions about Relations'' (1957) is an analysis of the [[ontology]] of [[logic of relatives|relations]]. Glassen argues that a relation has both properties (e.g. reflexivity (R), symmetry (S), transitivity (T)) and content. There must be content because many relations share the same set of properties while not being the same relation (e.g. "to the left of" and "before" are both [-R, -S, T]). Thus a relation "r" may be defined in terms of content and properties, e.g. as {r =df con, p1, p2, p3}. Glassen proceeds to point out several troubling questions that arise when we try to understand whether the relationship between content and properties is necessary or accidental. He admits in his conclusion that, "given the Bradleyan flavour of the problems to which it gives rise", there may be something wrong—and perhaps quite importantly wrong—with the initial distinction between content and properties. This paper was reviewed by [[Alonzo Church]] in ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'' 32:3 (Sept. 1968), p.&amp;nbsp;408.

''A Fallacy in Aristotle's Argument about the Good'' (1957) is a close analysis of a crucial paragraph in Book I, chapter 7 of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]]. Glassen argues that Aristotle fails to show (or even to attempt to argue) that it follows from the fact that the function of a good man is activity of the soul in accordance with virtue that the good of man—his final goal—is precisely that function. This reflects Glassen's attention to the distinction between morality and the broader theory of value. Glassen's argument has been referred to in a number of subsequent papers.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by Kathleen V. Wilkes, "The Good Man and the Good for Man in Aristotle’s Ethics", ''Mind'' 87:553 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurel Kolnai]], referring to the same problem although not specifically to Glassen's paper, called this the "Aristotelian Equivocation".&lt;ref&gt;Aurel Kolnai, "Morality and Practice I" in ''Ethics, Value and Reality: Selected Essays of Aurel Kolnai'' (1978), 63-94 at 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Are There Unresolvable Moral Disputes?'' (1962) was influential in the field of [[Moral realism|ethical objectivism]] in its introduction of subjective bases of approval on top of the objective bases for approval outlined in [[emotivist]] theory - an introduction which made possible the resolution of moral disputes theoretically unresolvable under the emotivist theory. In a way, his work can be seen as straddling the line between emotivism and ethical objectivism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12303">The '''phenomenal concept strategy''' ('''PCS''') is an approach within [[philosophy of mind]] to provide a [[physicalist]] response to anti-physicalist arguments like the [[explanatory gap]] and [[philosophical zombies]]. The name was coined by [[Daniel Stoljar]].&lt;ref name=Stoljar2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Daniel Stoljar|title=Physicalism and Phenomenal Concepts|journal=Mind &amp; Language|date=Nov 2005|volume=20|issue=5|pages=469–494|doi=10.1111/j.0268-1064.2005.00296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[David Chalmers]] put it, PCS "locates the gap in the relationship between our ''concepts'' of physical processes and our ''concepts'' of consciousness, rather than in the relationship between physical processes and consciousness themselves."&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; The idea is that if we can explain why we ''think'' there's an explanatory gap, this will defuse the motivation to question physicalism.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt;

==Overview==

PCS advocates typically subscribe to&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; what Chalmers has called "type-B materialism",&lt;ref name=Chalmers2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=David J.|editor1-link=Stephen P. Stich|editor2-link=Ted A. Warfield|title=The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind|date=2003|isbn=978-0631217756|chapter=Consciousness and its Place in Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that there is an [[epistemic]] but not [[ontological]] gap between physics and subjective experience. PCS maintains that our concepts are [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]], but reality is [[monistic]], in a similar way as "heat" and "molecular motion" are two different concepts that refer to the same property.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; However, phenomenal concepts are different from other concepts in that they incline us to see an epistemic gap.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; PCS suggests that physicalist explanations "cannot feel satisfactory [...] since the concepts used in the physical explanation don't entail any applications of the phenomenal concepts in terms of which the explanandum is characterized."&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007 /&gt;

PCS would help physicalists answer the [[knowledge argument]] because upon seeing red, Mary would have new thoughts about phenomenal concepts, even though those thoughts would only re-express physical facts she already knew. Likewise, we can conceive of zombies even if they aren't possible because when we think about their functional/physical characteristics, we don't also conjure thoughts about phenomenal concepts.&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007 /&gt;

[[David Papineau]] coined the term ''antipathetic fallacy'' to refer to the way in which we fail to see phenomenal experience in brain processing. It's the opposite of the [[pathetic fallacy]] of seeing consciousness in non-minds.&lt;ref name=Papineau2002 /&gt;

==Types of concepts==

Chalmers outlines several ways in which phenomenal concepts might be distinctive:&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt;

===Recognitional concepts===

These are so-called "type-demonstratives" in which we point to "one of ''those''". For instance:&lt;ref name=Loar1997&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brian Loar|editor1-link=Ned Block|editor2-link=Owen Flanagan|editor3-link=Güven Güzeldere|title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|chapter=Phenomenal states II}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Suppose you go into the California desert and spot a succulent never seen before. You become adept at recognizing instances, and gain a recognitional command of their kind, without a name for it; you are disposed to identify positive and negative instances and thereby pick out a kind. These dispositions are typically linked with capacities to form images, whose conceptual role seems to be to focus thoughts about an identifiable kind in the absence of currently perceived instances.

[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] suggests&lt;ref name=Carruthers2000&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Carruthers|title=Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521781732}}&lt;/ref&gt; that phenomenal concepts are ''purely'' recognitional, which means&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007 /&gt;
# they apply directly to instances
# they are ''conceptually isolated'', i.e., don't have ''a priori'' connections with other concepts (including physical or functional concepts).

===Distinct conceptual roles===

We think about physical and phenomenal concepts in different ways.&lt;ref name=Hill1997&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christopher S. Hill|title=Imaginability, conceivability, possibility, and the mind-body problem|journal=Philosophical Studies|date=Jul 1997|volume=87|issue=1|pages=61–85|doi=10.1023/A:1017911200883|issn=1573-0883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indexical concepts===

Several philosophers have suggested that phenomenal concepts denote brain states indexically, in a similar way as saying "now" picks out a particular time. Even given full knowledge of physics, additional indexical information is required to say where and when one is.&lt;ref name=Perry1979&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John Perry|title=The Problem of the Essential Indexical|journal=Noûs|date=Mar 1979|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–21|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lderosse/courses/lang/Perry(1979).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotational/constitutional concepts===

Some contend that phenomenal states are part of the concepts that refer to them. For instance, Papineau suggests that phenomenal concepts are ''quotational'', like saying "That state: ___."&lt;ref name=Papineau2002&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Papineau|title=[[Thinking about Consciousness]]|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199243822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katalin Balog defends a ''constitutional account'' of phenomenal concepts, in which "token experiences serve as modes of presentation of the phenomenal properties they instantiate."&lt;ref name=Balog2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Katalin Balog|title=In Defense of the Phenomenal Concept Strategy|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jan 2012|volume=84|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00541.x|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~kbalog/Web%20publications/PCS-Response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}} For instance, the concept of pain is partly constituted by a [[Type–token distinction|token]] experience of pain.&lt;ref name=Balog2012 /&gt;{{rp|7}} She claims this position helps resolve the explanatory gap because an ''a priori'' description alone doesn't suffice to express the concept; in addition, a direct experiential constitution is required.&lt;ref name=Balog2012 /&gt;{{rp|8}} While it seems like physical/functional information about {{chem|H|2|O}} tells us all there is about it, we feel something more for phenomenality because we "have a 'substantive' grasp of its nature."&lt;ref name=Balog2012 /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Papineau takes a similar position.&lt;ref name=Papineau2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Papineau|title=Confusions about Consciousness|journal=Richmond Journal of Philosophy|date=Autumn 2003|volume=5|url=http://www.richmond-philosophy.net/rjp/back_issues/rjp5_papineau.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that normal physical identity statements (such as that heat is molecular kinetic energy) involve two descriptions, which we can associate in our minds. In contrast, we think about a phenomenal concept by either "actually undergoing the experience" or at least by imagining it, and this creates a "what-it’s-likeness" sensation. Then:&lt;ref name=Papineau2003 /&gt;
:This subjective commonality can easily confuse us when we contemplate identities like ''pains = nociceptive-specific neuronal activity''.  We focus on the left-hand side, deploy our phenomenal concept of pain (that feeling), and therewith feel something akin to pain.  Then we focus on the right-hand side, deploy our concept of ''nociceptive-specific neurons'', and feel nothing (or at least nothing in the pain dimension—we may visually imagine axons and dendrites and so on).   And so we conclude that the right hand side ''leaves out'' the feeling of pain itself, the unpleasant what-it’s-likeness, and refers only to the distinct physical correlates of pain.
Papineau compares the situation to the [[use–mention distinction]]: Phenomenal concepts directly use the experiences to which they refer, while physical descriptions merely mention them.&lt;ref name=Papineau2003 /&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Chalmers's "master argument"===

David Chalmers presents "A Master Argument" against PCS.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; He defines C as the PCS thesis that
# humans have psychological features
# that explain why we have the apparent epistemic gaps with consciousness,
# and this explanation is purely physical.
All three of these must hold for PCS to succeed. He defines P as all physical facts. Then he poses a dilemma:
* "If P&amp;~C is conceivable, then C is not physically explicable." This is because P&amp;~C logically means physics alone doesn't explain C. If true, this horn would invalidate #3 of C.
* "If P&amp;~C is not conceivable, then C cannot explain our epistemic situation." This is because if P&amp;~C is not conceivable, C must follow straightforwardly from P. Hence, even zombies would satisfy C (since nothing more than P is required). But zombies would not completely share our epistemic situation—for instance, because their statements that "I'm phenomenally conscious" would be false while ours would be true. Since zombies might also share C, C doesn't explain why our epistemic situation is different from theirs. If true, this horn would invalidate #2 of C.
Regardless of which horn is true, C is invalidated.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=David J.|editor1-link=Torin Alter|editor2-link=Sven Walter|title=Phenomenal Concepts and Phenomenal Knowledge: New Essays on Consciousness and Physicalism|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=Phenomenal Concepts and the Explanatory Gap|url=http://consc.net/papers/pceg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reply====

Carruthers and Veillet argue that Chalmers's argument commits a fallacy of equivocation between first-person and third-person phenomenal concepts, but the authors reformulate it to avoid that problem. They proceed to attack the revised argument by denying the premise that if zombies must have third-person phenomenal concepts, then phenomenal concepts can't account for the explanatory gap. In particular, they suggest that, pace Chalmers, people and zombies would have the same epistemic situation even though the ''contents'' of their situations would be different. For instance, a person's phenomenal concept would have content of a phenomenal state, while the "schmenomenal" concept of a zombie would have content about a "schmenomenal" state. A zombie "is correct when he says that he is conscious, because he isn't saying that he has phenomenal states as we understand them. He is correct because he means that he has schmenomenal states, and he has them." So people and zombies can both have true beliefs justified in similar ways (same epistemic situation), even if those beliefs are ''about'' different things.&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peter Carruthers|author2=Bénédicte Veillet|title=The Phenomenal Concept Strategy|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|date=1 Jan 2007|volume=14|issue=9-10|pages=212–236|url=http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/Phenomenal%20Concept%20Strategy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
'''''Philosophaster''''' is a [[Latin]] [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy]] by [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]. He began writing the play in 1606 and completed it by 1615.&lt;ref&gt;According to the title page of Burton's manuscript. Burton originally wrote 'Inchoata 1606' (begun) and changed the 'Inchoata' to 'Scripta' (written) later. See page xi of William E. Buckley's preface to his Roxburghe Club publication of ''Philosophaster, comoedia, nunc primum in lucem producta. Poemata, antehac sparsim edita, nunc in unum collecta / auctore Roberto Burtono'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by  students in the Hall of [[Christ Church, Oxford]] on 16 February 1618 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]&lt;ref&gt;The dates in the manuscripts of the play are in '[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]' in which the year ends on 31 March.&lt;/ref&gt;). The play was not published in Burton's lifetime, and it remained in manuscript till 1862 when it was edited by William Edward Buckley and published by the [[Roxburghe Club]]. It was first translated into English by [[Paul Jordan-Smith]] and published by [[Stanford University Press]], California in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[[Holbrook Jackson]] in his Introduction to Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy, London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd., 1972, p. vi and footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the play is about someone who pretends to be a [[philosophy|philosopher]], the term itself has been used in more recent times to refer to a pretender to philosophy.

== Plot ==
A university is established by the [[Duke]] of Osuna in the small town of [[Osuna]] in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. The university is well-endowed, and it offers salaries and other incentives for students and academics all over Europe. Unfortunately, as well as honest and reputable people, the new university also attracts 'philosophasters' or sham philosophers. These include confidence tricksters, fraudsters and others who are more interested in making money than in contributing to academic life. The play is about the havoc caused by these people and by prostitutes attracted to the town. The townspeople are outraged, and The Duke is inclined to close the university down. However, two scholars persuade him not to do so. Instead, he summons both the villains and the victims before a Tribunal. All the wrongs are righted, and the villains are punished. The two scholars are put in charge of the University which is established on a better footing. The play ends with everyone singing a hymn in praise of philosophy.&lt;ref name=play&gt;''Robert Burton's Philosophaster, with an English translation of the same. Together with his other minor writings in prose and verse.'' Translation, introduction and notes by Paul Jordan-Smith. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1931, pp. 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
=== Philosophasters ===
The philosophasters in the play include:
* '''Polupragmaticus''' - a [[Jesuit]] priest who defrauded noblemen in the guise of a teacher, politician, courtier, theologian, or magician. 
* '''Pantomagus''' - an [[alchemist]] and [[physician]] who plied fake medicines. He also deceived a nobleman into believing that he could produce mountains of gold through the practice of alchemy. He would disappear when he had bankrupted a household. 
* '''Pedanus''' - a teacher of grammar who obtained by deception two [[Benefice|livings]] or ecclesiastical posts and was plotting to become the Duke's [[chaplain]]. 
* '''Amphimacer''' - a [[poetaster]] or sham poet who composed certain silly poems for his mistress and anyone else. 
* '''Theanus,''' a theologaster or sham [[theologian]] who was lazy and idle.&lt;ref name=play/&gt;

== Background ==
The background to the play is the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605. The play was written shortly after this Catholic plot to blow up King and Parliament, and it reflects the anti-catholic feeling of the time. Burton, in fact, refers to a real [[Pedro Téllez-Girón, 1st Duke of Osuna|Duke of Osuna]] who set up a university in [[Osuna]] in 1548. He chose this university because Andalusian universities were very religious, pro-catholic and peddled the worst kind of [[scholasticism]]. He is also attacking the [[Jesuits]] who were very active in his time, and the play portrays them as anti-social villains: "The typical Jesuit is ‘a notorious Bawd, &amp; famous Fornicator, ''lascivum pecus'', a very goat’ (AM 1.40), and the Jesuits play many ‘pranks’."&lt;ref&gt;See Kathryn Murphy, "Jesuits and Philosophasters: Robert Burton's Response to the Gunpowder Plot", ''Journal of the Northern Renaissance'', 1:1 (Spring 2009), p.6. This paper is freely available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term ==
[[Erwin Schrödinger]] used the term "philosophasters" in his 1952 Lecture on ''Transformation and Interpretation in [[Quantum Mechanics]]''. He wrote, ''With all the milliards of dollars and pounds the governments now lavish on the promotion of physics, I maintain that nobody has ever yet been able to procure a physical system whose wave-function was known to him or to anybody else. Therefore the whole idea of predicting the results of future observations from the wave-function is, in this dogmatic form, a dream of positivist philophasters.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schrödinger|first1=Erwin|title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|date=1995|publisher=Ox Bow Press|location=Woodbridge, CT|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">The '''psychology of science''' is a branch of the studies of science that includes [[philosophy of science]], [[history of science]], and sociology of science or [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]. The psychology of science is defined most simply as the scientific study of scientific thought or behavior. The field first gained popularity in the 1960s, with [[Abraham Maslow]] publishing an influential text on the subject in 1966, but this popularity faded, only re-emerging in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cUm4piWluecC|title=Scientific Genius: A Psychology of Science|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|date=1988-06-24|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780521352871|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some key figures currently in the psychology of science are [[William Brewer (psychologist)|William Brewer]], Kevin Dunbar, Gregory Feist, [[Michael Gorman (academic)|Michael Gorman]], [[David Klahr]], Barbara Kosloswki, [[Deanna Kuhn]], Sofia Liberman, Dean Keith Simonton, Will Shadish, [[Frank Sulloway]], [[Paul Thagard]], Ryan Tweney, [[Ron Westrum]], and Wendy Parker.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The psychology of science applies methods and theory from psychology to the analysis of scientific thought and behavior, each of which is defined both narrowly and broadly. Narrowly defined, "science" refers to thought and behavior of professional scientists and technologists. More broadly defined, "science" refers to thought and behavior of any one (present or past) of any age engaged in theory construction, learning scientific or mathematical concepts, model building, hypothesis testing, scientific reasoning, problem finding or solving, or creating or working on technology. Indeed, mathematical, engineering, and invention activities are included in both the broader and narrower definitions as well. The methods of psychology that are applied to the study of scientific thought and behavior include psychohistorical, psychobiographical, observational, descriptive, correlational, and experimental techniques.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The psychology of science has well-established literature in most every subfield of [[psychology]], including but not limited to neuroscientific, developmental, cognitive, personality, motivational, social, industrial/organizational, and clinical. Feist's 2006 book ''The Psychology of Science and the Origins of the Scientific Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Feist, G.J. (2006). ''The Psychology of Science and the Origins of the Scientific Mind''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; reviews and integrates much of this literature. 

How scientific concepts are learned is a major topic for the psychology of [[science education]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''''Pu''''' is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word meaning "unworked wood; inherent quality; simple" that was an early [[Daoist]] metaphor for the natural state of humanity, and relates with the Daoist keyword ''[[ziran]]'' (literally "self so") "natural; spontaneous". The scholar [[Ge Hong]] (283-343 CE) immortalized ''pu'' in his [[pen name]] ''Baopuzi'' "Master who Embraces Simplicity" and [[eponymous]] book ''[[Baopuzi]]''.

==Terminology==
''Pu'' can be written with either of the [[variant Chinese characters]] [[wikt:樸|樸]] or [[wikt:朴|朴]], which are linguistically complex.

===Characters===
Both 樸 and 朴 are classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic characters]], combining the semantically significant [[Radical 75|"tree" radical]] {{linktext|木}} (commonly used for writing names of trees and wooden objects) with the phonetic indicators ''pu'' {{linktext|菐}} or ''bu'' {{linktext|卜}}.

The [[Chinese character]] ''pu'' 樸 was first recorded on [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771-476 BCE), and the character ''pu'' 朴 was first recorded in [[Chinese classics]] from the [[Warring States]] period (475-221 BCE).

When the [[People's Republic of China]] promulgated [[simplified Chinese characters]] in 1956, the established variant ''pu'' 朴 (with 6 [[Stroke (CJKV character)|strokes]]) was chosen to replace the [[traditional Chinese character]] ''pu'' 樸 (with 16 [[Stroke (CJKV character)|strokes]]).

One of the two (c. 168 BCE) [[Mawangdui Silk Texts#Tao Te Ching|Mawangdui silk manuscript]] versions of the ''Daodejing'', discovered in 1973 by archeologists excavating a tomb, uses a rare textual variant character for ''pu'' 樸: ''wò'' 楃 "a house tent (esp. with a wooden roof)", written with the "tree radical" and ''wu'' 屋 "room; house" phonetic. The "B" text, like the received version, uses ''pu'' 樸 8 times in 6 chapters; the "A" text uses ''wò'' 楃 6 times in 4 chapters and has [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in chapters 19 and 57. The (c. 121 CE) ''Shuowen jiezi'' defines ''wo'' 楃 as ''muzhang'' 木帳 "wood canopy", and the (early 3rd century) ''[[Guangya]]'' defines it as ''choumu'' 幬幕 "curtain; cover". These variant words ''pú'' &lt; *''phrôk'' 樸 "unworked wood" and ''wò'' &lt; *''ʔôk'' 楃 "house tent" are semantically and phonologically dissimilar.

===Pronunciations and meanings===

The comprehensive Chinese character dictionary ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' (1987: 2:1291, 2:1154) lists 2 pronunciations and 8 meanings for the character 樸, and 6 pronunciations and 11 meanings for 朴; which are summarized below.

The graph 樸 can be read:
*''pǔ'' 
#"unworked wood", 
#"cut down; fell trees" 
#"nature; essence; intrinsic quality" (compare English ''in the rough'')
#"simple; plain; unadorned; unaffected"
#"(economics) net cost"
*''pú'' 
#"grow thickly (of plants); shrub"
#"an oak tree"
#"attached; affixed"

The graph 朴 can be read to mean:
*''pǔ'' 
#"unworked wood; natural; plain; etc." (= ''pǔ'' 樸)
#"large"
#"[[Curing (food preservation)|uncured]] meat" 
*''pū''
# "root; basis; origin"
#"beat; hit; an instrument of torture" (= ''pū'' 撲)
*''pò'' 
#"tree bark; (esp.) magnolia bark" in ''houpo'' 厚朴 "''[[Magnolia officinalis]]'' bark (used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]])" 
#in ''pòshù'' 朴樹 "''[[Celtis sinensis]]'', Chinese hackberry"
*''pō'' 
#in ''[[Podao|pōdāo]]'' 朴刀 "a kind of two-handed sword"
*''Pú'' 
#"a surname", namely [[Park (Korean surname)]]
*''Piáo''
# "a surname"

The ''[[Erya]]'', which is the oldest Chinese dictionary, defined ''pu'' 樸 and ''supu'' 樕樸 as "oak" names (in "Explaining Trees" chapter 14). First, ''pu'' 樸 is defined as ''bao'' 枹 (14:45). [[Guo Pu]]'s ''Erya'' commentary identified this ''pu'' tree as ''yupu'' 棫樸 "''[[Quercus acutissima]]'', saw-tooth oak" (which occurs in the ''Shijing'' below). ''Bao'' 枹 is usually read ''fu'' "drumstick", and Guo noted this name ''bao'' denoted "a kind of oak [樸] that grew in clumps", and quotes the ''Shijing'' usage as ''baoli'' 枹櫟 instead of ''baoli'' 苞櫟 "bushy oak" (see below). The ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' says there are two varieties of ''hu'' 槲 "''[[Quercus mongolica]]'', Mongolian oak", the ''bao'' 枹 is small and grows in clumps while the ''li'' 櫟 is tall and has large leaves. Second, ''supu'' 樕樸 is defined as ''xin'' 心 "heart; mind" (14:64). Guo identifies ''supu'' (cf. reverse ''pusu'' 樸樕 in the ''Shijing'' below) as ''husu'' 槲樕 (with ''hu'' 槲 "Mongolian oak"), the "''[[Quercus dentata]]'', daimyo oak". While ''xin'' "heart; mind" is a common Chinese word, this ''Erya'' definition is the only known context in which it names a tree. The ''Yijing'' uses ''xin'' to mean "thorn; prick", (tr. Wilhelm 1967:277): "Among varieties of wood it means those which are firm and have much pith".

The ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', the first Chinese dictionary of characters, simply defines ''pu'' 朴 as ''mupi'' 木皮 "tree bark; wood with bark", and ''pu'' 樸 as ''musu'' 木素 "plain wood; unworked lumber" (later meaning "[[lignin]]" in scientific terminology).

Returning to the central Daoist meaning of ''pu'', 
Pas and Leung (1998:351) challenge the stereotyped  "uncarved block" translation of ''pu'': "The idea implied in it comes closer to "wholeness," which is also contained in "uncarved block," except that "uncarved block" has been reified. As a result, what was an excellent analogy of the Tao has become sterile and counterproductive." 
Citing the ''pu'' translations of [[Séraphin Couvreur]] (1890:475) "wood that has not been worked on; simple, without ornament, without disguise" and [[Bernhard Karlgren]] (1923:231) "wood in its natural state, not worked: rough, plain, natural, simple"; Pas and Leung conclude, "it is obvious where the expression "uncarved block" came from, but the addition of "block" is an interpretation. The term means "plain wood," "uncarved wood.""

===Etymology===
[[Reconstructions of Old Chinese]] pronunciations have transformed Chinese [[etymology]]. [[Old Chinese]] reconstructions of ''pu'' or ''bu'' 樸 include: 
*''bú'' &lt; *''pûk'' or *''b'ûk'' (Dong 1948)
*''bú'' &lt; *''puk'' or *''b'uk'' "shrubby trees", ''pŭ'' &lt; *''p'uk'' "rough; unadorned", and ''pò'' &lt; *''p'ǔk'' "trim unworked wood; robust, solid" (Karlgren 1957:312)
*''pú'' &lt; *''phruk'' (Li 1971)
*''bú'' &lt; *''puk'' or *''buk'' (Zhou 1972)
*''pú'' &lt; *''phrôk'' "to trim wood", "in a natural state, unworked" (Schuessler 2007:418)
* ''pŭ'' &lt; *''pʰˤrok'' "unworked wood" (Baxter and Sagart 2001:118)

[[Victor Mair]] (1990:138) suggests that ''pu'' &lt; *''phluk'' 樸 "unhewn log" is "almost certainly related to the English word "block," which probably derives from the Indo-European root ''bhelk'' (beam)."

Axel Schuessler (2007:418) says the etymology of ''pú'' &lt; *''phrôk'' "to trim wood" could either be an "aspirated iterative derivation" from ''bāo'' &lt; *''prôk'' 剝 "cut up, peel, pluck", or "belong to the homophonous etymon with the basic meaning 'in a natural state, unworked', as in ''pú'' 樸 'in a natural state', 璞 'unworked precious stone'."

==Early textual references==
''Pu'' occurs in some of the earliest [[Chinese classics]], frequently in Daoist ones.

===Shijing===
Two odes in the ''[[Shijing]]'' "Classic of Poetry" use ''pu'' 樸 [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] to mean "an oak".

''Pusu'' 樸樕 occurs in Ode 23: "scrubby oaks" (Legge 1879:34), "a clump of oaks" (Waley 1937:60), "low shrubby trees" (Karlgren 1950:13). The Mao commentary describes the ''pusu'' as a 小木 "small tree". The ''Erya'' (above) writes this reversible compound as ''supu'' 樕樸.

''Yupu'' 棫樸 is the name of Ode 238, which records using this tree for firewood: "the ''yih'' and the ''p'oh''" (Legge 1879:442), "the oak clumps" (Waley 1937:266, Karlgren 1950:191). Commentaries describe the ''yupu'' as a "dense and shrubby tree".

In addition, Ode 132 has ''baoli'' 苞櫟: "the bushy oaks" (Legge 1879:201), "a clump of oaks" (Waley 1937:75), "luxuriant oaks" (Karlgren 1950:85). The ''Erya'' has ''baoli'' 枹櫟, writing ''bao'' as 枹 "an oak" instead of 苞 "bushy; luxuriant".

===Shujing===
The ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of History" (''Zhoushu'' 周書, ''Zicai'' 梓材 "[[Chinese catalpa]] lumber" section) uses ''pu'' once in the compound ''pozhou'' 樸斫 (''po'' "trim unworked wood" and ''zhuo'' "hack; chop off"): "as in working with the wood of the rottlera, when the toil of the coarser and finer operations has been completed, they have to apply the paint of red and other colours" (Legge 1899:417), "It is as when one works on catalpa wood; when he has toiled in trimming and carving it, he should take measures for making it red or green" (Karlgren 1950:48). Legge notes that ''pu'' means "the rough fashioning of the work" and ''zhou'' means "the fine finish given to it". Karlgren (1970:313) quotes the Han commentator [[Ma Rong (Han dynasty)|Ma Rong]] that ''po'' 樸 denotes "wood that has not yet been worked into a utensil; unworked wood", and concludes  ''po'' means "to treat the unworked wood (in the first rough cutting); to trim" is a variation of the same stem as ''pu'' 樸 "in a natural state; simple".

===Daodejing===
Six ''[[Daodejing]]'' chapters use ''pu'' 樸, two of them twice, for a total of 8 occurrences. 

Chapter 19 parallels the near-synonyms ''su'' {{linktext|素}} "raw silk; white; plain; simple; quiet" and ''pu'' 樸 "unworked wood; plain; simple", and was the source for Ge Hong's pen-name Baopuzi "Master who Embraces Simplicity". 
*Evince the plainness of undyed silk, Embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; Lessen selfishness, Diminish desires; Abolish learning and you will be without worries. (19, tr. Mair 1990:81)
Holmes Welch (1957:35) describes ''pu'' "the Uncarved Block" and ''su'' "Raw Silk" as symbols that Laozi used to expound his basic doctrine of "the return to our original nature". In modern usage, ''pu'' and ''su'' mean "plain," but originally ''pu'' "was wood as it came from the tree before man had dressed it", while ''su'' "was silk that man had never dyed or painted."  

Chapters 28 and 57 mention simple ''pu'' in reference to ''shengren'' {{linktext|聖人}} "sages", Chapter 15 similarly refers to ancient Daoist adepts and describes ''pu'' as ''dun'' {{linktext|敦}} "sincere; honest; plain".
*If eternal integrity suffices, You will return to the simplicity of the unhewn log. ... When the unhewn log is sawn apart, it is made into tools; When the sage is put to use, he becomes the chief of officials. For Great carving does no cutting. (28, tr. Mair 1990:93) 
*The sage has a saying: "I take no action, yet the people transform themselves; I do not interfere in affairs, yet the people enrich themselves; I desire not to desire, yet the people of themselves become simple as unhewn logs." (57, tr. Mair 1990:26) 
*Those of old who were adept in the Way were ... hesitant, as though crossing a stream in winter; cautious, as though fearful of their neighbors all around; solemn, as though guests in someone else's house; shrinking, as ice when it melts; plain, as an unhewn log; muddled, as turbid waters; expansive, as a broad valley. (15, tr. Mair 1990:76)
Among all the ''Daodejing'' occurrences of ''pu'', chapter 28 is the only case in which the transmitted and excavated versions are significantly different – the transmitted text has an extra grammatical [[Chinese particles|particle]] ''zhi'' 之 "a [[possessive]] marker; a 3rd person pronoun" after ''yong'' 用 "use; employ". Robert G. Henricks (1989:242) explains this small grammatical change between the standard text saying the sage ''yong zhi'' "uses it" and the excavated silk text saying ''yong'' "is used". The transmitted version 樸散則為器聖人用之則為官長 "When the uncarved wood is broken up, it is turned into concrete things. But when the sage uses it, he becomes the leading official." should be read 樸散則為器聖人用則為官長 "When uncarved wood is cut up, it's turned into vessels. When the Sage is used, he becomes the Head of Officials." [[D. C. Lau]] (1989:183) says the traditional passage "seems to say that when the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels. A vessel is a specialist who is only fitted to be an official. Hence the sage when he makes use of these vessels becomes the lord over the officials.", but in Mawangdui passage, "The meaning is very different. The uncarved block is a symbol for the sage. Just as the uncarved block becomes vessels when it shatters so does the sage become the chief of the officials when he allows himself to be employed, and just as the uncarved block is ruined when it becomes useful, so does a sage become ruined when he becomes useful." The word ''qi'' 器 "vessel; utensil" is translated here as "tools", "concrete things", "vessels", "specialists", and "officials".

Chapters 32 and 37 both address ''houwang'' 侯王 "feudal lords and kings" and describe the ''Dao'' as ''wuming'' {{linktext|無名}} "nameless", while 37 also calls ''pu'' "nameless".
*The Way is eternally nameless. Though the unhewn log is small, No one in the world dares subjugate it. If feudal lords and kings could maintain it, The myriad creatures would submit of themselves. (32, tr. Mair 1990:99) 
*The Way is eternally nameless. If feudal lords and kings preserve it, The myriad creatures will be transformed by themselves. After transformation, if they wish to rise up, I shall restrain them with the nameless unhewn log. By restraining them with the nameless unhewn log, They will not feel disgraced; Not feeling disgraced, They will be still, Whereupon heaven and earth will be made right by themselves. (37, tr. Mair 1990:105)
Chapter 37 has a minor textual difference between ''buyu'' 不欲 "not desire" in the standard version and ''buru'' 不辱 "not disgrace" in the Mawangdui version (Henricks 1989:260).

Lau (1989:xxx) explains ''pu'' in the ''Daodejing'' primarily means "the uncarved block is in a state as yet untouched by the artificial interference of human ingenuity and so is a symbol for the original state of man before desire is produced in him by artificial means".

The (c. 3rd century CE) ''[[Heshang Gong]]'' commentary version of this Daoist text interchangeably writes ''pu'' as both 樸 and 朴. Three chapters (28, 32, 37) use 樸 in both text and commentary, and one (15) uses 朴 in both. One (19) uses 樸 in text and 朴 in commentary, and another (57) uses 朴 in text and 樸 in commentary.
*"If they change and want to rise, the ego will suppress them by means of the [樸] simplicity of the nameless."; "The ego is the personality. The [樸] simplicity of the nameless is Tao. If all beings change into their selves, but afterwards revert to desire and exhibit shrewdness and hypocrisy, the princes and the king are obliged to suppress personality by means of Tao and Te." (37, tr. Erkes 1958:70)
*"Simple like [朴] unworked wood."; "What is simple is material and firm. The form of unworked wood is not yet carved. Within one ought to take care of the spirits, outwards one ought not to be pretentious." (15, tr. Erkes 1958:36)
*"Look at simplicity and hold fast to [樸] naturalness."; "To look at simplicity corresponds to holding fast to simplicity and keeping to truth as well as to not looking at externals. To hold fast to [朴] naturalness corresponds to looking at real naturalness in order to show it to the subjects. Thereby one may become a model." (19, tr. Erkes 1958:42)
*"I am without desires, and the people are [朴] simple of themselves."; "If I am always without desires, if I do away with externals, then the people will follow me and remain [樸] simple and natural." (57, tr. Erkes 1958:102)

Of nine ''Daodejing'' chapters without 樸 or 朴 in the text, three (3, 38, 41) use 樸 in commentary, and six (17, 64, 68, 71, 80, 81) use 朴. For examples, 
*"He [the saint] always induces the people not to know and not to desire."; "Return to [樸] simplicity and retain purity." (3, tr. Erkes 1958:18)
*"Sincere words are not beautiful."; "Sincere words are true words. What is not beautiful is [朴] simple and real." (81, tr. Erkes 1958:134)

Welch (1957:84) paraphrases the ''Daodejing'' relationship among ''pu'', ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' "inherent character; inner power", and ''[[Wu wei|wuwei]]'' "non-action; non-doing". Outwardly, one cannot achieve ''de'' "until you have erased the aggressive patterns etched by society into your nature. You must return to your natural self, to [''pu'']. You must discard morality and ambition, for if you keep these you will never be capable of compassion, moderation, and humility. When you discard some of your wishes, you will have them all." Inwardly, one performs several cultivations. "For, to achieve the outward [''pu''] you will have to cultivate a [''wuwei''] of the mind. And when the mind is quiet, [''pu''] will deepen. It will become a faculty for intuitively sensing the order of the universe—the [Dao] that can be named."

===Zhuangzi===
''Pu'' occurs 20 times in the (ca. 3rd century BCE) Daoist classic ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''. The standard ''Zhuangzi'' text writes ''pu'' both with the 16–stroke character 樸 six times in three chapters (9, 13, and 31) and with the 6–stroke variant character 朴 fourteen times in six chapters (7, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20), which evidences the heterogeneous textual origins. For instance, the word ''pubi'' (with ''bi'' 鄙 "low; mean; vulgar; unsophisticated") is written both樸鄙 "crude, mean [heart]" (chapter 31, tr. Mair 1994:332) and 朴鄙 "simple and unsophisticated [people]" (10, tr. Mair 1994:87).

A frequently occurring ''Zhuangzi'' metaphor contrasts returning to ''pu'' 樸 "unhewn log" with carving ''qi'' 器 "vessels" (which means "specialist; official" in ''Daodejing'' 28). 
*In a world of ultimate integrity, men would dwell together with the birds and the beasts. ... Equally without desire, this is called [素樸] "the simplicity of the unhewn log". With [素樸] the simplicity of the unhewn log, the people would attain their nature. ... Therefore, if [純樸] the simple, unhewn log remained intact, who would carve a sacrificial vessel from it? ... The [殘樸] carving of the unhewn log into [器] instruments is the fault of the craftsman; the impairment of the Way and integrity with humaneness and righteousness is the error of the sage. (9, tr. Mair 1994:81-82)
*[[Lie Yukou|Liezi]] "came to believe that he had barely begun to learn. ... He took no sides in affairs and [彫琢復朴] whittled himself back to the simplicity of the unhewn log. Clodlike, he stood alone in his physical form. Sealed off against perplexity, in this manner he remained whole to the end." (7, tr. Mair 1994:70)
*"I have heard it said, 'After all the carving and chiseling, [復歸於朴] Return to the simplicity of the unhewn log'." (20, tr. Mair 1994:190)

Another ''Zhuangzi'' chapter uses this term ''fupu'' 復朴 "return to simplicity".
*If you were to meet someone who understands great plainness, who subscribes to nonaction and [復朴] returns to the simplicity of the unhewn log, who embodies his nature and embraces his spirit, so as to wander through the common world, you would really be surprised! (12, tr. Mair 1994:112-113)

'''''Pāramitā''''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]) or '''''pāramī''''' (Pāli) is "perfection" or "completeness". While, technically, ''pāramī'' and ''pāramitā'' are both Pāli terms, [[Pali literature]] makes far greater reference to ''pāramī''.

== Etymology ==
[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.]] describes the etymology of the term:{{quote|The term ''pāramitā'', commonly translated as "perfection," has two etymologies. The first derives it from the word ''parama'', meaning "highest", "most distant", and hence "chief", "primary", "most excellent". Hence, the substantive can be rendered "excellence" or "perfection". This reading is supported by the ''[[Madhyanta-vibhaga-karika|Madhyāntavibhāga]]'' (V.4), where the twelve excellences (''parama'') are associated with the ten perfections (''pāramitā'').

A more creative yet widely reported etymology divides ''pāramitā'' into ''pāra'' and ''mita'', with ''pāra'' meaning "beyond", "the further bank, shore or boundary," and ''mita'', meaning "that which has arrived," or ''ita'' meaning "that which goes." ''Pāramitā'', then means "that which has gone beyond," "that which goes beyond," or "transcendent." This reading is reflected in the Tibetan translation ''pha rol tu phyin pa'' ("gone to the other side").{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=21}}}}

# ''[[Śīla|Sīla]] pāramī'' : virtue, morality, proper conduct
# ''[[Nekkhamma]] pāramī'' : renunciation
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Paññā]] pāramī'' : transcendental wisdom, insight
# ''[[Vīrya|Viriya]] pāramī'' : energy, diligence, vigour, effort
# ''[[Kshanti|Khanti]] pāramī'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance
# ''[[Sacca]] pāramī'' : truthfulness, honesty
# ''[[Adhiṭṭhāna]] pāramī'' : determination, resolution
# ''[[Mettā]] pāramī'' : goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness
# ''[[Upekkha|Upekkhā]] pāramī'' : equanimity, serenity

Two of the above [[virtue]]s, mettā and ''upekkhā'', also are [[brahmavihara|brahmavihāras]].

=== Historicity ===
The Theravādin teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (''[[Jataka tales]]'', ''[[Apadāna]]'', ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhavaṃsa]]'', ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariyāpiṭaka]]'') and post-canonical [[Atthakatha|commentaries]] written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time, and thus might not be an original part of the Theravādin teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"[Prose portions of the ''Jātakas''] originally did not form part of [the Theravādins] scriptures": Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the ''Cariyāpiṭaka'', Horner (2000), ''Cariyāpiṭaka'' section, p. vi, writes that it is "[c]onsidered to be post-[[Asoka]]n...."&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest parts of the ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta Piṭaka]]'' (for example, ''[[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]]'', ''[[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]]'', ''[[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyutta Nikāya]]'' and the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara Nikāya]]'') do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).&lt;ref&gt;"[the Theravādins’] early literature did not refer to the pāramitās." Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion.&lt;ref&gt;"The incorporation of pāramis by the Theravādins in the Jātakas reveals that they were not immune from Mahāyānic influence. This happened, of course, at a much later date[.]" Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is evident that the Hinayānists, either to popularize their religion or to interest the laity more in it, incorporated in their doctrines the conception of Bodhisattva and the practice of pāramitās. This was effected by the production of new literature: the Jātakas and Avadānas." Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 251. The term "Semi-Mahāyāna" occurs here as a subtitle.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;"As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahāyāna sutras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of "wandering alone like a rhinoceros." ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Buddhism is close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the [[śramaṇa]].

=== Traditional practice ===
Bodhi (2005) maintains that, in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four ''[[Sutta Pitaka|nikāyas]]''), those seeking [[Nirvana|the extinction of suffering]] (''nibbana'') pursued the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]].  As time went on, a [[backstory]] was provided for the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|multi-life]] development of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the [[bodhisattva]] (Pāli: ''bodhisatta'').  Over subsequent centuries, the ''pāramīs'' were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and [[Arhat|arahantship]].  Thus, Bodhi (2005) summarizes:
:It should be noted that in established Theravāda tradition the pāramīs are not regarded as a discipline peculiar to candidates for Buddhahood alone but as practices which must be fulfilled by all aspirants to enlightenment and deliverance, whether as [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]], [[paccekabuddha]]s, or [[sravaka|disciples]]. What distinguishes the supreme bodhisattva from aspirants in the other two vehicles is the degree to which the pāramīs must be cultivated and the length of time they must be pursued. But the qualities themselves are universal requisites for deliverance, which all must fulfill to at least a minimal degree to merit the fruits of the liberating path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]  (Converted the document's original use of the [[Velthuis]] convention to [[Pali#Alphabet with diacritics|Pāli]] diacritics.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mahāyāna Buddhism ==

In [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñapāramitā sūtras]], the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' and a large number of other texts list the six perfections:

# ''[[Dāna]] pāramitā'': generosity, giving of oneself (in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, 布施波羅蜜; in Tibetan, སྦྱིན་པ ''sbyin-pa'')
# ''[[Śīla]] pāramitā'' : virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (持戒波羅蜜; ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས ''tshul-khrims'')
# ''[[Kshanti|{{IAST|Kṣānti}}]] pāramitā'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (忍辱波羅蜜; བཟོད་པ ''bzod-pa'')
# ''[[Vīrya]] pāramitā'' : energy, diligence, vigor, effort (精進波羅蜜; བརྩོན་འགྲུས ''brtson-’grus'')
# ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] pāramitā'' : one-pointed concentration, contemplation (禪定波羅蜜, བསམ་གཏན ''bsam-gtan'')
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]] pāramitā'' : wisdom, insight (般若波羅蜜; ཤེས་རབ ''shes-rab'')

Note that this list is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator [[Dhammapala]], who says it is equivalent to the above list of ten.&lt;ref&gt;The passage is translated in Bodhi (1978), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]'', four more pāramitās are listed:

:7. ''[[upaya|Upāya]] pāramitā'': skillful means (方便波羅蜜）
:8. ''[[Bodhisattva vow|Praṇidhāna]] pāramitā'': vow, resolution, aspiration, determination (願波羅蜜）
:9. ''[[Five Strengths|Bala]] pāramitā'': spiritual power (力波羅蜜）
:10. ''[[Jnana|Jñāna]] pāramitā'': knowledge (智波羅蜜）

== Tibetan Buddhism ==
According to the perspective of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] practitioners have the choice of two practice paths: the path of perfection (Sanskrit: ''pāramitāyāna'') or the path of [[tantra]] (Sanskrit: ''tantrayāna''), which is the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]].

[[Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche]] renders "pāramitā" into English as "transcendent action" and then frames and qualifies it:
{{quote|When we say that ''paramita'' means "transcendent action," we mean it in the sense that actions or attitude are performed in a non-egocentric manner.  "Transcendental" does not refer to some external reality, but rather to the way in which we conduct our lives and perceive the world – either in an egocentric or a non-egocentric way.  The six ''paramitas'' are concerned with the effort to step out of the egocentric mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. (ed.) (2004). ''In the Presence of Masters:  Wisdom from 30 Contemporary Tibetan Buddhist Teachers''.  Boston, Massachusetts, USA:  Shambala.  {{ISBN|1-57062-849-1}} (pbk.: alk. paper) p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Six Yogas of Naropa#Pure illusory body|pure illusory body]] is said to be endowed with the six perfections (Sanskrit: ''ṣatpāramitā'').&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003).

The first four perfections are [[skillful means]] practice while the last two are wisdom practice. These contain all the methods and skills required for eliminating delusion and fulfilling other's needs. Also, leading from happy to happier states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wangchen|first1=Geshe Namgyal|title=Step by Step: Basic Buddhist Meditations|date=September 8, 2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=0861716000|pages=137|edition= Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3Ky1zGpzlUC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=skilfull+mean+six+perfections&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SI0QCW6ZlQ&amp;sig=Kt-4auoUoS7Y10OPHyp5HPnOHc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjikdHLnOraAhUDmuAKHf1SDloQ6AEIhgEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=skilfull%20mean%20six%20perfections&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quantum mind''' or '''quantum consciousness'''&lt;ref name="Quantum Approaches to Consciousness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/|title=Quantum Approaches to Consciousness|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|orig-year=First published Tue Nov 30, 2004 |date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; group of hypotheses propose that [[classical mechanics]] cannot explain [[consciousness]]. It posits that [[quantum mechanical]] phenomena, such as [[quantum entanglement]] and [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], may play an important part in the brain's function and could contribute to form the basis of an explanation of consciousness.

Hypotheses have been proposed about ways for quantum effects to be involved in the process of consciousness, but even those who advocate them admit that the hypotheses remain unproven, and possibly unprovable. Some of the proponents propose experiments that could demonstrate quantum consciousness, but the experiments have not yet been possible to perform.

Quantum mechanical terms are commonly misinterpreted to enable [[pseudoscience]]. Phenomena such as [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] and the [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] are vaguely attributed to consciousness, resulting in [[quantum mysticism]]. According to [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]], "No theory in the history of science has been more misused and abused by cranks and charlatans—and misunderstood by people struggling in good faith with difficult ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself|date=May 2016|publisher=Dutton|location=New York|accessdate=7 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[Skeptical_movement#Scientific_skepticism|scientific skeptic]] [[Lawrence Krauss]] also conveyed that "No area of physics stimulates more nonsense in the public arena than quantum mechanics."&lt;ref name="Krauss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Alan|title=How to Spot Quantum Quackery|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/how-spot-quantum-quackery-6c10403763|website=NBC News Science News|accessdate=8 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Eugene Wigner]] developed the idea that quantum mechanics has something to do with the workings of the mind. He proposed that the [[wave function collapse]]s due to its interaction with consciousness. [[Freeman Dyson]] argued that "mind, as manifested by the capacity to make choices, is to some extent inherent in every electron."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|authorlink=Freeman Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April--November 1985|date=2004|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|isbn=0060728892|page=297|edition=1st Perennial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary physicists and philosophers considered these arguments to be unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Searle|first1=John R.|authorlink=John Searle|title=The Mystery of Consciousness |date=1997|publisher=New York Review of Books|location=New York|isbn=9780940322066|pages=53–88|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Stenger]] characterized quantum consciousness as a "myth" having "no scientific basis" that "should take its place along with gods, unicorns and dragons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stenger |first=Victor |authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger |title=The Myth of Quantum Consciousness |work=The Humanist |volume= 53 No 3 (May–June 1992) |pages=13–15 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/QuantumConsciousness.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Chalmers]] argued against quantum consciousness. He instead discussed how [[quantum mechanics]] may relate to dualistic consciousness.&lt;ref name="Chalmers2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen P. Stich|author2=Ted A. Warfield|title=The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NEGK_ZStddkC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=dualistic+consciousness&amp;dq=2003+The+Blackwell+Guide+to+Philosophy+of+Mind#v=onepage&amp;q=dualistic%20consciousness&amp;f=false|date=15 April 2008|work=Blackwell Philosophy Guides|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=126|isbn=9780470998755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalmers is skeptical of the ability of any new physics to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author =  David J.

==Quantum mind approaches==

===Bohm===

[[David Bohm]] viewed [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]] as contradictory, which implied a more fundamental level in the universe.&lt;ref name="Bohm1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|authorlink=David Bohm|title=Wholeness and the Implicate Order.|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=Hoboken|isbn=0203995155|edition=Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed both quantum theory and relativity pointed towards this deeper theory, which he formulated as a quantum field theory. This more fundamental level was proposed to represent an undivided wholeness and an [[implicate order]], from which arises the [[explicate order]] of the universe as we experience it.

Bohm's proposed implicate order applies both to matter and consciousness. He suggested that it could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order. Bohm claimed that when we look at matter, we see nothing that helps us to understand consciousness.

Bohm discussed the experience of listening to music. He believed the feeling of movement and change that make up our experience of music derive from holding the immediate past and the present in the brain together. The musical notes from the past are transformations rather than memories. The notes that were implicate in the immediate past become explicate in the present. Bohm viewed this as consciousness emerging from the implicate order.

Bohm saw the movement, change or flow, and the coherence of experiences, such as listening to music, as a manifestation of the implicate order. He claimed to derive evidence for this from [[Jean Piaget|Jean Piaget's]]&lt;ref name="Piaget1956"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|first2=|title=Jean Piaget: selected works. (The Origin of Intelligence in the Child)|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415168861|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; work on infants. He held these studies to show that young children learn about time and space because they have a "hard-wired" understanding of movement as part of the implicate order. He compared this "hard-wiring" to [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory that grammar is "hard-wired" into human brains.

Bohm never proposed a specific means by which his proposal could be falsified, nor a neural mechanism through which his "implicate order" could emerge in a way relevant to consciousness.&lt;ref name="Bohm1980"/&gt; Bohm later collaborated on [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]]'s [[holonomic brain theory]] as a model of quantum consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wade|first1=Jenny|title=Changes of Mind: A Holonomic Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness|date=1996|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=9780791428498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Paavo Pylkkänen]], Bohm's suggestion "leads naturally to the assumption that the physical correlate of the [[logical thinking]] process is at the classically describable level of the brain, while the basic thinking process is at the quantum-theoretically describable level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paavo Pylkkänen|title=Can quantum analogies help us to understand the process of thought?|journal=Mind &amp; Matter|volume=12|number=1|pages=61–91|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/PYLCQA.1.pdf}} p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penrose and Hameroff===

{{main|Orchestrated objective reduction}}
Theoretical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] and [[anaesthesiologist]] [[Stuart Hameroff]] collaborated to produce the theory known as Orchestrated Objective Reduction ([[Orch-OR]]). Penrose and Hameroff initially developed their ideas separately and later collaborated to produce Orch-OR in the early 1990s. The theory was reviewed and updated by the authors in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm |title=Discovery of quantum vibrations in 'microtubules' inside brain neurons supports controversial theory of consciousness |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elsevier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/discovery-of-quantum-vibrations-in-microtubules-inside-brain-neurons-corroborates-controversial-20-year-old-theory-of-consciousness |title=Discovery of Quantum Vibrations in "Microtubules" Inside Brain Neurons Corroborates Controversial 20-Year-Old Theory of Consciousness |publisher=Elsevier |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose's argument stemmed from [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. In Penrose's first book on consciousness, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' (1989),&lt;ref name="Emperor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind|date=1989|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0 14 01 4534 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; he argued that while a formal system cannot prove its own consistency, Gödel’s unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Godel2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gödel|first1=Kurt|title=On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems|date=1992|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0486669807|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not formal proof systems and are not running a computable algorithm. According to Bringsjorg and Xiao, this line of reasoning is based on fallacious [[equivocation]] on the meaning of computation.&lt;ref&gt;Bringsjord, S. and Xiao, H. 2000. ''[http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/refute.penrose.pdf A Refutation of Penrose's Gödelian Case Against Artificial Intelligence].'' [[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same book, Penrose wrote, "One might speculate, however, that somewhere deep in the brain, cells are to be found of single quantum sensitivity.  If this proves to be the case, then quantum mechanics will be significantly involved in brain activity."&lt;ref name="Emperor" /&gt;{{rp|p.400}}

Penrose determined [[wave function collapse]] was the only possible physical basis for a non-computable process. Dissatisfied with its randomness, Penrose proposed a new form of wave function collapse that occurred in isolation and called it ''objective reduction''. He suggested each quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature and that when these become separated by more than one [[Planck length]] they become unstable and collapse.&lt;ref name="emperornewmind"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|date=1999|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0192861980|edition=[New edition]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose suggested that ''objective reduction'' represented neither randomness nor algorithmic processing but instead a non-computable influence in [[spacetime]] geometry from which mathematical understanding and, by later extension, consciousness derived.&lt;ref name="emperornewmind"/&gt;

Hameroff provided a hypothesis that [[microtubule]]s would be suitable hosts for quantum behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness|date=1995|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0198539789|edition=Repr. (with corrections).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microtubules are composed of [[tubulin]] [[protein dimer]] subunits. The dimers each have [[hydrophobic]] pockets that are 8&amp;nbsp;nm apart and that may contain delocalized [[pi electrons]]. Tubulins have other smaller non-polar regions that contain pi electron-rich indole rings separated by only about 2&amp;nbsp;nm.

Although these theories are stated in a scientific framework, it is difficult to separate them from the personal opinions of the scientist.  The opinions are often based on intuition or subjective ideas about the nature of consciousness.  For example, Penrose wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;my own point of view asserts that you can't even simulate conscious activity. What's going on in conscious thinking is something you couldn't properly imitate at all by computer.... If something behaves as though it's conscious, do you say it is conscious? People argue endlessly about that. Some people would say, 'Well, you've got to take the operational viewpoint; we don't know what consciousness is. How do you judge whether a person is conscious or not? Only by the way they act. You apply the same criterion to a computer or a computer-controlled robot.' Other people would say, 'No, you can't say it feels something merely because it behaves as though it feels something.' My view is different from both those views. The robot wouldn't even behave convincingly as though it was conscious unless it really was — which I say it couldn't be, if it's entirely computationally controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniel|first1=Dennett|title=Edge Conversation Chapter 10: Intuition Pumps, and response by Roger Penrose|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/daniel_c_dennett-chapter-10-intuition-pumps|website=Edge.com|accessdate=20 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Penrose continues, &lt;blockquote&gt; A lot of what the brain does you could do on a computer. I'm not saying that all the brain's action is completely different from what you do on a computer. I am claiming that the actions of consciousness are something different. I'm not saying that consciousness is beyond physics, either — although I'm saying that it's beyond the physics we know now....  My claim is that there has to be something in physics that we don't yet understand, which is very important, and which is of a noncomputational character. It's not specific to our brains; it's out there, in the physical world. But it usually plays a totally insignificant role. It would have to be in the bridge between quantum and classical levels of behavior — that is, where quantum measurement comes in.&lt;ref name="Penroseedge"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=Edge Conversation Chapter 14: Consciousness Involves Noncomputable Ingredients|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/roger_penrose-chapter-14-consciousness-involves-noncomputable-ingredients|website=Edge.com|accessdate=20 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, [[W. Daniel Hillis]] replied, "Penrose has committed the classical mistake of putting humans at the center of the universe. His argument is essentially that he can't imagine how the mind could be as complicated as it is without having some magic elixir brought in from some new principle of physics, so therefore it must involve that. It's a failure of Penrose's imagination.... It's true that there are unexplainable, uncomputable things, but there's no reason whatsoever to believe that the complex behavior we see in humans is in any way related to uncomputable, unexplainable things."&lt;ref name="Penroseedge"/&gt;

Lawrence Krauss is also blunt in criticizing Penrose's ideas.  He said, "Well, Roger Penrose has given lots of new-age crackpots ammunition by suggesting that at some fundamental scale, quantum mechanics might be relevant for consciousness. When you hear the term 'quantum consciousness,' you should be suspicious.... Many people are dubious that Penrose's suggestions are reasonable, because the brain is not an isolated quantum-mechanical system."&lt;ref name="Krauss"/&gt;

===Stapp===

[[Henry Stapp]] proposed that quantum waves are reduced only when they interact with consciousness. He argues from the Orthodox Quantum Mechanics of [[John von Neumann]] that the quantum state collapses when the observer selects one among the alternative quantum possibilities as a basis for future action. The collapse, therefore, takes place in the expectation that the observer associated with the state. Stapp's work drew criticism from scientists such as David Bourget and Danko Georgiev.&lt;ref name=Bourget&gt;

* Stapp's mind does not have its own [[wavefunction]] or [[density matrix]], but nevertheless can act upon the brain using [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operators]]. Such usage is not compatible with standard quantum mechanics because one can attach any number of ghostly minds to any point in space that act upon physical quantum systems with any projection operators. Therefore, Stapp's model negates "the prevailing principles of physics".&lt;ref name="Georgiev2012" /&gt; 
* Stapp's claim that quantum Zeno effect is robust against environmental decoherence directly contradicts a basic theorem in [[quantum information theory]] that acting with projection operators upon the density matrix of a quantum system can only increase the system's [[Von Neumann entropy]].&lt;ref name="Georgiev2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgiev2015" /&gt;

===David Pearce===

British philosopher [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] defends what he calls physicalistic idealism (""Physicalistic idealism" is the non-materialist physicalist claim that reality is fundamentally experiential and that the natural world is exhaustively described by the equations of physics and their solutions [...]," and has conjectured that unitary conscious minds are physical states of [[quantum coherence]] (neuronal superpositions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=David|title=Non-Materialist Physicalism: An experimentally testable conjecture|url=https://www.physicalism.com|accessdate=15 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=David|title=Quantum computing: the first 540 million years: Abstract of talk given at Tucson conference "Toward a Science of Consciousness" (2010)|url=https://www.hedweb.com/philsoph/quantum-computer.html|accessdate=18 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearcevideo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=David|title=The Binding Problem of Consciousness|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xizbtklciA|website=YouTube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=David|title=Schrödinger's Neurons: David Pearce at the "2016 Science of Consciousness" conference in Tucson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N6j1pHiEA4|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=18 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture is, according to Pearce, amenable to falsification unlike most theories of consciousness, and Pearce has outlined an experimental protocol describing how the hypothesis could be tested using [[Interferometry|matter-wave interferometry]] to detect [[Wave interference|nonclassical interference patterns]] of [[Quantum superposition|neuronal superpositions]] at the onset of [[Quantum decoherence|thermal decoherence]].&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=David|title=Non-Materialist Physicalism: An experimentally testable conjecture, Section 6|url=https://www.physicalism.com/#6|accessdate=15 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearce admits that his ideas are "highly speculative," "counterintuitive," and "incredible."&lt;ref name="Pearcevideo" /&gt;

==Criticism==

These hypotheses of the quantum mind remain hypothetical speculation, as Penrose and Pearce admitted in their discussion.  Until they make a prediction that is tested by experiment, the hypotheses aren't based in empirical evidence.  According to Lawrence Krauss, "It is true that quantum mechanics is extremely strange, and on extremely small scales for short times, all sorts of weird things happen. And in fact we can make weird quantum phenomena happen. But what quantum mechanics doesn't change about the universe is, if you want to change things, you still have to do something. You can't change the world by thinking about it."&lt;ref name="Krauss"/&gt;

The process of testing the hypotheses with experiments is fraught with problems, including conceptual/theoretical, practical, and ethical issues.

===Conceptual problems===

The idea that a quantum effect is necessary for consciousness to function is still in the realm of philosophy.  Penrose proposes that it is necessary.  But other theories of consciousness do not indicate that it is needed.  For example, [[Daniel Dennett]] proposed a theory called [[multiple drafts model]] that doesn't indicate that quantum effects are needed.   The theory is described in Dennett's book, ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', published in 1991.&lt;ref name="dennett1"/&gt;  A philosophical argument on either side isn't scientific proof, although the philosophical analysis can indicate key differences in the types of models, and they can show what type of experimental differences might be observed.  But since there isn't a clear consensus among philosophers, it isn't conceptual support that a quantum mind theory is needed.

There are computers that are specifically designed to compute using quantum mechanical effects.  [[Quantum computing]] is [[computation|computing]] using [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] [[phenomena]], such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cba.mit.edu/docs/papers/98.06.sciqc.pdf |title=Quantum Computing with Molecules |journal=[[Scientific American]] |first1=Neil |last1=Gershenfeld |authorlink1=Neil Gershenfeld |first2=Isaac L. |last2=Chuang |authorlink2=Isaac L. Chuang |date=June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are different from [[binary number|binary]] [[digital electronic computer]]s based on [[transistor]]s. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits ([[bit]]s), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses [[Qubit|quantum bits]], which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states.  One of the greatest challenges is controlling or removing [[quantum decoherence]]. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere.  Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286–288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, time consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|arxiv=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There aren't any obvious analogies between the functioning of quantum computers and the human brain.  Some of the hypothetical models of quantum mind have proposed mechanisms for maintaining quantum coherence in the brain, but they have not been shown to operate.

[[Quantum entanglement]] is a physical phenomenon often invoked for quantum mind models.  This effect occurs when pairs or groups of [[particle]]s interact so that the [[quantum state]] of each particle cannot be described independently of the other(s), even when the particles are separated by a large distance.  Instead, a quantum state has to be described for the whole system. [[Measurement#Quantum mechanics|Measurements]] of physical properties such as [[position (vector)|position]], [[momentum]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], performed on entangled particles are found to be [[correlation|correlated]].  If one of the particles is measured, the same property of the other particle immediately adjusts to maintain the conservation of the physical phenomenon.  According to the formalism of quantum theory, the effect of measurement happens instantly, no matter how far apart the particles are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Matson

Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made&lt;ref name="Peres1993"&gt;Asher Peres, ''Quantum Theory, Concepts and Methods'', Kluwer, 1993; {{ISBN|0-7923-2549-4}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; or the particles undergo random collisions or interactions.  According to David Pearce, "In neuronal networks, ion-ion scattering, ion-water collisions, and long-range Coulomb interactions from nearby ions all contribute to rapid decoherence times; but thermally-induced decoherence is even harder experimentally to control than collisional decoherence."  He anticipated that quantum effects would have to be measured in femtoseconds, a trillion times faster than the rate at which neurons function (milliseconds).&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt;

Another possible conceptual approach is to use quantum mechanics as an analogy to understand a different field of study like consciousness, without expecting that the laws of quantum physics will apply.  An example of this approach is the idea of [[Schrödinger's cat]].  [[Erwin Schrödinger]] described how one could, in principle, create entanglement of a large-scale system by making it dependent on an elementary particle in a superposition.  He proposed a scenario with a cat in a locked steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that ''the cat remains both alive and dead'' until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-alive cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1935"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schrödinger's famous [[thought experiment]] poses the question, "''when'' does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?"  In the same way, it is possible to ask whether the brain's act of making a decision is analogous to having a superposition of states of two decision outcomes, so that making a decision means "opening the box" to reduce the brain from a combination of states to one state.  But even Schrödinger didn't think this really happened to the cat; he didn't think the cat was literally alive and dead at the same time.  This analogy about making a decision uses a formalism that is derived from quantum mechanics, but it doesn't indicate the actual mechanism by which the decision is made.  In this way, the idea is similar to [[quantum cognition]].  This field clearly distinguishes itself from the quantum mind as it is not reliant on the hypothesis that there is something micro-physical quantum mechanical about the brain. Quantum cognition is based on the quantum-like paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. 2006. Quantum-like brain: "Interference of minds"  Biosystems, vol. 84, no. 3, pp. 225–241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Information Dynamics in Cognitive, Psychological, Social, and Anomalous Phenomena (Fundamental Theories of Physics) (Volume 138), Kluwer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; generalized quantum paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;Atmanspacher, H., Römer, H., &amp; Walach, H. (2002). Weak quantum theory: Complementarity and entanglement in physics and beyond. Foundations of Physics, 32(3), 379–406.&lt;/ref&gt; or quantum structure paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D. &amp; Aerts, S. (1994) Applications of quantum statistics in psychological studies of decision processes. Foundations of Science, 1, 85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; that information processing by complex systems such as the brain can be mathematically described in the framework of quantum information and quantum probability theory.  This model uses quantum mechanics only as an analogy, but doesn't propose that quantum mechanics is the physical mechanism by which it operates.  For example, quantum cognition proposes that some decisions can be analyzed as if there are interference between two alternatives, but it is not a physical quantum interference effect.

===Practical problems===

The demonstration of a quantum mind effect by experiment is necessary.  Is there a way to show that consciousness is impossible without a quantum effect?  Can a sufficiently complex digital, non-quantum computer be shown to be incapable of consciousness?  Perhaps a quantum computer will show that quantum effects are needed.  In any case, complex computers that are either digital or quantum computers may be built. These could demonstrate which type of computer is capable of conscious, intentional thought.  But they don't exist yet, and no experimental test has been demonstrated.

Quantum mechanics is a mathematical model that can provide some extremely accurate numerical predictions.  [[Richard Feynman]] called quantum electrodynamics, based on the quantum mechanics formalism, "the jewel of physics" for its [[precision tests of QED|extremely accurate predictions]] of quantities like the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] of the electron and the [[Lamb shift]] of the [[energy level]]s of [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name=feynbook&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Feynman |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-691-12575-6 |title=QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch1}}  So it is not impossible that the model could provide an accurate prediction about consciousness that would confirm that a quantum effect is involved.  If the mind depends on quantum mechanical effects, the true proof is to find an experiment that provides a calculation that can be compared to an experimental measurement.  It has to show a measurable difference between a classical computation result in a brain and one that involves quantum effects.

The main theoretical argument against the quantum mind hypothesis is the assertion that quantum states in the brain would lose coherency before they reached a scale where they could be useful for neural processing. This supposition was elaborated by  [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]]. His calculations indicate that quantum systems in the brain decohere at sub-picosecond timescales.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.61.4194 |author=Tegmark, M. |title= Importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes |journal=Physical Review E |volume=61 |pages=4194–4206 |year=2000 |bibcode=2000PhRvE..61.4194T|arxiv = quant-ph/9907009 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seife&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/287/5454/791|journal=Science |date=4 February 2000| volume=287|pmid=10691548 |issue=5454 |page=791 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5454.791|title=Cold Numbers Unmake the Quantum Mind|author=Charles Seife}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No response by a brain has shows computation results or reactions on this fast of a timescale.  Typical reactions are on the order of milliseconds, trillions of times longer than sub-picosecond time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuhas|first1=Daisy|title=Speedy Science: How fast can you react?|journal=Scientific American|date=May 24, 2012|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-reaction-time/|accessdate=18 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Dennett uses an experimental result in support of his Multiple Drafts Model of an optical illusion that happens on a time scale of less than a second or so.  In this experiment, two different colored lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change color as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change color before the second light is observed.&lt;ref name="dennett1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel, C. |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Velmans argues that the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]], another illusion that happens in about a second, demonstrates that there is a delay while modelling occurs in the brain and that this delay was discovered by Libet.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velmans, M. |title=Is Consciousness Integrated? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=15 |pages=229–230 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00068473}}(commentary on Dennett &amp; Kinsbourne "Time and the observer", BBS, 1992, 15(2): 183–201) Copyright Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  These slow illusions that happen at times of less than a second don't support a proposal that the brain functions on the picosecond time scale.

According to David Pearce, a demonstration of picosecond effects is "the fiendishly hard part – feasible in principle, but an experimental challenge still beyond the reach of contemporary molecular matter-wave interferometry.  ...The conjecture predicts that we'll discover the interference signature of sub-femtosecond macro-superpositions."&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;

Penrose says,&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem with trying to use quantum mechanics in the action of the brain is that if it were a matter of quantum nerve signals, these nerve signals would disturb the rest of the material in the brain, to the extent that the quantum coherence would get lost very quickly. You couldn't even attempt to build a quantum computer out of ordinary nerve signals, because they're just too big and in an environment that's too disorganized. Ordinary nerve signals have to be treated classically. But if you go down to the level of the microtubules, then there's an extremely good chance that you can get quantum-level activity inside them.

For my picture, I need this quantum-level activity in the microtubules; the activity has to be a large scale thing that goes not just from one microtubule to the next but from one nerve cell to the next, across large areas of the brain. We need some kind of coherent activity of a quantum nature which is weakly coupled to the computational activity that Hameroff argues is taking place along the microtubules.

There are various avenues of attack. One is directly on the physics, on quantum theory, and there are certain experiments that people are beginning to perform, and various schemes for a modification of quantum mechanics. I don't think the experiments are sensitive enough yet to test many of these specific ideas. One could imagine experiments that might test these things, but they'd be very hard to perform.&lt;ref name="Penroseedge"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A demonstration of a quantum effect in the brain has to explain this problem or explain why it is not relevant, or that the brain somehow circumvents the problem of the loss of quantum coherency at body temperature.  As Penrose proposes, it may require a new type of physical theory.

===Ethical problems===

Can self-awareness, or understanding of a self in the surrounding environment, be done by a classical parallel processor, or are quantum effects needed to have a sense of "oneness"?  According to Lawrence Krauss, "You should be wary whenever you hear something like, 'Quantum mechanics connects you with the universe' ... or 'quantum mechanics unifies you with everything else.' You can begin to be skeptical that the speaker is somehow trying to use quantum mechanics to argue fundamentally that you can change the world by thinking about it."&lt;ref name="Krauss"/&gt;  A subjective feeling is not sufficient to make this determination.  Humans don't have a reliable subjective feeling for how we do a lot of functions.  According to Daniel Dennett, "On this topic, ''Everybody's an expert...'' but they think that they have a particular personal authority about the nature of their own conscious experiences that can trump any hypothesis they find unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel|title=From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds|date=Feb 2017|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0393242072|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since humans are the only animals known to be conscious, then performing experiments to demonstrate quantum effects in consciousness requires experimentation on a living human brain.  This is not automatically excluded or impossible, but it seriously limits the kinds of experiments that can be done.  Studies of the ethics of brain studies are being actively solicited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BRAIN Initiative|title=BRAIN Initiative: Research on the Ethical Implications of Advancements in Neurotechnology and Brain Science (R01)|url=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-17-260.html|accessdate=4 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[BRAIN Initiative]], a U.S. Federal Government funded effort to document the connections of neurons in the brain.

An ethically objectionable practice by proponents of quantum mind theories involves the practice of using quantum mechanical terms in an effort to make the argument sound more impressive, even when they know that those terms are irrelevant.  Dale DeBakcsy notes that "trendy parapsychologists, academic relativists, and even the [[Dalai Lama]] have all taken their turn at robbing modern physics of a few well-sounding phrases and stretching them far beyond their original scope in order to add scientific weight to various pet theories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeBakcsy|first1=Dale|title=Stop Heisenberg Abuse!: Three Outrageous Misappropriations of Quantum Physics|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=May 2014|volume= 38| issue =  3|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the very least, these proponents must make a clear statement about whether quantum formalism is being used as an analogy or as an actual physical mechanism, and what evidence they are using for support.  An ethical statement by a researcher should specify what kind of relationship their hypothesis has to the physical laws.

Misleading statements of this type have been given by, for example, [[Deepak Chopra]].  Chopra has commonly referred to topics such as [[quantum healing]] or quantum effects of consciousness.  Seeing the human body as being undergirded by a "quantum mechanical body" composed not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that "human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself," as determined by one's state of mind.&lt;ref name=ageless&gt;{{cite book |first1=Deepak |last1=Chopra |title=Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old |publisher=Random House |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Eq2AFPCvaAC |page=6 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] states Chopra attempts to integrate [[Ayurveda]] with quantum mechanics to justify his teachings.&lt;ref name="skepdic-web" &gt;{{citation |url=http://www.skepdic.com/chopra.html |work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |first=Robert Todd |last=Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=Deepak Chopra |date=May 19, 2013 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra argues that what he calls "quantum healing" cures any manner of ailments, including cancer, through effects that he claims are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=AshmanBarringer2005/&gt; This has led physicists to object to his use of the term ''quantum'' in reference to medical conditions and the human body.&lt;ref name=AshmanBarringer2005&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Keith|editor1-last=Ashman|editor2-first=Phillip|editor2-last=Barringer|title=After the Science Wars: Science and the Study of Science|chapter=Chapter 9: Voodoo medicine in a scientific world|first=Robert L|last=Park|authorlink=Robert L.

So I think there’s a school of physicists who believe that consciousness has to be equated, or at least brought into the equation, in understanding quantum mechanics."&lt;ref name="dawkins1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chopra|first1=Deepak|title=Richard Dawkins Plays God: The Video (Updated)|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/richard-dawkins-plays-god_b_3467484.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=5 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, he also claims "[Quantum effects are] just a metaphor. Just like an electron or a photon is an indivisible unit of information and energy, a thought is an indivisible unit of consciousness."&lt;ref name="dawkins1"/&gt;  In his book ''Quantum Healing'', Chopra stated the conclusion that [[quantum entanglement]] links everything in the Universe, and therefore it must create consciousness.&lt;ref name=dnews&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neill|first1=Ian|title=Does Quantum Theory Explain Consciousness?|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/does-quantum-theory-explain-consciousness-110526.htm|accessdate=August 11, 2014|work=Discovery News|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC|date=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In either case, the references to the word "quantum" don't mean what a physicist would claim, and arguments that use the word "quantum" shouldn't be taken as scientifically proven.

Chris Carter includes statements in his book, ''Science and Psychic Phenomena,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Chris|title=Science and Psychic Phenomena: The Fall of the House of Skeptics|date=2012|publisher=Inner Traditions Press|isbn=978-1594774515}}&lt;/ref&gt; of quotes from quantum physicists in support of psychic phenomena.  In a review of the book, Benjamin Radford wrote that Carter used such references to "quantum physics, which he knows nothing about and which he (and people like Deepak Chopra) love to cite and reference because it sounds mysterious and paranormal....  Real, actual physicists I've spoken to break out laughing at this crap....  If Carter wishes to posit that quantum physics provides a plausible mechanism for psi, then it is his responsibility to show that, and he clearly fails to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radford|first1=Benjamin|title=The House of Skeptics Serves Psi (and Crow)|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=Mar 2014|volume= 37| issue =  2|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharon Hill has studied amateur paranormal research groups, and these groups like to use "vague and confusing language: ghosts 'use energy,' are made up of 'magnetic fields', or are associated with a 'quantum state.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon|title=Amateur Paranormal Research and Investigation Groups Doing 'Sciencey' Things|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=Mar 2012|volume= 36| issue =  2|pages=38–41|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/amateur_paranormal_research_and_investigation_groups_doing_sciencey_things}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon|title=Scientifical Americans: Paranormal Researchers and the Public Understanding of Science|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hgmTl12isA|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=17 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements like these about quantum mechanics indicate a temptation to misinterpret technical, mathematical terms like entanglement in terms of mystical feelings.  This approach can be interpreted as a kind of [[Scientism]], using the language and authority of science when the scientific concepts don't apply.

Perhaps the final question is, what difference does it make if quantum effects are involved in computations in the brain?  It is already known that quantum mechanics plays a role in the brain, since quantum mechanics determines the shapes and properties of molecules like [[neurotransmitters]] and [[proteins]], and these molecules affect how the brain works.  This is the reason that drugs such as [[morphine]] affect consciousness.  As Daniel Dennett said, "quantum effects are there in your car, your watch, and your computer. But most things — most macroscopic objects — are, as it were, oblivious to quantum effects. They don't amplify them; they don't hinge on them."&lt;ref name="Penroseedge"/&gt;  Lawrence Krauss said, "We're also connected to the universe by gravity, and we're connected to the planets by gravity. But that doesn't mean that astrology is true....  Often, people who are trying to sell whatever it is they're trying to sell try to justify it on the basis of science. Everyone knows quantum mechanics is weird, so why not use that to justify it? ... I don't know how many times I've heard people say, 'Oh, I love quantum mechanics because I'm really into meditation, or I love the spiritual benefits that it brings me.' But quantum mechanics, for better or worse, doesn't bring any more spiritual benefits than gravity does."&lt;ref name="Krauss"/&gt;

'''Richard Mead Goody''' (born 19 June 1921) is a British-American atmospheric physicist and emeritus professor of planetary physics at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lldYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Goody,+richard+mead%22+1921&amp;dq=%22Goody,+richard+mead%22+1921&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nnJtU5fiLsHzoAT1gIKwCw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ American Men &amp; Women of Science - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/goody Richard Goody], [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20001988.html | title=Richard M. Goody | work=NAS Website | accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
A native of [[Hertfordshire]], Goody attended [[Cambridge University]], from which he received a bachelor's degree in physics in 1942. He then worked at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] until October 1946, when he returned to Cambridge to receive his PhD, doing so in 1949.&lt;ref name=Goody/&gt; While there, he was instructed to build an [[infrared spectrometer]] for use in an airplane to measure stratospheric dryness.&lt;ref name=Goody/&gt; He also made important discoveries into the structure of the [[stratosphere]] during this time, which led him to study [[radiative transfer]] in planetary atmospheres.&lt;ref name=bowie/&gt; Related to this work, the best known and widely used model of absorption bands in atmospheric opacity is due to the work of Goody in 1952, and the model was initially known as the Goody random model. It was later discovered that [[Harris Mayer]]'s work under the supervision of [[Edward Teller]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] published in 1947 had made similar calculations and many sources now call the model the Mayer-Goody model or the Mayer-Goody statistical model.&lt;ref&gt;Timofeyev, Yu M., and Aleksander Vladimirovich Vasilʹev. Theoretical fundamentals of atmospheric optics. Cambridge Int Science Publishing, 2008. p294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific career==
Goody was appointed the [[Abbott Lawrence Rotch]] Professor of Dynamic Meteorology and Director of the [[Blue Hill Observatory]] at Harvard in 1958&lt;ref name=bowie/&gt; and elected into the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] the following year.&lt;ref name=HDC&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/Download/Proceedings-98.pdf Hitran Database Conference], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He became a US citizen in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irc-iamas.org/awards/2004_rgoody.php | title=IRC Awards 2004 - Gold Medal | work=International Radiation Commission | date=2004 | accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1964 book "Atmospheric Radiation" has been described as "classic".&lt;ref name=bowie/&gt; He served as the director of the Blue Hill Observatory until 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.nasa.gov/biose-j.html Biographies of Aerospace Officials and Policymakers, E-J]&lt;/ref&gt; and the chair of the Space Studies Board of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] from 1974 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/ssb/ssb_052281 | title=Board Members and Staff | publisher=National Academy of Science | accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Goody was the co-chair of a National Academy of Sciences study of [[Venus]] entitled "Venus: Strategy for Exploration",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Venus Strategy for Exploration | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | year=1970 | pages=R4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was partly responsible for launching the [[Pioneer Venus project]], which launched probes to Venus in 1978.&lt;ref name=Goody/&gt; He underwent compulsory retirement from Harvard in 1991.&lt;ref name=Goody/&gt;

== History ==
Science Development Foundation was established in accordance with the presidential order dated October 21, 2009.The establishment of the Foundation aimed at implementation of scientific projects and organizing scientific events, activities of the scientists, supporting scientific collectives, scientific organizations, scientists of the academy and education system, state and non-state organizations. 

Science of Development Foundation set up a system aiming at diffusing scientific information of Azerbaijan abroad, assisting young researches and scientists to extend their knowledge, experiences, to improve level of science in the country, to develop gadget base, to organize participation of scientists in international scientific conferences, seminars, trainings, to organize trainings, seminars over the country. An electron information bank was created in the Foundation. The information bank meeting European scientific standards includes the information on the most active young scientists and specialists working in Azerbaijan, as well as their scientific activities and the degree of activeness. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sdf.gov.az/en/|title=Science Development Foundation under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan|website=sdf.gov.az|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to support young scientists materially and morally, the Foundation attracts them to scientific valuation. They attend the valuation as independent scientific experts.
The foundation is in closely cooperation with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the Ministry of the Youth and Sport.

The Foundation investigates the natural resources, cultural and historical heritage in the country. One of the goals of the Foundation is to enhance the role of the science in all social-economic fields, solving the social problems, develop scientific information and innovations, to study international experience gained in science, to establish relations with international scientific foundations, organizations, committees. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zsi.at/en/object/partner/3479|title=Science Development Foundation under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan)|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sufism|Ideas}}  
{{Sunni Islam}}
'''Silsila''' ({{lang-ar|سلسلة}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning ''chain'', ''link'', ''connection'' often used in various senses of [[:wikt:lineage|lineage]]. In particular, it may be translated as  [[religious order|"(religious) order"]] or "spiritual [[genealogy]]" where one Sufi Master transfers his khilfat to his spiritual descendant.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Historical importance ==
Every [[tariqa]] has a silsila. Silsilas originated with the initiation of [[tariqa|Sufi orders]] which dates back to the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. Most silsilas trace their lineage back to his cousin and son-in-law [[Ali]] bin Abi Talib such as the [[Qadiriyyah]], the [[Chishti Order|Chishtiyya]], the [[Noorbakshia Islam|Noorbakhshia]] and the [[Suhrawardiyya]]h orders. However, other silsilas owe their ancestry to other caliphs such as the [[Naqshbandiyya]]h order of [[South Asia]] is through the Caliph [[Abu Bakr]].

Centuries ago, Arabia did not have schools for formal [[education]]. Students went to masters who taught them. Upon completion of their study, they received [[ijazah]] (permission) which acted as the certification of their [[education]]. A graduate then acted as a master having his own students or disciples. This chain of masters was known as Silsila or lineage. Somewhat analogous to the modern situation where degrees are only accepted from recognized universities, the certification of a master having a verifiable chain of masters was the only criteria which accorded legitimacy:

"Theoretically one can only receive instruction in these practices (talqîn) from an authorised teacher of the [[tariqa]], and only after pledging a vow of obedience ([[bay'ah]]) to this shaikh. The shaikh gives his disciples permission (ijâza) to practice the tariqa: he may also authorise one or more of them to teach it to others, i.e. appoint them as his khalîfa. In this way a hierarchically ordered network of teachers may emerge. Each shaikh can show a chain of authorities for the tarekat he teaches, his silsila or spiritual genealogy. Usually the silsila reaches back from one's own teacher up to the Prophet, with whom all tarekats claim to have originated although there have been modifications along the way. A Sufi's silsila is his badge of identity and source of legitimation; it provides him with a list of illustrious predecessors and shows how he is related to other Sufis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shari`a court, tarekat and pesantren: religious institutions in the sultanate of Banten|author=Martin van Bruinessen|journal=Archipel|volume=50|pages=165&amp;ndash;200|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Banten_religious_institutions.htm|year=1995|doi=10.3406/arch.1995.3069|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026142322/http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/Banten_religious_institutions.htm|archivedate=2009-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silsila can be of a partial knowledge or a book as well. All [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Hafiz]] (memorizers of Quran), [[Muhaddith]]s (narrators of Hadiths), [[Qari]]es (reciters of Quran with correct accent and pronunciation) are given a chain of credible narrators linking to the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Mohammad]].

==Chain of authority==
For [[Islam|Muslims]], the Chain of Authenticity is an important way to ascertain the validity of a saying of [[Mohammad]] (also known as a [[Hadith]]). The Chain of Authenticity relates the chain of people who have heard and repeated the saying of Mohammad through the generations, until that particular Hadith was written down (Ali bin Abi Talib said that 'Aisha said that the Prophet Mohammad said…). A similar idea appears in [[Sufism]] in regards to the lineage and teachings of Sufi masters and students. This string of master to student is called a silsila, literally meaning “chain”. The focus of the silsila like the Chain of Authenticity is to trace the lineage of a [[Sufi order]] to Mohammad through his Companions: Ali bin Abi Talib (the primary link between Sufi orders and Mohammad), Abu Bakr, and Umar (three of the [[Four Righteously Guided Caliphs]]). When a Sufi order can be traced back to Mohammad through one of the three aforementioned Companions the lineage is called the Silsilat al-Dhahab (dhahab meaning gold) or the “Chain of Gold” (Golden Chain). In early Islamic history, [[gold]] was an extremely desired prize and was used for [[currency]], to show wealth and power, and for scientific purposes including [[medicine]]. Thus, gold was the most desired commodity in the material world, just as the Golden Chain is the most desired commodity of Sufi orders.

When Sufism began in the second century of Islam, according to some experts, it was an individual choice; many Sufis aimed to be more like Muhammad by becoming [[Ascetism|ascetic]] and focusing their lives fully on God; more so than the Five Daily Prayers and usual prescripted religious practices. This often included removing oneself from society and other people in general. As Sufism became a greater movement in Islam, individual Sufis began to group together. These groups (also known as orders) were based on a common master. This common master then began spiritual lineage, which is a connection between a Sufi order in which there is a common spiritual heritage based on the master’s teachings (i.e., ‘path’ or ‘method’) called tariq or [[tariqah]]. As the number of Sufi orders grew, there arose a need for legitimacy of the orders to establish each order was following the teachings of Mohammad directly; thus the idea of the Silsilat al-Dhahab. If a Sufi order is able to trace its student to master lineage back to one of the three major [[caliph]]s (and in particular Ali bin Abi Talib) who provide a straight link to Mohammad (because of their Companion status with him) then the order is considered righteous and directly following the teachings of Mohammad. In possessing the Golden Chain, a Sufi order is able to establish their order prominently in the mystical world.

== Shia term ==
{{main|Hadith of Golden Chain}}
[[Shi'a Islam|Shias]] use it idiomatically to mean a lineage of authentic Masters.

==China==
Among [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]], the concept of ''silsilah'' has developed into that of a ''[[menhuan]]'' (门宦): a Chinese-style [[Sufi order]] whose leaders trace a lineage chain going back to the order's founder in China (e.g., [[Ma Laichi]] or [[Ma Mingxin]]), and beyond, toward his teachers in Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}

The '''''Sophist''''' ({{lang-el|Σοφιστής}}; {{lang-la|Sophista}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Estienne]] (ed.), ''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'', Vol. 1, 1578, [https://archive.org/stream/platonisoperaqua01plat#page/216/mode/2up p. 217].&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Plato#Works|Platonic dialogue]] from the philosopher's late period, most likely written in 360 BC. Its main theme is to identify what a [[sophist]] is and how a sophist differs from a [[philosopher]] and [[:wikt:statesman|statesman]]. Because each seems distinguished by a particular form of knowledge, the dialogue continues some of the lines of inquiry pursued in the [[epistemological]] dialogue, ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', which is said to have taken place the day before. Because the ''Sophist'' treats these matters, it is often taken to shed light on [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms]] and is compared with the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which criticized what is often taken to be the theory of forms.

Like its sequel, the ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', the dialogue is unusual in that [[Socrates]] is present but plays only a minor role.  Instead, the [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] Stranger takes the lead in the discussion. The fact that Socrates is present but silent makes it difficult to attribute the views put forward by the Eleatic Stranger to Plato, beyond the difficulty inherent in taking any character to be an author's "mouthpiece."

==Introduction==
This dialogue takes place a day after Plato's ''Theaetetus'' in an unspecified gymnasium in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]]. The participants are [[Socrates]], who plays a minor role, the elder mathematician [[Theodorus of Cyrene|Theodorus]], the young mathematician [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]], and a visitor from [[Velia|Elea]], the hometown of [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], who is often referred to in English translations as the Eleatic Stranger or the Eleatic Visitor.  Other young mathematicians are also silently present.  The dialogue begins when Socrates arrives and asks the Eleatic Stranger whether in his homeland the sophist, statesperson, and philosopher are considered to be one kind or three.  The Eleatic Stranger responds that they are three, and then sets about to give an account of the sophist through dialectical exchange with Theaetetus.

==Method of definition (216a–236d)==
{{details|diairesis}}
The Eleatic Stranger pursues a different method of definition than features in Plato's other dialogues by the use of a model, comparison of the model with the target kind, collection, and  division (''diairesis''), of the collected kinds. At first he starts with the use of a mundane model (a fisherman), which shares some qualities in common with the target kind (the sophist). This common quality is the certain expertise (''[[techne]]'') in one subject. Then through the method of collection of different kinds (farming, caring for mortal bodies, for things that are put together or fabricated and imitation), he tries to bring them together into one kind, which he calls ''productive art''. The same is true with the collection of learning, recognition, commerce, combat and hunting, which can be grouped into the kind of ''acquisitive art''.

After these two collections, he proceeds to the division of the types of expertise into ''production'' and ''acquisition'', and then he tries to find out to which of these two sub-kinds the fisherman belongs (classification), in this case, the acquisitive kind of expertise. By following the same method, namely, diairesis through collection, he divides the acquisitive art into ''possession taking'' and ''exchanging goods'', to which sophistry belongs. The sophist is a kind of merchant. After many successive collections and divisions he finally arrives at the definition of the model (fisherman). Throughout this process the Eleatic Stranger classifies many kinds of activities (hunting, aquatic-hunting, fishing, strike-hunting).

After the verbal explanation of the model (definition), he tries to find out what the model and the target kind share in common (sameness) and what differentiates them (difference). Through this comparison, and after having been aware of the different kinds and sub-kinds, he can classify sophistry also among the other branches of the ‘tree’ of division of expertise as follows: "1. production, hunting by persuasion and money-earning, 2.acquisition, soul wholesaling, 3. soul retailing, retailing things that others make, 4. soul retailing, retailing things that he makes himself, 5. possession taking, competition, money-making expertise in debating."

Throughout the process of comparison of the distinguished kinds through his method of collection, the Eleatic Stranger discovers some attributes in relation to which the kinds can be divided (difference in relation to something). These are similar to the ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' of [[Aristotle]], so to say: quantity, quality, relation, location, time, position, end etc.

After having failed to define sophistry, the Stranger attempts a final diairesis through the collection of the five definitions of sophistry. Since these five definitions share in common one quality (sameness), which is the ''imitation'', he finally qualifies sophistry as ''imitation art''. Following the division of the imitation art in ''copy-making and appearance-making'', he discovers that sophistry falls under the ''appearance-making art'', namely the Sophist imitates the wise man.

The sophist is presented negatively, but he can be said to be someone who merely pretends to have knowledge or to be a purveyor of false knowledge only if [[right opinion]] and false opinion can be distinguished. It seems impossible to say that the sophist presents things that are not as though they were, or passes off "non-being" as "being," since this would suggest that non-being exists, or that non-existence exists. Otherwise, the sophist couldn't "do" anything with it. The Stranger suggests that it is Parmenides' doctrine of being and non-being that is at the root of this problem, and so proceeds to criticize Parmenides' ideas, namely that "it is impossible that things that are not are."

==Puzzles of being and not-being, great kinds (236d–264b)==
The Eleatic Stranger, before proceeding to the final definition of sophistry, has to make clear the concepts that he used throughout the procedure of definition. In other words, he has to clarify what is the nature of the [[Being]] (''that which is''), Not-Being, sameness (identity), difference, motion (change), and rest, and how they are interrelated. Therefore, he examines [[Parmenides]]’ notion in comparison with [[Empedocles]] and [[Heraclitus]]’ in order to find out whether Being is identical with ''change'' or ''rest'', or both.

The conclusion is that rest and change both "are," that is, both are beings; Parmenides had said that only rest "is." Furthermore, ''Being'' is a "kind" which all existing things share in common. ''Sameness'' is a "kind" that all things which belong to the same kind or genus share with reference to a certain attribute, and due to which diaeresis through collection is possible. ''Difference'' is a "kind" that makes things of the same genus distinct from one another; therefore it enables us to proceed to their division. Finally, so-called ''Not-Being'' is not the opposite of Being, but simply different from it. Therefore, the negation of Being is identified with "difference." Not-being is difference, not the opposite of Being.

Following these conclusions, the true statement can be distinguished from the false one, since each statement consists of a verb and a name. The name refers to the subject, and because a thought or a speech is always about something, and it cannot be about nothing (''Non-Being''). The verb is the sign of the action that the subject performs or the action being performed to or on the subject. When the verb states something that is about the subject, namely one of his properties, then the statement is true. While when the verb states something that is ''different'' (''it is not'') from the properties of the subject, then the statement is false, but is not attributing being to non-being.

It is plausible then, that ‘''things that are not  (appearing and seeming) somehow are''’, and so it is also plausible that the sophist produces false appearances and imitates the wise man.

==Final definition (264b–268d)==
After having solved all these puzzles, that is to say the interrelation between being, not-being, difference and negation, as well as the possibility of the "appearing and seeming but not really being," the Eleatic Stranger can finally proceed to define sophistry. "Sophistry is a productive art, human, of the imitation kind, copy-making, of the appearance-making kind, uninformed and insincere in the form of contrary-speech-producing art."

==Interpretations==
Since Plato wrote the ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'' after the ''Sophist'', while he never wrote the dialogue ''Philosopher'', many scholars argue that Plato challenges the audience to search for the definition of the philosopher themselves, by applying the method of inquiry and definition shown in those two dialogues. However, this does not mean that one can simply extend the method in a mechanical way to the investigation of the philosopher, but he only shows us how one can proceed in such philosophical enquiries.

Aristotle picks up a number of themes dealt with in the ''Sophist'' in his own work ''[[De Interpretatione]]''. Among these are the required parts of a statement (names and verbs) as well as affirmations and denials.

{{About|the philosophical position|other uses of spiritualism|Spiritualism (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], '''spiritualism''' is the notion, shared by a wide variety of systems of thought, that there is an immaterial reality that cannot be perceived by the senses.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/560495/spiritualism "Spiritualism (in philosophy)"], britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt; This includes philosophies that postulate a [[personal God]], the [[immortality of the soul]], or the immortality of the intellect or will, as well as any systems of thought that assume a [[universal mind]] or cosmic forces lying beyond the reach of purely [[materialism|materialistic]] interpretations.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; Generally, any philosophical position, be it [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], [[monism]], [[atheism]], [[theism]], [[pantheism]], [[idealism]] or any other, is compatible with spiritualism as long as it allows for a reality beyond matter.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;&lt;ref name="James1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=William James|title=A pluralistic universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPuwCunFTFoC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=17 July 2010|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-67391-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theism is an example of a dualist spiritualist philosophy, while pantheism is an example of monist spiritualism.&lt;ref name="James1977" /&gt;

'''Stanislavs Ladusãns''' (Rudzeisi village, [[Zvirgzdene Parish|Zvirgzdene]] parish, [[Latgale]] region, [[Latvia]], 22nd August, 1912 - [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], 25th July, 1993) was a Latvian-Brazilian professor of Philosophy, a member of the Brazilian Academy of Philosophy, and a [[Jesuit]] priest who arrived in Brazil on February 17th, 1947. He also lived in [[Poland]] and [[Italy]].

Lasusãns was the teacher of the Brazilian philosopher and journalist [[Olavo de Carvalho]].

==Career==
Ladusãns earned his PhD from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]]. In 1970, he founded the Brazilian Society of Catholic Philosophers and later the Center for Philosophical Research in [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=revistafilosofia&gt;{{citar web|título=Mário Ferreira dos  Santos|url=http://conhecimentopratico.uol.com.br/filosofia/ideologia-sabedoria/18/imprime181337.asp|obra=Revista Filosofia|acessodata=29 de dezembro de 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1953 onwards, Ladusãns took over the direction of the Library of the Center for Higher Studies of the Society of Jesus, specializing in Philosophy and Theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faculdadejesuita.edu.br/index.php?pagina=grupo_conteudo&amp;tela=51|title=Portal FAJE|website=www.faculdadejesuita.edu.br|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already with a post-doctorate degree, Ladusãns was not able to return to Latvia because of the [[Military occupations by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation]]. He hid his identity from the security organs, since, at the time, Latvians were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.

Tännsjö is one of the few Swedish philosophers who is frequently heard in the public debate. His distinctly [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethical views have made him a controversial figure, notably within the medical establishment and for the Swedish [[Kristdemokraterna|Christian Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Helle Klein]] |title=Vill Karolinska ha ett yrkesförbud? |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/ledare/story/0,2789,656713,00.html |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2005-06-08 |access-date=2006-10-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310215501/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/ledare/story/0,2789,656713,00.html |archive-date=2007-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tännsjö has been a member of the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] since 1970, and was involved in writing the first party programme after the party dropped the [[communist]] label in 1990.

Tännsjö's most recent work in political philosophy is "Global Democracy: The Case for a World Government" (Edinburgh UP)  written in connection with the research project Democracy Unbound supported by the Swedish Research Council. The royalties from the sales of the book are being donated to [[Oxfam]]. His most recent book is Taking Life. Three Theories on the Ethics of Killing (Oxford UP).

In 2001, he debated [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] and [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[William Lane Craig]] on the subject, "If [[God is dead|God Is Dead]], Is Everything Permitted?".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|S974FC2Aw3I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tännsjö is a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/statements/page/4/|title=Statements|last=|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yun Hyu''' (윤휴; 尹鑴, 1617 – 1680) was a [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Joseon Dynasty]] politician and [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar, poet. Yun was the political leader of the Southern (''Nam-in'') [[Political factions in Joseon Dynasty|faction of the Joseon Dynasty]]. His courtesy name was Baegho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=Controversy over Ritual in 17th Century Korea|journal=Seoul Journal of Korean Studies|year=1990|volume=3|pages=49–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Haheon, Yahbo.

He was nominated to be a Jipyeong (持平, 지평) as a Yebinshijeong (禮賓寺正, 예빈시정) and had served in various other posts, before he left politics to absorb himself in scholarly pursuits. 

In 1660 he became a leading figure in the controversy regarding the mourning rituals over [[Hyojong of Joseon|King Hyojong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674 he became involved again in a second round of the controversy, this time over the death of [[Queen Inseon]]. In 1680 he was ordered to commit suicide by [[Sukjong of Joseon|King Sukjong]] after a long public debate with [[Song Siyeol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miura|first=Kumio|title=The Rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea|year=1985|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=NY|pages=411–444 [436]|editor=de Bary, Wm. Theodore |chapter=Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy in Seventeenth-Century Korea: Song Siyol and Yun Hyu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1680 Yun Hyu was expelled and exiled to Gapsan (甲山, 갑산) and that year sentenced to death and executed.
