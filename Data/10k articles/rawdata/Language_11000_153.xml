'''Air Observation Post''' ('''AOP''') is an aeroplane or helicopter used in the role of [[artillery spotter]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and other services of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth air forces. In this role, either the pilot of the aircraft or a passenger acts as an observer watching for targets on the ground, and/or as a [[Artillery observer|Forward Observation Officer]] directing the fire, by radio, of [[artillery]] on the ground (or calling in tactical ground-attack aircraft).&lt;ref name=fr&gt;History of AOP [http://military-genealogy.forcesreunited.org.uk/3968/Air_Observation_Post_(AOP) at forcesreunited.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the interwar period, the role of artillery spotting was mixed with reconnaissance and ground attack to be served by [[Army Co-operation]] (AC) squadrons. At the beginning of [[World War II]] their standard aircraft was the [[Westland Lysander]]. This aircraft had a high level of losses with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] during the [[Battle of France]] (118 shot down out of a total of 175 deployed). This demonstrated the unsuitability of the Lysander for Army Co-operation and called into question the whole concept. These RAF squadrons converted to  [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft by 1941, dropping the liaison and artillery spotting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_westland_lysander.html|title=Westland Lysander|website=www.historyofwar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II - British development==
The first of the dedicated Air Observation Post units was established by Major Charles Bazeley of the [[Royal Artillery]]. Working as D flight of an RAF unit and equipped with the [[Auster]], they went to France in February 1940 to develop the role on the French artillery ranges, in liaison with the French army. This training and development work had to be abandoned when the German blitzkrieg got underway and the unit was back at its UK base in [[Old Sarum Airfield|Old Sarum]] by 20 May 1940. The flight had been ordered to disband, but the Army resisted this, and the intervention of [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|General Alan Brook]], who was Commander in Chief Home Forces at the time, was able to secure the future of the flight and the concept of the AOP.&lt;ref name=Munro /&gt;{{rp|11-12}}

By 1942, AOP squadrons 651, 652, and 653 were in existence. Ultimately the AOP units consisted of squadrons 651 to 663, with 664, 665 and 666 as [[RCAF]] units with both Canadian and British personnel.

The key difference from the Army Co-operation squadrons was that AOP pilots were from the Royal Artillery. The RAF provided the technicians to service the aircraft and the equipment officers and adjutants. The rest of each unit was provided by the army, including signalers and drivers. A further unusual feature of Air Observation Post squadrons was that all pilots were officers, and they were nearly all captains. Since most operations were carried out separately by individual flights, this lack of rank structure in squadrons tended not to produce problems.{{r|Munro}}

During World War II, British AOP units used light, fixed-wing aircraft, almost exclusively several marks of [[Auster]] aircraft. The low speed, high manoeuvrability, small size (so aiding concealment at front-line landing grounds) and light weight of the Auster made this a much more suitable aircraft than the Lysander. The standard tactic of dealing with enemy fighter aircraft was to fly very low around a hill or a wood. Casualty rates for AOP pilots turned out to be relatively low, certainly compared to RAF pilots or infantrymen. One source of losses in combat was the aircraft being hit whilst flying through the path of outgoing shells. This was a particular hazard in intense bombardments: four aircraft were lost in this way during the [[Operation Plunder|crossing of the Rhine]] in March 1945.&lt;ref name="Munro"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munro|first1=Ronald Lyell|title=Above the Battle: An Air Observation Post Pilot at War|date=2016|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Books Ltd|location=Barnsley|isbn=978 1 47387 275 2|edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155|q=four Austers were to be destroyed}}

==Postwar==
In 1957, the newly formed [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] was created from existing army units. Fixed wing aircraft were steadily replaced by helicopters.&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;

'''Amarakaeri''' is an [[Amazonian languages|Amazonian language]] of the [[Harákmbut languages|Harákmbut]] language family spoken in [[Peru]] along the [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]] and Colorado Rivers. There is less than 1% literacy compared to 5 to 15% literacy in second language Spanish. There is one dialect called Kisambaeri. It is an official language and has a dictionary. Amarakaeri speakers include the Kochimberi, Küpondirideri, Wíntaperi, Wakitaneri, and Kareneri gold panning tribes. There is a common misconception is that Amarakaeri is an Arawakan language. Alternate names include Amarakaire, Amaracaire, and Mashco; the latter of which is considered a pejorative term.

== Phonology ==
Amarakaeri has 18 vowels.

== Life ==
Annelie Basson was born on a farm  near [[Grootfontein]] near the village of [[Uniondale, Western Cape|Uniondale]] ([[Cape Province]]). She holds a teaching degree in music (piano) from the [[University of South Africa]] (1986).

She is the author of fifty short stories and novels published in magazines [[Huisgenoot]], [[Sarie]] and [[Rooi Rose]]. She writes a regular column in [[Volksblad]] and Die Burger.

In November 2010, in an interview with the newspaper [[Rapport]], she caused controversy by declaring that she did not like black people or understand them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/690822.html|title='I don't like black people'|work=iAfrica.com|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the statements, the newspaper ''Die Burger'' decided to withdraw her column. She refused to retract her remarks and to condemn them. She added that it was "perhaps unfair" to put all black people in the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Author Annelie Botes stands by racist comments|url = http://mg.co.za/article/2010-11-26-author-anneli-botes-stands-by-racist-comments|website = The M&amp;G Online|access-date = 2016-01-29|first = Staff|last = Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avatime''', also known as '''Afatime''', '''Sideme''', or '''Sia''', is a [[Kwa language]] of the Avatime (self designation: Kedone (m.sg.)) people of eastern Ghana. The Avatime live primarily in the seven towns and villages of [[Amedzofe, Ghana|Amedzofe]], Vane, Gbadzeme, Dzokpe, Biakpe, Dzogbefeme, and Fume.

==Phonology==
Avatime is a tonal language with three tones, has vowel harmony, and has been claimed to have doubly articulated fricatives.

===Vowels===
Avatime has nine vowels, {{IPA|/i ɪ e ɛ a ɔ o ʊ u/}}, though the vowels {{IPA|/ɪ ʊ/}} have been overlooked in most descriptions of the language. It is not clear if the difference between {{IPA|/i e o u/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ ɛ ɔ ʊ/}} is one of [[advanced and retracted tongue root]] (laryngeal contraction), as in so many languages of Ghana, or of [[vowel height]]: different phonetic parameters support different analyses.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Since the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] does not have distinct letters for ±ATR vowels, they are transcribed here as differing in height for legibility.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avatime has [[vowel harmony]]. A root many not mix vowels of the relaxed {{IPA|/i e o u/}} and contracted {{IPA|/ɪ ɛ a ɔ ʊ/}} sets, and prefixes change vowels to harmonize with the vowels of the root. For example, the human singular gender prefix is {{IPA|/ɔ ~ o/}}, and the human plural is {{IPA|/a ~ e/}}: {{IPA|/o-ze/}} "thief", {{IPA|/ɔ-ka/}} "father"; {{IPA|/be-ze/}} "thieves", {{IPA|/ba-ka/}} "fathers"; also {{IPA|/o-bu/}} "bee" but {{IPA|/ɔ-bʊ/}} "god".&lt;ref group=note&gt;Tone not marked. Other prefixes vary as {{IPA|/ɛ ~ e/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels may be long or short. Records from 1910 showed that all vowels could be nasalized, but that is disappearing, and few words with nasal vowels remained by the end of the century.

{{IPA|/ɸ/}} is found in [[Ewe language|Ewe]] borrowings, as is {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, which can be seen to be distinct from {{IPA|/kw/}} (which cannot be followed by another consonant) in the loanword {{IPA|/àkʷlɛ̄/}} "boat".

The language has been claimed to have [[Doubly articulated consonant|doubly articulated]] fricatives {{IPA|/x͡ɸ ɣ͡β/}}. However, as with similar claims for Swedish {{IPA|[ɧ]}}, the labial articulation is not fricated, and these are actually labialized velars, {{IPA|/xʷ ɣʷ/}}. All velar fricatives are quite weak, and are closer to {{IPA|[h ɦ hʷ ɦʷ]}}.

The affricates vary between {{IPA|[t͡s], [d͡z]}} and {{IPA|[t͡ʃ], [d͡ʒ]}}, which may be a generational difference.

===Phonotactics===
Syllables are V, CV, CGV, and N: Avatime allows consonant-approximant clusters, where the approximant may be {{IPA|/l/, /w/, /j/}}. There is also a syllabic nasal, which takes its own tone: {{IPA|/kpāŋ̄/}} "many".

Any consonant but {{IPA|/n/, /l/}} may form a cluster with {{IPA|/l/}}: {{IPA|/ɔ̀kplɔ̄nɔ̀/}} "table", {{IPA|/ɔ̀ɡblāɡɛ̄/}} "snake", {{IPA|/káɣʷlɪ̀tsã̀/}} "chameleon", {{IPA|/sɪ̄ŋʷlɛ̀sɛ̃̀/}} "mucous". After a [[coronal consonant]], the {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[r]}}.

When two vowels come together, they are either separated by a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, fuse into a single vowel, or the first vowel reduces to a [[semivowel]]. In the latter case, the four [[front vowel]]s reduce to {{IPA|[j]}} and three of the back vowels reduce to {{IPA|[w]}}, but {{IPA|/u/}} is fronted to {{IPA|[ɥ]}}.

However, there are /Cw/ and /Cj/ sequences which are not derived from vowel sequences. These are {{IPA|/fw/, /mw/, /fj/, /vj/, /βj/, /tj/, /dj/, /sj/, /zj/, /lj/, /ŋʷj/}}.

'''Bartelomeus Frederik Maria (Bart FM) Droog''' (born 18 February 1966, [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] poet, [[anthologist]] and researcher.

As a poet, Droog performed on stages inside and outside the Netherlands, notably with De Dichters uit Epibreren, a group consisting of the poets Droog and Tjitse Hofman and the musician Jan Klug, which he co-founded. De Dichters uit Epibreren existed from 1994 to 2011; in 2003 they were awarded the [[Johnny van Doorn]] Prize for Spoken Literature. Droog took stage in [[Iran]], [[Armenia]], [[South Africa]] and many European countries.

In 2002, the city council of [[Groningen]] appointed Droog as the first stadsdichter (city poet), for a three year period.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hoorne, [http://www.literaturefromthelowcountries.eu/modern-minstrels/ 'Modern Minstrels. City Poets in the Low Countries'], Literature from the Low Countries Yearbook, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In that period he developed the concept of 'De eenzame uitvaart' (The Lonely Funeral): the city poet writes a poem for the deceased without relatives and reads the poem at the funeral. Poets in other cities in the Netherlands and [[Flanders]] adopted this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ro, [http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/the-dutch-city-poets-who-memorialize-the-lonely-dead/ 'The Dutch City Poets Who Memorialize the Lonely Dead'], Ploughshares, December 24th 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Droog was, from 2008 to 2010, also the city poet of his town of birth.

He established the Stichting Nederlandse Poëzie Encyclopedie (Foundation Dutch Poetry Encyclopedia), of which the main goals are to spread Dutch poetry and the knowledge of Dutch language poetry, including through the online Poetry Encyclopedia, the Nederlandse Poëzie Encyclopedie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nederlandsepoezie.org/redactioneel.html Nederlandse Poëzie Encyclopedie, Colofon]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 onwards, Droog also works as an investigative journalist. Subjects he published about include:

'''Bimal Mitra''' (1912–1991) was a prominent Bengali writer. 
Bimal Mitra was equally adept in writing in Bengali as well as in Hindi, and wrote more than one hundred novels and short stories.  Many of Bimal Mitra's novels have been made into successful films.
One of his most popular works, ''[[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam book|Shaheb Bibi Golam]]'' (January 1953) which was adapted into a hugely popular movie. He also earned a [[Filmfare]] nomination for Best Story for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deep750.googlepages.com/FilmfareAwards.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in the last years of the nineteenth century, the novel tells the story of the sumptuous lifestyle and the decay of a feudal family. It is the story of Pateshwari, aka Chhoto Bou, a woman who wants to experience romance, to be a real wife, to invent for herself and live a new kind of conjugality. The book also tells the story of Calcutta, now Kolkata, and of all the people who lived there.

''Asami Hazir'' is another popular work of Bimal Mitra. The novel is based on the true story of a man who wants to repent for the sins of his father and grandfather. The novel was adapted into a TV series for Doordarshan - ''[[Mujrim Hazir]]''.

He had served in railways in [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] for long years. He was working in the Chakradharpur Division in the 1940s in the Control Organisation. One of his novelettes ''Char Chokher Khela'' is based on the lives of the Anglo-Indian population of Chakradharpur railway colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ckpser.gov.in |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625192408/http://www.ckpser.gov.in/ |archivedate=2009-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned from Indian Railway Services in 1950 at the age of 38 only to become a devoted full-time writer.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Mitra died on December 2, 1991 at his residence in South Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=YRJZAAAAMAAJ |page= |title=Indian Author }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bozal Spanish''' is a possible extinct [[Spanish-based creole languages|Spanish-based creole language]] or [[pidgin]] that may have been a mixture of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Kikongo]], with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] influences.&lt;ref name="clements"/&gt;  Attestation is insufficient to indicate whether Bozal Spanish was ever a single, coherent or stable language, or if the term merely referred to any idiolect of Spanish that included African elements.

The Spanish distinguished ''[[black ladino|negros ladinos]]''&lt;ref name="DRAE ladino"&gt;''[http://dle.rae.es/?id=GElf0MV esclavo ladino]'' in the [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]].&lt;/ref&gt; ("Latinate Negros", those who spent more than a year in a Spanish-speaking territory) and ''negros bosales'' (wild, untamed&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | entry=bozal | editor1=[[Mario Andrew Pei]] | editor2=Salvatore Ramondino | title=The New World Spanish/English English/Spanish Dictionary | page=92 | publisher=[[New American Library]] | year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negroes; those born in or freshly arrived from Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Estéban Pichardo y Tapia | entry=BOZAL | title=Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas | page=39 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWsVAAAAYAAJ | year=1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Portuguese distinguished between {{lang|pt|índios mansos}} (tamed, domesticated [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]) and {{lang|pt|índios bravos}} (untamed, wild Indians), and between {{lang|pt|negros crioulos}} or {{lang|pt|ladinos}} (blacks born in the territory of a European empire, cf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25566">The linguistic classification of the ancient [[Thracian language]] has long been a matter of contention and uncertainty, and there are widely varying hypotheses regarding its position among other [[Paleo-Balkan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;This is confirmed among others by Benjamin W. Fortson in his ''Indo-European Language and Culture'', when he states that "all attempts to relate Thracian to Phrygian, Illyrian, or Dacian...are...purely speculative." (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilija Casule even links Thracian and Phrygian with the [[Burushaski language]], a [[language isolate]] spoken in northern [[Pakistan]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is not contested, however, that the Thracian languages were [[Indo-European language]]s which had acquired [[satem]] characteristics by the time they are attested.

The longer Thracian inscriptions that are known&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~Groznijat/thrac/thrac_6.html Duridanov, Ivan. ''The Language of the Thracians''].&lt;/ref&gt; (if they are indeed examples of Thracian sentences and phrases, which has not been determined) are not apparently close to Baltic, Slavic, Albanian, or any other known language, and they have not been satisfactorily deciphered aside from perhaps a few words.

===Daco-Thracian===
A ''Daco-Thracian'' (or ''Thraco-Dacian'') grouping with [[Dacian language|Dacian]] as either the same language or different from Thracian was widely held until the 1950s, but is untenable (according to [[J. P. Mallory]]) in light of toponymic evidence: only a percent of place names north of the Danube betray "pan-Thracian" roots.&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=J. P. |last=Mallory |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Thracian language |page=576 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis of a Thraco-Dacian or Daco-Thracian branch of IE, indicating a close link between the Thracian and Dacian languages, has numerous adherents, including Russu 1967, [[Georg Solta]] 1980, Vraciu 1980, Crossland, Trask (2000), McHenry (1993), Mihailov (2008). Crossland (1982) considers that the divergence of a presumed original Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects is not so significant as to rank them as separate languages. According to [[Georg Solta]] (1982), there is no significant difference between Dacian and Thracian. Rădulescu (1984) accepts that Daco-Moesian possesses a certain degree of dialectal individuality, but argues that there is no fundamental separation between Daco-Moesian and Thracian. Crossland considers this seems to be a divergence of a Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects, not as different as to rank as separate languages.{{sfn | Crossland| 1982 | 838}}{{dubious|date=March 2011}} Polomé (1982) considers that the evidence presented by Georgiev and Duridanov, although substantial, is not sufficient to determine whether Daco-Moesian and Thracian were two dialects of the same language or two distinct languages.

In the 1950s, the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev]] published his work which argued that Dacian and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] should be assigned to a language branch termed ''Daco-Mysian'', [[Moesia|Mysian]] (the term ''Mysian'' derives from the Daco-Thracian tribe known as the ''[[Moesi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;The ''Moesi'' of [[Moesia]] are not to be confused with the ''Mysoi'' ([[Mysians]]) of [[Mysia]] in ancient [[Anatolia]], though some{{who|date=October 2015}} hypothesize that the Mysians are directly descended from the Balkan Moesi. Georgiev claimed that Thracian is related to Daco-Moesian but distinct from Illyrian. This is hypothesized mostly on the basis of [[Strabo]]'s claim that some Moesians had migrated to Mysia, becoming the Mysians of Anatolia. Also in some classical sources the ''Moesi'' of Moesia are called ''Μυσοί''; Thracologists often see this as a corruption. Thracologists have noted a Thracian element in Mysia, but the Mysians are more often {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} viewed as a non-Thraco-Dacic people akin to the Phrygians, not the Thracians.&lt;/ref&gt; being thought of as a transitional language between Dacian and Thracian. Georgiev argued that Dacian and Thracian are different languages, with different phonetic systems, his idea being supported by the placenames, which end in ''-dava'' in Dacian and Mysian, as opposed to ''-para'', in Thracian placenames.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Georgiev (Gheorghiev), ''Raporturile dintre limbile dacă, tracă şi frigiană'', "Studii Clasice" Journal, II, 1960, 39-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgiev argues that the distance between Dacian and Thracian was approximately the same as that between the Armenian and Persian languages. The claim of Georgiev that Albanian is a direct recent descendant of Daco-Moesian, not only a part of the branch, is highly based on speculations as suffixes from Dacian toponyms as [[Dava (Dacian)|Dava]], for example, are lacking in modern Albanian toponymy (with one exception).

===Baltic===
The Baltic classification of Dacian and Thracian has been proposed by the Lithuanian polymath [[Jonas Basanavičius]], referred to as "Patriarch of Lithuania", who insisted this is the most important work of his life and listed 600 identical words of Balts and [[Thracians]]&lt;ref&gt;Dras. J. Basanavičius.

The Bulgarian linguist Ivan Duridanov, in his first publication claimed that Thracian and Dacian are genetically linked to the Baltic languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dėl žynio Žalmokšio vardo kilmės {{!}} Vydos Vartai Yogi.lt|url=http://www.yogi.lt/proteviu-sauksmas/del-zynio-zalmoksio-vardo-kilmes/|website=www.yogi.lt|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the next one he made the following classification: "The Thracian language formed a close group with the Baltic (resp. Balto-Slavic), the Dacian and the '[[Pelasgian]]' languages. More distant were its relations with the other Indo-European languages, and especially with Greek, the Italic and Celtic languages, which exhibit only isolated phonetic similarities with Thracian; the Tokharian and the Hittite were also distant."{{sfn|Duridanov|1976}} Of about 200 reconstructed Thracian words&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexicons.ru/old/f/thracian/index.html reconstructed Thracian words]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} by Duridanov, most cognates (138) appear in the Baltic languages, mostly in Lithuanian, followed by Germanic (61), Indo-Aryan (41), Greek (36), Bulgarian (23), Latin (10) and Albanian (8). The use of toponyms is suggested to determine the extent of a culture's influence. Parallels have enabled linguists, using the techniques of [[comparative linguistics]], to decipher the meanings of several Dacian and Thracian placenames with, they claim, a high degree of probability. Of 300 attested Thracian geographic names&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/thrac_lang/thrac_4a1.html Thracian geographic names]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} most parallels were found between Thracian and Baltic and geographic names in the study of Duridanov.{{sfn|Duridanov|1976}}{{sfn|Duridanov|1985}} According to him the most important impression make the geographic cognates of Baltic and Thracian "the similarity of these parallels stretching frequently on the main element and the suffix simultaneously, which makes a strong impression".{{sfn|Duridanov|1985}} He also [[List of reconstructed Dacian words|reconstructed Dacian words]] and [[Dacian–Baltic connection|Dacian placenames]] and found parallels mostly in the Baltic languages, followed by Albanian.{{sfn|Duridanov|1976}} Other Slavic authors noted that Dacian and Thracian have much in common with Baltic [[onomastics]] and explicitly not in any similar way with Slavic onomastics, including cognates and parallels of lexical isoglosses, which implies a recent common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg N. Trubachev, "Linguistics and ethnogenesis of the Slavs: the ancient Slavs as evidenced by etymology and onomastics", Journal of Indo-European Studies 13 (1985), pp. 203–256, here p. 215. On the other hand, certain isoglosses, particularly lexical ones, in Balkan Slavic languages have cognates in Baltic, but not in East Slavic languages. See D. Brozovic, "Doseljenje slavena i njihovi dodiri sa starosjediocima u svjetlu lingvistickih istraiivanja" [The settlement of the Slavs and their contacts with the native population in the light of linguistic studies], in Simpozijum "Treaslavenski etnit‘lei elemenii na Balkanu u etnogenezi juinih Slovena" [Symposium on Pre-Slavic ethnic elements on the Balkans and the ethnognesis of Southern Slavs], 24–26 October 1968, Mostar, ed. A. Benac (Sarajevo: [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], 1969), 1313: 129–140, here pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

After creating a list of names of rivers and personal names with a high number of parallels, the Romanian linguist Mircea M. Radulescu classified the [[Daco-Moesian]] and Thracian as Baltic languages, result of Baltic expansion to the south and also proposed such classification for [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]].&lt;ref name="Radulescu"&gt;M. Radulescu, "The Indo-European position of lllirian, Daco-Mysian and Thracian: a historic Methodological Approach", ''Journal of Indo-European Studies'' 15 (3–4), 239–271, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venezuelan-Lithuanian historian [[Jurate Rosales]] classifies Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages.&lt;ref name="Rosales"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jūratė|last=de Rosales|title=Europos šaknys ir mes, Lietuviai|language=Lithuanian|trans-title=Roots of Europe and us, Lithuanians|pages=43–70|url=http://meileshoroskopai.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Jurate.Statkute.de_.Rosales.-.Europos.saknys.ir_.mes_.lietuviai.2011.LT_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American linguist Harvey Mayer refers to both Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages and refers to them as Southern or Eastern Baltic. He claims to have sufficient evidence for classifying them as Baltoidic or at least "Baltic-like", if not exactly, Baltic dialects or languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv

Zero grade in this word is east Baltic, e-grade here is west Baltic, while the other word for "pine, evergreen", preidē (Prussian and Dacian), priede (Latvian), is marginal in Lithuanian matched by no *peus- in Latvian.}}

===Thraco-Illyrian===
'''Thraco-Illyrian''' is a hypothesis that the Thraco-Dacian and [[Illyrian languages]] comprise a distinct branch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]. [[Thraco-Illyrian]] is also used as a term merely implying a Thracian-Illyrian [[Language shift|interference]],  [[Creole language|mixture]] or [[sprachbund]], or as a shorthand way of saying that it is not determined whether a subject is to be considered as pertaining to Thracian or Illyrian. Downgraded to a geo-linguistic concept, these languages are referred to as Paleo-Balkan.

The rivers [[Vardar]] and [[Great Morava|Morava]] are generally taken as the rough line of demarcation between the Illyrian sphere on the west and Thracian on the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-43531/Balkans Encyclopædia Britannica - Balkans].&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, much interference in the area between Illyrian and Thracian, with Thracian groups inhabiting Illyrian lands (the Thracian [[Bryges]] for example) and Illyrian groups overlapping into the Thracian zone (the [[Dardani]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J.J. ''The Illyrians''. 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, p. 85. "Whether the Dardanians were an Illyrian or a Thracian people has been much debated..."&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be a Thraco-Illyrian mix; Wilkes, 1992 ''et al.''). It appears that Thracian and Illyrian do not have a clear-cut frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Russu (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities found between the Illyrian and Thracian lexis can thus be seen as merely linguistic interference.&lt;ref&gt;Hemp, Georgiev, ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Others such as I.I. Russu argue that there should have been major similarities between Illyrian and Thracian, and a common linguistic branch (not merely a [[Sprachbund]]) is probable. Among the Thraco-Illyrian correspondences Russu considers are the following:

{| class="wikitable"

Not many Thraco-Illyrian correspondences are definite, and a number may be incorrect, even from the list above. However, Sorin Paliga states:&lt;ref&gt;Paliga, S. (2001–2002). "Pre-Slavic and Pre-Romance Place-Names in Southeast Europe". ''Orpheus'' (Sofia) 11–12: 85–132.&lt;/ref&gt; "According to the available data, we may surmise that Thracian and Illyrian were mutually understandable, e.g. like [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], in one extreme, or like Spanish and Portuguese, at the other." Other linguists argue that Illyrian and Thracian were different Indo-European branches which later converged through contact. It is also of significance that Illyrian languages still have not been classified whether they were [[centum]] or [[satem]] language, while it is undisputed that Thracian was a [[satem]] language by the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]].&lt;ref&gt;The satem nature of proto-Thracian is disputed (Olteanu 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fragmentary attestation of both Illyrian and Thraco-Dacian, the existence of a Thraco-Illyrian branch remains controversial. In fact, this linguistic hypothesis was seriously called into question in the 1960s. New publications argued that no strong evidence for Thraco-Illyrian exists, and that the two language-areas show more differences than correspondences.&lt;ref&gt;See works by Vladimir Georgiev, Ivan Duridanov, and [[Eric Hamp]].&lt;/ref&gt; The place of [[Paeonian language]] remains unclear. Modern linguists are uncertain on the classification of Paeonian, due to the extreme scarcity of materials we have on this language. On one side are [[Wilhelm Tomaschek]] and [[Paul Kretschmer]], who claim it belonged to the [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian family]], and on the other side is [[Dimiter Dechev]], who claims affinities with [[Thracian language|Thracian]].

In 1977 Georgiev claimed that Daco-Mysian was closely related to the Thracian branch of Indo-European and that Illyrian was different from Thracian "as much as Iranian from Latin" for example.&lt;ref name=Georgiev77&gt;[http://documents.tips/documents/-1977--56265194764a2.html Траките и техният език (1977 В Георгиев)], p. 132, 183, 192, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albanian===
There are a number of close cognates between Thracian and Albanian, but this may indicate only that Thracian and Albanian are  related but not very closely related satem IE languages on their own branches of Indo-European, analogous to the situation between Albanian and the Baltic languages: Albanian and Baltic share many close cognates,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Orel]], ''A Concise Historical Grammar of the Albanian language''; et al.&lt;/ref&gt; while according to Mayer, [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is a descendant of [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] and escaped any heavy Baltic influence of Daco-Thracian.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1997" /&gt; Still, the hypothesis that Thracian and Albanian form a distinct branch (often in these scenarios, along with Dacian) of Indo-European is given much consideration even today. A few of the cognates between Thracian and Albanian may actually represent borrowings from one language to another;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} in most cases this is ruled out because a word or lexical item follows the sound-changes expected in the language from its PIE sound-changes.

Among the cognates between Thracian and Albanian: the Thracian inscription ''mezenai'' on the Duvanli gold ring has been unanimously linked to [[Messapian language|Messapian]] ''menzana'' (=horse deity) to Albanian ''mëz'' (=pony), as well as to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''mânz'' (=colt), and it is agreed that Thracian ''mezenai'' meant 'horseman'; Thracian ''manteia'' is supposed to be cognate to Albanian ''mand'' (=mulberry). This view has not gained wide acceptance among scholars and is rejected by most Albanian linguists, who both mainly consider that Albanian belongs to the Illyrian branch of IE.&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi, 1999, p283&lt;/ref&gt; Polome accepts the claim that Albanian is descended from Illyrian, not Thracian, although he considers the evidence for this as inconclusive. A toponymic analysis of a Bulgarian linguist showed incosistency between toponymy of the [[Bessi]] and Albanian toponymy.

===Ancient Greek===
Sorin Mihai Olteanu, a [[Romanians|Romanian]] linguist and [[Thracologist]], proposed that the Thracian (as well as the Dacian) language was a centum language in its earlier period, and developed satem features over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soltdm.com/langtdm/phon/palatala_e.htm Sorin Mihai Olteanu - The Thracian Palatal] (Accessed: February 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the arguments for this idea is that there are many close cognates between Thracian and [[Ancient Greek]]. There are also substratum words in the Romanian language that are cited as evidence of the genetic relationship of the Thracian language to ancient Greek and the [[Ancient Macedonian language]] (the extinct language or Greek dialect of ancient [[Macedon]]). The [[Greek language]] itself may be grouped with the [[Phrygian language]] and [[Armenian language]], both of which have been grouped with Thracian in the past.

As in the case with Albanian and Balto-Slavic, there is no compelling evidence that Thracian and Greek (or Daco-Thracian and Greco-Macedonian) share a close common ancestor.

===Thraco-Phrygian or Thraco-Armenian hypothesis===

For a long time a Thraco-Phrygian hypothesis grouping Thracian with the extinct Phrygian language was considered, largely based on Greek historians like Strabo. By extension of identifying Phrygians with Proto-Armenians, a Thraco-Phrygian branch of Indo-European was postulated with Thracian, Phrygian and Armenian and constituent languages. The evidence for this seems to have been mostly based on interpretations of history and identifying the eastern [[Mushki]] with Armenians and assuming they had branched off from western Mushki (whom has been conclusively identified as Phrygians).&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Diakonoff ”The Pre-History of the Armenian People” Erevan, 1968, English Translation by Lori Jennings
(Delmar, New York, 1984) http://www.attalus.org/armenian/diakph10.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, in 1988 Fredrik Kortlandt argued, on linguistic grounds such as a common treatment of Proto-Indo-European glottal stops, that Armenian descended from a Thracian dialect. Thus, forming a Thraco-Armenian branch of Indo-European.
In 2016 Kortlandt extended his theories, postulating a link between Thraco-Armenian and the hypothetical [[Graeco-Phrygian]] language family, despite Thracian and Armenian being Satem languages and Greek and Phrygian Centum languages Kortlandt identifies sound correspondences and grammatical similarities postulating a relationship between his Thraco-Armenian family and the more established Graeco-Phrygian family. 
[[Graeco-Armenian]] is by itself a common hypothesized subgrouping of Indo-European languages.
Kortlandt considers Albanian a descendent of Dacian which he regards as belonging to a separate language family as Thraco-Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;Frederik Kortlandt ”Phrygian Between Greek and Armenian” Academie Bulgare des Sciences Linguistique Balkanique LV (2016), 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Older textbooks grouped Phrygian and Armenian with Thracian, but the belief is no longer popular and is mostly discarded.&lt;ref&gt;See C. Brixhe - Ancient languages of Asia Minor, Cambridge University Press, 2008
We will dismiss, at least temporarily, the idea of a Thraco-Phrygian unity. Thraco-Dacian (or Thracian and Daco-Mysian) seems to belong to the eastern (satem) group of Indo-European languages and its (their) phonetic system is far less conservative than that of Phrygian (see Brixhe and Panayotou 1994, §§3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Phrygian is not widely seen as linked to Thracian.{{sfn|Polomé|1982|pp=887–888}} Georgiev claimed that Thracian is different from Phrygian "as much as Greek from Albanian", comparing 150 Phrygian inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Georgiev77/&gt; Duridanov found in 1976 Phrygian completely lacking parallels in Thracian and concluded that the Thraco-Phrygian theory is debunked. Duridanov argued that the Thraco-Illyrian theory is a mistake of the past: "In the past it was regarded that Thracian together with the Phrygian and other vanished languages belonged to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages. This mistake was corrected in the 80’s of the last century, but the ambiguities still persisted: the Thracian was combined in one group with the Phrygian (P. Kretschmer), and later – with the Illyrian (the language, spoken in the modern Dalmatia and Albania)."

[[Image:Narrenturm Vienna June 2006 575.jpg|thumb|[[Vienna]]'s [[Narrenturm (hospital) |Narrenturm]]—[[german language|German]] for "fools' tower"—was one of the earliest buildings specifically designed for mentally ill people. It was built in 1784.]]
'''Deinstitutionalisation''' (or '''deinstitutionalization''') is the process of replacing long-stay [[psychiatric hospital]]s with less isolated [[community mental health service]]s for those diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] or [[developmental disability]]. In the late 20th century, it led to the closure of many psychiatric hospitals, as patients were increasingly cared for at home or in [[halfway house]]s, clinics and regular hospitals.

Deinstitutionalisation works in two ways. The first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates. The second focuses on reforming psychiatric care to reduce (or avoid encouraging) feelings of dependency, hopelessness and other behaviors that make it hard for patients to adjust to a life outside of care.&lt;ref name=Stroman&gt;{{cite book|last=Stroman|first=Duane|year=2003|title=The Disability Rights Movement: From Deinstitutionalization to Self-determination|publisher=University Press of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern deinstitutionalisation movement was initiated by three factors:
*A socio-political movement for community mental health services and open hospitals;
*The advent of [[psychiatric medication|psychiatric drugs]] able to manage [[Psychosis|psychotic]] episodes;
*Financial imperatives (in the US specifically, to shift costs from state to federal budgets)&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt;

The movement to reduce institutionalisation was met with wide acceptance in Western countries, though its effects have been the subject of many debates. Some experts, such as [[E. Fuller Torrey]], have argued that deinstitutionalisation was a mistake,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torrey|first=E. Fuller|title=Documenting the failure of deinstitutionalisation|journal=Psychiatry|date=Summer 2010|volume=73|issue=2|pages=122–4|pmid=20557222|doi=10.1521/psyc.2010.73.2.122}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[Thomas Szasz]], argue it did not provide enough freedom for patients.&lt;ref name=Szasz&gt;{{cite book|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=Coercion as cure: a critical history of psychiatry|year=2007|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|isbn=978-0-7658-0379-5|pages=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YqYFBbp0u2wC&amp;pg=PA34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that it was an improvement on the system that existed before. Psychiatrist [[Leon Eisenberg]] has argued that it has generally been beneficial for psychiatric patients, while noting that some were left homeless or without care.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Leon|authorlink=Leon Eisenberg|last2=Guttmacher|first2=Laurence|title=Were we all asleep at the switch?

==Origins==
===19th century===
The 19th century saw a large expansion in the number and size of [[lunatic asylum|asylum]]s in Western [[industrialisation|industrialised]] countries. Although initially based on principles of [[moral treatment]], they became overstretched, non-therapeutic, isolated in location, and neglectful of patients.&lt;ref name=Wright1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright D |title=Getting out of the asylum: understanding the confinement of the insane in the nineteenth century |journal=Social History of Medicine |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=137–55 |date=April 1997 |pmid=11619188 |doi= 10.1093/shm/10.1.137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
By the beginning of the 20th century, increasing admissions had resulted in serious overcrowding, causing many problems for psychiatric institutions. Funding was often cut, especially during periods of economic decline and wartime. Asylums became notorious for poor living conditions, lack of hygiene, overcrowding, ill-treatment, and [[Patient abuse|abuse of patients]].

The first community-based alternatives were suggested and tentatively implemented in the 1920s and 1930s, although asylum numbers continued to increase up to the 1950s. The movement for deinstitutionalisation moved to the forefront in various countries during the 1950s and 1960s with the advent of [[chlorpromazine]] and other antipsychotic drugs.

The prevailing public arguments, time of onset, and pace of reforms varied by country.&lt;ref name=Fakhourya07/&gt; In the United States, [[class action lawsuit]]s and the scrutiny of institutions through [[disability activism]] and [[antipsychiatry]] helped expose poor conditions and treatment. Sociologists and others argued that such institutions maintained or created dependency, passivity, exclusion, and disability, which caused people to remain institutionalised. [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan's experiment]] in 1973 "accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to deinstitutionalize as many mental patients as possible."&lt;ref name="Kornblum 2011 195"&gt;{{cite book |last = Kornblum |first = William |editor1-last = Mitchell |editor1-first = Erin |editor2-last = Jucha |editor2-first = Robert |editor3-last = Chell |editor3-first = John |title = Sociology in a Changing World |edition = 9th |publisher = Cengage learning |year = 2011 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DtKcG6qoY5AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |doi = |isbn = 978-1-111-30157-6 |page = 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prevailing argument claimed that community services would be cheaper and that new psychiatric medications made it more feasible to release people into the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rochefort, D.A. |title=Origins of the "Third psychiatric revolution": the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 |journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |date=Spring 1984 |pmid=6736594 |url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6736594 |doi=10.1215/03616878-9-1-1 |access-date=2009-04-30 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709153258/http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6736594 |archive-date=2012-07-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health professionals, public officials, families, advocacy groups, public citizens, and unions held differing views on deinstitutionalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherl |first1=D.J. |last2=Macht |first2=L.B. |title=Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=599–604 |date=September 1979 |pmid=223959 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=223959 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106115504/http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=223959 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-06 |doi=10.1176/ps.30.9.599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key text in the development of deinstitutionalisation was ''[[Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates]]'', a 1961 book by [[sociologist]] [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name="Mac Suibhne"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mac Suibhne|first=Séamus|title=Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and other Inmates|journal=[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]|date=7 October 2009|volume=339|pages=b4109|doi=10.1136/bmj.b4109|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving |title=Asylums: essays on the social situation of mental patients and other inmates|year=1961|publisher=Anchor Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FqELAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Extracts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracts from Erving Goffman|url=http://studymore.org.uk/xgof.htm#Asylums|publisher=A Middlesex University resource|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients, the hospital.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinstein R. |title=Goffman's Asylums and the Social Situation of Mental Patients |journal=Orthomolecular Psychiatry |volume=11 |issue=N 4 |pages=267–274 |year=1982 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1982/pdf/1982-v11n04-p267.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his [[participant observation]] [[field work]], the book details Goffman's theory of the "[[total institution]]" (principally in the example he gives, as the title of the book indicates, mental institutions) and the process by which it takes efforts to maintain predictable and regular behavior on the part of both "guard" and "captor," suggesting that many of the features of such institutions serve the ritual function of ensuring that both classes of people know their function and [[social role]], in other words of "[[institutionalization|institutionalizing]]" them.

[[Franco Basaglia]], a leading Italian psychiatrist who inspired and was the architect of the [[psychiatric reform in Italy]], also defined mental hospital as an oppressive, locked and [[total institution]] in which prison-like, punitive rules are applied, in order to gradually eliminate its own contents, and patients, doctors and nurses are all subjected (at different levels) to the same process of institutionalism.&lt;ref name="Tansella"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tansella|first=M. |title=Community psychiatry without mental hospitals—the Italian experience: a review |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=664–669 |date=November 1986 |pmid=3795212 |pmc=1290535 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalisation]] (AAAIMH) was an organisation founded in 1970 by [[Thomas Szasz]], George Alexander, and [[Erving Goffman]] for the purpose of abolishing involuntary psychiatric intervention, particularly [[involuntary commitment]], against individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Constance|last2=Brodsky|first2=Stanley|title=Client Participation in Human Services: The Prometheus Principle|year=1978|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|pages=114|isbn=978-0878551316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PafpN9Q0_VAC&amp;pg=PA114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of the AAAIMH was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=To the editor|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|year=1971|volume=61|pages=1076|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVUqAQAAMAAJ|doi=10.2105/AJPH.61.6.1076-a|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=1 June 1971|volume=127|issue=12|pages=1698|pmid=5565860|doi=10.1176/ajp.127.12.1698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, ''[[The Abolitionist]]''.&lt;ref name=Schaler&gt;{{cite book|title=Szasz Under Fire: A Psychiatric Abolitionist Faces His Critics|year=2004|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=978-0812695687|pages=xiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ts6cxoiO-o4C&amp;pg=PR14|editor=Schaler, Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was dissolved in 1980.&lt;ref name=Schaler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aut&gt;{{cite book|title=Aut aut|year=2011|publisher=Il Saggiatore|isbn=978-8865761267|pages=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3CF4C5s8PUC&amp;pg=PT166|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American psychiatrist [[Loren Mosher]] noticed that the psychiatric institution itself gave him master classes in the art of the "total institution": labeling, unnecessary dependency, the induction and perpetuation of powerlessness, the degradation ceremony, authoritarianism, and the primacy of institutional needs over those of the persons it was ostensibly there to serve-the patients.&lt;ref name="Mosher2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mosher L.R. |title=Soteria and other alternatives to acute psychiatric hospitalization: a personal and professional review |journal=[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]] |volume=187 |issue=3 |pages=142–149 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10086470 |doi=10.1097/00005053-199903000-00003 |url=http://www.cmha.ca/data/1/rec_docs/1166_alternatives%20to%20acute%20psychiatric%20hospitalization.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092044/http://www.cmha.ca/data/1/rec_docs/1166_alternatives%20to%20acute%20psychiatric%20hospitalization.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[New York ARC v. Rockefeller]]'', parents of 5,000 residents at the [[Willowbrook State School]] in Staten Island, New York, filed suit over the inhumane living conditions at that institution, where residents were abused and neglected.  A 1972 television broadcast from the Willowbrook State School, titled "Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace," outraged the general public. However, it took 3 years from the time the lawsuit documents were filed before the consent judgement was signed. In 1975, the consent judgement was signed, and it committed New York state to improve community placement for the now designated "Willowbrook Class." The Willowbrook State School was closed in 1987, and all but about 150 of the former Willowbrook residents were moved to group homes by 1992.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |title=Disability History Timeline |year=2002 |website=Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living Management |publisher=[[Temple University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sproutflix.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sproutflix.org/content/willowbrook-last-great-disgrace |title=Sproutflix website description of film titled Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724153008/http://sproutflix.org/content/willowbrook-last-great-disgrace |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.htmlres=9F0CE4D71E3EF931A25750C0A965958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 New York Times article, "Big Day for Ex-Residents Of Center for the Retarded," by Celia W.

In 1973, a federal district court ruled in ''Souder v. Brennan'' that patients in mental health institutions must be considered employees and paid the minimum wage required by the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] whenever they performed any activity that conferred an economic benefit on an institution. Following this ruling, institutional peonage was outlawed, as evidenced in Pennsylvania's Institutional Peonage Abolishment Act of 1973.

==Consequences==
There is an increased incarceration for the mental health population due to mental health treatment facilities being closed as a result of the lack of government funding. The solution is to put money back into mental health treatment facilities to decrease the mental health population in jail. Better Mental health services would combat not only mental illness, but homelessness as well. In a survey by the United States Conference of Mayors (2008), 20 percent of cities listed better coordination with mental health service providers as one of the top three items needed to combat homelessness. Incarceration and homelessness are mutual risk factors for each other. Researchers generally estimate that 25-50 percent of the homeless population has a history of incarceration. 
According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 20 to 25 percent of the homeless population in the United States suffers from some sort of severe mental illness (SAMSHA 2018). About a fifth of America’s 1.7 million homeless population suffer from untreated schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, when you focus in on single adult homeless males, about 16% of them suffer from some form of severe and persistent mental illness. There is general agreement among researchers that the number of mentally ill individuals in jail is substantial, and that many of these individuals are arrested for minor crimes, particularly disorderly conduct or trespassing. There is evidence that a large percentage of jailed individuals may also have been homeless at the time of arrest. Nearly 21 percent were classified as homeless when they were arrested and 40 percent said they had been homeless at some time during the past few years. The researchers concluded that homelessness significantly increases the risk of indictment for violent criminal offenses among mentally disordered offenders (National Coalition for the Homeless 2009). 

Community services that developed include [[supportive housing]] with full or partial supervision and specialised teams (such as [[assertive community treatment]] and [[early intervention in psychosis|early intervention teams]]). Costs have been reported as generally equivalent to inpatient hospitalisation, even lower in some cases (depending on how well or poorly funded the community alternatives are).&lt;ref name=Fakhourya07/&gt; Although deinstitutionalisation has been positive for the majority of patients, it also has shortcomings.

Criticism of deinstitutionalisation takes two forms. Some, like [[E. Fuller Torrey]], defend the use of psychiatric institutions and conclude that deinstitutionalisation was a move in the wrong direction. Others, such as Walid Fakhoury and Stefan Priebe argue that it was an unsuccessful move in the right direction, suggesting that modern day society faces the problem of "reinstitutionalisation".&lt;ref name=Fakhourya07/&gt; Sometimes these groups have similar criticisms. Both argue that many patients [[Homelessness and mental health|became homeless]] or [[Mentally ill people in United States jails and prisons|in prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Torrey, Dr. E. Fuller|authorlink1=E. Fuller Torrey|title=250,000 Mentally Ill are Homeless. The number is increasing|url=http://mentalillnesspolicy.org/consequences/homeless-mentally-ill.html|website=Mental Illness Policy Org|accessdate=6 August 2015|ref=mentalillnesspolicy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fakhourya07/&gt;

New community services are often uncoordinated and unable to meet complex needs. Services in the community sometimes isolate the mentally ill within a new [[ghetto]], where service users meet each other but have little contact with the rest of the public community. Fakhoury and Priebe said that instead of "[[community psychiatry]]", reforms established a "psychiatric community".&lt;ref name= Fakhourya07/&gt;

Families can often play a crucial role in the care of those who would typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority of those who would be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Torrey|first=E.

===Violence===
====Victimisation====
Moves to community living and services have led to various concerns and fears, from both the individuals themselves and other members of the community. Over a quarter of individuals accessing community mental health services in a US inner-city area are victims of at least one violent crime per year, a proportion eleven times higher than the inner-city average. The elevated victim rate holds for every category of crime, including rape/sexual assault, other violent assaults, and personal and property theft. [[Victimisation]] rates are similar to those with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teplin|first1=Linda A|last2=McClelland|first2=Gary M|last3=Abram|first3=Karen M|last4=Weiner|first4=Dana A|title=Crime Victimisation in Adults With Severe Mental Illness: Comparison With the National Crime Victimisation Survey |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=911–21 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16061769 |pmc=1389236 |doi= 10.1001/archpsyc.62.8.911 |url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=208861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersilia|first=Joan R |title=Crime Victims With Developmental Disabilities: A Review Essay |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=655–94 |year=2001 |doi=10.1177/009385480102800601 |url= http://cjb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/6/655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misconceptions====
Despite perceptions by the public and media that people with mental disorders released into the community are more likely to be dangerous and violent, a large study indicated that those without substance abuse symptoms are no more likely to commit violence than others without substance abuse symptoms in their neighborhoods, which were usually economically deprived and high in substance abuse and crime. The study also reported that a higher proportion of the patients than of the others in the neighborhoods reported symptoms of substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steadman|first1=Henry J|last2=Mulvey|first2=Edward P.|last3=Monahan|first3=John|last4=Robbins|first4=Pamela Clark|last5=Appelbaum|first5=Paul S|last6=Grisso|first6=Thomas|last7=Roth|first7=Loren H|last8=Silver|first8=Eric|title=Violence by people discharged from acute psychiatric inpatient facilities and by others in the same neighborhoods |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=393–401 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9596041 |url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=203874 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.55.5.393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings on violence committed by those with mental disorders in the community have been inconsistent and related to numerous factors; a higher rate of more serious offences such as homicide have sometimes been found but, despite high-profile homicide cases, the evidence suggests this has not been increased by deinstitutionalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sirotich|first=F. |title=Correlates of Crime and Violence among Persons with Mental Disorder: An Evidence-Based Review |journal=Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=171–94 |year=2008 |doi=10.1093/brief-treatment/mhn006 |url=http://triggered.edina.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbtci.stanford.clockss.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Fabstract%2F8%2F2%2F171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stuart03&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stuart|first=H. |title=Violence and mental illness: an overview |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=121–4 |date=June 2003 |pmid=16946914 |pmc= 1525086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor|first1=P.J.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. |title=Homicides by people with mental illness: Myth and reality |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=174 |issue=1|pages=9–14 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10211145 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/174/1/9 |doi=10.1192/bjp.174.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggression and violence that does occur, in either direction, is usually within family settings rather than between strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Solomon |first1=Phyllis L. |last2=Cavanaugh |first2=Mary M. |last3=Gelles |first3=Richard J. |title=Family violence among adults with severe mental illness: a neglected area of research |journal=[[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=40–54 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15574672 |doi=10.1177/1524838004272464 |url=http://tva.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15574672 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand]] established a [[truth and reconciliation commission|reconciliation initiative]] in 2005 to address the ongoing [[damages|compensation]] payouts to ex-patients of state-run mental institutions in the 1970s to 1990s. A number of grievances were heard, including: poor reasons for admissions; unsanitary and overcrowded conditions; lack of communication to patients and family members; physical violence and sexual misconduct and abuse; inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints; pressures and difficulties for staff, within an [[authoritarian]] hierarchy based on containment; fear and humiliation in the misuse of [[seclusion]]; over-use and abuse of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]], psychiatric medications, and other treatments as punishments, including [[group therapy]], with continued [[adverse effects]]; lack of support on discharge; interrupted lives and lost potential; and continued stigma, prejudice, and emotional distress and trauma.

There were some references to instances of helpful aspects or kindnesses despite the system. Participants were offered counselling to help them deal with their experiences, along with advice on their rights, including access to records and legal redress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Internal Affairs, New Zealand Government|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/Agency-Confidential-Forum-for-Former-In-Patients-of-Psychiatric-Hospitals-Index|title=Report of the Confidential Forum for Former In-Patients of Psychiatric Hospitals|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform was focused on the gradual dismantlement of psychiatric hospitals, which required an effective community mental health service.&lt;ref name="Tansella" /&gt;{{rp|665}} The object of community care was to reverse the long-accepted practice of isolating the mentally ill in large institutions and to promote their integration in a socially stimulating environment, while avoiding subjecting them to excessive social pressures.&lt;ref name="Tansella"/&gt;{{rp|664}}

The work of [[Giorgio Antonucci]], instead of changing the form of commitment from the mental hospital to other forms of coercion, questions the basis of psychiatry, affirming that mental hospitals are the essence of psychiatry and rejecting any possible reform of psychiatry, that must be completely eliminated.&lt;ref name=Maraini /&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the trend towards deinstitutionalisation began in the 1950s. At the time, 0.4% of the population of England were housed in asylums.&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of specialist mental health services, S Lawton-Smith and A McCulloch, Mental Health Foundation, {{cite web |url=http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/content/assets/pdf/publications/starting-today-background-paper-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404105121/http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/content/assets/pdf/publications/starting-today-background-paper-1.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Harold Macmillan]] sponsored the [[Mental Health Act 1959]],&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health: Mental Health Act 1959 General Policy, Registered Files (95,200 Series), The National Archives, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10978&lt;/ref&gt; which removed the distinction between psychiatric hospitals and other types of hospitals. [[Enoch Powell]], the Minister of Health in the early 1960s, criticized psychiatric institutions in his 1961 "Water Tower" speech and called for most of the care to be transferred to general hospitals and the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studymore.org.uk/xpowell.htm Powell's Water Tower speech]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaigns of Barbara Robb and several scandals involving mistreatment at asylums (notably [[Ely Hospital]]) furthered the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | others =Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State of the Department of Health and Social Security | date =11 March 1969 | title =Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Allegations of Ill – Treatment of Patients and other irregularities at the Ely Hospital, Cardiff | type =Government report | url =http://www.sochealth.co.uk/resources/national-health-service/democracy-involvement-and-accountability-in-health/complaints-regulation-and-enquries/report-of-the-committee-of-inquiry-into-allegations-of-ill-treatment-of-patients-and-other-irregularities-at-the-ely-hospital-cardiff-1969/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ely Hospital scandal led to an inquiry led by [[Brian Abel-Smith]] and a 1971 white paper that recommended further reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Learning difficulties residential home scandals: the inside story and lessons from Longcare and Cornwall|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2007/01/10/learning-difficulties-residential-home-scandals-the-inside-story-and-lessons-from-longcare-and-cornwall/#.UoPuhPlT6UM|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Community Care|date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The policy of deinstitutionalisation came to be known as [[Care in the Community]] at the time it was taken up by the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Large-scale closures of the old asylums began in the 1980s. By 2015, none remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/making-change-possible/mental-health-services|title=Case study 1: Deinstitutionalisation in UK mental health services |publisher=The King's Fund|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====United States====
{{main|Deinstitutionalization in the United States}}
[[File:Center building at Saint Elizabeths, August 23, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[St Elizabeth's Hospital]] in 2006, closed and boarded up. The hospital had been one of the sites of the [[Rosenhan experiment]] in the 1970s.]]

The United States has experienced two main waves of deinstitutionalisation. The first wave began in the 1950s and targeted people with mental illness.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt; The second wave began roughly 15 years later and focused on individuals who had been diagnosed with a developmental disability.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt; [[Loren Mosher]] argues that deinstitutionalisation fully began in the 1970s and was due to financial incentives like [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]] and Social Security Disability, rather than after the earlier introduction of psychiatric drugs.&lt;ref name=Mosher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Loren|authorlink=Loren Mosher|title=Letter Mosher to Goodwin|journal=[[Psychology Today]]|volume= 32|issue=5|year=1999|pages=8|url=http://www.moshersoteria.com/soteriawp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/psycho.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important factors that led to deinstitutionalisation were changing public attitudes to mental health and mental hospitals, the introduction of [[psychiatric medication|psychiatric drugs]] and individual states' desires to reduce costs from mental hospitals.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt; The federal government offered financial incentives to the states to achieve this goal.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt; Stroman pinpoints World War II as the point when attitudes began to change. In 1946, [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] published one of the first exposés of the shortcomings of mental illness treatment.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt; Also in 1946, Congress passed the [[National Mental Health Act|National Mental Health Act of 1946]], which created the [[National Institute of Mental Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]]. NIMH was pivotal in funding research for the developing mental health field.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt;

President [[John F. Kennedy]] had a special interest in the issue of mental health because his sister, [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], had incurred brain damage after being [[Rosemary Kennedy#Lobotomy|lobotomised]] at the age of 23.&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt; His administration sponsored the successful passage of the [[Community Mental Health Act]], one of the most important laws that led to deinstitutionalization. The movement continued to gain momentum during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The 1965 amendments to Social Security shifted about 50% of the mental health care costs from states to the federal government,&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt; motivating state governments to promote deinstitutionalization. The 1970s saw the founding of several advocacy groups, including Liberation of Mental Patients, Project Release, Insane Liberation Front, and the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness|National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)]].&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt;

The 1970s saw some key court rulings that increased the rights of patients, due to lawsuits from these advocacy groups. In 1973, a federal district court ruled in ''Souder v. Brennan'' that patients in mental health institutions must be considered employees and paid the minimum wage required by the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] whenever they performed any activity that conferred an economic benefit on an institution. Following this ruling, institutional peonage was outlawed. In 1975, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[O'Connor v. Donaldson|restricted the rights of states to incarcerate someone who was not violent]]. This was followed up with a 1978 ruling [[Addington v. Texas|further restricting states from confining anyone involuntarily for mental illness]]. In 1975, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] ruled in favour of the Mental Patient's Liberation Front of [[Rogers v. Okin]],&lt;ref name=Stroman/&gt; establishing the right of a patient to refuse treatment. Later reforms included the [[Mental Health Parity Act]], which required health insurers to give mental health patients equal coverage.

Other factors include scandals. A 1972 television broadcast exposed the abuse and neglect of 5,000 patients at the [[Willowbrook State School]] in [[Staten Island]], New York. The [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan's experiment]] in 1973 caused several psychiatric hospitals to fail to notice fake patients who showed no symptoms once they were institutionalized.&lt;ref name="Kornblum 2011 195"/&gt; The pitfalls of institutionalization were dramatized in an award-winning 1975 film, ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]''.

In 1955 for every 100,000 US citizens there were 340 psychiatric hospital beds. In 2005 that number had diminished to 17 per 100,000.

===South America===
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
In several South American countries,{{specify|date=May 2012}}, such as in Argentina, the total number of beds in asylum-type institutions has decreased, replaced by psychiatric inpatient units in general hospitals and other local settings.&lt;ref name=Fakhourya07/&gt;

The '''Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre''' '''(DCDC)''' is the United Kingdom (UK) [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]’s (MOD’s) [[think tank]].

==Structure==
The DCDC is headed by a two-star officer, located at Shrivenham and is under the UK's [[Joint Forces Command]] but reports to the [[Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Vice Chief of the Defence Staff]] (VCDS) who sets its priorities and outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre: the MOD's independent think tank|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507544/20160217_DCDC_Pamphlet_Web__2_.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2016|agency=British Ministry of Defence|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The DCDC (Originally called the Joint Doctrine and Concepts Centre (JDCC)) was established as a result of the 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]]. The UK recognised that it needed to have a clearer long-term vision of the way in which it expected it forces and their methods of operation to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The background to the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/DcdcBackground.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080205163222/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/DcdcBackground.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 February 2008|accessdate=30 May 2016|agency=British Ministry of Defence|date=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outputs==
DCDC produces many publications relating to the future global environment. It also has a Doctrine Team responsible for writing and maintaining a range of joint operational level UK and NATO doctrine publications, and Strategy, Analysis and Research and Legal Teams such as the [[Global Strategic Trends Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/development-concepts-and-doctrine-centre|accessdate=30 May 2016|agency=British Ministry of Defence|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equatoguinean Spanish''' ({{lang-es|Español ecuatoguineano}}) is the variety of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in [[Equatorial Guinea]]. This is the only Spanish variety that holds national official status in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. It is regulated by the [[Equatoguinean Academy of the Spanish Language]] and is spoken by about 90% of the population, estimated at 1,170,308 for the year 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=-91&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=dq&amp;msz=1500 |title=World Gazetteer |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527134644/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=-91&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=dq&amp;msz=1500 |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (though population figures for this country are highly dubious), all of them second-language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Penny|first1= Ralph|authorlink1= |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|edition= 2|series= |volume= |date= |year= 2002|month= |origyear= 1991|publisher= |location= |page= 33|quote= ''Spanish is spoken by part of the population of Equatorial Guinea. Spanish is the language of education and the press, and is the only common language in an otherwise linguistically diverse country. However, those who speak Spanish use it as a second language, often acquired in adulthood and therefore not always in a fully native manner.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Spanish Guinea]] (along with the islands of [[Bioko]], formerly Fernando Pó) became a [[Spanish colonial empire|Spanish colony]] after being obtained from Portugal in exchange for American territories in 1778 under the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. Full colonization of the continental interior was not established until the end of the 19th century. The present nation of Equatorial Guinea became independent on October 12, 1968.
[[File:Old Equatorial Guinean 1000 pesetas banknote, 1969.jpg|thumb|1000 Equatoguinean pesetas banknote from 1969]]

While the country has maintained its indigenous linguistic diversity, Spanish is the national and official language. Spanish is spoken by about 90% of the population in Bioko and coastal [[Río Muni]] and between 60% to 70% in the interior of Río Muni.&lt;ref name=psu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/jml34/eg.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Spanish of Equatorial Guinea: research on la hispanidad's best-kept secret |author=John M. Lipski |accessdate=2015-05-20 |publisher=Personal.psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Equatoguinean Spanish is more like [[Peninsular Spanish]] than [[Spanish language in the Americas|American Spanish]] dialects. Here are some features of Equatoguinean Spanish:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipski|first1=John|title=The Spanish Language of Equatorial Guinea|journal=Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies|volume=8|pages=120–123|jstor=20641705}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both syllable- and word-final /s/ are strongly pronounced.
* /ɾ/ and /r/ are merged.
* Articles are omitted.
* The pronoun ''usted'' can be used with the ''tú'' verbal conjugation.
* There is no distinction between indicative and subjunctive moods.
* ''Vosotros'' is used interchangeably with ''ustedes''.
* The preposition ''en'' replaces ''a'' to mark a destination: ''voy'' '''''en''''' ''[[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]]'' instead of ''voy'' '''''a''''' ''Bata''.

==Comparison to Caribbean Spanish==
According to John Lipski, a comparison between the Spanish spoken in Equatorial Guinea and [[Caribbean Spanish]] does not hint at an influence of [[African languages]] in Caribbean Spanish, despite some earlier theories. Both varieties of Spanish are very different. The main influence on the Spanish spoken in Equatorial Guinea seems to be the varieties spoken by native Spanish colonizers.&lt;ref name=Lipski1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/jml34/egs.pdf|format=PDF|title=''A test case of the Afro-hispanic connection''|author=John Lipski|publisher=Personal.osu.edu|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a different paper, however, Lipski admits that the [[phonotactics]] of African languages might have reinforced, in Caribbean Spanish, the consonant reduction that was already taking place in Spanish from Southern Spain.&lt;ref name=Lipski2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/jml34/egt.pdf |format=PDF|title=''A new look at Afro-Hispanic Phonology: th case of Equatorial Guinea''|author=John Lipski|publisher=Personal.osu.edu|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1540">'''Fiachra Mac Brádaigh''' (c.1690–c.1760) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] poet and [[scribe]],

[[Mac Brádaigh]] was a descendant of one of the leading families of [[Breifne]]. A Gaelic poet and one of the finest products of, and teachers in, the [[hedge schools]] before the introduction of formal education. He is buried in Dunsandle in [[County Galway]], his adopted home.

His work has been described by [[Séamus P. Ó Mórdha]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He composed an Aisling, a Seachrán and a Faoistin as was expected of an 18th century poet but he invested each of them with a something of the exuberance and liveliness of his own personality. Some of the Northern Aislingí that have come down to us could have been written by any one of half a dozen poets but not so Mac Brádaigh. He puts the stamp of his own locality and of his own individuality on his compositions."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Gaj's Latin alphabet''' ({{lang-sh|abeceda, latinica}}, or ''gajica'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-sh|abetsěːda, latǐnitsa, ɡǎjitsa}}, {{IPA-sl|ˈɡáːjitsa|lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the form of the [[Latin script]] used for [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]. It was devised by [[Croatia]]n linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]] in 1835, based on [[Jan Hus]]'s [[Czech alphabet]]. A [[Slovene alphabet|slightly reduced version]] is used as the script of the [[Slovene language]], and a [[Montenegrin alphabet|slightly expanded version]] is used as a script of the modern standard [[Montenegrin language]]. A modified version is used for the [[Romanization of Macedonian|romanization]] of the [[Macedonian language]]. [[Pavao Ritter Vitezović]] had proposed an idea for the orthography of the Croatian language, stating that every sound should have only one letter. Gaj's alphabet is currently used in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Serbia]].

==Letters==
[[File:SrbLatAlphabet.png|300px|thumb|upright|Gaj's Latin alphabet omits 4 letters (q,w,x,y) from the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|ISO Basic Latin alphabet]].]]
The alphabet consists of thirty [[Capital letters|upper]] and [[Lower case|lower]] case letters:

&lt;/center&gt;
Gaj's original alphabet contained the digraph {{angbr|dj}}, which [[Serbian language|Serbian]] linguist [[Đuro Daničić]] later replaced with the letter {{angbr|đ}}.

The letters do not have names, and consonants are normally pronounced as such when spelling is necessary (or followed by a short [[schwa]], e.g. {{IPA|/fə/}}). When clarity is needed, they are pronounced similar to the [[German alphabet]]: ''a, be, ce, če, će, de, dže, đe, e, ef, ge, ha, i, je, ka, el, elj, em, en, enj, o, pe, er, es, eš, te, u, ve, ze, že''. These rules for pronunciation of individual letters are common as far as the 22 letters that match the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] are concerned. The use of others is mostly limited to the context of linguistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=50643&amp;lang=en | title = On some similarities and differences between Croatian and Slovakian | first1 = Margita | last1 = Žagarová | first2 = Ana | last2 = Pintarić | language = Croatian | pages = 129&amp;ndash;134 | journal = Linguistics | volume = 1 | number = 1 |date=July 1998 | accessdate = 2012-04-18 | publisher = Faculty of Philosophy, University of Osijek | issn = 1331-7202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffpu.hr/fileadmin/Dokumenti/Ortografija.pdf |language=Croatian |title=Ortografija |work=Jezične vježbe |publisher=Faculty of Philosophy, University of Pula |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314032923/http://www.ffpu.hr/fileadmin/Dokumenti/Ortografija.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in mathematics, {{angbr|j}} is commonly pronounced ''jot'', as in German. The missing four letters are pronounced as follows: {{angbr|q}} as ''ku'' or ''kju'', {{angbr|w}} as ''dublve'' or ''duplo ve'', {{angbr|x}} as ''iks'', {{angbr|y}} as ''ipsilon''.

==Digraphs==
Note that the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] [[dž]], [[Lj (letter)|lj]], and [[Nj (letter)|nj]] are considered to be single letters:
* In dictionaries, ''njegov'' comes after ''novine'', in a separate {{angbr|nj}} section after the end of the &lt;n&gt; section; ''bolje'' comes after ''bolnica''; and so forth.

|-
| &lt;small&gt;C&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;A&lt;/small&gt;
|}

*In vertical writing (such as on signs), {{angbr|dž}}, {{angbr|lj}}, {{angbr|nj}} are written horizontally, as a unit. For instance, if ''mjenjačnica'' ('[[bureau de change]]') is written vertically, {{angbr|nj}} appears on the fourth line (but note {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|j}} appear separately on the first and second lines, respectively, because {{angbr|mj}} contains two letters, not one). In [[crossword]] puzzles, {{angbr|dž}}, {{angbr|lj}}, {{angbr|nj}} each occupy a single square.
*If words are written with a space between each letter (such as on signs), each digraphs is written as a unit.  For instance: ''M J E NJ A Č N I C A''.
*If only the initial letter of a word is capitalized, only the first of the two component letters is capitalized: ''Njemačka'' ('[[Germany]]'), not ''NJemačka''. In [[Unicode]], the form {{angbr|Nj}} is referred to as ''[[titlecase]]'', as opposed to the uppercase form {{angbr|NJ}}, representing one of the few cases in which titlecase and uppercase differ. Uppercase would be used if the entire word was capitalized: ''NJEMAČKA''.

==Origins==
[[File:Ljudevit Gaj (Knjižnica Gajeva 1875).png|thumb|200px|left|Croatian linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]]]]

The Croatian Latin alphabet was mostly designed by [[Ljudevit Gaj]], who modelled it after [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], and invented {{angbr|lj}}, {{angbr|nj}} and {{angbr|dž}}. In 1830, he published in [[Buda (city)|Buda]] the book ''Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskog pravopisanja'' ("Brief basics of the Croatian-Slavonic orthography"), which was the first common Croatian [[orthography]] book. It was not the first ever Croatian orthography work, as it was preceded by works of Rajmund Đamanjić (1639), [[Ignjat Đurđević]] and [[Pavao Ritter Vitezović]]. Croats had previously used the Latin script, but some of the specific sounds were not uniformly represented. Versions of the [[Hungarian alphabet]] were most commonly used, but others were too, in an often confused, inconsistent fashion.

Gaj followed the example of Pavao Ritter Vitezović and the [[Czech alphabet|Czech orthography]], making one letter of the Latin script for each sound in the language. His alphabet mapped completely on [[Serbian Cyrillic]] which had been standardized by [[Vuk Karadžić]] a few years before.&lt;ref name="ComrieCorbett2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Comrie|first1=Bernard|authorlink1=Bernard Comrie|last2=Corbett|first2=Greville G.|title=The Slavonic Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRF9Yiso1OIC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-21320-9|page=45|quote=... following Vuk's reform of Cyrillic (see above) in the early nineteenth century, Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s performed the same operation on Latinica,...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Đuro Daničić]] suggested in his ''Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'' ("Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian language") published in 1880 that Gaj's digraphs {{angbr|dž}}, {{angbr|dj}}, {{angbr|lj}} and {{angbr|nj}} should be replaced by single letters : {{angbr|ģ}}, {{angbr|đ}}, {{angbr|ļ}} and {{angbr|ń}} respectively. The original Gaj alphabet was eventually revised, but only the digraph {{angbr|dj}} has been replaced with Daničić's {{angbr|đ}}, while {{angbr|dž}}, {{angbr|lj}} and {{angbr|nj}} have been kept. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Computing==
In the 1990s, there was a general confusion about the proper [[character encoding]] to use to write text in Latin Croatian on computers.

*An attempt was made to apply the 7-bit "[[YUSCII]]", later "CROSCII", which included the five letters with diacritics at the expense of five non-letter characters ([, ], {, }, @), but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Because the ASCII character @ sorts before A, this led to jokes calling it ''žabeceda'' (''žaba''=frog, ''abeceda''=alphabet).
*Other short-lived vendor-specific efforts were also undertaken.{{which|date=July 2010}}
*The [[8-bit]] [[ISO 8859-2]] (Latin-2) standard was developed by ISO.
*[[MS-DOS]] introduced 8-bit encoding [[Code page 852|CP852]] for Central European languages, disregarding the ISO standard.
*[[Microsoft Windows]] spread yet another 8-bit encoding called [[CP1250]], which had a few letters mapped one-to-one with ISO 8859-2, but also had some mapped elsewhere.
*[[Apple computer|Apple]]'s [[Macintosh Central European encoding]] does not include the entire Gaj's Latin alphabet. Instead, a separate codepage, called [[MacCroatian encoding]], is used.
*[[EBCDIC]] also has a Latin-2 encoding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pcomhelp/v5r9/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pcomm.doc/reference/html/hcp_reference44.htm Host Code Page 1153/1375 Latin 2 – EBCDIC Multilingual]{{Clear}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The preferred [[character encoding]] for Croatian today is either the [[ISO 8859-2]], or the [[Unicode]] encoding [[UTF-8]] (with two bytes or 16 bits necessary to use the letters with diacritics). However, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, one can still find programs as well as databases that use [[CP1250]], [[Code page 852|CP852]] or even CROSCII.

Digraphs {{angbr|dž}}, {{angbr|lj}} and {{angbr|nj}} in their upper case, title case and lower case forms have dedicated UNICODE code points as shown in the table below, However, these are included chiefly for backwards compatibility (with legacy encodings which kept a one-to-one correspondence with Cyrillic); modern texts use a sequence of characters.

==Usage for Slovene==
Since the early 1840s, Gaj's alphabet was increasingly used for the [[Slovene language]]. In the beginning, it was most commonly used by Slovene authors who treated Slovene as a variant of Serbo-Croatian (such as [[Stanko Vraz]]), but it was later accepted by a large spectrum of Slovene-writing authors. The breakthrough came in 1845, when the Slovene conservative leader [[Janez Bleiweis]] started using Gaj's script in his journal ''[[Kmetijske in rokodelske novice]]'' ("Agricultural and Artisan News"), which was read by a wide public in the countryside. By 1850, Gaj's alphabet (known as ''gajica'' in Slovene) became the only official [[Slovene alphabet]], replacing three other writing systems which circulated in the [[Slovene Lands]] since the 1830s: the traditional ''[[bohoričica]]'' (after [[Adam Bohorič]] who codified it) and the two innovative proposals by the [[Peter Dajnko]] (the ''[[dajnčica]]'') and [[Franc Serafin Metelko]] (the ''[[metelčica]]'').

The Slovene version of Gaj's alphabet differs from the Serbo-Croatian one in several ways:
*The Slovene alphabet does not have the characters {{angbr|ć}} and {{angbr|đ}}; the sounds they represent do not occur in Slovene.
*In Slovene, the digraphs {{angbr|lj}} and {{angbr|nj}} are treated as two separate letters and represent separate sounds (the word [[polje]] is pronounced {{IPA-sl|ˈpóːljɛ|}} or {{IPA-sl|pɔˈljéː|}} in Slovene, as opposed to {{IPA-sh|pôʎe|}} in Serbo-Croatian).
*While the phoneme {{IPA|/dʒ/}} exists in modern Slovene and is written {{angbr|dž}}, it is used in only borrowed words and so {{angbr|d}} and {{angbr|ž}} are considered separate letters, not a digraph.

Slovene orthography is comparatively less phonetic than Serbo-Croatian {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. For instance, letter {{angbr|e}} can be pronounced in four ways ({{IPA|/eː/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}), and letter {{angbr|v}} in two ({{IPA|[ʋ]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, though the difference is not [[phoneme|phonemic]]). Also, it does not record consonant voicing assimilation: compare e.g. Slovene {{angbr|odpad}} and Serbo-Croatian {{angbr|otpad}} ('junkyard', 'waste').

==Usage in Macedonian==
{{Main|Romanization of Macedonian}}

[[Romanization]] of [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] is done according to Gaj's Latin alphabet&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, H. (1952), Grammar of the Macedonian literary language, Skopje.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macedonian Latin alphabet, Pravopis na makedonskiot literaturen jazik, B. Vidoeski, T. Dimitrovski, K. Koneski, K. Tošev, R. Ugrinova Skalovska - Prosvetno delo Skopje, 1970, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; but is slightly modified. Gaj's ''ć'' and ''đ'' are not used at all, with ''ḱ'' and ''ǵ'' introduced instead. The rest of the letters of the alphabet are used to represent the equivalent Cyrillic letters. Also, Macedonian uses the letter ''dz'', which is not part of the Serbo-Croatian phonemic inventory. However, the backs of record sleeves published in the former [[Yugoslavia]], by non-Macedonian publishers, (such as [[Mizar (album)|Mizar's debut album]]) used ''ć'' and ''đ'', like other places.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39085">In [[historical linguistics]] and [[language change]], '''grammaticalization''' (also known as '''grammatization''' or '''grammaticization''') is a process of language change by which words representing objects and actions (i.e. [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s) become grammatical markers ([[affix]]es, [[preposition]]s, etc.). Thus it creates new [[function words]] by a process other than deriving them from existing [[bound morpheme|bound]], [[inflection]]al constructions, instead deriving them from [[content word]]s. For example, the [[Old English]] verb ''willan'' 'to want', 'to wish' has become the [[Modern English]] auxiliary verb ''will'', which expresses intention or simply [[future tense|futurity]]. Some concepts are often grammaticalized, while others, such as [[evidentiality]], not so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wals.info/chapter/78 |title=WALS Online - Chapter Coding of Evidentiality |website=wals.info |language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an understanding of this process, a distinction needs to be made between [[lexical items]], or content words, which carry specific lexical meaning, and grammatical items, or function words, with little or no lexical meaning, which serve to express grammatical relationships between the different words in an utterance. Grammaticalization has been defined as "the change whereby lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions, and, once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions".&lt;ref&gt;Hopper &amp; Traugott 2003, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply said, grammaticalization is the process in which a [[lexical word]] or a word cluster loses some or all of its lexical meaning and starts to fulfil a more grammatical function. Where grammaticalization takes place, nouns and verbs which carry certain lexical meaning develop over time into grammatical items such as [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], [[marker (linguistics)|case markers]], inflections, and [[sentence connectives]].

A well-known example of grammaticalization is that of the process in which the lexical cluster ''let us'', for example in "let us eat",  is reduced to ''let's'' as in "let's you and me fight". Here, the phrase has lost its lexical meaning of "allow us" and has become an auxiliary introducing a suggestion, the pronoun 'us' reduced first to a suffix and then to an unanalyzed phoneme.

Another example of grammaticalization occurs in [[American English]] with ''sure'', where it is used in routine phrases and as a response. It also features in many collocations, such as ''sure do'', ''sure can'' and ''sure is''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohdenburg|first1=edited by Günter|last2=Schlüter|first2=Julia|title=One language, two grammars? : differences between British and American English|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-87219-5|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept was developed in the works of [[Franz Bopp|Bopp]] (1816), Schlegel (1818), [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]] (1825) and [[Georg von der Gabelentz|Gabelentz]] (1891). Humboldt, for instance, came up with the idea of evolutionary language. He suggested that in all languages grammatical structures evolved out of a language stage in which there were only words for concrete objects and ideas. In order to successfully communicate these ideas, grammatical structures slowly came into existence. Grammar slowly developed through four different stages, each in which the grammatical structure would be more developed. Though [[neo-grammarians]] like [[Karl Brugmann|Brugmann]] rejected the separation of language into distinct "stages" in favour of [[uniformitarian]] assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;Harris &amp; Campbell 1995, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; they were positively inclined towards some of these earlier linguists' hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann 1995, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "grammaticalization" in the modern sense was coined by the French linguist [[Antoine Meillet]] in his ''L'évolution des formes grammaticales'' (1912). Meillet's definition was "the attribution of grammatical character to an erstwhile autonomous word".&lt;ref&gt;Hopper and Traugott 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Meillet showed that what was at issue was not the origins of grammatical forms but their transformations. He was thus able to present a notion of the creation of grammatical forms as a legitimate study for linguistics. Later studies in the field have further developed and altered Meillet's ideas and have introduced many other examples of grammaticalization.

During the second half of the twentieth century, the study of grammatical change over time became somewhat unfashionable{{attribution needed|date=March 2012}}, in contrast to [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] ideas of language change in which grammaticalization did not play a role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The field of [[linguistics]] at the time was strongly concerned with [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] studies of language change, which marginalized historical approaches such as grammaticalization. It did however, mostly in [[Indo-European studies]], remain an instrument for explaining language change.

It was not until the 1970s, with the growth of interest in [[discourse analysis]] and [[linguistic universals]], that the interest for grammaticalization in linguistic studies began to grow again. A greatly influential work in the domain was [[Christian Lehmann]]'s ''Thoughts on Grammaticalization'' (1982). This was the first work to emphasize the continuity of research from the earliest period to the present, and it provided a survey of the major work in the field.  Lehmann also invented a set of 'parameters', a method along which [[grammaticality]] could be measured both synchronically and diachronically.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper and Traugott 2003, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important work was [[Bernd Heine|Heine]] and [[Mechthild Reh|Reh's]] ''Grammaticalization and Reanalysis in African Languages'' (1984). This work focussed on [[African languages]] synchronically from the point of view of grammaticalization. They saw grammaticalization as an important tool for describing the workings of languages and their universal aspects and it provided an exhaustive list of the pathways of grammaticalization.

The great number of studies on grammaticalization in the last decade show grammaticalization remains a popular item and is regarded as an important field within linguistic studies in general. Among recent publications there is a wide range of [[descriptive]] studies trying to come up with umbrella definitions and exhaustive lists, while others tend to focus more on its nature and significance, questioning the opportunities and boundaries of grammaticalization. An important and popular topic which is still debated is the question of unidirectionality.

==Mechanisms==
It is difficult to capture the term "grammaticalization" in one clear definition (see the 'various views on grammaticalization' section below). However, there are some processes that are often linked to grammaticalization. These are [[#Semantic_bleaching|semantic bleaching]], [[#Phonetic_erosion|phonetic erosion]], [[#Morphological_reduction|morphological reduction]] and [[#Obligatorification|obligatorification]].

===Semantic bleaching===
Semantic bleaching, or desemanticization, has been seen from early on as a characteristic of grammaticalization. It can be described as the loss of semantic content. More specifically, with reference to grammaticalization, bleaching refers to the loss of all (or most) lexical content of an entity while only its grammatical content is retained,&lt;ref&gt;Heine 1993, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[James Matisoff]] described bleaching as "the partial effacement of a morpheme's semantic features, the stripping away of some of its precise content so it can be used in an abstracter, grammatical-hardware-like way".&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff 1991, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Haiman]] wrote that "semantic reduction, or bleaching, occurs as a morpheme loses its intention: From describing a narrow set of ideas, it comes to describe an ever broader range of them, and eventually may lose its meaning altogether".&lt;ref&gt;Haiman 1991, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  He saw this as one of the two kinds of change that are always associated with grammaticalization (the other being phonetic reduction).

===Morphological reduction===
Once a [[natural language|linguistic]] expression has changed from a [[Content word|lexical]] to a [[Grammatical word|grammatical]] meaning (bleaching), it is likely to lose [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntactic]] elements that were characteristic of its initial category, but which are not relevant to the [[grammatical function]].&lt;ref&gt;Heine &amp; Kuteva 2007, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called ''[[De-categorialization|decategorialization]],'' or ''morphological reduction''.

For example, the [[demonstrative]] 'that' as in "that book" came to be used as a [[relative clause]] marker, and lost the grammatical category of  [[Grammatical number|number]] ('that' singular vs. 'those' plural), as in "the book that I know" versus "the things that I know".

===Phonetic erosion===
Phonetic erosion (also called phonological attrition or phonological reduction), is another process that is often linked to grammaticalization. It implies that a linguistic expression loses [[phonetic]] substance when it has undergone grammaticalization. Heine writes that "once a [[lexeme]] is conventionalized as a [[grammatical marker]], it tends to undergo erosion; that is, the [[phonological]] substance is likely to be reduced in some way and to become more dependent on surrounding [[phonetic]] material".&lt;ref&gt;Heine 1993, p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernd Heine]] and [[Tania Kuteva]] have described different kinds of phonetic erosion for applicable cases:

# Loss of phonetic segments, including loss of full syllables.
# Loss of suprasegmental properties, such as stress, tone, or intonation.
# Loss of phonetic autonomy and adaptation to adjacent phonetic units.
# Phonetic simplification

'Going to' → 'gonna' (or even 'I am going to' → 'I'm gonna' → 'I'mma') and 'because' → 'coz' are examples of erosion in English. Some linguists trace erosion to the speaker's tendency to follow the principle of least effort, while others think that erosion is a sign of changes taking place.

However, phonetic erosion, a common process of language change that can take place with no connection to grammaticalization, is not a necessary property of grammaticalization.&lt;ref&gt;Lessau 1994, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Latin construction of the type ''clarā mente'', meaning 'with a clear mind' is the source of modern Romance productive adverb formation, as in Italian ''chiaramente'', Spanish ''claramente'' 'clearly'. In both languages, -''mente'' in this usage is interpretable by today's native speakers only as a morpheme signaling 'adverb' and it has undergone no phonological erosion from the Latin source, ''mente''. This example also illustrates that semantic bleaching of a form in its grammaticalized morphemic role does not necessarily imply bleaching of its lexical source, and that the two can separate neatly in spite of maintaining identical phonological form: the noun ''mente'' is alive and well today in both Italian and Spanish with its meaning 'mind', yet native speakers do not recognize the noun 'mind' in the suffix ''-mente''.

The phonetic erosion may bring a brand-new look to the phonological system of a language, by changing the inventory of phones and phonemes, making new arrangements in the phonotactic patterns of a syllable, etc. Special treatise on the phonological consequences of grammaticalization and lexicalization in the Chinese languages can be found in [[Wei-Heng Chen]](2011), which provides evidence how an morph-phonological change can later change into a purely phonological change and evidence that there is typological difference in the phonetic and phonological consequences of grammaticalization between [[monosyllabic language]]s (featuring an obligatory match between [[syllable]] and [[morpheme]], with exceptions of either loanwords or derivations like [[Reduplication|reduplicative]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or [[diminutive]]s, other morphological alternations) vs non-monosyllabic languages (including [[disyllabic]] or bisyllabic Austronesian languages, [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] languages featuring a [[Tri-consonantal root|tri-consonantal]] word root, [[Indo-European languages]] without a 100% obligatory match between such a sound unit as syllable and such a meaning unit as morpheme or word, despite an assume majority of monosyllabic reconstructed word stems/roots in the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] hypothesis), a difference mostly initiated by the German linguist [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|W. Humboldt]], putting [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages in a sharp contrast to the other languages in the world in typology.

===Obligatorification===
Obligatorification occurs when the use of linguistic structures becomes increasingly more obligatory in the process of grammaticalization.&lt;ref&gt;Heine &amp; Kuteva 2007, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehmann describes it as a reduction in transparadigmatic variability, by which he means that "the freedom of the language user with regard to the paradigm as a whole" is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann 2002, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of obligatoriness can be found in the category of number, which can be obligatory in some languages or in specific contexts, in the development of articles, and in the development of [[personal pronouns]] of some languages. Some linguists, like Heine and Kuteva, stress the fact that even though obligatorification can be seen as an important process, it is not necessary for grammaticalization to take place, and it also occurs in other types of language change.&lt;ref&gt;Heine &amp; Kuteva 2007, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these 'parameters of grammaticalization' are often linked to the theory, linguists such as [[Joan Bybee|Bybee]] et al. (1994) have acknowledged that independently, they are not essential to grammaticalization. In addition, most are not limited to grammaticalization but can be applied in the wider context of language change. Critics of the theory of grammaticalization have used these difficulties to claim that grammaticalization has no independent status of its own, that all processes involved can be described separately from the theory of grammaticalization. Janda, for example, wrote that "given that even writers on grammaticalization themselves freely acknowledge the involvement of several distinct processes in the larger set of phenomena, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the notion of grammaticalization, too, tends to represent an epiphenomenal telescoping. That is, it may involve certain typical "path(way)s", but the latter seem to be built out of separate stepping-stones which can often be seen in isolation and whose individual outlines are always distinctly recognizable".&lt;ref&gt;Janda , p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clines of grammaticality - cycles of categorial downgrading==
In the process of grammaticalization, an uninflected lexical word (or content word) is transformed into a grammar word (or [[function word]]). The process by which the word leaves its [[word class]] and enters another is not sudden, but occurs by a gradual series of individual shifts. The overlapping stages of grammaticalization form a chain, generally called a [[Cline (linguistics)|cline]]. These shifts generally follow similar patterns in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper and Traugott 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists do not agree on the precise definition of a cline or on its exact characteristics in given instances. It is believed that the stages on the cline do not always have a fixed position, but vary. However, Hopper and [[Elizabeth C. Traugott|Traugott]]'s famous pattern for the cline of grammaticalization illustrates the various stages of the form:

:[[content word]] &amp;rarr; [[grammatical word]] &amp;rarr; [[clitic]] &amp;rarr; [[inflectional]] [[affix]]

This particular cline is called "the cline of grammaticality"&lt;ref&gt;Hopper and Traugott 2003, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; or the "cycle of categorial downgrading",&lt;ref&gt;Givon 1971, Reighard 1978, Wittmann 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a common one. In this cline every item to the right represents a more [[grammatical]] and less [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] form than the one to its left.

=== English ''will'' ===
It is very common for full verbs to become [[auxiliaries]] and eventually inflexional endings. An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the change from the [[Old English]] (OE) [[verb]] willan ('to want/to wish') to an auxiliary verb signifying intention in [[Middle English]] (ME). In [[Present Day English]] (PDE) this form is even shortened to 'll, and no longer necessarily implies intention, but often is simply a mark of future tense (see [[shall and will]]). The PDE verb 'will' can thus be said to have less lexical meaning than its preceding form in OE.&lt;ref&gt;Aitchison 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Content word: [[Old English]] ''willan'' (to want/to wish)
* Grammatical word: [[Middle English]] and [[Modern English]] will, e.g. "I '''will''' go to the market"; auxiliary expressing intention, lacking many features of [[English verb]]s such as an inflected past tense (it is ungrammatical to say, e.g. *I '''will'''ed go to the market).
** [[Present Day English]] will, e.g. "I '''will''' see you later"; auxiliary expressing futurity but not necessarily intention (similar in meaning to "I am '''gonna''' see you later")
* Clitic: [[Present Day English]] 'll, e.g. "My friends''''ll''' be there this evening." This clitic form phonologically adapts to its surroundings and cannot receive [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] unlike the uncontracted form.
* Inflexional suffix: This has not occurred in English, but hypothetically ''will'' could become further grammaticalized to the point where it forms an inflexional affix indicating future tense.

=== Examples of full grammaticalization ===
The final stage of grammaticalization has happened in many languages. For example, in [[Serbo-Croatian]], the [[Old Church Slavonic]] verb ''xъtěti'' (to want/to wish, the same as Old English ''willan'') has gone from a content word (''hoću hoditi, hoćeš hoditi, hoće hoditi'' 'I/you/s/he wants to walk') to an auxiliary verb in phonetically reduced form (''ću hoditi, ćeš hoditi, će hoditi'' 'I/you/s/he will walk') to a clitic (''hoditi ću, hoditi ćeš, hoditi će''), and finally to a fused inflection (''hodiću, hodićeš, hodiće'' 'I/you/s/he will walk'). In Latin the original future tense forms (e.g. cantabo) were dropped when they became phonetically too close to the imperfect forms (cantabam). Instead, a phrase like ''cantare habeo'', literally ''I have got to sing'' acquired the sense of futurity (cf. I have to sing). Finally it became true future tense in almost all Romance languages and the auxiliary became a full-fledged inflection (cf. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''cantaré, cantarás, cantará'', [[French language|French]] je ''chanterai, tu chanteras, il/elle chantera'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''canterò, canterai, canterà'', I will sing, you will sing, s/he will sing). In some verbs the process went further and produced irregular forms [cf. Spanish ''[[wikt:hacer#Spanish|haré]]'' (instead of *''haceré'', I'll do) and ''[[wikt:tener#Spanish|tendré]]'' (not *''teneré'', I'll have, the loss of ''e'' followed by epenthesis of ''d'' is especially common)] and even regular forms (the change the ''a'' in the stem ''{{wt|it|cantare}}'' to ''e'' in ''canterò'' has affected the whole class of conjugation type I Italian verbs).

Compare the [[German language|German]] verb ''[[wikt:wollen#German|wollen]]'' which has partially undergone a similar path of grammaticalization, and note the simultaneous existence of the non-grammaticalized Modern English verb ''to will'' (e.g. "He '''will'''ed himself to continue along the steep path.") or ''hoteti'' in Serbo-Croatian (''Hoċu da hodim'' = I want that I walk).

=== Japanese compound verbs ===
An illustrative example of this cline is in the orthography of Japanese [[compound verb]]s. Many Japanese words are formed by connecting two verbs, as in {{Nihongo|"go and ask"|行って聞く|ittekiku}}, and in Japanese orthography lexical items are generally written with [[kanji]] (here 行く and 聞く), while grammatical items are written with [[hiragana]] (as in the connecting て). Compound verbs are thus generally written with a kanji for each constituent verb, but some suffixes have become grammaticalized, and are written in hiragana, such as {{Nihongo|"try out, see"|〜みる|-miru}}, from {{Nihongo|"see"|見る|miru}}, as in {{Nihongo|"try eating (it) and see"|食べてみる|tabetemiru}}.

=== Historical linguistics ===
In ''Grammaticalization'' (2003) Hopper and [[Elizabeth C. Traugott|Traugott]] state that the cline of grammaticalization has both diachronic and synchronic implications. Diachronically (i.e. looking at changes over time), clines represent a natural path along which forms or words change over time. However, synchronically (i.e. looking at a single point in time), clines can be seen as an arrangement of forms along imaginary lines, with at one end a 'fuller' or lexical form and at the other a more 'reduced' or grammatical form.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper and Traugott 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; What Hopper and Traugott mean is that from a diachronic or historical point of view, changes of word forms is seen as a natural process, whereas synchronically, this process can be seen as inevitable instead of historical.

The studying and documentation of recurrent [[cline (linguistics)|cline]]s enable linguists to form general laws of grammaticalization and language change in general. It plays an important role in the reconstruction of older states of a language. Moreover, the documenting of changes can help to reveal the lines along which a language is likely to develop in the future.

==Unidirectionality hypothesis==
The [[unidirectionality hypothesis]] is the idea that grammaticalization, the development of [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] elements into [[grammatical]] ones, or less grammatical into more grammatical, is the preferred direction of linguistic change, that a grammatical item is much less likely to move backwards rather than forwards on Hopper &amp; [[Elizabeth C. Traugott|Traugott]]'s cline of grammaticalization.&lt;ref name="bisangmalchukov"&gt;{{Cite book

In the words of [[Bernd Heine]], "grammaticalization is a unidirectional process, that is, it leads from less grammatical to more grammatical forms and constructions".&lt;ref&gt;Heine &amp; Kuteva 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the strongest claims about grammaticalization, and is often cited as one of its basic principles. In addition, unidirectionality refers to a general developmental orientation which all (or the large majority) of the cases of grammaticalization have in common, and which can be paraphrased in abstract, general terms, independent of any specific case.&lt;ref&gt;Lessau 1994, p. 885.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of unidirectionality is an important one when trying to predict language change through grammaticalization (and for making the claim that grammaticalization can be predicted). [[Lessau]] notes that "unidirectionality in itself is a predictive assertion in that it selects the general type of possible development (it predicts the direction of any given incipient case)," and unidirectionality also rules out an entire range of development types that do not follow this principle, hereby limiting the amount of possible paths of development.&lt;ref&gt;Lessau 1994, p. 886.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterexamples (degrammaticalization) ===
Although unidirectionality is a key element of grammaticalization, it is not absolute. Indeed, the possibility of counterexamples, coupled with their rarity, is given as evidence for the general operating principle of unidirectionality. According to [[Lyle Campbell]], however, advocates often minimize the counterexamples or redefine them as not being part of the grammaticalization cline.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2000, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He gives the example of [[Paul Hopper|Hopper]] and [[Elizabeth C. Traugott|Traugott]] (1993) who treat some putative counterexamples as cases of lexicalization in which a grammatical form is incorporated into a lexical item but does not itself become a lexical item. An example is the phrase ''to up the ante,'' which incorporates the preposition ''up'' (a function word) in a verb (a content word) but without ''up'' becoming a verb outside of this lexical item. Since it is the entire phrase ''to up the ante'' that is the verb, Hopper and Traugott argue that the word ''up'' itself cannot be said to have degrammaticalized, a view that is challenged to some extent by parallel usages such as ''to up the bid'', ''to up the payment'', ''to up the deductions'', ''to up the medication'', by the fact that in all cases  ''the'' can be replaced by a possessive (my, your, her, Bill's, etc.), and by further extensions still: ''he upped his game'' 'he improved his performance'.

Examples that are not confined to a specific lexical item are less common. One is the English [[genitive]] -'s, which, in [[Old English]], was a suffix but, in Modern English, is a clitic. As Jespersen (1894) put it,
{{quote|In [[Modern English]]...(compared to OE) the -s is much more independent: it can be separated from its main word by an adverb such as else (somebody else's hat ), by a prepositional clause such as of England (the queen of England's power ), or even by a relative clause such as I saw yesterday (the man I saw yesterday's car)...the English genitive is in fact no longer a flexional form...historically attested facts show us in the most unequivocal way a development - not, indeed, from an originally self-existent word to a mere flexional ending, but the exactly opposite development of what was an inseparable part of a complicated [[flexional system]] to greater and greater emancipation and independence.&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Campbell 2001, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Traugott cites a counterexample from function to content word proposed by [[Kate Burridge]] (1998): the development in [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] of the auxiliary ''wotte'' of the preterite subjunctive [[Modal verb|modal]] ''welle'' 'would' (from 'wanted') into a full verb 'to wish, to desire'.&lt;ref&gt;Traugott 2001, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to various instances of grammaticalization, there are relatively few counterexamples to the unidirectionality hypothesis, and they often seem to require special circumstances to occur. One is found in the development of [[Irish Gaelic]] with the origin of the first-person-plural pronoun ''muid'' (a function word) from the inflectional suffix ''-mid'' (as in ''táimid'' 'we are') because of a reanalysis based on the verb-pronoun order of the other persons of the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Norde 2009, p. 204–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is the degrammaticalization of the North Saami abessive ('without') case suffix -''haga'' to the postposition ''haga'' 'without' and further to a preposition and a free-standing adverb.&lt;ref&gt;Norde 2009, p. 207–209; Ylikoski 2016, p. 119–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the morphologically analogous derivational suffix -''naga'' 'stained with' (e.g., ''gáffenaga'' 'stained with coffee', ''oljonaga'' 'stained with oil') – itself based on the essive case marker *-''na'' – has degrammaticalized into an independent noun ''naga'' 'stain'.&lt;ref&gt;Ylikoski 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on grammaticalization==
Linguists have come up with different interpretation of the term 'grammaticalization', and there are many alternatives to the definition given in the introduction. The following will be a non-exhaustive list of authors who have written about the subject with their individual approaches to the nature of the term 'grammaticalization'.

*[[Antoine Meillet]] (1912): "Tandis que l'analogie peut renouveler le détail des formes, mais laisse le plus souvent intact le plan d'ensemble du système grammatical, la 'grammaticalisation' de certains mots crée des formes neuves, introduit des catégories qui n'avaient pas d'expression linguistique, transforme l'ensemble du système." ("While the analogy can renew the detail of the forms, but often leaves untouched the overall plan of the grammatical system, the 'grammaticalization' of certain words creates new forms, introduces categories for which there was no linguistical expression, and transforms the whole of the system.")
* [[Jerzy Kurylowicz]] (1965): His "classical" definition is probably the one most often referred to: "Grammaticalization consists in the increase of the range of a morpheme advancing from a lexical to a grammatical or from a less grammatical to a more grammatical status, e.g. from a derivative formant to an inflectional one".&lt;ref&gt;Kurylowicz 1975, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the study of grammaticalization has become broader, and linguists have extended the term into various directions.

* [[Christian Lehmann]] (1982): Writer of ''Thoughts on Grammaticalization'' and ''New Reflections on Grammaticalization and Lexicalization'', wrote that "Grammaticalization is a process leading from [[lexeme]]s to [[grammar|grammatical]] formatives. A number of [[semantics|semantic]], [[syntax|syntactic]] and [[phonology|phonological]] processes interact in the grammaticalization of morphemes and of whole constructions. A sign is grammaticalized to the extent that it is devoid of concrete [[lexicon|lexical]] meaning and takes part in obligatory grammatical rules".&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann 1982, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paul Hopper]] (1991): Hopper defined the five 'principles' by which you can detect grammaticalization while it is taking place: [[layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialization]], [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]], and [[de-categorialization|decategorization]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopper 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[František Lichtenberk]] (1991): In his article on "The Gradualness of Grammaticalization", he defined grammaticalization as "a historical process, a kind of change that has certain consequences for the morphosyntactic categories of a language and thus for the grammar of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 1991, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James A. Matisoff]] (1991): Matisoff used the term '[[metaphor]]' to describe grammaticalization when he wrote: "Grammatization may also be viewed as a subtype of metaphor (etymologically "carrying beyond"), our most general term for a meaning shift. […] Grammaticalization is a metaphorical shift toward the abstract, "metaphor" being defined as an originally conscious or voluntary shift in a word's meaning because of some perceived similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Matifsoff 1991, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elizabeth Traugott]] &amp; [[Bernd Heine]] (1991): Together, they edited a two-volume collection of papers from a 1988 conference organized by Talmy Givón under the title ''Approaches to Grammaticaliztion''. They defined grammaticalization as "a linguistic process, both through time and synchronically, of organization of categories and of [[Coding (social sciences)|coding]]. The study of grammaticalization therefore highlights the tension between relatively unconstrained lexical expression and more constrained morphosyntactic coding, and points to relative indeterminacy in language and to the basic non-discreteness of categories".&lt;ref&gt;Traugott &amp; Heine 1991, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Olga Fischer]] &amp; [[Anette Rosenbach]] (2000): In the introduction of their book ''Pathways of Change'', a summary is given of recent approaches to grammaticalization. "The term 'grammaticalization' is today used in various ways. In a fairly loose sense, 'grammaticalized' often simply refers to the fact that a form or construction has become fixed and obligatory. (…) In a stricter sense, however, (…) the notion of 'grammaticalization' is first and foremost a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] process with certain typical mechanisms."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer &amp; Rosenbach 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lyle Campbell]] lists proposed counterexamples in his article "What's wrong with grammaticalization?". In the same issue of ''[[Language Sciences]],'' Richard D. Janda cites over 70 works critical of the unidirectionality hypothesis in his article "Beyond 'pathways' and 'unidirectionality'".
* A brief summary and review of the current state of research on the lexicalization/degrammaticalization sub-branch, including the most recent developments between 2000 and 2010, is provided by this paper on degrammaticalization.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner. 2010. Expanding the Definition of Grammaticalization.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first monograph on degrammaticalization and its relation to grammaticalization was published in 2009 by Muriel Norde.&lt;ref&gt;Norde 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sahitya Akademi Award]]''' is given each year, since 1955, by [[Sahitya Akademi]] (India's National Academy of Letters), to writers and their works, for their outstanding contribution to the upliftment of [[Indian literature]] and [[Konkani literature]] in particular.&lt;ref name=sahitya&gt;[http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/awards/akademi_awards.jsp :: SAHITYA : Akademi Awards ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akademi Awards (1955-2015)|url=http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/awards/akademi%20samman_suchi.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084937/http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/awards/akademi%20samman_suchi.jsp|archive-date=4 March 2016|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Sahitya Akademi recognised Konkani in 1975 as an independent and literary language, one of the important factors was the literary heritage of [[Romi Konkani]] since the year 1556. However, after Konkani in the [[Devanagari]] script was made the official language of [[Goa]] in 1987, the Sahitya Akademi has supported only writers in the Devanagari script.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4990">In [[mathematics]], the '''Littlewood conjecture''' is an [[open problem]] ({{As of|2016|lc=on}}) in [[Diophantine approximation]], proposed by [[John Edensor Littlewood]] around 1930. It states that for any two [[real number]]s α and β,

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} \ n\,\Vert n\alpha\Vert \,\Vert n\beta\Vert = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Vert \,\Vert&lt;/math&gt; is here the distance to the nearest integer.

==Formulation and explanation==

This means the following: take a point (α,β) in the plane, and then consider the sequence of points

:(2α,2β), (3α,3β), ... .

For each of these, multiply the distance to the closest line with integer x-coordinate by the distance to the closest line with integer y-coordinate. This product will certainly be at most 1/4. The conjecture makes no statement about whether this sequence of values will [[Convergence (mathematics)|converge]]; it typically does not, in fact. The conjecture states something about the [[Limit superior and limit inferior|limit inferior]], and says that there is a subsequence for which the distances decay faster than the reciprocal, i.e.

:o(1/''n'')

in the [[Big O notation#Little-o notation|little-o notation]].

==Connection to further conjectures==

It is known that this would follow from a result in the [[geometry of numbers]], about the minimum on a non-zero [[lattice (group)|lattice]] point of a product of three linear forms in three real variables: the implication was shown in 1955 by [[J. W. S. Cassels]] and [[Swinnerton-Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.W.S. Cassels |author2=H.P.F. Swinnerton-Dyer | title=On the product of three homogeneous linear forms and the indefinite ternary quadratic forms | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | volume=248 | issue=940 | date=1955-06-23 | pages=73–96 | doi=10.1098/rsta.1955.0010 | jstor=91633 | mr = 70653 |zbl=0065.27905| bibcode=1955RSPTA.248...73C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be formulated another way, in group-theoretic terms. There is now another conjecture, expected to hold for ''n'' ≥ 3: it is stated in terms of ''G'' = ''SL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R''), Γ = ''SL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Z''), and the subgroup ''D'' of [[diagonal matrices]] in ''G''.

'''''Conjecture''''': for any ''g'' in ''G''/Γ such that ''Dg'' is [[relatively compact]] (in ''G''/Γ), then ''Dg'' is closed.

This in turn is a special case of a general conjecture of [[Grigory Margulis|Margulis]] on [[Lie group]]s.

==Partial results==
Borel showed in 1909 that the exceptional set of real pairs (α,β) violating the statement of the conjecture is of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.&lt;ref name=AB444&gt;Adamczewski &amp; Bugeaud (2010) p.444&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred Einsiedler]], [[Anatole Katok]] and [[Elon Lindenstrauss]] have shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Einsiedler |author2=A. Katok |author3=E. Lindenstrauss | title=Invariant measures and the set of exceptions to Littlewood's conjecture | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=164 | issue=2 | pages=513–560 | date=2006-09-01 | doi=10.4007/annals.2006.164.513 | arxiv=math.DS/0612721 | mr = 2247967 |zbl=1109.22004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it must have [[Hausdorff dimension]] zero;&lt;ref name=AB445&gt;Adamczewski &amp; Bugeaud (2010) p.445&lt;/ref&gt; and in fact is a union of countably many [[Compact space|compact set]]s of [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]] zero. The result was proved by using measure classification theorem for diagonalizable actions of higher-rank groups, and an ''isolation theorem'' proved by Lindenstrauss and Barak Weiss.

These results imply that non-trivial pairs satisfying the conjecture exist: indeed, given a real number α such that &lt;math&gt;\inf_{n \ge 1} n \cdot || n \alpha || &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to construct an explicit β such that (α,β) satisfies the conjecture.&lt;ref name=AB446&gt;Adamczewski &amp; Bugeaud (2010) p.446&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manifesto to the Polish Nation''', also called the '''Manifesto of Grand Duke Nicholas''' or '''Manifesto of the 14th August 1914'''; {{lang-pl|Odezwa Wielkiego Księcia Mikołaja Mikołajewicza}} was a proclamation by [[Grand Duke Nicholas]], commander in chief of the Russian armies to Poles on 14 August 1914 after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Nicholas, proclaiming that though 'a hundred and fifty years ago the living body of Poland was torn to pieces, [...] her soul survived and she lived in hope that for the Polish people would come an hour of regeneration and reconciliation with Russia'. Nicholas promised the [[Partitions of Poland|re-unification of the Polish lands]] under the aegis of the Russian Tsar and an autonomy to the Poles. The manifesto was met with appreciation by [[Roman Dmowski]], one of the leaders of the Polish nationalists.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from ''{{lang|arn|mapu}}'' 'land' and ''{{lang|arn|dungun}}'' 'speak, speech') is a [[language isolate]] spoken in south-central [[Chile]] and west central [[Argentina]] by the [[Mapuche]] people (from ''mapu'' 'land' and ''che'' 'people'). It is also spelled '''Mapuzugun''' and '''Mapudungu'''. It was formerly known as '''Araucanian''',&lt;ref name=HegBer2013/&gt; the name given to the Mapuche by the Spaniards; the Mapuche avoid it as a remnant of [[Colonial Chile|Spanish colonialism]], and it is considered offensive.

Mapudungun is not an official language of Chile or Argentina and has received virtually no government support throughout its history. It is not used as a language of instruction in either country’s educational system despite the Chilean government's commitment to provide full access to education in Mapuche areas in southern Chile. There is an ongoing political debate over which alphabet to use as the standard alphabet of written Mapudungun. There are approximately 144,000 native speakers in Chile and another 8,400 in west central [[Argentina]]. 

Only 2.4% of urban speakers and 16% of rural speakers use Mapudungun when speaking with children, and only 3.8% of speakers aged 10–19 years in the south of Chile (the language’s stronghold) are "highly competent" in the language.{{sfnp|Sadowsky|Painequeo|Salamanca|Avelino|2013|p=88}}

==Name==
Depending on the alphabet, the sound {{IPA|/tʃ/}} is spelled {{angbr|ch}} or {{angbr|c}}, and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} as {{angbr|g}} or {{angbr|ng}}. The language is called either the "speech (''{{IPA|d/zuŋun}}'') of the land (''{{IPA|mapu}}'')"  or the "speech of the people (''{{IPA|tʃe}}'')". An {{angbr|n}} may connect the two words. There are thus several ways to write the name of the language:

==History==
{{see also|Mapuche history}}
When the Spanish arrived in Chile, they found four groups of Mapuche speakers in the region of [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]], from which the Spanish called them ''araucanos'': the [[Picunche people]] (from ''{{lang|arn|pikum}}'' 'north' and ''{{lang|arn|che}}'' 'people'), the [[Huilliche people]] (from ''{{lang|arn|willi}}'' 'south'), the [[Pehuenche people]] (from ''{{lang|arn|pewen}}'' 'monkey puzzle tree' ''[[Araucaria araucana]]''), and the [[Moluche people]]  (from ''{{lang|arn|molu}}'' 'west'). The Picunche were conquered quite rapidly by the Spanish, whereas the Huilliche were not assimilated until the 18th century. 

Mapudungun was the only language spoken in central Chile. The sociolinguistic situation of the Mapuche has changed rapidly. Now, nearly all of Mapuche people are bilingual or monolingual in Spanish. The degree of bilingualism depends on the community, participation in Chilean society, and the individual's choice towards the traditional or modern/urban way of life.&lt;ref name= book&gt;Gruyter, Mouton. A Grammar of Mapuche. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some lexical influence from the [[Quechuan languages]] (''pataka'' 'hundred', ''warangka'' 'thousand') and more recently from Spanish.

==Dialects==

[[Linguist]] Robert A. Croese divides Mapudungun into eight dialectal sub-groups (I-VIII). Sub-group I is centered in [[Arauco Province]], Sub-group II is the dialect of [[Angol]], [[Los Ángeles, Bío Bío|Los Ángeles]] and the middle and lower [[Bío Bío River]]. Sub-group III is centered around [[Purén]]. In the areas around [[Lonquimay]], [[Melipeuco]] and [[Allipén River]] dialect sub-group IV is spoken. Sub-group V is spoken at the coast of [[Araucanía Region]] including [[Queule]], [[Budi Lake]] and [[Toltén]]. 

Temuco is the epicenter of the Mapuche territory today.&lt;ref&gt;(Smeets, Ineke (2008). A Grammar of Mapuche. Mouton de Gruyter.) &lt;/ref&gt; Around [[Temuco]], [[Freire, Chile|Freire]] and [[Gorbea, Chile|Gorbea]] the sub-group VI is spoken. Group VII is spoken in [[Valdivia Province]] plus [[Pucón]] and [[Curarrehue]]. The last "dialect" sub-group is VIII which is the [[Huilliche language]] spoken from [[Ranco Lake|Lago Ranco]] and [[Bueno River|Río Bueno]] to the south and is not mutually intelligible with the other dialects.&lt;ref name=Croese1985&gt;{{cite book |last=Croese |first=Robert A.|editor1-last=Manelis Klein |editor1-first=Harriet|editor2-last=Stark|editor2-first=Louisa R.|date=1985 |title=South American Indian Languages: Retrospect and Prospect |chapter=21. Mapuche Dialect Survey|url= |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=University of Texas Press |pages=784–801 |isbn=0-292-77592-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These can be grouped in four dialect groups: north, central, south-central and south. These are further divided into eight sub-groups: I and II (northern), III–IV (central), V-VII (south-central) and VIII (southern). The sub-groups III-VII are more closely related to each other than they are to I-II and VIII. Croese finds these relationships as consistent, but not proof, with the theory of [[Mapuche history#Origins|origin of the Mapuche]] proposed by [[Ricardo E. Latcham]].&lt;ref name=Croese1985/&gt;

The Mapudungun spoken in the Argentinean provinces of Neuquen and Rio Negro is similar to that of the central dialect group in Chile, while the Ranquel (Ranku ̈lche) variety spoken in the Argentinean province of La Pampa is closer to the northern dialect group.{{sfnp|Sadowsky|Painequeo|Salamanca|Avelino|2013|p=87}}

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
===Prosody===
Mapudungun has partially predictable, non-contrastive stress. The stressed syllable is generally the last one if it is closed (''{{lang|arn|awkán}}'' 'game', ''{{lang|arn|tralkán}}'' 'thunder'), and the one before last if the last one is open (''{{lang|arn|rúka}}'' 'house', ''{{lang|arn|lóngko}}'' 'head'). There is no phonemic tone.

==Orthography==
{{Main|Mapudungun alphabet}}
[[File:Aukan kawin griffitie mapuche.jpg|thumb|240px|Graffiti in Mapudungun meaning "War Council".]]

The Mapuche had no writing system before the Spanish arrived, but the language is now written with the Latin script. Although the  [[orthography]] used in this article is based on the ''Alfabeto Mapuche Unificado'', the system used by Chilean linguists and other people in many publications in the language, the competing Ragileo, Nhewenh and Azumchefi systems all have their supporters, and there is still no consensus among authorities, linguists and Mapuche communities. The same word can look very different in each system, with the word for "conversation or story" being written either ''gvxam'' or ''ngütram'', for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trekaletuan.com/2009/12/13/los-diferentes-grafemarios-y-alfabetos-del-mapudungun-raguileo-unificado-y-azumchefi/ "LOS DIFERENTES GRAFEMARIOS Y ALFABETOS DEL MAPUDUNGUN"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210075819/http://trekaletuan.com/2009/12/13/los-diferentes-grafemarios-y-alfabetos-del-mapudungun-raguileo-unificado-y-azumchefi/ |date=2013-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft lawsuit===
In late 2006, Mapuche leaders threatened to sue [[Microsoft]] when the latter completed a translation of their [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system into Mapudungun. They claimed that Microsoft needed permission to do so and had not sought it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/oukin-uk-chile-mapuches-microsoft-idUKN2238412220061123]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Guerra idiomática entre los indígenas mapuches de Chile y Microsoft''. El Mundo / Gideon Long (Reuters), 28 November 2006 [http://www.elmundo.es/navegante/2006/11/24/tecnologia/1164364076.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The event can be seen in the light of the greater political struggle concerning the [[alphabet]] that should become the standard alphabet of the Mapuche people.

==Morphology==
*Mapuche is an agglutinative language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Mapuche|last=Smeets|first=Ineke|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[word order]] of Mapudungun is flexible, but a [[topic–comment]] construction is common. The subject (agent) of a transitive clause tends to precede the verb, and the object tends to follow (A–V–O order); the subject of an intransitive clause tends to follow the verb (V–S order).&lt;ref name=book/&gt;
* Most complex verb formations in Mapudungu are constructed with five or six morphemes.&lt;ref&gt;(Monson et al. (2004) Data Collection and Analysis of Mapudungun Morphology for Spelling Correction. Language Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nouns are grouped in two classes, animate and inanimate. For example, ''{{lang|arn|pu}}'' is a plural indicator for animate nouns and ''{{lang|arn|yuka}}'' as the plural for inanimate nouns. ''{{lang|arn|Chi}}'' (or ''{{lang|arn|ti}}'') can be used as a definite animate article, as in ''{{lang|arn|chi wentru}}'' 'the man' and ''{{lang|arn|chi pu wentru}}'' for 'the men'. The number ''{{lang|arn|kiñe}}'' 'one' serves as an indefinite article. Subjects and objects use the same case.&lt;ref name="wals"&gt;http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_map&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are, for personal pronouns, three persons and three numbers: ''{{lang|arn|iñche}}'' 'I', ''{{lang|arn|iñchiw}}'' 'we (2)', ''{{lang|arn|iñchiñ}}'' 'we (more than 2)'; ''{{lang|arn|eymi}}'' 'you', ''{{lang|arn|eymu}}'' 'you (2)', ''{{lang|arn|eymün}}'' 'you (more than 2)'; ''{{lang|arn|fey}}'' 'he/she/it', ''{{lang|arn|feyengu}}'' 'they (2)', ''{{lang|arn|feyengün}}'' 'they (more than 2)'.
*Possessive pronouns are related to the personal forms: ''{{lang|arn|ñi}}'' 'my; his, her; their', ''{{lang|arn|yu}}'' 'our (2)', ''{{lang|arn|iñ}}'' 'our (more than 2)'; ''{{lang|arn|mi}}'' 'your', ''{{lang|arn|mu}}'' 'your (2)', ''{{lang|arn|mün}}'' 'your (more than 2)'. They are often found with a particle ''{{lang|arn|ta}}'', which does not seem to add anything specific to the meaning: ''{{lang|arn|tami}}'' 'your'.
*Interrogative pronouns include ''{{lang|arn|iney}}'' 'who', ''{{lang|arn|chem}}'' 'what', ''{{lang|arn|chumül}}'' 'when', ''{{lang|arn|chew}}'' 'where', ''{{lang|arn|chum(ngechi)}}'' 'how' and ''{{lang|arn|chumngelu}}'' 'why'.
 
* Mapudungu uses particles, which is a small group of morphemes that enable the speaker to express how they feel about what they have said. Examples include ''chi'' (doubt), ''am'' (surprise), ''nga'' (regret), ''llemay'' (certainty), ''chemay'' (amazement), ''chiam'' (wonder), ''amfe'' (exclamation). There are also more complicated particles such as ''kay'', which suggest the information about to be said is in contrast to what was just said. Another complex particle is ''may,'' which is used when the speaker expects to get a positive reaction from what they are saying. One particle, ''anchi'', refers to the subject of the sentence, and an example would be ''"chem anchi?"'' which translates to what [is] that (pointed out)?&lt;ref&gt; (Smeets, Ineke (2008). A Grammar of Mapuche. Mouton de Gruyter.) to the morphology section.

&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An inflection can be added to a noun with -''mew'' or -''mu''. This suffix can refer to time, place, cause or comparison.&lt;ref&gt;(Smeets, Ineke (2008). A Grammar of Mapuche. Mouton de Gruyter.)&lt;/ref&gt; "An example of this is the sentence 
''Mesa-mew müle-y ti mamüllü ñi müle-n mi tukupu-a-l.'' 

table-loc be-ind/3sS the wood poss be-noml 2s.poss use-nrld-noml

‘On the table is the wood that you should use.’ 
&lt;ref&gt;(Baker, Mark C. On the Loci of Agreement: Inversion Constructions in Mapudungu. Rutgers University) &lt;/ref&gt;
*Numbers from 1 to 10 are as follows: 1 ''{{lang|arn|kiñe}}'', 2 ''{{lang|arn|epu}}'', 3 ''{{lang|arn|küla}}'', 4 ''{{lang|arn|meli}}'', 5 ''{{lang|arn|kechu}}'', 6 ''{{lang|arn|kayu}}'', 7 ''{{lang|arn|regle}}'', 8 ''{{lang|arn|pura}}'', 9 ''{{lang|arn|aylla}}'', 10 ''{{lang|arn|mari}}''; 20 ''{{lang|arn|epu mari}}'', 30 ''{{lang|arn|küla mari}}'', 110 ''{{lang|arn|(kiñe) pataka mari}}''.  Numbers are extremely regular in formation, which is comparable to [[Chinese numerals#Reading and transcribing numbers|Chinese]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]], or to constructed languages such as [[Esperanto]]. 
*Verbs can be finite or non-finite (non-finite endings: ''-n'', ''-el'', ''-etew'', ''-lu'', ''-am'', etc.), are intransitive or transitive and are conjugated according to person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural), voice (active, agentless passive and reflexive-reciprocal, plus two applicatives) and mood (indicative, imperative and subjunctive). In the indicative, the present (zero) and future (''-(y)a'') tenses are distinguished. There are a number of aspects: the progressive, resultative and habitual are well established; some forms that seem to mark some subtype of perfect are also found. Other verb morphology includes an evidential marker (reportative-mirative), directionals (cislocative, translocative, andative and ambulative, plus an interruptive and continuous action marker) and modal markers (sudden action, faked action, immediate action, etc.). There is productive noun incorporation, and the case can be made for root compounding morphology.
*  "Spanish loan verbs have generally been adapted into Mapudungu in the third person singular form. An example is the Mapudungu verb for "to be able" is ''"pwede,"'' and the Spanish translation for "he can" is ''"puede."''&lt;ref&gt;(Smeets, Ineke (2008). A Grammar of Mapuche.

The indicative present paradigm for an intransitive verb like ''{{lang|arn|konün}}'' 'enter' is as follows:

What some authors{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} have described as an inverse system (similar to the ones described for [[Algonquian languages]]) can be seen from the forms of a transitive verb like ''{{lang|arn|pen}}'' 'see'. The 'intransitive' forms are the following:
{| border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px gray solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; vertical-align: center;"

When a third person interacts with a first or second person, the forms are direct (without ''-e'') or inverse (with ''-e''); the speaker has no choice. When two third persons interact, two different forms are available: the direct form (''{{lang|arn|pefi}}'') is appropriate when the agent is topical (the central figure in that particular passage). The inverse form (''{{lang|arn|peenew}}'') is appropriate when the patient is topical. Thus, ''{{lang|arn|chi wentru pefi chi domo}}'' means 'the man saw the woman' while ''{{lang|arn|chi wentru peeyew chi domo}}'' means something like 'the man was seen by the woman'. However, that it is not a passive construction; the passive would be ''{{lang|arn|chi wentru pengey}}'' 'the man was seen; someone saw the man'. Therefore, a better translation may be 'it was the woman who saw the man' or 'the woman was the one who saw the man'.

==Language revitalization efforts==
The Chilean Ministry of Education created the Office of Intercultural Bilingual Education in 1996 in an attempt to include indigenous language in education. By 2004, there were still no programs in public schools in Santiago, despite the fact that 50% of the country’s Mapuche population resides in and around the area of Santiago. 30.4% of Mapuche students never graduate eighth grade and they have high rates of poverty. No university holds courses on Mapudungu. Most language revitalization efforts have been in rural communities and these efforts have been received in different ways by the Mapuche population: Ortiz says some feel that teaching Mapudungu in schools will set their children behind other Chileans, which reveals that their culture has been devalued by the Chilean government for so long that, unfortunately, some Mapuche people have come to see their language as worthless, too, which is a direct and lasting impact of colonization. &lt;ref&gt;(Ortiz, Patricio R. (2009) Indigenous Knowledge and Language: Decolonizing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy in a Mapuche Intercultural Bilingual Education Program in Chile. Canadian Journal of Indigenous Education, 32, 93-114.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
===Older works===
The formalization and normalization of Mapudungun was effected by the first Mapudungun grammar published by the Jesuit priest [[Luis de Valdivia]] in 1606 (''Arte y Gramatica General de la Lengva que Corre en Todo el Reyno de Chile'').  More important is the ''Arte de la Lengua General del Reyno de Chile'' by the Jesuit [[Andrés Febrés]] (1765, Lima) composed of a grammar and dictionary. In 1776 three volumes in Latin were published in Westfalia (''Chilidúgú sive Res Chilenses'') by the German Jesuit [[Bernardo Havestadt]]. The work by Febrés was used as a basic preparation from 1810 for missionary priests going into the regions occupied by the Mapuche people. A corrected version was completed in 1846 and a summary, without a dictionary in 1864. A work based on Febrés' book is the ''Breve Metodo della Lingua Araucana y Dizionario Italo-Araucano e Viceversa'' by the Italian [[Octaviano de Niza]] in 1888. It was destroyed in a fire at the Convento de San Francisco in [[valdivia (city)|Valdivia]] in 1928.

===Modern works===
The most comprehensive works to date are the ones by Augusta (1903, 1916). Salas (1992, 2006) is an introduction for non-specialists, featuring an ethnographic introduction and a valuable text collection as well. Zúñiga (2006) includes a complete grammatical description, a bilingual dictionary, some texts and an audio CD with text recordings (educational material, a traditional folktale and six contemporary poems). Smeets (1989) and Zúñiga (2000) are for specialists only. Fernández-Garay (2005) introduces both the language and the culture. Catrileo (1995) and the dictionaries by Hernández &amp; Ramos are trilingual (Spanish, English and Mapudungun).

'''Mikhail Mikhailovich Zoshchenko''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Миха́йлович Зо́щенко}}; {{OldStyleDate|August 9|1894|July 28}} – July 22, 1958) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] author and [[satirist]].

==Biography==
Zoshchenko was born in 1894, in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, according to his 1953 autobiography. His Ukrainian father was an artist and a mosaicist responsible for the exterior decoration of the [[Suvorov Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Introduction to ''Nervous People and Other Satires'' page viii&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Russian. The future writer attended the Faculty of Law at the [[Saint Petersburg University]], but did not graduate due to financial problems. During [[World War I]], Zoshchenko served in the army as a field officer, was wounded in action several times, and was heavily decorated. In 1919, during the [[Russian Civil War]], he served for several months in the [[Red Army]] before being discharged for health reasons.
{{Serapion Brothers|size=200px|align=left}}    
He was associated with the [[Serapion Brothers]] and attained particular popularity in the 1920s as a satirist, but, after his denunciation in the [[Zhdanov decree]] of 1946, Zoshchenko lived in dire poverty. He was awarded his pension only a few months before he died.   
   
Zoshchenko developed a simplified [[deadpan]] style of writing which simultaneously made him accessible to "the people" and mocked official demands for accessibility: "I write very compactly. My sentences are short. Accessible to the poor. Maybe that's the reason why I have so many readers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Volkov]], ''Shostakovich and Stalin'', p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Volkov compares this style to the nakedness of the Russian holy fool or ''[[yurodivy]]''.    
    
Zoshchenko wrote a series of short stories for children about [[Vladimir Lenin]].{{cite web|url=https://ostrovok.de/p/zoshchenko/rasskazyi-o-lenine.html|title=''Рассказы о Ленине'' *|date=30 September 2000|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="145606">[[File:Lyndon B. Johnson taking the oath of office, November 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] taking the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] in 1963, after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]]]
An '''oath of office''' is an [[oath]] or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] a person takes before undertaking the duties of an [[office]], usually a position in government or within a religious body, although such oaths are sometimes required of officers of other organizations. Such oaths are often required by the laws of the state, religious body, or other organization before the person may actually exercise the powers of the office or any religious body. It may be administered at an [[inauguration]], [[coronation]], [[throne|enthronement]], or other ceremony connected with the taking up of office itself, or it may be administered privately.  In some cases it may be administered privately and then repeated during a public ceremony.

Some oaths of office are a statement of loyalty to a [[constitution]] or other legal text or to a person or other office-holder (e.g., an oath to support the constitution of the state, or of loyalty to the king). Under the laws of a state it may be considered [[treason]] or a [[High crimes and misdemeanours|high crime]] to betray a sworn oath of office.

The word 'oath' and the phrase 'I swear' refer to a solemn vow. For those who choose not to, the alternative terms 'solemn promise' and 'I promise' are sometimes used.

==Australia==
{{See also|Oath of Allegiance (Australia)}}
All members of the [[Australian Parliament]] are required to take before taking their seat in Parliament an Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance before the [[Governor-General of Australia]]. The requirement to take the oath is set out in section 42 of the [[Australian Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia_Constitution_Act |pages=Chapter I, Part IV, clause 42 |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wording of the oath and affirmation are set out in a schedule to the Constitution. The oath is:

{{quote|I, (name), do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors according to law. So help me God!}}

The affirmation is:
{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors according to law.}}

Upon taking office, the [[Governor-General of Australia]] is required to take the above Oath of Allegiance as well as a second Oath of Office:

{{quote|1=I, (name), do swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors according to law, in the office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I will do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of the Commonwealth of Australia, without fear or favour, affection or ill will. So help me God!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gg.gov.au/oath-office |title=Oath of Office |publisher=Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General |accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to swearing, the Oath of Allegiance upon becoming a Member of Parliament, the Prime Minister, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries also recite an Oath of Office upon entering office. The wording of this oath is not prescribed within the Constitution and is ultimately determined by the Prime Minister of the day.

==Belgium==

===King===
In Belgium, the King is not crowned but swears the constitutional oath in front of both Chambers of the federal parliament in the Palace of the Nation in Brussels. The assembly room is rebuilt for this occasion.

First, the parliamentary session of the Federal Chamber of Representatives and the Senate is opened. The joint session is presided over by the presidents of the Chamber and the Senate.

Afterwards, the King is announced by the usher in the country's three official languages: le Roi – de Koning – der König. The King enters the assembly room and sits on the throne in the center.

After a speech of the President of the Chamber, the King is invited to take the constitutional oath. This happens in the three official languages:

{{quote|''Dutch'': Ik zweer dat ik de Grondwet en de wetten van het Belgische volk zal naleven, 's Lands onafhankelijkheid handhaven en het grondgebied ongeschonden bewaren.}}
{{quote|''French'': Je jure d'observer la Constitution et les lois du peuple belge, de maintenir l'indépendance nationale et l'intégrité du territoire.}}
{{quote|''German'': Ich schwöre, die Verfassung und die Gesetze des belgischen Volkes zu beachten, die Unabhängigkeit des Landes zu erhalten und die Unversehrtheit des Staatsgebietes zu wahren.}}

In English: I swear that I will observe the constitution and laws of the Belgian people, preserve the country's independence and protect its territorial integrity. (Article 91 of the Belgian Constitution)

The King makes his inaugural speech. The President of the Senate congratulates the King. The Royal Band of the Belgian Naval Component performs the Belgian national anthem and the European anthem.

The King leaves and the parliamentary session is closed.

101 cannon shots are fired.

The other members of these governments do not take the oath at the King, but in front of their respective parliaments.

They may choose to take the oath in one or more of the country's languages.

{{quote|''Dutch'': Ik zweer getrouwheid aan de Koning, gehoorzaamheid aan de Grondwet en aan de wetten van het Belgische volk.}}
{{quote|''French'': Je jure fidélité au Roi, obéissance à la Constitution et aux lois du Peuple belge.}}
{{quote|''German'': Ich schwöre Treue dem König, Gehorsam der Verfassung und den Gesetzen des belgisches Volkes.}}

The members of the Chambers of Representatives, the Senate, the Flemish Parliament, the Walloon Parliament, the Parliament of the French Community, the Parliament of the German-speaking Community and the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region have to swear the following oath:

{{quote|''Dutch'': Ik zweer de Grondwet na te leven.}}
{{quote|''French'': Je jure d'observer la Constitution. }}
{{quote|''German'': Ich schwöre, die Verfassung zu beachten.}}

==Brazil==
[[File:Dilmaoath.jpg|thumb|[[Dilma Rousseff]] takes the oath of office of the President of Brazil.]]

The affirmation required by the [[Constitution of Brazil]] to be taken by the [[President of Brazil|president]]-elect upon entering into office is as follows:

The [[Vice-President of Brazil|vice-president]] is required to take the same pledge.

The affirmations of office required of members of the [[National Congress of Brazil]] are specified in the rules of procedure of each [[Chambers of parliament|house]] (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]])

The internal rules of the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] set out the affirmation that must be taken by justices upon their investiture. Other judges make different affirmations, as provided for by law or in the internal rules of each Court.

The Constitution and laws of the several [[States of Brazil|states]] and the organic laws of the municipalities also specify affirmations that must be made by the key officers of those entities.

==Canada==
{{Further|Oath of Allegiance (Canada)}}

No formal oath is required to be taken by the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;See United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor general===
The [[Governor General of Canada]] is required to take the "Oath for the due execution of the Office of Our Governor General and [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada]], and for the due impartial administration of justice", which includes swearing allegiance to the reigning [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] the viceroy is to represent.

===Ministers===
The Clerk of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] administers the Oath of Office and Oath of Allegiance to ministers, including the prime minister of Canada, at [[Rideau Hall]]. The Oath of Office is as follows:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly and sincerely promise and swear (or declare) that I will truly and faithfully, and to the best of my skill and knowledge, execute the powers and trusts reposed in me as (office), so help me God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://archive.gg.ca/media/fs-fd/p3_e.asp| title=Oaths of Office| date=30 April 2009| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ministers who choose to take the oath as an affirmation use ''declare'' instead of ''swear'' and omit ''so help me God''. When not already members of the privy council, ministers also take the oath for members of the privy council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://archive.gg.ca/media/fs-fd/P2_e.asp| title=The Swearing-in of Privy Councillors| date=30 April 2009| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime minister's oath is slightly different:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly and sincerely promise and swear (or declare) that I will truly and faithfully, and to the best of my skill and knowledge, execute the powers and trust reposed in me as Prime Minister of Canada.

All [[Conscription in Finland|Finnish conscripts]] are required to give the military oath or affirmation. The oath or affirmation is given in the end of the basic training using the formula:

{{quote|I, (name), promise and affirm before the almighty and all-knowing God (''in affirmation'': by my honour and by my conscience) that I am a trustworthy and faithful citizen of the realm of Finland. I want to serve my country honestly and, to my best ability, seek and pursue her edification and advantage. 
I want everywhere and in every situation, during the peace and during the war, defend the inviolability of my fatherland, her legal system of government and the legal authority of the realm. If I perceive or gain knowledge of activity to overthrow the legal authority or to subvert the system of government of the country, I want to report it to the authorities without delay. 
The troop to which I belong and my place in it I will not desert in any situation, but so long as I have strength in me, I will completely fulfill the task I have received. 
I promise to act properly and uprightly, obey my superiors, comply with the laws and decrees and keep the service secrets trusted in me. 
I want to be forthright and helpful to my fellow servicemen. Never will I due to kinship, friendship, envy, hatred or fear nor because of gifts or any other reason act contrary to my duty in service. 
If I be given a position of superiority, I want to be rightful to my subordinates, to take care of their wellbeing, acquire information on their wishes, to be their councillor and guide and, for my own self, set them a good and encouraging example. All this I want to fulfil according to my honour and my conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2007/20071443 Decree on conscription (''Valtioneuvoston asetus asevelvollisuudesta (1443/2007).] Retrieved 2008-01-09. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Germany==
{{see also|Hitler oath}}
The oath of office of the [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]], and other [[Cabinet of Germany|federal ministers]] in Germany is as follows:

{{quote|I swear that I will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the German people, promote their welfare, protect them from harm, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, perform my duties conscientiously, and do justice to all. So help me God.&lt;ref name="grundgesetz56"&gt;''Grundgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', Art. 56&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The religious affirmation may be omitted.&lt;ref name="grundgesetz56" /&gt; The first (and only) chancellor to do this was [[Gerhard Schröder]] in 1998.

Each of the 16 [[States of Germany|Länder]] (states) has its own oath of office for the [[Minister President]]s and other ministers, also for the Länder employees.

The oath for soldiers in Germany reads as follows:

{{quote|I swear to serve loyally the Federal Republic of Germany and to defend bravely the right and the freedom of the German people. So help me God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of Propaganda: Film and National Socialism, 1933-1945, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|1-571-81066-8}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depending on the oath's interpretation, the following translation is also possible:

{{quote|I swear to serve loyally the Federal Republic of Germany and to defend bravely the justice and the freedom of the German people. So help me God{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

In both of the above, conscripts say "vow" instead of "swear", and the religious affirmation is not added for conscripts since the vow is not an actual oath.

The oath for federal ''[[Beamter|Beamte]]'':

{{quote|I swear to protect the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and all valid laws within the Federal Republic and to fulfill my duties of the office faithfully, so help me God.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

==Indonesia==
===President and Vice President===
Based on the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia Article 9 about the Oath of Office and Promise of the [[President of Indonesia|President]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]]:

Before assuming office, the President and the Vice-President shall take the oath of office according to their religions, or solemnly promise before the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR) or the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) session as follows:

The President's/Vice-President's Oath of Office (for Muslims):

{{quote|In the name of Allah, I swear that I will perform the duties of the President (''or'' Vice-President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my ability and as justly as possible, and that I will strictly observe the Constitution and consistently implement the law and regulations in the service of the country and the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

The President's/Vice-President's Promise:

{{quote|I solemnly promise that I will perform the duties of the President (''or'' Vice-President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my ability and as justly as possible, and that I will strictly observe the constitution and consistently implement the law and regulations in the service of the country and the people.&lt;ref&gt;''Indonesian Constitutional Reform, 1999-2002: An Evaluation of Constitution-making in Transition'' {{ISBN|978-9-79709-394-5}} p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In case any sessions can not be held, like one in 1998 when the protesters took control of the parliament building, the oath can be performed before the MPR chairperson and vice chairpersons, as well as the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia|Chief Justice]] and his/her deputies with presence of the chairperson of every chambers.

===Cabinet members and Presidential Work Units (UKP)===
{{quote|In the name of Allah (for Muslims) ''or'' Om Atah Paramawisesa (for Hindus) ''or'' In the name of [[Sanghyang Adi Buddha]] (for Buddhists) I swear (''or'' in the name of God I promise (for Protestants and Catholics)) that I will be faithful to the [[Constitution of Indonesia]], and will execute any laws consistently for my service to the nation and the country. That I, when executing the duties of this office, will highly honor office ethics, perform to the best of my ability, and with full responsibility. That I will maintain my integrity, never abuse my power, and avert myself from despicable actions. (''for Christians and Catholics:'' So help me God.)  (''for Hindus:'' Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Om.)}}

In the past, between the pronunciation of God according to each religions and "so help me God" expression, the oath will be like this (note that before the second and third sentence, they will be started with "I swear", regardless of the religions): 
{{quote|that I, being appointed to this office, directly or indirectly, by any name or excuse, will not grant or promise or give something to anyone. That I, for doing or not doing something, will never receive from anyone, directly or indirectly, any promise or givings. That I, will be faithful to the Constitution and will preserve any laws and rulings that valid for the state of the Republic of Indonesia. That I, with all my strength, will seek the welfare of the Republic of Indonesia. That I will be faithful to the people and the country, and will fulfill any obligations that were passed on me because of this office. That I will execute the duties and obligations with full responsibility to the people and the country.}}

To refer the god in Hindu, the oath used to use sentence "In the name of [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi]]", and later "Om Swastiastu". There was also a time when Christian and Catholic ministers said "I swear" instead of promise at the beginning of the oath, did not mention any reference to God. The verses "to seek the welfare" was removed since it reflected the dictatorial [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order era]].

The declarations' references to God were criticised in a 1993 report of the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]].&lt;ref name="ireland-crg"/&gt; The 1996 Constitution Review Group proposed that the President and members of the Council of State should be permitted to substitute a non-religious affirmation.&lt;ref name="ireland-crg"/&gt; In contrast, it recommended a uniform non-religious oath for all judges, on the basis that impartiality was more central to the judicial function and would be compromised by providing a choice of words.&lt;ref name="ireland-crg"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=21 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123405/http://www.constitution.ie/reports/crg.pdf |url=http://www.constitution.ie/reports/crg.pdf|title=Report|last=Constitution Review Group|date=July 1996|publisher=Stationery Office|accessdate=7 March 2011|location=Dublin |pages=26, 113, 157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)}}
Members of the [[Oireachtas]] and of the [[Government of Ireland|Government]] do not make any oath. From the foundation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, both had to make an oath of allegiance to [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|the Constitution]] and of [[fidelity]] to King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1922/en/act/pub/0001/sched1.html Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann)] Articles 17, 55&lt;/ref&gt;  This controversial provision of the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1922/en/act/pub/0001/sched2.html Anglo-Irish Treaty 1921] Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War of 1922–23]].

The [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]] took the same Oath of Allegiance and Oath of Office as the [[Governor General of Canada]]. This did not take place in public.

==Israel==
In Israel, the [[Basic laws of Israel|Basic Laws]] specify oaths of office of high-ranking members of the government.

==United Kingdom==

===Oaths taken by the monarch===
In the United Kingdom, no formal oath is essential to be taken by the monarch in relation to his or her accession. He or she is, however, required to take an oath regarding the security of the Church of Scotland. At a coronation, the monarch usually takes an oath but as a coronation is inessential, Monarchs need not take a similar oath in order to discharge their duties, as with the case of Edward VIII. The exact wording of the coronation oath of various monarchs has altered throughout the years without statutory authority but remain based on the oath as prescribed by the [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]].

====Coronation Oath====
The following was the oath taken by Queen Elizabeth II at her coronation on 2 June 1953:

{{quote|Archbishop: Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and the other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?

Queen: I solemnly promise so to do.

Archbishop: Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?

Queen: I will.

Archbishop: Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel? Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the United Kingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law? Will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in England? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of England, and to the Churches there committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of them?

Queen: All this I promise to do.

Then the Queen arising out of her Chair, supported as before, the Sword of State being carried before her, shall go to the Altar, and make her solemn Oath in the sight of all the people to observe the premisses: laying her right hand upon the Holy Gospel in the great Bible (which was before carried in the procession and is now brought from the Altar by the Arch-bishop, and tendered to her as she kneels upon the steps), and saying these words:

The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God.

===History of the Oath===
While the oath-taking dates back to the First Congress in 1789, the current oath is a product of the 1860s, drafted by [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era members of Congress intent on ensnaring traitors.

In 1789, the [[1st United States Congress]] created an oath to fulfill the requirement of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] of the [[United States Constitution]]:

{{quote|I, A. B. do solemnly swear or affirm (as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=146 Chap. I. 1 Stat. 23] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation:  U. S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved March 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It also passed the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which established an additional oath taken by federal judges:

{{quote|I do solemnly swear (or affirm), that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me, according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the Constitution, and laws of the United States. [So help me God.]}}

The outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] quickly transformed the routine act of oath-taking into one of enormous significance. In April 1861, a time of uncertain and shifting loyalties, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] ordered all federal civilian employees within the executive branch to take an expanded oath. When Congress convened for a brief emergency session in July, members echoed the president's action by enacting legislation requiring employees to take the expanded oath in support of the Union. This oath is the earliest direct predecessor of the modern version of the oath.

When Congress returned for its regular session in December 1861, members who believed that the Union had as much to fear from northern traitors as southern soldiers again revised the oath, adding a new first section known as the "Ironclad Test Oath." The war-inspired Test Oath, signed into law on July 2, 1862, required "every person elected or appointed to any office ... under the Government of the United States ... excepting the President of the United States" to swear or affirm that they had never previously engaged in criminal or disloyal conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=012/llsl012.db&amp;recNum=533 Chap. CXXVIII. 12 Stat. 502] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation:  U. S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved March 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Those government employees who failed to take the 1862 Test Oath would not receive a salary; those who swore falsely would be prosecuted for [[perjury]] and forever denied federal employment.

The 1862 oath's second section incorporated a different rendering of the hastily drafted 1861 oath. Although Congress did not extend coverage of the Ironclad Test Oath to its own members, many took it voluntarily. Angered by those who refused this symbolic act during a wartime crisis, and determined to prevent the eventual return of prewar southern leaders to positions of power in the national government, congressional hard-liners eventually succeeded by 1864 in making the Test Oath mandatory for all members.

The Senate then revised its rules to require that members not only take the Test Oath orally, but also that they "subscribe" to it by signing a printed copy. This condition reflected a wartime practice in which military and civilian authorities required anyone wishing to do business with the federal government to sign a copy of the Test Oath. The current practice of newly sworn senators signing individual pages in an oath book dates from this period.

As tensions cooled during the decade following the Civil War, Congress enacted private legislation permitting particular former Confederates to take only the second section of the 1862 oath. An 1868 public law prescribed this alternative oath for "any person who has participated in the late rebellion, and from whom all legal disabilities arising therefrom have been removed by act of Congress."&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=118 Chap. CXXXIX. 15 Stat. 85] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U. S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved March 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Northerners immediately pointed to the new law's unfair double standard that required loyal Unionists to take the Test Oath's harsh first section while permitting ex-Confederates to ignore it. In 1884, a new generation of lawmakers quietly repealed the first section of the Test Oath, leaving intact the current affirmation of constitutional allegiance.

===Federal Executive and Legislative Branch Oaths===
In the [[United States]], the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] for the [[President of the United States|President]] is specified in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] ([[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation|Article II, Section 1]]):

{{quote|"I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A2Sec1 Article II - The Executive Branch : Section 1 - The President], The Constitution of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The oath may be sworn or affirmed (in which case it is called an ''affirmation'' instead of ''oath''). Although not present in the text of the Constitution, it is customary for modern presidents to say "So help me God" after the end of the oath. For officers other than the President, the expression "So help me God" is explicitly prescribed, but the Judiciary Act of 1789 also explains when it can be omitted (specifically for oaths taken by court clerks): "Which words, so help me God, shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/judiciary_1789.htm Judiciary Act of 1789], Sec. 7. Retrieved 2009-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution (Article VI, clause 3) also specifies:
{{quote|The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.}}

At the start of each new [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], in January of every odd-numbered year, newly elected or re-elected Members of Congress – the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate – must recite an oath:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.''&lt;ref name=usc5.3331 /&gt;}}

This oath is also taken by the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], members of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], federal judges and all other civil and military officers and federal employees other than the President.

===Federal Judiciary Oaths===
In the United States, [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] are required to take two oaths. The first oath is this:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as (office) under the Constitution and laws of the United States. [So help me God.]&lt;ref name=usc28.453&gt;{{usc|28|453}}, ''Oaths of justices and judges''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second is the same oath that members of Congress take:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. [So help me God.]&lt;ref name=usc5.3331&gt;{{usc|5|3331}}, ''Oath of Office''&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Federal statute specifically says that the latter oath "does not affect other oaths required by law."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{usc|5|3331}}, ''Oath of Office''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Oaths – Federal and State===
See ''[[United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office]]''.

===State and Local Oaths===
The oaths of state and local officials are largely patterned on the federal oath of constitutional allegiance. Typical would be the oath taken by all New York government officials:

{{quote|I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of New York, (and the Charter of the City of New York, e.g.), and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of (mayor of the City of New York, e.g.) to the best of my ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm New York State Constitution, Article 8 Section 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723110017/http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm |date=2010-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (''So help me God'' is traditionally added.)

====Tennessee (county offices)====
All elected county officials and the appointed officers such as clerk and master, and deputies to these officers, are required to take an oath of office which actually consists of two oaths: the
constitutional oath, and an oath for the particular office or fidelity oath (Tenn. Const. Art. X, Sec. 1).  The following is combination fidelity and constitutional oath:
{{quote|I do solemnly swear that I will perform with fidelity the duties of the office to which I have been elected, and which I am about to assume.  I do solemnly swear to support the constitutions of Tennessee and the United States and to faithfully perform the duties of the office of ____________  for ____________  County, Tennessee.&lt;ref name="tennessee oaths"&gt;[http://www.ctas.tennessee.edu/public/web/ctas.nsf/EntriesWeb/8900D65183E0B278862570F200540438/$FILE/OATHS2006.pdf OATHS OF OFFICE (2006)], [http://www.ctas.tennessee.edu County technical Assistance Servise], [[University of Tennessee]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The simple constitutional oath and fidelity oath are taken by persons who do not have a more specific oath prescribed by law (T.C.A. § 8-18-111). This basic oath is used upon entering the
following offices:
County Executive/Mayor
County Clerk (or deputy county clerk by substituting the word "appointed" for "elected")
County Register (or deputy register by substituting the word "appointed" for "elected")
Chief administrative officer of the county highway department

County commissioners may use the same basic oath as noted above, but phrased as follows:
{{quote|I do solemnly swear that I will perform with fidelity the duties of the office to which I have been elected, and which I am about to assume.  I do solemnly swear to support
the constitutions of Tennessee and the United States and to faithfully perform the duties of the office of county commissioner representing the ____________ district of ____________  County, Tennessee.&lt;ref name="tennessee oaths" /&gt;}}

Clerks of court, deputy clerks of court, sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, assessors of property and deputy assessors, constables with law enforcement powers, constables without law enforcement powers, general sessions court judges, and school board members in Tennessee all have specific variations of their oaths of office.&lt;ref name="tennessee oaths" /&gt;

== Venezuela ==
The [[President of Venezuela]], upon assumption of the office on his inauguration, is asked by the President of the National Assembly (until 1999, the Senate President, on behalf of the entire National Federal Congress), holding a copy of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]], the following:

{{quote|Before God and the Fatherland, Do you swear therefore to perform the duties of the position of Constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and in the performance of your duties fulfill the Constitution and laws of the Republic?}}

With the right hand on the shoulder level he answers with a "Yes I swear" and the President then responds: "If you do so, before God and the Fatherland your duties will be performed, and it will be demanded of you if you not. Therefore, in the name of the Republic and by the authority of the law, I investiture you as Constitutional President of the Republic as of this moment for this term period." Then the Presidential Sash (with the colors and coat of arms from the [[Flag of Venezuela]] and the collar of the Order of the Liberatiors is turned over to him from the outgoing President, but if the case is that of succession due to death of office of his predecessor both items are cased and are given to him by the National Assembly President instead. If reelected the method is the same as after the sudden death of the President while in office.

== Catholic Church==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] requires all of its [[Holy Orders|clergy]] before ordination and most of those promoted to positions of authority to make a "Profession of Faith," as below. It is very similar to the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]] (referred to as the Symbol of Faith).

{{quote|I, (name), with firm [[faith]] believe and profess everything that is contained in the Symbol of Faith: namely:

I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made, one in Being with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and for our [[salvation]], he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I look forward to resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. [[Amen]].

With firm faith, I also believe everything contained in the Word of God, whether written or handed down in Tradition, which the Church, either by a solemn judgement or by the ordinary and universal Magisterium, sets forth to be believed as divinely revealed.

I also firmly accept and hold each and everything definitively proposed by the Church regarding teaching on faith and morals.

Moreover, I adhere with religious submission of will and intellect to the teachings which either the [[Roman Pontiff|Roman pontiff]] or the [[College of Bishops]] enunciate when they exercise their authentic Magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim these teachings by a definitive act.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

Further, all of those promoted to positions of authority (vicars general, judicial vicars, episcopal vicars, pastors of parishes and superiors within religious orders) or with teaching responsibilities (rectors of seminaries, professors at seminaries, heads or Catholic universities or professors on the faculties of Catholic colleges and universities who teach subjects involving religion), and all those ordained deacons (and therefore all those who will also later be ordained priests) to take the following "Oath of Fidelity"

{{quote|I, (name), in assuming the office of (office), promise that in my words and in my actions I shall always preserve [[Full communion|communion with the Catholic Church]].

With great care and fidelity I shall carry out the duties incumbent on me toward the Church, both universal and particular, in which, according to the provisions of the law, I have been called to exercise my service.

In fulfilling the charge entrusted to me in the name of the Church, I shall hold fast to the deposit of faith in its entirety; I shall faithfully hand it on and explain it, and I shall avoid any teachings contrary to it.

I shall follow and foster the common discipline of the entire Church and I shall maintain the observance of all [[Canon law|ecclesiastical laws]], especially those contained in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]].

With Christian obedience I shall follow what the Bishops, as authentic [[Doctor of the Church|doctors]] and [[Church Fathers|teachers of the faith]], declare, or what they, as those who govern the Church, establish.

I shall also faithfully assist the diocesan Bishops, so that the apostolic activity, exercised in the name and by mandate of the Church, may be carried out in communion with the Church.

So help me God, and God's Holy Gospels on which I place my hand.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

'''Dr. Phakirappa Gurubasappa Halakatti'''  is a [[Kannada]] writer. He was born in [[Dharwad]]. He studied at the Basel Mission High School, Dharwad and then at St. Xaviour's College, Bombay. He obtained his B.A. and L.L.B. degrees from the University of Bombay. However he started his legal practice in [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]]&lt;nowiki&gt;. He was an important public figure serving in several different capacities. He was an educationist and a vocal supporter of social reformation. As part of the educational reforms of the Lingayaths, he established a high school in 1910. He was also very active in ameliorating the conditions of the farmers and for this purpose he established a co-operative society in 1912 to help small-scale farmers, weavers, pot-makers, etc. His tenure as a member of the Mumbai Legislative Council in 1920 gave a much needed impetus to the politics of Bijapur and he enjoyed an important position among his colleagues and friends. "His political activities during this period also helped him building contacts with several national leaders and their followers" (The "Discovery" of Vachanas, 2012). &lt;/nowiki&gt;

But his interest grew towards Vachana Shasthra of twelfth century. He visited many villages in north Karnataka and collected old [[palm leaf manuscripts]]&lt;nowiki&gt; in which vachanas were written. But some parts of those manuscripts were either damaged or missing.  Then he completed those missing parts of vachana and published it in three volumes popularly known as [[Vachana Shastra Saara]] (The Essence of Vachana Shastra). His work was considered great as it made even a common man understand the vachana.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kannada text book First PU (Chapter 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also published two periodicals: "Shivaanubhava" and "Nava Karnataka".He was considered as the "Max Muller of Karnataka" for his continuous research on Vachana Shasthra for over 60 years just the same as [[Max Muller]] of Germany on Vedas. He was one of the foremost to translate vachanas into English and they were published in [[Indian Antiquity]] (1922). His contribution to Kannada literature lies primarily in the "discovery" of vachanas. It was part of his zealous research on the Lingayath literature. He collected, wrote and published more than ten thousand pages about [[Lingayath Literature]]&lt;nowiki&gt; out of which vachana vangmaya (literature) occupies a lion's share. He initiated the process of adapting precolonial vachanas to correspond to his contemporary sensibilities. He encouraged many young minds to take up studies on vachanas; collate and publish them. He is proudly hailed as "Vachana Gummata" (The Gumbaz of Vachanas) by [[B.M. Shrikantaiah]], the doyen of [[modern Kannada poetry]]. Popularly known as "Vachana Pitamaha(Father of Vachanas)" However, despite his fame and name, Halkatti spent his life in poverty. He was awarded the honorary doctorate by the Karnatak University. The British Government conferred him the titles &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Rao Sahib]] and [[Rao Bahadur]]. He was chosen as the President of [[Kannada Sahitya Sammelana]] which took place in 1926 at Bellary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">A '''phrasal template''' is a [[phrase]]-long [[collocation]] that contains one or several  empty slots which may be filled by words to produce individual phrases. Often there are some restrictions on the grammatic category of the words allowed to fill particular slots. An example is the phrase "common stocks rose &lt;Number&gt; to &lt;Number&gt;", e.g., "common stocks rose 1.72 to 340.36".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Armstrong (1994) ''Using Large Corpora'', {{ISBN|0-262-51082-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b3Si8InCqRgC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22phrasal+templates+are%22&amp;sig=YQR-W88pTp1BTMNbIcLnpk1qw74 p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phrasal templates are akin to [[form (document)|form]]s in which blanks are to be filled with data. 

A word game that makes use of phrasal templates is [[Mad Libs]].

The notion is used in [[natural language processing]] systems&lt;ref&gt;Joseph D. Becker, The phrasal lexicon, Proceedings of the 1975 workshop on Theoretical issues in natural language processing, June 10-13, 1975, Cambridge, Massachusetts, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=980212&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;CFID=14936101&amp;CFTOKEN=33513042]&lt;/ref&gt; and in language generators, such as application-oriented [[report generator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Kukich. "Knowledge-Based Report Generation: A Knowledge Engineering Approach to Natural Language Report Generation." Ph.D. Thesis, Information Science Department, [[University of Pittsburgh]], 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Boubeau, D. Carcagno, E. Goldberg, R. Kittredge, and A. Polguere. "Bilingual generation of weather forecasts in an operations environment." In Proceedings of the 13   th   International Conference on [[Computational Linguistics]] (COLING-90), Volume 1, pages 9&amp;mdash;92, Helsinki, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neologism "[[snowclone]]" was introduced to refer to a special case of phrasal templates that "clone" popular [[cliché]]s.  For example, a misquotation of [[Diana Vreeland]]'s "Pink is the navy blue of India"&lt;ref&gt;[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003981.html ON THE TRAIL OF "THE NEW BLACK" (AND "THE NAVY BLUE")], ''[[Language Log]]'', December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; may have gaven rise to the template "[X] is the new black," which in turn evolved into "[X] is the new [Y]".

The term "phrasal template" first appeared in a linguistic study of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUNl4I6n-KwC&amp;q=%22phrasal+template%22&amp;dq=%22phrasal+template%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifzPmKyqbSAhVmlFQKHYtSDqwQ6AEIJDAC|title=Prosody: models and measurements|last=Cutler|first=Anne|last2=Ladd|first2=D. Robert|last3=Brown|first3=Gillian|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9783540124283|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but doesn't appear to have come into common use until the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nZQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22phrasal+template%22&amp;dq=%22phrasal+template%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifzPmKyqbSAhVmlFQKHYtSDqwQ6AEIHDAA|title=Proceedings of the Conference|last=Meeting|first=Association for Computational Linguistics|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''race of the future''' is a theoretical composite [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which will result from ongoing [[racial admixture]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff, "[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html God and White Men at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028042755/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html |date=28 October 2012 }}", ''Yale Alumni Magazine'', May/June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] in 1925 in ''Practical Idealism'' predicted: "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]-[[Negroid]] race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;''Praktischer Idealismus'', Wien/Leipzig 1925, pages 20, 23, 50&lt;/ref&gt; The same scenario had been envisaged, with rather less enthusiasm, by [[Madison Grant]] in his 1916 ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', calling for a [[eugenics]] program to prevent this development, and in a similar ideological context in [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' in 1920.

==History==
[[Gottfried de Purucker]] was an author and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] who, when asked about [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] in 1930, said "In answering your question very briefly, I can say simply this, that the time has not come when I would willingly suggest intermarriage; but I am in honesty bound to qualify that by saying that the race of the future will be a composite, composed of the many different races on earth today. Let us also remember that all men are ultimately of one blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/dialogue/dial13.htm|title=KTMG Papers: Thirteen|work=The Dialogues of G. de Purucker|publisher=Theosophical University Press|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''miscegenation'' was used in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet printed in [[New York City]] in late 1863, entitled [[Miscegenation hoax|''Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro''.]] The pamphlet purported to be in favor of [[interbreeding]] of whites and [[Black people|blacks]] until the races were indistinguishably mixed as [[mulatto]]s, claiming that this was the goal of the [[United States Republican Party]]. The real authors were [[David Goodman Croly]], managing editor of the ''[[New York World]]'', a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] paper, and [[George Wakeman]], a ''World'' reporter. The pamphlet soon was exposed as an attempt to discredit the Republicans, the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] administration, and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] by exploiting the fears and racial biases common among whites. Nonetheless, this pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in communities on both sides of the [[American Civil War]] by opponents of Republicans.

The British colony of [[Maryland]] was the first to pass an anti-miscegenation law (1664).&lt;ref name="Pascoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4708.html|title=Why the Ugly Rhetoric Against Gay Marriage Is Familiar to this Historian of Miscegenation | last=Pascoe | first=Peggy | authorlink=Peggy Pascoe | date=2004-04-19 | work=History News Network | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, many American states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], often based on controversial interpretations of the [[Bible]], particularly the story of [[Phinehas, son of Eleazar|Phinehas]]. Typically a [[felony]], these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of [[adultery]] or [[fornication]] would be brought against them instead. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii, and the federal District of Columbia did not pass anti-miscegenation laws. In 1883, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=106&amp;invol=583 Pace v. Alabama]''.

In 1948, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] in ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' effectively repealed the California anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby making California the first state in the twentieth century to do so. In 1967, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.

==Multiracial populations==
===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], as much as 44% of the population classify themselves as [[Pardo Brazilians|Pardo]] (multiracial).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=3&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=93&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 "População residente, por cor ou raça, situação e sexo."] IBGE - PNAD.&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically a mix of White, Black and Native American.

===United States===
[[William Quan Judge]] was a 19th century theosophist who wrote in his book [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/aechoes.htm Echoes from the Orient]; "We are preparing here in America a new race which will exhibit the perfection of the glories that I said were being slowly brought to the surface from the long forgotten past ... Here, and nowhere else, are to be found men and women of every race living together, being governed together, attacking nature and the problems of life together, and bringing forth children who combine, each one, two races. This process will go on until in the course of many generations there will be produced on the American continents an entirely new race; new bodies; new orders of intellect; new powers of the mind."

In the United States, the proportion of [[multiracial American]] children is growing. Interracial partnerships are rising, as are transracial [[adoption]]s. In 1990, about 14% of 18- and 19-year-olds, 12% of 20- and 21-year-olds, and 7% of 34- and 35-year-olds were involved in interracial [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s (Joyner and Kao, 2005). &lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/interracial.couples.ssl.html|title=Interracial relationships are on the increase in U.S., but decline with age, Cornell study finds|last=Lang|first=Susan S.|date=2005-11-02|work=Chronicle Online|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 in the United States, 15% of new marriages were interracial, with 9% of whites, 17% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians married outside of their race. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-[[mestizo]], 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204880404577226981780914906?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories|title=More Marriages Cross Race, Ethnicity Lines|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other views==
According to [[anthropologist]] [[Henry Harpending]], human populations are actually diverging from one another, as opposed to melding into a single population. Harpending stated "Human races are evolving away from each other ... Genes are evolving fast in Europe, Asia and Africa, but almost all of these are unique to their continent of origin. We are getting less alike, not merging into a single, mixed humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116529402.html|title=Are humans evolving faster? Findings suggest we are becoming more different, not alike|work=physorg.com|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2016}}
In [[medicine|medical]] contexts, '''rhotacism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|t|ə|s|ɪ|z|əm}}) is the inability to pronounce or difficulty in pronouncing the sound ''r''. [[speech-language pathology|Speech pathologists]] call the condition ''de''-rhotacization, because the sounds lose their [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]] quality rather than becoming rhotic.

== Language development ==
Rhotic sounds are usually the last ones a child masters. Some people never learn to produce them; they substitute other sounds, such as the [[velar approximant]], the [[uvular approximant]] (often called the [[French language|French]] ''R''), and the [[uvular trill]].

In English, the most common occurrence of this type is a pronunciation perceived as closer to [w] (typically, though, actually the [[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}}), which is known as [[r-labialisation|''r''-labialisation]]. This form of rhotacism has often been used in English-language media for comedic effect, since it evokes among English speakers a childlike way of pronouncing the letter R, an example being [[Elmer Fudd]]'s pronunciation of "rabbit" [[Help:IPA|[ˈɹ̠ʷæbɪ̈t]]] as "wabbit" [[Help:IPA|[ˈwæbɪ̈t]]] in ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons. Often, people with the condition are mistakenly referred to as a person with a [[lisp]], which is a completely different condition.

== Across languages ==
Rhotacism is more common among speakers of languages that have a [[Alveolar trill|trilled R]],{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian Language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (except in the provinces of [[Skåne]], [[Halland]], [[Blekinge]], [[Öland]] and southern [[Småland]]).

==People with rhotacism==
* [[Jonathan Ross]], British television and radio presenter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio's New Wave: Global Sound in the Digital Era|p=156|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-136-44630-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The leader of [[Hezbollah]], [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Sheikh [[Hasan Nasrallah]], has been ridiculed for his rhotacism, particularly his “''Amwīka''”* and “''Iswā’īl''”* for Arabic ''Amrīka'' ("America"), ''Isrā’īl'' ("Israel").{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== In popular culture ==
* [[Elmer Fudd]] in ''[[Looney Tunes]]''
* [[Barry Kripke]] in ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' is depicted as having this speech impediment. However, he has problems with both "R" and "L" sounds. His Siri on his iPhone answers him back as "Bawwy". He is last seen in Season 11 episode "The Bow Tie Asymmetry", at the end of the wedding, singing the song "At Last" as "At Wast".
* In the 1979 film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', [[Pontius_Pilate#Portrayals_in_film_/_television|Pilate]] is also depicted as having this speech impediment. Because of this, people around him often cannot understand his words, and he is mocked by the townspeople of Jerusalem when he talks to them in the square.
* In the 1986 animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the character Gussie Mouseheimer (voiced by [[Madeline Kahn]]) also replaces 'R' and 'L' with 'W', similar to Elmer Fudd, especially when saying the word 'rally', pronouncing it as 'wawwy'.
* In the 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', the character known as The Impressive Clergyman also has problems with multiple sounds, including "R" and "L". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/characters/nm0177228&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tony Angelino, a one-time character from [[Only Fools and Horses]], suffered from Rhotacism, becoming apparent during his stage performance of the [[Roy Orbison]] song "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]".
*[[Homestar Runner (character)|Homestar Runner]]

The '''Saskatchewan Organization for Heritage Languages''' (SOHL) is a provincial [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to promoting the study and teaching of [[heritage language]]s in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official SOHL Website|url=http://heritagelanguages.sk.ca/|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], it concentrates on languages other than [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's official languages of English and French]], and operates as an umbrella organization for groups, schools and individuals across the province. The SOHL was established in 1985.

The SOHL is governed by a Board of Directors and employs two permanent full-time staff members. Its membership consists of over 70 heritage language schools and [[multilingual]] organizations. Regular membership is open to any community-based non-profit organization in Saskatchewan involved in developing, teaching, and promoting the learning of heritage languages. Associate membership is open to individuals and institutions supportive of the aims and objectives of SOHL but not eligible for regular membership. Associate members cannot vote or hold office.

==History==
SOHL had its formal beginning on June 1, 1985, and was designated a non-profit PCO in August 1987. In 1994, SOHL hosted a national conference entitled “Speak Up, Speak Out!” It focused on the job and economic opportunities created by languages and on the importance of languages in the international marketplace. In 1996/97, SOHL introduced a new project - the Mini-Language Lessons Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mini Language Lessons Program|url=http://heritagelanguages.sk.ca/pages/mini-language-lessons-program|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the public and separate school systems. Heritage language teachers introduced students to the culture and language of various countries in the world.

A Future Search Conference was held in 1999. The purpose was to look at past accomplishments and achievements of SOHL, to look at its current state and to begin the process of creating a new vision for the future. In 2004, SOHL celebrated Heritage Languages Recognition Day with a Choral Festival. Due to the positive response, celebrations are now held annually in both Regina and Saskatoon to mark this occasion.

In 2005, SOHL celebrated its 20th Anniversary. Along with a special celebration at our conference, SOHL produced a Centennial History Book looking back at years of Heritage Language Schools in Saskatchewan. In 2008, SOHL celebrated UNESCO’s declaration of 2008 as the International Year of Languages. A special Yearbook was compiled and published, which outlines SOHL’s various activities, as well as those of MLAR, SIA, and the heritage schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOHL History|url=http://heritagelanguages.sk.ca/pages/sohl-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sightline''' (also '''sight line''') or '''visual axis''' is a normally unobstructed [[wikt:line of sight|line of sight]] between an intended observer (or spectator) and a subject of interest, such as a [[stage (theatre)|stage]], [[arena]], or [[monument]]. Sightlines are a particularly important consideration in [[Theatre (disambiguation)|theatre]] and [[stadium]] design, [[Junction (road)|road junction]] layout and [[urban planning]]. In cities such as [[London]], [[construction]] within sightlines is restricted to protect the key views of famous [[landmark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/vision/supplementary-planning-guidance/view-management [[London View Management Framework]] (LVMF) 2009.{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjects that have a direct line of sight with one another are said to be ''intervisible''.

==C-value==

[[File:Sightlines C-Value.jpg|thumb|The C-value is the vertical distance from the spectator eye to where it intersects the sightline of the spectator directly behind.]]
{{image frame|content=&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{D(N+R)}{D+T}-R&lt;/math&gt;|caption=&lt;br /&gt;
{{center|C-Value formula}}
*D = the horizontal distance from the eye to the point of focus
*N = the riser height
*R = the vertical height to the point of focus
*T = the seating row depth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Green Guide - Guide to safety at sports ground|publisher=Dept of Culture, Media and Sport|isbn=978-0-11-702074-0|pages=109|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/5153.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627082146/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/5153.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Good sightlines allow spectators to see all areas of a venue stage or field of play. To ensure this designers utilize the C-value, defined as the vertical distance from a spectator's eyes to sightline of the spectator directly behind. The C-value is determined in part by the [[Rake (theatre)|rake]], that is, the upward slope of the seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BLVed6z6hAC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=sightline+c-value&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim74X7gcrdAhVCy1QKHakYDQIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sightline%20c-value&amp;f=false|title=Sports architecture|last=Sheard|first=Rod|publisher=Spon Press|year=2001|isbn=9781138982833|edition=[New edition]|location=|pages=47|oclc=1017768626}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The stadium bowl rake if based on consistent C-values will follow half of a [[parabola]] in section. The curvature will be greatest closest to the pitch and will become an increasingly flatter curve as it moves to the upper rows. As a general rule the rake or curve of the seating bowl will flatten as the first row of seats move away from the side-line for a constant C-value. It is impractical to make different step heights for every single row. In practice the riser height is the same for a set of 4 or 5 rows at the bottom of the bowl with the number of rows in each same height set increasing for higher up rows. The uppermost tier could have only 2 or even 1 different step heights.

It is the lowest rows of seats that are the most sensitive to the impact of the C-value because of the very flat view angle to the touch line. The higher seats can have a reduced C-value without impacting as seriously on the clear view of the field of play.

==Sightlines in theatres==
Sightline criteria in theaters can include: the "isacoustic curve"&lt;ref&gt;Russell, John Scott. ''Treatise on Sightlines.'' Edinburgh new philosophical Journal 27, 1838.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=V-Q5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA419&amp;lpg=PA419&amp;dq=franklin+institute+isacoustic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ORD8qPlFCV&amp;sig=X3AFmX9YqBpkQVoO9-DEHgSb_W4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n_MmTs3tNaXu0gHx9bnkCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Journal of the Franklin Institute.'' Third Series, Vol. VI, July 1843, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birkmire, William H. ''The Planning and Construction of American Theatres.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1907, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; defined by [[John Scott Russell]] in 1838 and applied at the [[Auditorium Building]] in Chicago and the [[Emery Theatre]] in Cincinnati; alternate row sightlines where each patron sees between the heads of patrons in the row in front and over the heads of patrons in the second row in front; next row sightlines where each patron sees over the heads of patrons in the row immediately in front; and basic considerations like pointing the chairs more or less toward the performance, being able to see the conductor in the pit, being able to see other patrons, being able to see actors on elevated scenery, and not being obstructed by a wall, railing, column, ceiling overhang, loudspeaker cluster, or any other obstruction. The design of sightlines includes considerations of how much of the stage and scenery each patron can see. For example, can each patron see the top of the scenery or not, and can each patron see the whole stage floor or not? Design of sightlines is divided into two related exercises, vertical sightlines and horizontal sightlines. Design of proper sightlines includes resolving both technical and aesthetic issues. At issue is the emotional response of the audience: whether a performer can hold the audience's attention or not; whether the patron feels they had a "good" seat and their ticket was fairly priced or not; whether the audience gets the emotional impact of the performance or not; and whether the patron wants to come back and see another performance in that theater or not. Building codes restrict the maximum and minimum rise per row, limit the minimum width per row, limit the maximum deviation in the size of steps from row to row to achieve the curvature of the rake, and limit other aspects of sightline design.

It is recommended that a spectator's eye height must not be lower than 800&amp;nbsp;mm above the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Green Guide - Guide to safety at sports ground|publisher=Dept of Culture, Media and Sport|isbn=978-0-11-702074-0|pages=117|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/5153.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627082146/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/5153.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in larger theatres it is acceptable to locate the eye height of the first row on the level of the stage.

==Sightlines in stadiums==
The spectator view in modern stadia is optimised very carefully to balance the uninterrupted clear view to the field for every seat whilst not making the seating terraces any higher than necessary to satisfy structure, cost and safety considerations. [[File:C-Value section.jpg|thumb|Typical Architectural Section of a stadium.]] This is done with careful modelling utilizing the C-Value to ensure the ideal rake or curvature of the seating bowl. C-values are improved with a steeper slope or moving the seating rows away from the focus point. Inadequate views result in spectators jumping up for a better view during exciting play. This is an annoyance to others and can lead to fights and in the context of large crowds this can be a serious safety threat. The maximum step height between terraces or rows is usually limited to 540mm. If this is exceeded then a continuous guardrail is required as protection against falling. Even with a 540mm terrace step many spectators become uncomfortable and start to feel the impact of vertigo. An ideal maximum terrace step height that will avoid most people feeling insecure is 450mm.

===Sightlines in plan===
[[File:Sightline to far end corner flag.JPG|thumb|The illustration indicates the partially obstructed view of the front row spectators looking at the far corner flag of the adjacent touchline. One eye can see the action on the field whilst vision to the second eye is blocked.]]
The C-Value considers the sightlines in the vertical plane. The sightlines in the horizontal plane need to be considered for the front row spectators in the instance where they look acutley sideways, typically adjacent far end corner flag. At the extreme end of the front row, spectators could have their view from one of their eyes blocked by the head of the adjacent spectator. During exciting play this can lead to spectators jumping up out of their seats to get a better view. A clear view for both eyes for all front row spectators can be achieved by the use of curved stands in plan. It can also be argued that with play that is already a long distance away a better view of the game is available on the big video screen.

===Focus point===
The touch-line (or side-line) and the goal-line are considered the C-Value focus point in Stadia.

==Obstructed view seats==
There should be a clear view of the playing field from all seats. Roof supports should be eliminated entirely from the seating area.
In calculating the sight lines it should be appreciated that advertising boards of 90–100&amp;nbsp;cm in height may be erected around the field at a distance of five metres from the touch lines and five metres behind the centre of the goal lines. FIFA ticketing carry out an assessment of all seats and those seats that have an obstructed view of the game will be classed obstructed view seats and will not be sold. Quite often these are the first few seats adjacent to the pitch with their view partially blocked by the advertising hoardings. This is an especially big problem with football stadiums that have running tracks around them. These seats are either covered with a fabric and not occupied during the game or the tickets are issued to non-paying spectators.

==FIFA C-Value standards==
6&amp;nbsp;cm absolute minimum

9&amp;nbsp;cm recommended minimum

12&amp;nbsp;cm optimum

== Research ==
The audience's sightline is an important aspect of the design of viewing venues. For theaters, an algorithm is used to check the sightline from a seat to determine if it is blocked.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; The development of better methods is the subject of continuing research. In 2011, Yeonhee Kim and Ghang Lee presented an algorithm to derive actual sight area in the early design stage of theater without producing a 3D model.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; The algorithm uses plan and cross sectional drawings to analyze view of audiences to resolve to address errors of the "sight area rate" algorithm which does not account for sightlines being blocked by the front-row seats in a theater.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41182%28416%2987 | title=A Study of Sight Area Rate Analysis Algorithm on Theater Design. |author1=Kim, Y. |author2=Lee, G. |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Computing in Civil Engineering | year=2011 | pages=706–712 | doi=10.1061/41182(416)87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South Oran Berber''', or '''Figuig Berber''' (''Figig''), is a cluster of the [[Zenati languages]], which belong to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic family]].&lt;ref&gt;This language has no established name in English; in French literature it is referred to as ''Kçours du Sud-Oranais'' or ''parlers des Kçours Oranais et de Figuig'', and its speakers mostly call it by the vague term ''Shelha'' or ''Tashelhiyt''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken in a number of oases of southwestern [[Algeria]] and across the border in [[Morocco]].

These areas include most of the [[ksar|ksour]] (fortified villages) between [[Mecheria]] and [[Béni Abbès]]: [[Tiout, Algeria|Tiout]], [[Ain Sfisifa]], [[Boussemghoun]], [[Moghrar]], [[Chellala]], [[Asla]], [[Fendi]], [[Mougheul]], [[Lahmar]], [[Boukais]], [[Sfissifa]], [[Ouakda]], [[Barrbi]] near [[Taghit]], [[Igli, Algeria|Igli]], [[Mazzer]] in Algeria, [[Iche, Morocco|Iche]], [[Ain Chair]] and the seven ksour of [[Figuig]] (Ait Wadday, Ait Amar, Ait Lamiz, Ait Sliman, Ait Anaj, Ait Addi and Iznayen)&lt;ref name="unsc-fig" /&gt; in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;André Basset, La langue berbère dans les territoires du sud,  ''Revue Africaine'' vol. 85, 1941,  pp. 62-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these towns, the only one whose dialect has been studied in any detail is Figuig (Kossmann 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Maarten Kossmann, ''Grammaire du parler berbère de Figuig: Maroc oriental'', Peeters 1997 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZHi3MZgDI0UC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; A cursory study of the northern dialects, including texts and vocabulary, is Basset (1885),&lt;ref&gt;[[René Basset]]: "Notes de lexicographie berbère 3e série : dialecte des k'çours oranais et de Figuig" in Journal Asiatique 1885 t. II pp. 302-371&lt;/ref&gt; while a sketch grammar of its southernmost member, Igli, is provided by Kossmann (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Maarten Kossmann, "Grammatical notes on the Berber dialect of Igli (Sud oranais, Algeria)", in ed. D. Ibriszimow, M. Kossmann, H. Stroomer, R. Vossen, ''Études berbères V – Essais sur des variations dialectales et autres articles''.  Köln: Rüdiger Köppe, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other Berber varieties, the Figuig Berber dialects use bipartite verbal negation. The preverbal negator is ''ul'' (locally ''un'', ''il''); the postverbal negator is ''ša'' (Igli, Mazzer) / ''šay'' (Figuig, Iche, Moghrar) / ''iš'' (Boussemghoun, Ain Chair), with both the latter two appearing as [[allomorphs]] in Tiout.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, ''op. cit.'':94&lt;/ref&gt; The numerals 1 and 2 are Berber, while higher numerals are Arabic borrowings throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, ''op. cit.'':84&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Valod]], a small town near [[Bardoli]] in [[South Gujarat]] on 30 May 1921. He did his schooling from Songadh and Gangadhara. He [[matriculation|matriculated]] from [[Navsari]] in 1938. He completed his BA in 1943 and MA from [[Elphinstone College]] in 1945. In the same year, he started teaching at D. J. Singh College in [[Karachi]] and later joined [[Sardar Patel University]], [[Vallabh Vidyanagar]] in 1947. From 1951, he served as a lecturer, professor and later as Head of the Gujarati Department at the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]], [[Vadodara]] till his retirement in 1981.&lt;ref name= "agsi"&gt;{{cite book|title=અર્વાચીન ગુજરાતી સાહિત્યનો ઈતિહાસ - આધુનિક અને અનુઆધુનિક યુગ (History of Modern Gujarati Literature – Modern and Postmodern Era)|first=Prasad|last=Brahmabhatt |publisher=Parshwa Publication|location=Ahmedabad|year=2010|pages=22–33|language=gu|isbn=978-93-5108-247-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp&gt;{{Cite web|title =સુરેશ જોષી (Suresh Joshi)|url = http://gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Suresh-Joshi.html|website =[[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]]|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Panchal|first=Shirish|author-link=Shirish Panchal|title=Makers of Indian Literature: Suresh Joshi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AMOIkTYkOQC&amp;pg=PP2|year=2004|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1922-9|pages=2–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early life was spent at Songadh which influenced his life. At the age of eight, he secretly published his poem in ''Baljeevan'' magazine. He edited ''Falguni'' magazine in his college life. ''Upjati'' (1956) was his first published work. He had also edited ''Manisha'', ''Kshitij'', ''Etad'' and ''Uhapoh'' magazines.&lt;ref name= "agsi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm20cgl/&gt;

A strong opponent of romantic tendencies in literature, Joshi influenced many up-and-coming writers in the 1960s and 1970s. His personal essays "are said to have introduced a new prose style in [[Gujarati literature]]," according to Gujarati scholar Sarala Jag Mohan.&lt;ref name=sm20cgl&gt;Mohan, Sarala Jag, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;dq=Urdu+poets&amp;num=100&amp;output=html Chapter 4: "Twentieth-Century Gujarati Literature"] (Google books link), in Natarajan, Nalini, and Emanuel Sampath Nelson, editors, ''Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India'', Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-313-28778-7}}, retrieved 10 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt; He was influenced by efforts of experimentation in western literature.&lt;ref name="Sivasankari1998"/&gt;

He was one of the chief exponents of [[experimentalism|experimentalist]] poetry in Gujarati, primarily through his literary criticism, rather than his poems. Under his influence, form, technique and structure became far more important considerations within Gujarati poetry. The torments of the individual and literary craftsmanship became more highly esteemed, but intelligibility, lyricism and musicality were valued less, as were social concerns of the writer and even the contents of the work, according to Deepak B. Mehta.&lt;ref name=mil&gt;George, K. M., editor, ''Modern Indian Literature: An Anthology'', published by Sahitya Akademi, 1992, {{ISBN|978-81-7201-324-0}}, Chapter: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vfSPI2irzUgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA100,M1 "Modern Gujarati Literature"] by Deepak B. Mehta&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] were prime interests of his.&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm20cgl/&gt;

==Works==
Suresh Joshi was a modernist author who led the modernist movement in [[Gujarati literature]] which emerged after 1955, the post-Gandhian era.&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt; He is recognized as the father of modern Gujarati literature&lt;ref name="Sivasankari1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sivasankari|title=Knit India through literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PVjAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Eastwest Books|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the leader of [[avant-garde]] writers in Gujarati.&lt;ref name="Devy2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.

''Upjati'' (1956), ''Pratyancha'' (1961), ''Itara'' (1973) and ''Tathapi'' (1980) are his poetry collection. He withdrawn his first publication ''Upjati'' on his second publication.&lt;ref name= "agsi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm20cgl/&gt; Through his poems, he introduced obscurity and ambiguity to Gujarati literature.&lt;ref name="Tripathi 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Tripathi | first=Salil | title=A new generation of poets from Gujarat is keeping a rich poetic legacy alive | website= [[LiveMint]] | date=2018-02-16 | url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/WxQCScWHU7AACzKudTj58I/A-new-generation-of-poets-from-Gujarat-is-keeping-a-rich-poe.html | access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His four novels are collectively published as ''Kathachatushtay''. Two of them, ''[[Chhinnapatra]]'' (1965) and ''[[Maranottar]]'' (1973) were already published before. ''Vidula'' and ''Kathachakra'' were published before with other short stories but Joshi considered them as novels and published again with other two.&lt;ref name= "agsi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt; ''Chhinnapatra'' was translated into English by [[Tridip Suhrud]] as ''Crumpled letters'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Jolly2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaretta Jolly|title=Encyclopedia of Life Writing: Autobiographical and Biographical Forms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pedJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1087|accessdate=27 January 2017|date=4 December 2013|publisher=[[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-136-78744-7|page=1087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very experimental in [[novella]]s. He transformed the genre in Gujarati literature by his continued experimentation and esthetics. ''Grihapravesh'' (1957), ''Biji Thodik Vartao'' (1958), ''Apich'' (1965), ''Na Tatra Suryo Bhati'' (1967), ''Ekda Naimisharanye'' (1980) are his collection of stories which include 62 novellas. His 21 stories were collected in ''Maniti Anmaniti'' (1982), edited by Shirish Panchal.&lt;ref name= "agsi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm20cgl/&gt; He promoted a theory of fiction known as ''Ghatanavilop'' which focuses on suggestive potential of language instead of plot element in fiction.&lt;ref name="Devy2002"/&gt;

''Janantike'' (1965) is his first collection of essays. His other essay collections are ''Idam Sarvam'' (1971), ''Ahobat Kim Ashcharyam'' (1975), ''Iti Me Iti'' (1987). ''Bhavyami'' (1984) includes selected essays edited by Shirish Panchal from his more than thousand essays.&lt;ref name= "agsi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm20cgl/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trust1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Book Trust|title=Masterpieces of Indian literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXFOAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher=National Book Trust|isbn=978-81-237-1978-8|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Janantike'' was translated into English by V Y Kantak as ''Intimated Asides'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Navgujarat Samay 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=‘માનવીની ભવાઈ’નો સુંદર અંગ્રેજી અનુવાદ -Navgujarat Samay | website=Navgujarat Samay | date=2014-05-24 | url=http://navgujaratsamay.indiatimes.com/navgujarat-samay-supplementaries-gujarati-columnist/kadar-ane-kitab/articleshow/35558013.cms | language=gu | access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a reformer in field of literary criticism. His first work of citicism ''Kinchit'' (1960) rebelled against established norms. ''Gujarati Kavitano Aswad'' (1962), ''Kavyacharcha'' (1971), ''Kathopkathan'', ''Shrunavantu'' (1972), ''Arunyarudan'' (1976), ''[[Chintayami Manasa]]'' (1983), ''Ashtamoahyay'' (1984) are his other collections of criticism.&lt;ref name= "agsi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panchal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm20cgl/&gt;

''Madhyakalin Gyanmargi Kavyadharani Bhumika'' (1978) is his research work. ''Jananti Ye Kimapi'' (1984) is collection of six essays edited by him which focuses on new movement in literary criticism. He edited some anthologies; '' Navonmesh'' (1971), ''Narharini Gyangeeta'' (1978), ''Gujarati Sarjanatmak Gadya: Ek Sankalan'' (1981), ''Vastana Pado'' (1983). ''Parakiya'' (1975) his collection of translation of fine world poetry. ''Dhire Vahe Chhe Don'' Volume I (1960) and ''Bhonytaliyano Adami'' (1967) are translations of Russian novels. ''Shikari Bandook ane Hajar Saraso'' (1975) is translation of Japanese stories. ''Ameriki Tunki Varta'' (1967) is translation of ''The Short Story in America'' by [[Raymond B. West]]. ''Amerikana Sahityano Itihas'' (1965) is translation of book by Marks Cliff.

'''Thangar Bachan''' (born 1962) is an Indian film director and actor, [[cinematographer]] and novelist. He was born in Pathrakottai, a village near Panruti.

==Early life==
Thankar Bachan was born in Pathirakottai, a village near Panruti.

==Career==
Thankar Bachan was known for his contribution in portraying North Tamil Nadu villages which was not depicted in Tamil cinema properly.His story plots were set mostly at Panruti and surrounding villages. After Bharathiraja villages were best portrayed in Thangar Bachan movies. Bharathiraja himself declared that after him Bachan directs the best village films.

==Controversy==
Thankar Bachan has often faced criticism for his public speeches and notably had to face the wrath of actresses including Khushboo for saying that "women who acted mainly for money are akin to prostitutes". He later had to apologise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/sep/26khushboo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  During the audio launch of ''[[Aridhu Aridhu]]'', Thangar Bachan criticised some of the filmmakers in [[Kollywood]] for unnecessarily wasting more money on songs at foreign locations and technical extravaganzas in films that blatantly lacks a good concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southdreamz.com/21904/thangar-bachan-back-with-yet-another-controversy/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, under the purview of the [[Bell System]], local telephone calls were typically unmetered and included in [[flat rate]] billing. The term '''toll''' calling was adopted 
for [[long distance call]]s which were subject to [[Toll (telecommunications)|toll charges]].

In the UK, all calls were chargeable and the term [[Trunking|trunk calling]] was adopted for long distance calls. Initially a trunk call had to be booked in advance and a [[switchboard operator]] called the subscriber when the call set-up was completed; a process known as 'delay working'. Due to increasing demands for trunk calls from London and the associated delays in connecting them, calls to exchanges adjacent to the London director area were transferred to a new Toll exchange opened on 17 September 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1912to1968/1921.htm|title = BT PLC Group History|date = |accessdate = 14 October 2015|website = |publisher = BT|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls to toll area exchanges were connected on-demand whilst the originating subscriber waited thus improving service and reducing operator costs. The London Toll Area boundary was extended in 1923 and again in 1928, so that eventually Southampton, Portsmouth, Reading, Bedford, Colchester and the whole of Kent and Sussex were included. The system was later introduced to other large cities and remained in use until the late 1950s when, with the advent of Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD), Toll was eventually phased out. The name ''toll'' was probably taken from US usage.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the London telephone area, calls to subscribers who were not serviced by [[Director telephone system]]s within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by [[tandem exchange]] ''Toll A'': a subscriber would dial a prefix code, typically two letters plus zero, one or two figures (e.g. DA, EP5, LK85) followed by the number of the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange.  To avoid confusion, three-letter dialling codes were not used for calls from the director area to the fringe area, even if they corresponded to the same holes in the dial (e.g. the Hoddesdon and Mogador codes were HO3 and MO4 respectively).  Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were often given numerical codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number: these direct routings permitted the use of short unamplified lines.  For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial a code (typically 7, 87 or exceptionally 1), to wait for a second dialling tone, and to follow this with the three letters and four figures of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange ''Toll B'', from which the second dialling tone originated. To have a second dialling tone in this way was very unusual on the [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.

The distinction between ''trunk'' and ''toll'' became irrelevant when subscriber trunk dialling ([[subscriber trunk dialling|STD]]) was introduced.

==History==
In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth realms]], the term is to '''turn Queen's''' or '''King's evidence''', depending on the sex of the reigning monarch.&lt;ref&gt;W. McMordie, ''English Idioms and How to Use Them'' (Oxford University Press, 1954), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "turning approver" or "turn king's approver" was also historically used; an approver "not only admitted his own guilt to a crime but also incriminated his accomplices both past and present" in exchange for avoiding a [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death sentence]] (and obtaining a lesser penalty, such as [[life imprisonment]] or [[abjuration of the realm]]) or improving prison conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sara M. Butler, ''Forensic Medicine and Death Investigation in Medieval England'' (Routledge, 2015), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American parlance, a defendant who agrees to cooperate with prosecutors and give information against co-conspirators (often those with greater culpability) is also said to '''''flip'''''.&lt;ref name="Abadinsky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. West, ''Secrets, Sex, and Spectacle: The Rules of Scandal in Japan and the United States'' (University of Chicago Press, 2006), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Strohm, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/mueller-uses-classic-prosecution-playbook-despite-trump-warnings Mueller Uses Classic Prosecution Playbook Despite Trump Warnings], Bloomberg News (August 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evan Thomas, ''The Man to See'' (Touchstone, 1991), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses who have turned state's evidence have been important in [[organized crime]] cases in the United States, such as those against [[La Cosa Nostra]]. The first ''mafiosi'' who turned state's evidence, such as [[Joseph Valachi]] and [[Jimmy Fratianno]], did so in response to threats on their life from Mafia associates; later cooperators were motivated to cooperate in order to avoid heavy sentences, such as those provided for under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO Act]]. Some who turned state's evidence were permitted to participate in the [[Witness Security Program]] (WITSEC).&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Kelly, Ko-lin Chin, Rufus Schatzberg, "Without Fear of Retribution: The Witness Security Program" in ''Handbook of Organized Crime in the United States'' (Greenwood, 1994), p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the highest-ranking Mafia members to ever turn state's evidence was [[Salvatore Gravano]] ("Sammy the Bull"), an underboss of the [[Gambino crime family]] who pleaded guilty to 19 murders and agreed to testify against family boss [[John Gotti]]. (Gravano was sentenced to 20 years; Gotti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Lyman, ''Practical Drug Enforcement'' (3rd ed.: CRC Press, 2007), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Massino]] was also the first boss of one of the [[Five Families]] in New York City to turn state's evidence.&lt;ref name="ff 688"&gt;Raab, p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[writing]] and [[typography]], a '''ligature''' occurs where two or more [[grapheme]]s or letters are joined as a single [[glyph]]. An example is the character ''[[æ]]'' as used in English, in which the letters ''a'' and ''e'' are joined. The common [[ampersand]] (&amp;) developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters ''e'' and ''t'' (spelling ''et'', from the [[Latin]] for "and") were combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0043-ampersand.htm "The Ampersand &amp; More"] with Kory Stamper, part of the "Ask the Editor" video series at Merriam-Webster.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Bind rune|scribal abbreviation}}
The origin of typographical ligatures comes from the invention of writing with a stylus on fibrous material (like paper) or clay. Businessmen especially who needed a way to speed up the process of written communication found that conjoining letters and abbreviating words for lay use was more convenient for record keeping and transaction than the bulky long forms. The earliest known script, [[Sumerian cuneiform]], includes many cases of character combinations that, over time, gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Ligatures figure prominently in many historical manuscripts, notably the [[Brahmic family|Brahmic]] [[abugida]]s, or the [[bind rune]] of the [[Migration Period]] Germanic [[runic inscription]]s.

[[File:Broken l.svg|thumb|250px|Doubles ([[gemination|Geminated consonants]]) during the Roman Republic era were written as a [[sicilicus]].&lt;ref&gt;Capelli&amp;nbsp;– Dizionario di abbreviature latine ed italiane&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval era several conventions existed (mostly [[Diacritic|diacritic marks]]). However, in Nordic texts a particular type of ligature appeared for ''ll'' and ''tt'', referred to as "broken ''l''" and "broken ''t''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hit.uib.no/mufi/proposal/PUA-range5-v1.html Medieval Unicode Font Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Medieval scribes who wrote in [[Latin]] increased their writing speed by combining characters and by introducing [[notational abbreviation]]s. Others conjoined letters for aesthetic purposes. For example, in [[blackletter]], letters with right-facing bowls ('''b''', '''o''', and '''p''') and those with left-facing bowls ('''c''', '''e''', '''o''', '''d''', '''g''' and '''q''') were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed. In many script forms, characters such as '''h''', '''m''', and '''n''' had their vertical strokes superimposed. Scribes also used notational abbreviations to avoid having to write a whole character in one stroke. Manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations.

Modifications to script bodies like these usually originate from legal, business and monastic sources, with the emphasis shifting from business to monastic sources by around the 9th and 10th centuries.

[[File:Th Taumfel.jpg|thumb|250px|A widely-used Th ligature in a handwriting-style typeface]]

In [[Handwriting|hand writing]], a ligature is made by joining two or more characters in atypical fashion by merging their parts or by writing one above or inside the other. While in printing, a ligature is a group of characters that is typeset as a unit, and the characters do not have to be joined. For example, in some cases the '''fi''' ligature prints the letters '''f''' and '''i''' with a greater separation than when they are typeset as separate letters. When [[printing press|printing with movable type]] was invented around 1450,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/johannes-gutenberg-and-the-printing-press-1991865 |title=Johannes Gutenberg and the Printing Press |first=Mary |last=Bellis |date=17 April 2017 |website=ThoughtCo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters, as they were based on handwriting. Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another.

Ligatures began to fall out of use due to their complexity in the 20th century. Sans serif typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include [[Gill Sans]] and [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]]. Inexpensive [[phototypesetting]] machines in the 1970s (which did not require [[journeyman]] knowledge or training to operate) also generally avoid them. A few, however, became characters in their own right, see below the sections about [[#German ß|German ß]], [[#Letters and diacritics originating as ligatures|various Latin accented letters]], [[#Symbols originating as ligatures|&amp; et al.]].

The trend against digraph use was further strengthened by the desktop publishing revolution starting around 1977 with the production of the Apple II. Early computer software in particular had no way to allow for ligature substitution (the automatic use of ligatures where appropriate), while most new digital typefaces did not include ligatures. As most of the early PC development was designed for the English language (which already treated ligatures as optional at best) dependence on ligatures did not carry over to digital. Ligature use fell as the number of traditional hand [[compositor (typesetting)|compositors]] and [[hot metal typesetting]] machine operators dropped due to the mass production of the IBM Selectric brand of electric typewriter in 1961. A designer active in the period commented: "some of the world's greatest typefaces were quickly becoming some of the world's worst fonts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frere-Jones|first1=Tobias|title=Hoefler Text|url=https://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/overview/|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligatures have grown in popularity over the last 20 years due to an increasing interest in creating typesetting systems that evoke arcane designs and classical scripts. One of the first computer typesetting programs to take advantage of computer-driven typesetting (and later laser printers) was [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[TeX]] program. Now the standard method of mathematical typesetting, its default fonts are explicitly based on nineteenth-century styles. Many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets; these include [[FF Scala]], Seria and others by [[Martin Majoor]] and [[Hoefler Text]] by [[Jonathan Hoefler]]. [[Mrs Eaves]] by [[Zuzana Licko]] contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create dramatic display text with a feel of antiquity.
A parallel use of ligatures is seen in the creation of script fonts that join letterforms to simulate handwriting effectively. This trend is caused in part by the increased support for other languages and alphabets in modern computing, many of which use ligatures somewhat extensively. This has caused the development of new digital typesetting techniques such as [[OpenType]], and the incorporation of ligature support into the text display systems of [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and applications like [[Microsoft Office]]. An increasing modern trend is to use a "Th" ligature which reduces spacing between these letters to make it easier to read, a trait infrequent in metal type.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|date=12 May 2011|title=Flawed Typefaces|url=http://www.printmag.com/featured/flawed-typefaces/|website=Print magazine|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt Roman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulrich|first1=Ferdinand|date=22 July 2012|title=Hunt Roman|url=https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/hunt-roman/|website=Typographica|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Kerning Game"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|date=31 October 2011|title=The Kerning Game|url=http://www.printmag.com/featured/the-kerning-game/|website=Print|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, modern font programming divides ligatures into three groups, which can be activated separately: standard, contextual and historical. Standard ligatures are needed to allow the font to display without errors such as character collision. Designers sometimes find contextual and historic ligatures desirable for creating effects or to evoke an old-fashioned print look.

===Stylistic ligatures===
[[File:Ligature drawing.svg|right|Two common ligatures: fi and fl]]
Many ligatures combine '''f''' with the following letter. A particularly prominent example is '''ﬁ''' (or '''f{{zwnj}}i''', rendered with two normal letters). The [[tittle]] of the '''i''' in many typefaces collides with the hood of the '''f''' when placed beside each other in a word, and are combined into a single glyph with the [[tittle]] absorbed into the '''f'''. Other ligatures with the letter f include '''fj''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The combination ''fj'' is represented in [[English language|English]] only in "[[fjord]]" and "[[fjeld]]", but is encountered in languages where ''j'' represents a vocalic or semi-vocalic sound ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], occasionally in [[Esperanto]]) or an affix ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), or where word-compounding results such ligatures ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]])&lt;/ref&gt; '''f{{zwnj}}l''' (ﬂ), '''f{{zwnj}}f''' (ﬀ), '''f{{zwnj}}f{{zwnj}}i''' (ﬃ), and '''f{{zwnj}}f{{zwnj}}l''' (ﬄ). Ligatures for '''fa''', '''fe''', '''fo''', '''fr''', '''fs''', '''ft''', '''fb''', '''fh''', '''fu''', '''fy''', and for '''f''' followed by a [[full stop]], [[comma]], or [[hyphen]], as well as the equivalent set for the doubled '''ff''' and '''fft''' are also used, though are less common.

These arose because with the usual type sort for [[lowercase]] '''f''', the end of its hood is on a [[kerning|kern]], which would be damaged by collision with raised parts of the next letter.

Ligatures crossing the [[morpheme]] boundary of a composite word are sometimes considered incorrect, especially in official [[German orthography]] as outlined in the [[Duden]]. An English example of this would be '''ff''' in ''shelf{{zwnj}}ful''; a German example would be {{lang|de|Schiff{{zwnj}}fahrt}} ("boat trip").&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang|de|Schiff{{zwnj}}fahrt}} is written with ''ff{{zwnj}}f'' only if the writer follows the [[German spelling reform of 1996|spelling reform of 1996]]. The same standard explicitly allows the spelling {{lang|de|Schiff-Fahrt}} with dash to avoid the tripled f.&lt;/ref&gt; Some computer programs (such as [[TeX]]) provide a setting to disable ligatures for German, while some users have also written macros to identify which ligatures to disable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to [[LaTeX]], 3rd Ed. |author=Helmut Kopka |author2=Patrick W. Daly |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1999 |pages=22 |isbn=0-201-39825-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Loretan |first1=Mico |title=Selnolig |url=https://ctan.org/pkg/selnolig |website=[[CTAN]] |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Wheel Taumfel.jpg|thumb|Ligatures "Th" and "Wh" illustration]]

[[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] distinguishes [[dotted and dotless I|dotted and dotless "I"]]. In a ligature with ''f'' (in words such as {{lang|tr|fırın|translation=oven}} and {{lang|tr|fikir|translation=idea}}), this contrast would be obscured. The '''fi''' ligature is therefore not used in Turkish typography, and neither are other ligatures like that for '''fl''', which would be rare anyway.

[[File:Berliner Strassenschilder.jpg|right|thumb|280px|"ß" in the form of a "ſʒ" ligature on a street sign in Berlin ({{lang|de|Petersburger Straße}}). The sign on the right ({{lang|de|Bersarinplatz}}) ends with a "tʒ" ligature.]]
Remnants of the ligatures '''ſʒ'''/'''ſz''' ("sharp s", {{lang|de|eszett}}) and '''tʒ'''/'''tz''' ("sharp t", {{lang|de|tezett}}) from [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|Fraktur]], a family of [[German language|German]] [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s, originally mandatory in Fraktur but now employed only stylistically, can be seen to this day on street signs for city squares whose name contains {{lang|de|Platz}} or ends in {{lang|de|-platz}}. Instead, the "sz" ligature has merged into a single character, the [[#German ß|German ß]] – see below.

Sometimes, ligatures for '''st''' (ﬆ), '''ſt''' (ﬅ), '''ch''', '''ct''', '''Qu''' and '''Th''' are used (e.g. in the typeface [[Linux Libertine]]).

Besides conventional ligatures, in the metal type era some newspapers commissioned custom condensed single sorts for the names of common long names that might appear in news headings, such as "[[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]", "[[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]]", and others. In these cases the characters did not appear combined, just more tightly spaced than if printed conventionally.&lt;ref name="Nytimes Eisenhower"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=David|title=1952 – 'Eisenhower,' a True Campaign Logo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/insider/1952-eisenhower-a-true-campaign-logo.html?mcubz=1|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German ß===
{{Main|ß}}
The [[German language|German]] '''{{lang|de|Eszett}}''' (also called the {{lang|de|scharfes S}}, meaning ''sharp s'') [[ß]] is an official letter of the alphabet in Germany and Austria. There is no general consensus about its history. Its name {{lang|de|Es-zett}} (meaning S-Z) suggests a connection of "long s and z" (ſʒ) but the Latin script also knows a ligature of "long s over round s" (ſs). The latter is used as the design principle for the character in most of today's typefaces. Since German was mostly set in blackletter typefaces until the 1940s, and those typefaces were rarely set in uppercase, a capital version of the {{lang|de|Eszett}} never came into common use, even though its creation has been discussed since the end of the 19th century. Therefore, the common replacement in uppercase typesetting was originally SZ ({{lang|de|Maße}} "measure" → {{lang|de|MAS{{zwnj}}ZE}}, different from {{lang|de|Mas{{zwnj}}se}} "mass" → {{lang|de|MAS{{zwnj}}SE}}) and later SS ({{lang|de|Maße}} → {{lang|de|MAS{{zwnj}}SE}}). The SS replacement is currently the only valid spelling according to the official orthography (the so-called {{lang|de|Rechtschreibreform}}) in Germany and Austria. For German writing in Switzerland, the ß is omitted altogether in favour of ss, hence the German slur about the Swiss: ''»Wie trinken die Schweizer Bier? —&amp;nbsp;In Massen.«'' ("How do the Swiss drink beer? —&amp;nbsp;In mass" instead of two other meanings if it had been written as "in Maßen": one is "not too much", the other to drink out of jugs that hold exactly one [[Maß]] of volume).
Since 2008, the [[capital ẞ|capital version (ẞ)]] of the Eszett character is part of Unicode and appears in more and more typefaces. The new character has not yet entered mainstream writing. A new standardized German keyboard layout (DIN 2137-T2) has included the capital ß since 2012. Since the end of 2010, the {{lang|de|Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen (StAGN)}} suggests the new upper case character for "ß" rather than replacing it with "SS" or "SZ" for geographical names.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[http://141.74.33.52/stagn/Portals/0/101125_TopR5.pdf Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen (StAGN) Empfehlungen und Hinweise für die Schreibweise geographischer Namen für Herausgeber von Kartenwerken und anderen Veröffentlichungen für den internationalen Gebrauch Bundesrepublik Deutschland 5. überarbeitete Ausgabe]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusett ꝏ===
In the [[Massachusett writing systems|colonial orthography]] created by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], later used in the first Bible printed in the Americas, the Massachuset-language {{lang|wam|[[Eliot Indian Bible|Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God]]}} published in 1663, although Eliot had previously translated catechisms and published books of the Bible as well as trained Indians to become literate who in turn trained others. A prominent feature of the new orthography was his use of the double-o ligature "ꝏ" to represent the "oo" of "f&lt;u&gt;oo&lt;/u&gt;d" as opposed to the "oo" of "h&lt;u&gt;oo&lt;/u&gt;k", although Eliot himself used "oo" and "ꝏ" interchangeably. In the orthography in use since 2000 in the Wampanoag communities participating in the Wopanaak Language Reclamation Project, the ligature was replaced with the numeral 8, partly because of its ease in typesetting and display as well as similarity to the o-u ligature Ȣ used in Abenaki. For example, ''seepꝏash''&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, J. H. (1903). ''Natick Dictionary. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; (colonial) (''seep8ash'') (WLRP, modern).&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). Introduction to the wampanoag grammar. (Master's thesis). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Massachusetts Institute of Technology. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters and diacritics originating as ligatures===

[[File:Caslon Pro Ligatures.svg|thumb|250px|The ligatures of [[Caslon|Adobe Caslon Pro]].]]
As the letter '''[[W]]''' is an addition to the [[Latin alphabet]] that originated in the seventh century, the phoneme it represents was formerly written in various ways. In [[Old English language|Old English]], the [[runes|runic letter]] [[wynn]] (Ƿ) was used, but [[Normans|Norman]] influence forced wynn out of use. By the 14th century, the "new" letter ''W'', originated as two '''[[V]]'''s or '''[[U]]'''s joined together, developed into a legitimate letter with its own position in the alphabet. Because of its relative youth compared to other letters of the alphabet, only a few European languages (English, Dutch, German, Polish, Welsh, Maltese, and Walloon) use the letter in native words.

The character '''[[Æ]]''' (lower case '''æ'''; in ancient times named {{lang|ang|[[æsc]]}}) when used in the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], or [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] languages, or [[Old English language|Old English]], is not a typographic ligature. It is a distinct [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]—a [[vowel]]—and when alphabetised, is given a different place in the [[collation|alphabetic order]]. In modern [[English orthography]] '''Æ''' is not considered an independent letter but a spelling variant, for example: "[[encyclopædia]]" versus "encyclopaedia" or "encyclopedia".

'''Æ''' comes from [[Medieval Latin|Mediæval Latin]], where it was an optional ligature in some words, for example, "Æneas". It is still found as a variant in English and French, but the trend has recently been towards printing the '''A''' and '''E''' separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style, 14th Ed |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1993 |location=Chicago |pages=6.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, '''[[Œ]]''' and '''œ''', while normally printed as ligatures in French, are replaced by component letters if technical restrictions require it.

In [[German orthography]], the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlauted]] vowels [[ä]], [[ö]], and [[ü]] historically arose from ''ae'', ''oe'', ''ue'' ligatures (strictly, from superscript ''e'', viz. ''aͤ'', ''oͤ'', ''uͤ''). It is common practice to replace them with ''ae, oe, ue'' digraphs when the diacritics are unavailable, for example in electronic conversation. Phone books treat umlauted vowels as equivalent to the relevant digraph (so that a name Müller will appear at the same place as if it were spelled Mueller; German surnames have a strongly fixed orthography, either a name is spelled with ''ü'' or with ''ue''); however, the alphabetic order used in other books treats them as equivalent to the simple letters ''a'', ''o'' and ''u''. The convention in [[Scandinavian languages]] and [[Finnish orthography|Finnish]] is different: there the umlaut vowels are treated as independent letters with positions at the end of the alphabet.

The ''[[ring (diacritic)|ring]]'' [[diacritic]] used in vowels such as [[å]] likewise originated as an '''o'''-ligature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfcm/0489.html Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 33. Väderlek – Äänekoski / 905–906]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the replacement of the older "aa" with "å" became a {{lang|la|de facto}} practice, an "a" with another "a" on top (aͣ) could sometimes be used, for example in [[Johannes Bureus]]'s, ''Runa: ABC-Boken'' (1611).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.se/F1700/ABC.htm Bureus, J., Runa ABC boken]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''uo''' ligature [[ů]] in particular saw use in [[Early Modern High German]], but it merged in later Germanic languages with '''u''' (e.g. [[Middle High German|MHG]] {{lang|gmh|fuosz}}, [[Early New High German|ENHG]] ''fuͦß'', [[Modern German]] {{lang|de|Fuß}} "foot"). It survives in [[Czech language|Czech]], where it is called {{lang|cs|[[ring (diacritic)#Ring above|kroužek]]}}.

The ''[[tilde]]'' diacritic, used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as part of the letter ''[[ñ]]'', representing the [[palatal nasal]] consonant, and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[nasalization]] of a vowel, originated in ligatures where ''n'' followed the base letter: {{lang|es|Espanna}} → {{lang|es|España}}.&lt;!--needs Pt example--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.aulahispanica.com/origen-de-la-enie.html Origen de la 'Ñ']", Aula Hispanica.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[circumflex]] in [[French language|French]] spelling stems from the ligature of a silent ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;''Teach Yourself French''. Collier's Cyclopedia, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; The French, Portuguese, Catalan and old Spanish letter '''[[ç]]''' represents a ''c'' over a ''z''; the diacritic's name [[cedilla]] means "little [[z]]ed".

The letter [[hwair]] (ƕ), used only in [[transliteration]] of the [[Gothic language]], resembles a ''hw'' ligature. It was introduced by [[philology|philologists]] around 1900 to replace the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''hv'' formerly used to express the phoneme in question, e.g. by [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]] in the 1860s ({{lang|la|[[Patrologia Latina]]}} vol. 18).

The [[Byzantine]]s had a unique [[ou (ligature)|o-u ligature]] (Ȣ) that, while originally based on the [[Greek alphabet]]'s ο-υ, carried over into Latin alphabets as well. This ligature is still seen today on icon artwork in Greek Orthodox churches, and sometimes in graffiti or other forms of informal or decorative writing.

[[Gha]] (ƣ), a rarely used letter based on Q and G, was misconstrued by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] to be an OI ligature due to its appearance, and is thus known (to the ISO and, in turn, [[Unicode]]) as "Oi".

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] formerly used ligatures to represent [[affricate consonant]]s, of which six are encoded in Unicode: {{IPA|ʣ, ʤ, ʥ, ʦ, ʧ}} and {{IPA|ʨ}}. One [[fricative consonant]] is still represented with a ligature: {{IPA|ɮ}}, and the [[extensions to the IPA]] contain three more: {{IPA|ʩ}}, {{IPA|ʪ}} and {{IPA|ʫ}}.

The [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]], a short-lived alphabet intended for young children, used a number of ligatures to represent long vowels: ꜷ, æ, œ, ᵫ, ꭡ, and ligatures for ee, ou and oi that are not encoded in Unicode. Ligatures for consonants also existed, including ligatures of ʃh, ʈh, wh, ʗh, ng and a reversed t with h (neither the reversed t nor any of the consonant ligatures are in Unicode).

Rarer ligatures also exist, such as ꜳ; Ꜵꜵ; Ꜷ; Ꜹꜹ; Ꜻꜻ (barred ''AV''); Ꜽꜽ; Ꝏꝏ, which is used in medieval [[Old Norse|Nordic]] languages for {{IPA link|oː||/}} (a long [[close-mid back rounded vowel]]),&lt;ref name="L206027"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06027-n3027-medieval.pdf|title=L2/06-027: Proposal to add Medievalist characters to the UCS|date=2006-01-30|first1=Michael|last1=Everson|first2=Peter|last2=Baker|first3=António|last3=Emiliano|first4=Florian|last4=Grammel|first5=Odd Einar|last5=Haugen|first6=Diana|last6=Luft|first7=Susana|last7=Pedro|first8=Gerd|last8=Schumacher|first9=Andreas|last9=Stötzner}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in some orthographies of the [[Massachusett language]] to represent {{IPA link|uː||/}} (a long [[close back rounded vowel]]); ᵺ; Ỻỻ, which was used in [[Medieval Welsh]] to represent {{IPA link|ɬ||/}} (the [[voiceless lateral fricative]]);&lt;ref name="L206027"/&gt; Ꜩꜩ; ᴂ; ᴔ; and ꭣ.

===Symbols originating as ligatures===
[[File:etlig.svg|180px|thumbnail|An ''et'' ligature in a [[humanist script]]]]
The most common ligature is the [[ampersand]] '''&amp;'''. This was originally a ligature of '''E''' and '''t''', forming the [[Latin]] word "et", meaning "''and''". It has exactly the same use in [[French language|French]] and in [[English language|English]]. The ampersand comes in many different forms. Because of its ubiquity, it is generally no longer considered a ligature, but a [[logogram]].

Like many other ligatures, it has at times been considered a letter (e.g., in early Modern English); in English it is pronounced "and", not "et", except in the case of ''&amp;c'', pronounced "[[et cetera]]". In most fonts, it does not immediately resemble the two letters used to form it, although certain typefaces (such as [[Trebuchet MS]]) use the design &lt;span style='font-family: "Trebuchet MS", sans-serif'&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; in the form of a ligature.

Similarly, the [[dollar sign]] $ possibly originated as a ligature (for "pesos", although there are other theories as well) but is now a logogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cajori, Florian |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |location=New York |publisher=Dover (reprint) |year=1993 |isbn=0-486-67766-4}} – contains section on the history of the dollar sign, with much documentary evidence supporting the theory that $ began as a ligature for "pesos".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish peseta]] was sometimes symbolized by a ligature ₧ (from Pts), and the [[French franc]] was often symbolized by an F-r ligature (&lt;span style="font-family:Garamond,Anaktoria;"&gt;₣&lt;/span&gt;).

[[Alchemy]] used [[alchemical symbol|a set of mostly standardized symbols]], many of which were ligatures: 🜇 (AR, for [[aqua regia]]), 🜈 (S inside a V, for [[aqua vitae]]), 🝫 (MB, for ''balneum Mariae'' [Mary's bath], a [[double boiler]]), 🝬 (VB, for ''balneum vaporis'', a steam bath), and 🝛 (''aaa'', for [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]). In [[astronomy]], the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] is symbolized by a PL ligature, ♇. A different PL ligature, ⅊, represents the [[property line]] in surveying. In engineering diagrams, a CL ligature, ℄, represents the center line of an object.

===Digraphs===
[[File:IJ uppercase ligature.svg|180px|thumbnail|Uppercase [[IJ (digraph)|IJ]] glyph appearing as the distinctive "broken-''U''" ligature in [[Helvetica]] rendered by [[Omega (TeX)|Omega TeX]]]]
[[File:IJ (letter).svg|thumb|Comparison of ''ĳ'' and ''y'' in various forms]]

[[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]], such as ''[[ll]]'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Welsh language|Welsh]], are not ligatures in the general case as the two letters are displayed as separate glyphs: although written together, when they are joined in handwriting or [[italic type|italic]] fonts the base form of the letters is not changed and the individual glyphs remain separate. Like some ligatures discussed above, these digraphs may or may not be considered individual letters in their respective languages. Until the 1994 spelling reform, the digraphs ''[[ch (digraph)|ch]]'' and ''ll'' were considered separate letters in Spanish for [[collation]] purposes. Catalan makes a difference between "Spanish ll" or palatalized l, written ''ll'' as in ''llei'' (law), and "French ll" or geminated l, written ''l·l'' as in ''col·lega'' (colleague).

The difference can be illustrated with the French digraph {{lang|fr|[[œu (digraph)|œu]]}}, which is composed of the ligature {{lang|fr|[[œ]]}} and the simplex letter {{lang|fr|u}}.

[[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|[[IJ (digraph)|ĳ]]}}, however, is somewhat more ambiguous. Depending on the standard used, it can be considered a digraph, a ligature or a letter in itself, and its upper case and [[lower case]] forms are often available as a single glyph with a distinctive ligature in several professional fonts (e.g. [[Zapfino]]). [[Sans serif]] uppercase {{lang|nl|Ĳ}} glyphs, popular in the [[Netherlands]], typically use a ligature resembling a {{lang|nl|U}} with a broken left-hand stroke. Adding to the confusion, Dutch handwriting can render {{lang|nl|y}} (which is not found in native Dutch words, but occurs in words borrowed from other languages) as a {{lang|nl|ĳ}}-glyph without the dots in its lowercase form and the {{lang|nl|IJ}} in its uppercase form looking virtually identical (only slightly bigger). When written/typed as two separate letters, both should be capitalized – or not – to form a correctly spelled word, like {{lang|nl|IJs}} or {{lang|nl|ijs}} ([[ice]]).

==Non-Latin alphabets==

[[File:JanaSanskritSans ddhrya.svg|250px|thumb|The [[Devanagari]] ''{{IAST|ddhrya}}''-ligature (द् + ध् + र् + य = द्ध्र्य) of JanaSanskritSans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tdil.mit.gov.in/download/janasanskrit.htm |title=JanaSanskritSans |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160603/http://tdil.mit.gov.in/download/janasanskrit.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ligatures are not limited to Latin script:
*The [[Armenian alphabet]] has next ligatures: [[և]](also recognizes as letter), ﬔ, ﬕ, մն, ﬗ, ﬖ
*The [[Brahmic family|Brahmic]] [[abugida]]s make frequent use of ligatures in consonant clusters. The number of ligatures employed is language-dependent; thus many more ligatures are conventionally used in [[Devanagari]] when writing [[Sanskrit]] than when writing [[Hindi]]. Having 37 consonants in total, the total number of ligatures that can be formed in Devanagari using only two letters is 1369, though few fonts are able to render all of them. In particular, [[Mangal (font)|Mangal]], which is included with [[Microsoft Windows]]' Indic support, does not correctly handle ligatures with consonants attached to the right of the characters द, ट, ठ, ड, and ढ, leaving the [[virama]] attached to them and displaying the following consonant in its standard form.
*The [[Georgian script]] includes [[უ]] (uni), which is a combination of [[ო]] (oni) and the former letter [[ჳ]] (vie).
*A number of ligatures have been employed in the [[Greek alphabet]], in particular a combination of omicron (Ο) and upsilon (Υ), which later gave rise to a letter of the [[Cyrillic script]]—see [[Ou (letter)]]. Among the ancient Greek [[attic numerals|acrophonic numerals]], ligatures were common (in fact, the ligature of a short-legged capital [[pi (letter)|pi]] was a key feature of the acrophonic numeral system).
*Cyrillic ligatures: [[Lje|Љ]], [[Nje|Њ]], [[Yery|Ы]], [[Ot (Cyrillic)|Ѿ]]. [[Iotified]] Cyrillic letters are ligatures of the early Cyrillic [[decimal I]] and another vowel: [[A iotified|Ꙗ]] (ancestor of [[Ya (Cyrillic)|Я]]), [[E iotified|Ѥ]], [[Little Yus iotified|Ѩ]], [[Big Yus iotified|Ѭ]], [[Yu (Cyrillic)|Ю]] (descended from another ligature, [[Uk (Cyrillic)|Оу]], an early version of [[У]]). Two letters of the [[Serbian Cyrillic]] alphabet, [[lje]] and [[nje]] (љ, њ), were invented by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] for use in his 1818 ''Serbian Dictionary'', replacing the earlier digraphs ⟨ль⟩ and ⟨нь⟩, as ligatures of Cyrillic [[El (Cyrillic)|El]] and [[En (Cyrillic)|En]] (л, н) with the [[soft sign]] (ь). [[Yae (Cyrillic)|Yae]], a ligature of ya (Я) and e also exists: Ԙ, ԙ, as do [[Dzze]] (Ꚉ, ꚉ ← Д + З) and [[Zhwe]] (Ꚅ, ꚅ ← З + Ж).
*Some forms of the [[Glagolitic]] script, used from Middle Ages to the 19th century to write some Slavic languages, have a box-like shape that lends itself to more frequent use of ligatures.
*{{anchor|'HEBREW LIGATURE ALEF LAMED' (U+FB4F)}}In the [[Hebrew alphabet]], the letters [[aleph]] &lt;span style="font-family:'serif'; font-size:150%; line-height:1em;"&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; and [[lamed]] &lt;span style="font-family:'serif'; font-size:150%; line-height:1em;"&gt;ל&lt;/span&gt; can form a ligature (&lt;span style="font-family:'serif'; font-size:150%; line-height:1em;"&gt;ﭏ&lt;/span&gt;). The ligature appears in some pre-modern texts (mainly religious), or in [[Judeo-Arabic]] texts, where that combination is very frequent, since ''[ʔ] [a]l-'' (written [[aleph]] plus [[lamed]], in the Hebrew script) is the definite article in Arabic.
*In the [[Arabic alphabet]], historically a [[cursive]] derived from the [[Nabataean alphabet]], most letters' shapes depend on whether they are followed (word-initial), preceded (word-final) or both (medial) by other letters. For example, Arabic [[م|mīm]], isolated {{lang|ar|م}}, tripled (''mmm'', rendering as initial, medial and final): {{lang|ar|ممم}}. Notable are the shapes taken by [[lām]] + [[ʼalif]] isolated: {{lang|ar|ﻻ}}, and lām + ʾalif medial or final: {{lang|ar|ﻼ}}. Unicode has a special ''[[Allah]]'' ligature at U+FDF2: {{lang|ar|ﷲ}}.
*[[Urdu]] (one of the main languages of South Asia), which uses a calligraphic version of the Arabic-based [[Nastaʿlīq script]], requires a great number of ligatures in digital typography. [[InPage]], a widely used [[desktop publishing]] tool for Urdu, uses Nasta`liq fonts with over 20,000 ligatures.
*In [[American Sign Language]] a ligature of the [[American manual alphabet]] is used to sign "I love you", from the English [[initialism]] ILY. It consists of the little finger of the letter I plus the thumb and forefinger of the letter L. The letter Y (little finger and thumb) overlaps with the other two letters.
*The [[Japanese language]] has a number of obsolete [[kana ligature]]s. Of these, only two are widely available ones on computers: one for [[hiragana]], [[Yori (kana)|ゟ]], which is a vertical writing ligature of the characters [[Yo (kana)|よ]] and [[Ri (kana)|り]]; and one for [[katakana]], [[Koto (kana)|ヿ]], which is a vertical writing ligature of the characters [[Ko (kana)|コ]] and [[To (kana)|ト]].
*[[Lao language|Lao]] uses three ligatures, all comprising the letter ຫ (h). As a tonal language, most consonant sounds in Lao are represented by two consonants, which will govern the tone of the syllable. Five consonant sounds are only represented by a single consonant letter (ງ (ŋ), ນ (m), ມ (n), ລ (l), ວ (w)), meaning that one cannot render all the tones for words beginning with these sounds. A silent ຫ indicates that the syllable should be read with the tone rules for ຫ, rather than those of the following consonant. Three consonants can form ligatures with the letter ຫ. ຫ+ນ=ໜ (n), ຫ+ມ=ໝ (m) and ຫ+ລ=ຫຼ (l). ງ (ŋ) and ວ (w) just form clusters: ຫງ (ŋ) and ຫວ (w). ລ (l) can also be used written in a cluster rather than as a ligature: ຫລ (l).
*In many [[runes|runic]] texts ligatures are common. Such ligatures are known as bind-runes and were optional.

===Chinese ligatures===
[[File:Hxkm zhongwen kanji.svg|thumb|left|100px|A Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|[[chéngyǔ]]}} (expression) written as a ligature. It reads {{lang|zh-Latn|Kǒng Mèng hàoxué}} &lt;big&gt;({{lang|zh|孔孟好學}})&lt;/big&gt; and means "to be as studious as [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]]."]]
{{see also|Polysyllabic Chinese character}}
[[Written Chinese]] has a long history of creating new characters by merging parts or wholes of other [[Chinese character]]s. However, a few of these combinations do not represent [[morpheme]]s but retain the original multi-character (multiple morpheme) reading and are therefore not considered true characters themselves. In Chinese, these ligatures are called {{lang|zh-Latn|héwén}} ({{wikt-lang|zh|合文}}) or {{lang|zh-Latn|héshū}} ({{lang|zh|合書}}); see [[polysyllabic Chinese character]]s for more.

One popular ligature used on {{lang|zh-Latn|[[chūntiē]]}} decorations used for [[Chinese Lunar New Year]] is a combination of the four characters for {{lang|zh-Latn|zhāocái jìnbǎo}} ({{lang|zh|招財進寶}}), meaning "ushering in wealth and fortune" and used as a popular New Year's greeting.

}}
In 1924, {{lang|zh-Latn|Du Dingyou|italic=no}} ({{lang|zh|杜定友}}; 1898–1967) created the ligature {{lang|zh|圕}} from two of the three characters {{lang|zh|圖書館}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|túshūguǎn}}), meaning "library".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.stnn.cc:82/culture/splend/t20060421_196261.html '圕'字怎麼念？什麼意思？誰造的？]" ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' online. 21 April 2006. Retrieved 15 January 2011.{{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it does have an assigned pronunciation of {{lang|zh-Latn|tuān}} and appears in many dictionaries, it is not a [[morpheme]] and cannot be used as such in Chinese. Instead, it is usually considered a graphic representation of {{lang|zh-Latn|túshūguǎn}}.

In recent years, a Chinese [[internet meme]], the [[Grass Mud Horse]], has had such a ligature associated with it combining the three relevant Chinese characters {{lang|zh|草}}, {{lang|zh|泥}}, and {{lang|zh|马}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Cǎonímǎ}}).

Similar to the ligatures were several "two-syllable Chinese characters" ({{wikt-lang|zh|雙音節漢字}}) created in the 19th century as [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters]] for [[SI units]]. In Chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters, as {{lang|zh|厘米}} {{lang|zh-Latn|límǐ}} "centimeter" ({{lang|zh|厘}} centi-, {{lang|zh|米}} meter) or {{lang|zh|千瓦}} {{lang|zh-Latn|qiānwǎ}} "kilowatt". However, in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters, pronounced disyllabically, such as {{lang|zh|瓩}} for {{lang|zh|千瓦}} or {{lang|zh|糎}} for {{lang|zh|厘米}} – some of these characters were also used in Japan, where they were pronounced with borrowed European readings instead. These have now fallen out of general use, but are occasionally seen.&lt;ref name=vmair&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3330 "Polysyllabic characters in Chinese writing"], ''Language Log'', 2011 August 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer typesetting==
[[File:Ligatures.svg|thumb|right|300px|Some example ligatures in Latin script]]
The [[OpenType]] font format includes features for associating multiple [[glyph]]s to a single character, used for ligature substitution. Typesetting software may or may not implement this feature, even if it is explicitly present in the font's metadata. [[XeTeX]] is a TeX typesetting engine designed to make the most of such advanced features. This type of substitution used to be needed mainly for typesetting Arabic texts, but ligature lookups and substitutions are being put into all kinds of Western Latin OpenType fonts. In OpenType, there are standard &lt;code&gt;liga&lt;/code&gt;, historical &lt;code&gt;hlig&lt;/code&gt;, contextual &lt;code&gt;clig&lt;/code&gt;, discretionary &lt;code&gt;dlig&lt;/code&gt; and required &lt;code&gt;rlig&lt;/code&gt; ligatures. These can be enabled or disabled in [[CSS3]] using &lt;code&gt;font-feature-settings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=msdnFontFeature&gt;{{cite web|title=font-feature-settings property|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh869409%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|website=MSDN|publisher=MSDN|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TeX===

Opinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures. [[TeX]] is an example of a computer typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically. The [[Computer Modern]] Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures '''ff''', '''fi''', '''fl''', '''ffi''', and '''ffl'''. When TeX finds these combinations in a text, it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter.

===CSS===

[[CSS]] supports &lt;code&gt;font-variant-ligatures&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;common-ligatures&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;discretionary-ligatures&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;historical-ligatures&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;contextual&lt;/code&gt; are supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSS font-variant-ligatures Property|url=https://www.cssportal.com/css-properties/font-variant-ligatures.php|website=CSS Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ligatures in Unicode (Latin alphabets)===
This table below shows discrete letter pairs on the left, the corresponding [[Unicode]] ligature in the middle column, and the Unicode code point on the right. Provided you are using an [[operating system]] and [[Web browser|browser]] that can handle Unicode, and have the correct Unicode [[typeface|fonts]] installed, some or all of these will display correctly. See also the provided graphic.

[[Unicode]] maintains that ligaturing is a presentation issue rather than a character definition issue, and that, for example, "if a modern font is asked to display 'h' followed by 'r', and the font has an 'hr' ligature in it, it can display the ligature." Accordingly, the use of the special Unicode ligature characters is "discouraged", and "no more will be encoded in any circumstances".&lt;ref name="UniFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unicode.org/faq/ligature_digraph.html |title= Unicode FAQ: Ligatures, Digraphs, Presentation Forms vs. Plain Text|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Unicode has continued to add ligatures, but only in such cases that the ligatures were used as distinct letters in a language or could be interpreted as standalone [[Unicode symbols|symbols]].) Note, however, that ligatures such as æ and œ are not used to replace arbitrary "ae" or "oe" sequences; it is incorrect to write "does" as "dœs".
[[File:Word default no ligatures.tiff|thumb|[[Microsoft Word]] does not enable ligatures automatically. Here, with [[Gill Sans]] Light, the 'f' and 'i' appear superimposed when default settings are used.]]
Notably, [[Microsoft Word]] does not enable ligatures by default, partly for [[backward compatibility]] reasons due to its long history. This can be changed from the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box.

'''Tiri''' (Ciri, Tĩrĩ), or '''Mea''' (''Ha Mea''), is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] of [[New Caledonia]].

==Grammar==

===Pronouns and person marking===
Tîrî has two types of [[pronoun]]s: personal pronouns, which make reference to [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical case|case]], and impersonal pronouns, which only have one respective form and are more restricted in their use (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

Like all other [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominals]] in Tîrî, pronouns can occupy various positions throughout the [[Clause (grammar)|clause]] (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;37). They may appear as the nominal [[Subject (linguistics)|subject]] of the verb, marked by the subject marker ''nrâ'' and [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreeing]] in person and number with the subject pronoun in the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]; the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of a verb; the object of a preposition; or the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] of a predicate (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;37–38).

When they appear within the verb [[phrase]], personal pronouns show agreement in person and number with the nominal subject that optionally follows the predicate (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;38).
&lt;br /&gt;

|}
&lt;br /&gt;
Personal pronouns in Tîrî also mark listener [[clusivity]] in the first person non-singular, and are generally used for human referents (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;39). The below example shows appropriate usage of the third person singular '''nrâ''' (not to be confused with the latter '''nrâ''', which is acting as a subject marker for the optional nominal subject '''toni''').
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (1) ||'''''nrâ'''''||''fi''||''wai''||''nrâ''||''toni''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;go&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;already&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;SM&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;Tony&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=6| 'Tony has gone.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;39)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the third person pronoun can be used for non-human entities (while the first and second person pronouns generally only refer to humans), speakers tend to use it in its singular form even when there is more than one referent, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;39).
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (2) ||'''''nrâ'''''||''hô''||''nrâ''||''mêwe''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;sing&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;SM&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;bird&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=6| 'A bird (or birds) sang.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;39)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
As indicated in the table above, Tîrî pronouns change form depending on whether they are being used as subjective, objective or free forms, the latter encompassing a variety of other pronoun usages, such as pronouns that have been [[Topicalization|topicalized]] and occur sentence-initially, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40).
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (3) ||'''''nrô'''''||''u''||''ta''||''nrî''||''u''||''ta''||''ô-nrî''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;1SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;1SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;hit&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;1SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;hit&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;head-3SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=6| 'Me, I hit him; I hit his head.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;40)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
While they are classified as pronouns as they fill the subject pronoun slot, Tîrî's two impersonal pronouns show less flexibility than personal pronouns. They do not show any distinction for person or number and occur only in their respective forms of ''hêrrê'' and ''va'', are unable to appear anywhere other than the subject pronoun position (the first element in the verb phrase), and are never followed by a nominal subject (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;41).

Speakers use ''hêrrê'' to refer to any number of unspecified entities when they do not wish to or are not concerned with specifying a referent as the [[Agent (linguistics)|agent]] of an action (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;41), as in the example below.
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (4) ||'''''hêrrê'''''||''hôdrô''||''mwâ''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;IMPN&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;burn&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;hut&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=6| 'Someone burned the hut./The hut burned.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;41)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
This contrasts with the below example, which is more likely to be used by a speaker who wishes to imply that a particular person has committed the same act (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;42).
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (5) ||''nrâ''||''hôdrô''||''mwâ''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;burn&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;hut&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=6| 'He burned the hut.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;42)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
While ''hêrrê'' is typically used to refer to humans, the impersonal pronoun ''va'' is used similarly to refer to non-human referents, though this is not always the case (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;43). ''Va'' behaves much as the English pronouns ''it'' and ''that'' insofar as they can refer to both particular things (e.g. ''Did it bite you?''; ''What's that over there?'') as well as propositions (e.g. ''It's the truth.''; ''That's a lie.''), as demonstrated below (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;43).
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (6) ||'''''va'''''||''re''||''radio''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;IMPN&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;[[List of glossing abbreviations|ASS]]&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;radio&lt;/small&gt;

| ||colspan=6| 'That must be a radio.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;43)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;

|-
| ||colspan=6| 'It is not true.' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;43)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
Subject pronouns may be used in conjunction with the [[Grammatical tense|tense]]-[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] markers ''ei'' 'future' and ''a'' 'perfect, actual, definite', in which case a number of pronouns may change their phonological form (see the below example, in which the second person singular ''ke'' has been combined with ''a'') (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;170).
&lt;br /&gt;

|-

=== Possession ===
Tîrî, like most [[Oceanic languages]], exhibits many types of [[possessive]] constructions, including possessive [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]], possessive [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s and [[Bound form|bound-form]] [[noun]]s (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;144). Classic possessive constructions involve two [[Nominal sentence|nominals]] that indicate the [[referent]] of one is possessed by the other. Tîrî has two types of possessive relationships, [[inalienable possession]] and [[alienable possession]] (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;145). Inalienable possession describes an inherent relationship between two referents such as [[kinship]], while alienable possession describes a non-inherent relationship such as temporary ownership or voluntary association (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;145).

'''Table 1: Summary of Possession in Tîrî (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;155).'''

|}

==== Alienable possession ====
In Tîrî, alienable possession can occur in two ways. The first is when the noun possessed is followed by a possessive preposition and then by a [[pronominal]] or nominal processor (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;145). The second is when the [[noun]] possessed occurs in [[apposition]] with a possessive classifier (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;145).

===== Possessive prepositions =====
Prepositions are included in a closed set of grammatical words that are placed immediately before a [[noun phrase]] and express a [[syntactic]] relationship between the noun phrase and a predicate or another noun phrase (Osumi, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;145).

There are three possessive prepositional markers in Tiri: ''nrâ'', ''rre/rrê'', and ''ò'' and they occur between two nominals in the following structure.

NP&lt;sub&gt;(possessed)&lt;/sub&gt;       nrâ, rre/rrê, ò          NP&lt;sub&gt;(possessor)&lt;/sub&gt; (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;145).

'''Table 2: Tîrî Possessive prepositional morphemes (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;145).'''

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|ò

|}

''nrâ'' functions as both a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and possessive marker when it precedes a noun phrase. As a possessive marker, it links the possessor to the preceding noun phrase, suggesting temporary possession (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;145). In Tîrî, the majority of nouns can occur with ''nrâ.''

''An example of nrâ:''

|-
|

|POSS
|3SG
|-
|
| colspan="3" |‘his paper’ (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;145).
|}

The possessive marker variants ''rre/rrê'' are restricted to the nouns, ''mwâ'' ‘hut’, ''wâ'' ‘boat’ and ''ò'' ‘pot’ (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;146).

''An example of rrê:''

|
|Hut
|POSS
|1PL EXC
|-
|
| colspan="3" |‘our (not including you) hut’ (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;146)
|}

The possessed noun phrases that can occur with prepositions ''ò'' are limited to ''nre'' ‘fire, firewood’ or [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] with ''nre'': ''mee-nre'' ‘habitation’, ''pwò-nre'' ‘touch’, and ''mwârrâ-nre'' ‘fire flame’ (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;147). The possessive relationship expressed by ò is related to fire, with the purpose of warming oneself or cooking something.

''An example of ò:''
{|

|''nrü''
|-
|
|Fire
|POSS

|-
|
| colspan="3" |‘your fire’ (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;147)
|}

In these examples, the possessive prepositions, ''nrâ'', ''rrê'' and ''ò'' are between two nominals, as in the structure above.

===== Possessive Classifiers =====
Another type of alienability is in constructions where the possessed nouns occur in apposition with a possessive classifier. Possessive classifiers are always either bound to pronominal or nominal possessors and they function to determine the nature of possession rather than to classify it (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;49). In Tîrî, unlike other languages, any noun can occur with a possessive classifier. They consist of the following: ''e-,'' ''ere-'', ''hwee-'', ''odho-'', ''hwiie-'', ''êê-'' and ''hêê-'' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;49).

'''Table 3: Tîrî Possessive classifiers morphemes (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;50).'''
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|''hwee-''    
|General meat or egg, to be eaten
|-
|''odho-''    
|Things to be drunk
|-
|''hwiie-''

|''êê-''    
|Plants growing on possessor’s land, or to be planted 
|-
|''hêê-''    
|Refers to something that belongs to the possessor by law or custom
|}

In Tîrî, the possessive classifier can be placed before or after the noun possessed, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;149).

NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessed)&lt;/sub&gt;        POSS.CLASSIFIER  NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessor)&lt;/sub&gt;

OR,

POSS.CLASSIFIER NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessor)         &lt;/sub&gt;             NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessed)&lt;/sub&gt;

|
|fruit-man

|-
|
| colspan="2" |‘man’s oranges’ (Osumi, 1995, p. 149)
|}

==== Inalienable possession ====
Nouns that occur with inalienable possession are generally ones whose referents have no independent existence but are related to an entity (Osumi, 1995, p. 152). In Tiri, inalienable possession is the [[juxtaposition]]{{disambiguation needed|date=July 2017}} of two nouns in the following structure:

NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessed)&lt;/sub&gt; – NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessor)&lt;/sub&gt; (Osumi, 1995, p. 152).

===== Bound-form nouns =====
There are two types of bound-form nouns, bound nouns and link nouns. This class is inalienable as that the referents of the nouns are possessed in some inextricable way, for example, kinship and body parts.  In most cases, the possessor has no control over the possession.

====== Bound nouns ======

Bound nouns are those that either has possessive [[pronoun]] [[suffix]]es or are bound to a nominal possessor (Osumi, 1995, p. 59). They include nouns referring to kinship, body or plants or other inanimate parts, secretions or of the body or plant, personal attributes or properties and the effects or origins of human affairs (Osumi, 1995, p. 153).

They can also be bound to another [[Root (linguistics)|root]] either noun or [[verb]], in compound constructions (Osumi, 1995, p. 59). For example of ''afiraa''  'wife', where it is bound to the [[Third-person singular|third person singular]] possessive ''nrî'':

{|
|(16)
|''toni''
|''nrâ''
|''sùveharru''
|'''''afiraa'''-nrî''
|-
|
|Tony
|3SG
|love
|wife-3SG
|-
|
| colspan="4" |‘Tony loves his wife’ (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;59)
|}

'''Table 4: Examples of Bound nouns (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;60).'''

|(17)
|'''''nrîfò'''-rò''
|-
|
|Mouth-1SG
|-
|
|my mouth’ (Osumi, 1995, p. '''59''')
|}

====== Link nouns ======
Link nouns referents belong to similar categories of bound nouns such as kinship and body or plants or other inanimate parts. They are obligatorily linked to a pronoun or head of a pronominal phrase, where the possessive relationship is demonstrated by a link morpheme ''-nrâ-'' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;62)''.'' The construction has this following form:

NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessed)&lt;/sub&gt; – nrâ &lt;sub&gt;(link)&lt;/sub&gt; – NP &lt;sub&gt;(possessor)&lt;/sub&gt; (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;154).

When the possessor is the first person singular, the link morpheme ''-nrâ-'' is often omitted as seen below. 
{|
|(18)
|'''''panrea'''-rò''
|-
|
|aunt-1SG
|-
|
|'my aunt' (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;62)
|}

''-nrâ-''  is also identical in form to the general possessive prepositions. Therefore, link nouns are alike to free [[Proper noun|common nouns]] that are followed by the possessive ''nrâ.'' Both constructions are difficult to differentiate, the link nouns depict inalienable possession and cannot be separated from their possessor by an element (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;154).

This subclass of nouns includes some from the words in the following list.

'''Table 5: Examples of Link nouns (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;60).'''
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" |External body parts of animals or humans    
! colspan="2" |Secretions or body products of animals or humans       
|-

|Cheek 
|kòfio    
|Perspiration      
|-
|ôfaò    
|Horn (of cow)     
|nruâ    
|Dirt (of the body)      
|-
|jawe 
|Tail 
|tòghòrrò    
|Boil        
|}

There can also be morphological complex link nouns, which involve a bound noun or a location noun in the first position, with the link noun in the second (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;64).

Although the examples represented are not comprehensive for both bound and link nouns, they show that there is no structural distinction between the two subclasses. Analysis of a Tîrî [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] by Midori Osumi (1995, p.&amp;nbsp;65) found that there were thirty-three bound nouns referring to external body parts compared to only five link nouns. This indicates that there are semantic differences between subclasses. For example, among the five link nouns is ''ao-'' ‘cheek’ is the only one that refers to external human body parts while others refer to external animal and insect parts (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;65). This shows that all external human body parts are bound nouns, except for ''ao-'' in Tîrî (Osumi, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;65).

The '''vanguard''' (also called the '''advance guard''') is the leading part of an advancing [[military formation]]. It has a number of functions, including seeking out the enemy and  securing ground in advance of the main force.

== History ==
The vanguard derives from the traditional division of a medieval army into three ''[[Battle (formation)|battles]]'' or ''wards''; the Van, the Main (or Middle), and the [[Rearguard|Rear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Soldiers Lives through History: The Middle Ages |last=Rogers |first= Clifford|authorlink= Clifford J. Rogers |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood |location= Westport|isbn=978-0-313-33350-7 |page= 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Vanguard originates with the medieval French ''avant-garde'', i.e. "the advance guard". The vanguard would lead the line of march and would deploy first on the field of battle, either in front of the other wards or to the right if they stood in line.

The makeup of the vanguard of a fifteenth-century [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] army is a typical example. This consisted of 
*a contingent of foreriders, from whom a forward detachment of scouts was drawn
*the main body of the vanguard, in which there traveled civil officials and trumpeters to carry messages and summon the surrender of towns and castles, and 
*a body of workmen under the direction of the Master of Artillery whose job it was to clear obstacles which would obstruct the baggage and artillery travelling with the main army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Armies of Medieval Burgundy 1364–1477|last=Michael |first=Nicholas |year=1983 |publisher=Osprey|location=London |isbn=0-85045-518-9|pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an English force of [[England in the Middle Ages|the period]], the foreriders of the vanguard would be accompanied by the harbingers, whose job was to locate lodgings for the army for the following night.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (2007), pp 76–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forward detachments===
During the Soviet-German War (1941-1945), beginning in July 1943, the [[Red Army]] began forming, as part of its offensive doctrine, ''ad hoc'' vanguard formations called forward detachments ''[peredovye otriady]'', from army, corps and divisional units. Forward detachments brought together the mobile (motorized or mechanized) elements of the parent formation to play an exploitation role once a breakthrough of the German lines occurred. A rifle division, for example, might mount one or two battalions of infantry on trucks, with motorized antitank guns and motorized artillery in support.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Glantz, ''Colossus Reborn'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, pp. 110, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|History}}
{{Left communism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''World revolution''' is the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of overthrowing [[capitalism]] in all countries through the [[class consciousness|conscious]] revolutionary action of the organized [[working class]]. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allowed a [[revolutionary party]] to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a [[workers' state]] based on [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. In most Marxist schools, such as [[Trotskyism]], the essentially international character of the [[class struggle]] and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of [[socialism in one country]].

The end goal of such internationally oriented [[revolutionary socialism]] is to achieve [[world socialism]], and later, [[stateless communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1933/teaching/4.htm The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism] by [[Bukharin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm The State and Revolution — Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist movements==
The [[October Revolution]] of 1917  in Russia sparked a [[revolutionary wave]] of [[socialist]] and [[communist]] uprisings across Europe, most notably the [[German Revolution]], the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Revolution]], [[Biennio Rosso]] and the [[Finnish Civil War|revolutionary war in Finland]] with the short lived [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also [[Revolutions of 1917-23]].

Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that [[capitalism]] would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the [[Comintern]], founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the [[Russian Civil War]] into an essentially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide.
{{rquote|right|Revolutions are the locomotives of history.| [[Karl Marx]] &lt;ref&gt;''Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above 1928-1941'' by Robert C. Tucker, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992, {{ISBN|0-393-30869-3}}, pg 608&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see ''[[Socialism in one country]]''.

After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again.
As [[fascism]] grew in [[Europe]] in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the [[Comintern]] opted for a [[Popular Front]] with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of [[World War II]] in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's [[Western world|Western]] allies.

===After World War II===
A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the [[aftermath of World War II]], though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of [[anti-fascist]] resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in [[Eastern Europe]], meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, Western media criticized the lack of liberal democratic elements in their rise to power.  Nonetheless, Communist movements in Eastern Europe proliferated, even with some local cases independent of the USSR, such as the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], who also were integral in repelling fascism during World War II.

Revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]], the establishment of the [[New Left]] together with the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the militancy of the [[Black Panther Party]] and similar armed/insurrectionary "Liberation Front" groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the [[labor movement]] for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, "The East is Red, and the West is Ready". However, this [[Far left|radical left]] spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain [[right-wing]], economically [[conservatism|conservative]] ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by [[Thatcherism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Reaganomics]] in the [[United States]]) and also [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|free-market reforms in China]] and [[doi moi|in Vietnam]].

Within [[Marxist theory]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s concept of the [[labor aristocracy]] and his description of [[imperialism]], and{{spaced ndash}}separately, but not necessarily unrelatedly{{spaced ndash}}[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s theories regarding the [[deformed workers' state]], offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of [[proletarian internationalism]].

'''Yanesha'''' (Yaneshac̈h/Yanešač̣; literally 'we the people'), also called '''Amuesha''' or '''Amoesha''' is a language spoken by the [[Amuesha people]] of [[Peru]] in central and eastern [[Pasco Region]].

Due to the influence and domination of the [[Inca Empire]], Yanesha' has many loanwords from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], including some core vocabulary.  Yanesha' may also have been influenced by Quechua's vowel system so that, today, it has a three-vowel system rather than a four-vowel one that is typical of related [[Arawakan languages]].

==Phonology==
Yanesha' has 22 [[consonant]]s and 9 [[vowel]] phonemes. The consonants have a certain degree of [[allophone|allophonic]] variation while that of the vowels is more considerable.

#The affricates and {{IPA|/tʲ/}} are phonetically aspirated
#{{IPA|[ŋ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}}

Yanesha', similar to languages like [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Irish language|Irish]], and [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], makes contrasts between certain pairs of [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] and plain consonants:

* ''anap̃'' {{IPA|/aˈnax'''pʲ'''/}} ('he answered him') vs. ''anap'' {{IPA|/aˈnax'''p'''/}} ('he answered')
* ''esho'ta netsorram̃o'' {{IPA|/eˈʃota netsoˈʐa'''mʲ'''o/}} ('entered my saw') vs. ''esho'ta nenamo'' {{IPA|/eˈʃota neˈna'''m'''o/}} ('entered my mouth')
* ''ña'' {{IPA|/'''n'''ʲa/}} ('he') vs. ''na'' {{IPA|/'''n'''a/}} ('I')

The remaining two palatalized consonants, {{IPA|/lʲ/}} and {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, don’t offer a one-to-one contrast with plain consonants; the former because it is the only [[lateral consonant]] and so contrasts with no other phoneme on the basis of just palatalization; {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, while contrasting with {{IPA|/t/}}, also contrasts with {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and {{IPA|/tʂ/}}.  The bilabial palatalized consonants have a more perceptible palatal offglide than the alveolar ones.  Word-finally, this offglide is voiceless for {{IPA|/pʲ/}} and {{IPA|/lʲ/}} while being absent for {{IPA|/mʲ/}}.

Another general feature of Yanesha' is devoicing in certain contexts.  In addition to the devoicing of palatal offglides above, the [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] fricative {{IPA|/ʐ/}} is voiceless when word final ([[final devoicing]]) or before a voiceless consonant ([[regressive assimilation]]): ''arrpa'' {{IPA|/ˈaʐpa/}} ('here it is') → {{IPA|[ˈaʂpa]}}.  The [[approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} are voiceless before voiceless stops, as in ''huautena'' {{IPA|/wawˈteːna/}} ('barks') and ''neytarr'' {{IPA|/nejˈtaʐ/}} ('my door'); {{IPA|/j/}} is also voiceless before affricates and word-finally: ''ahuey'' {{IPA|/aˈwej/}} ('let's go').

Similarly, the stops {{IPA|/p/}},  {{IPA|t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] word-finally ''ellap'' {{IPA|/eˈlʲap/}} ('shotgun') → {{IPA|[eˈlʲapʰ]}}; preceding another stop or an [[affricate consonant|affricate]], a stop may be aspirated or unreleased so that ''etquëll'' {{IPA|/eːtˈkelʲ/}} ('a fish') is realized as {{IPA|[eetʰkelʲ]}} or {{IPA|[eetkelʲ]}}.  The [[velar consonant|velar]] fricative {{IPA|/x/}} is [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] to {{IPA|[h]}} before another consonant.

===Vowels===
Yanesha' has three basic vowel qualities, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and  {{IPA|/o/}}.  Each contrasts phonemically between short, long, and "laryngeal" or [[glottalization|glottalized]] forms.

Laryngealization generally consists of glottalization of the vowel in question, creating a kind of [[creaky voice]]. In pre-final contexts, a variation occurs—especially before voiced consonants—ranging from creaky phonation throughout the vowel to a sequence of a vowel, [[glottal stop]], and a slightly rearticulated vowel: ''ma'ñorr'' {{IPA|/maˀˈnʲoʐ/}} ('deer') → {{IPA|[maʔa̯ˈnʲoʂ]}}.  Before a word-final nasal, this rearticulated vowel may be realized as a syllabic quality of said nasal.  Also, although not as long as a phonemically long vowel, laryngeal vowels are generally longer than short ones.  When absolutely word-final, laryngealized vowels differ from short ones only by the presence of a following glottal stop.

Each vowel varies in its phonetic qualities, having contextual allophones as well as [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] in [[free variation]] with each other:

{{IPA|/e/}} is the [[vowel length|short]] phoneme consisting of phones that are [[front vowel|front]] and [[close vowel|close]] to [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]].  Generally, it is realized as close {{IPA|[i]}} when following [[bilabial consonant]]s.  Otherwise, the phones {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ɪ]}} are in free variation with each other so that {{IPA|/nexˈse/}} ('my brother') may be realized as either {{IPA|[nehˈse]}} or {{IPA|[nehˈsɪ]}}.

{{IPA|/eː/}} is the long counterpart to {{IPA|/e/}}.  It differs almost solely in its length, although when it follows {{IPA|/k/}} it becomes a sort of [[diphthong]] with the first element being identical in [[vowel height]] while being more [[retraction (phonetics)|retracted]] so that ''quë''' {{IPA|/keː/}} ('large kind of parrot') is realized as {{IPA|[ke̠e]}}.

Laryngeal {{IPA|/eˀ/}} consists of the same variation and allophony of the short phoneme with the minor exception that it is more likely to be realized as close following {{IPA|/p/}} as in ''pe'sherr'' {{IPA|/peˀˈʃeːʐ/}} ('parakeet') → {{IPA|[piˀˈʃeeʂ]}} 'parakeet'

{{IPA|/a/}} is the short phoneme consisting of phones that are [[central vowel|central]].  Its most frequent realization is that of an [[open central unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ä]}} (represented hereafter without the [[centralization (phonetics)|centralizing]] diacritic).  Before {{IPA|/k/}}, there is free variation between this and {{IPA|[ə]}} so that ''nanac'' {{IPA|/naˈnakʰ/}} ('exceedingly') may be realized as {{IPA|[naˈnakʰ]}} or {{IPA|[nanˈəkʰ]}}.  While the laryngeal counterpart is qualitatively identical to the short, the long counterpart, {{IPA|/aː/}}, differs only in that {{IPA|[ə]}} is not a potential realization.

{{IPA|/o/}} is the short phoneme consisting of phones that are [[back vowel|back]] as well as [[vowel roundedness|rounded]].  Generally, {{IPA|[o]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} are in free variation so that ''oyua'' {{IPA|/ojoˈwa/}} ('wild pig') may be realized as {{IPA|[ojoˈwa]}} or {{IPA|[ujuˈwa]}}.  The phone {{IPA|[ʊ]}} is another potential realization, although it most frequently occurs before stops so that ''not'' {{IPA|/not/}} ('my hand') may be realized as {{IPA|[nʊtʰ]}}.  {{IPA|[ʊ]}} is not a potential realization of long {{IPA|/oː/}} but both the long and laryngeal counterparts are otherwise qualitatively identical to short {{IPA|/o/}}.

===Phonotactics===

All consonants appear initially, medially, and finally with the exception that {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} do not occur word-finally. With two exceptions ({{IPA|/tsʐ/}} and {{IPA|/mw/}}), initial clusters include at least one stop. The other possible initial clusters are:
* {{IPA|/pw/}}, {{IPA|/pr/}}, {{IPA|/tr/}}, {{IPA|/kj/}}
* {{IPA|/tʃp/}}, {{IPA|/ʐp/}}, {{IPA|/tʃt/}}, {{IPA|/ʃt/}}

Word final clusters consist of either a nasal or {{IPA|/x/}} followed by a plosive or affricate: 
* {{IPA|/mp/}}, {{IPA|/nt/}}, {{IPA|/nk/}}, {{IPA|/ntʲ/}}, {{IPA|/ntʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ntʂ/}}

Medial clusters may be of two or three consonants.

===Stress===

Although apparently phonemic, stress tends to occur on the penultimate syllable but also in the ultimate.  Less frequently, it is antepenultimate.  Some words, like ''oc̈hen'' {{IPA|/ˈotʂen/~/oˈtʂen/}} ('comb'), have stress in free variation.

'''Yigal Mossinson''' (alternate spellings include Igal Mossinsohn and Yigal Mosenzon) (25 December 1917 – 1 May 1994) was an Israeli novelist, playwright, and [[inventor]]. He was the author of the [[Hasamba]] children's book series.&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;[http://www.ithl.org.il/page_13782 Igal Mossinsohn at ithl.org.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his many awards was the David's Violin Prize for "[[Casablan]]," the 1954 play upon which the Israeli [[musical comedy]] stage and screen hit, "Kazablan," was based."&lt;ref name="Almagor"&gt;[http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=342 Almigor, Dan, "Musical Plays on the Hebrew Stage," All About Jewish Theater.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mossinson was born in 1917 in the [[moshav]] [[Ein Ganim]] located near [[Petah Tikva]] and grew up in [[Tel Aviv]]. Later on Mossinson studied in [[Beit Alfa]] and in the [[youth village]] of [[Ben Shemen]]. Afterward he moved to the [[Kibbutz]] [[Na'an]], where he lived from 1938 to 1950. In 1943 Mossinson joined the [[Palmach]]. During that period Mossinson was arrested by the British and imprisoned in [[Latrun]]. In 1944 Mossinson published his first story in the newspaper "[[Al HaMishmar]]". During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] Mossinson served as a cultural officer in the [[Givati]] unit.

In 1953, following the publication of the novel "A Man's Way" ({{lang-he-n|דֶּרֶךְ גֶּבֶר}}) Mossinson had to leave the kibbutz; he moved to Moshav [[Beit Shearim]]. From 1952 Mossinson served for a year and a half as a press spokesman for the [[Israeli police]] and afterward as the spokesman of the [[Habima Theatre]].

In 1957 Mossinson founded the "Sadan" theatre in the Mughrabi Hall. The theater went bankrupt eventually and closed. In 1959 Mossinson moved to the United States where he pursued various businesses for a living.  During this period he helped adapt the play "Casablan" for the screen, with a film version (filmed in Greece) released in 1964.  In 1965 Mossinson returned to live in Israel, where he began his literary career.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt;

During the last years of his life Mossinson began developing a number of inventions that gained particular success.

==Family==
Mossinson had two children from his first marriage, two children from his second marriage, and two children from his third marriage. One of his brothers was the Israeli author [[Moshe Mossinson]] and his niece, the daughter of Moshe Mossinson, is the Israeli author [[Dvora Omer]].

==Work==
Mossinsohn's first story was published in 1944, and in 1950 the first volume of his "[[Hasamba]]" children's adventure stories was published.  The series, which eventually included 45 stories, won him "national acclaim" as a children's author.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt;
