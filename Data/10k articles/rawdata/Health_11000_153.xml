'''12-''O''-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate''' ('''TPA'''), also commonly known as '''tetradecanoylphorbol acetate''', '''tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate''', and '''phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate''' ('''PMA'''), is a diester of [[phorbol]] and a potent [[Tumor promotion|tumor promoter]] often employed in biomedical research to activate the [[signal transduction]] [[enzyme]] [[protein kinase C]] (PKC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Castagna | year = 1982 |title=Direct activation of calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase by tumor-promoting phorbol esters |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/257/13/7847.full.pdf | journal = [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]] | volume =  257 | issue = 13 | pages = 7847–7851 |pmid=7085651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Blumberg | year = 1988 |title= Protein kinase C as the receptor for the phorbol ester tumor promoters: sixth Rhoads memorial award lecture| journal = [[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]] | volume =  48 | issue =  | pages = 1–8| pmid = 3275491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Niedel | year = 1983 | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume = 80 | pages = 36–40 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.80.1.36 | title = Phorbol Diester Receptor Copurifies with Protein Kinase C | bibcode = 1983PNAS...80...36N | pmc = 393304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of TPA on PKC result from its similarity to one of the natural activators of classic PKC isoforms, [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. TPA is a [[small molecule]] drug.

In [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] biology, [[superoxide]] was identified as the major [[reactive oxygen species]] induced by TPA/PMA but not by [[ionomycin]] in mouse macrophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Swindle | year = 2002 |title= A Comparison of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Rat Peritoneal Macrophages and Mast Cells Using the Highly Sensitive Real-Time Chemiluminescent Probe Pholasin: Inhibition of Antigen-Induced Mast Cell Degranulation by Macrophage-Derived Hydrogen Peroxide|url=http://www.jimmunol.org/content/169/10/5866.full.pdf | journal = [[The Journal of Immunology]] | volume =  169 | issue = 10 | pages = 5866–5873 |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.169.10.5866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, TPA/PMA has been routinely used as an inducer for endogenous [[superoxide]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Huang | year = 2014 |title=Megakaryocytic Differentiation of K562 Cells Induced by PMA Reduced the Activity of Respiratory Chain Complex IV | journal = [[PLoS ONE]] | volume =  9 | issue = 5 | pages = e96246 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0096246| bibcode=2014PLoSO...996246H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TPA is also being studied as a [[medication|drug]] in the treatment of [[hematology|hematologic]] [[cancer]] {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

TPA has a specific use in cancer diagnostics as a B-cell specific [[mitogen]] in [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] testing. To view the chromosomes, a cytogenetic test requires dividing cells. TPA is used to stimulate division of B-cells during cytogenetic diagnosis of B-cell cancers such as [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The AGT cytogenetics laboratory manual''. 3rd ed. Barch, Margaret J., Knutsen, Turid., Spurbeck, Jack L., eds. 1997. Lippincott-Raven.&lt;/ref&gt;

TPA is also commonly used together with [[ionomycin]] to stimulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, and is used in protocols for intracellular staining of these cytokines.&lt;ref name="urlFlow Cytometry Intracellular Staining Guide"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ebioscience.com/resources/best-protocols/flow-cytometry/flow-cytometry-intracellular-staining-quick-guide.htm | title = Flow Cytometry Intracellular Staining Guide | date = | work = | publisher = eBioscience, Inc | accessdate = 2011-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TPA induces [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|KSHV]] reactivation in PEL cell cultures via stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. The pathway involves the activation of the early-immediate viral protein RTA that contributes to the activation of the lytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Adina|last2=Brodie|first2=Chaya|last3=Sarid|first3=Ronit|title=An essential role of ERK signalling in TPA-induced reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.|journal=The Journal of General Virology|date=April 2006|volume=87|issue=Pt 4|pages=795–802|pmid=16528027|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.321.5484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|doi=10.1099/vir.0.81619-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TPA was first found in  the [[croton (plant)|croton]] plant, a shrub found in Southeast Asia, exposure to which provokes a [[poison ivy]]-like rash.{{Citation needed| date=December 2012}} It underwent a phase 1 [[clinical trial]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Tim Ryan (D-OH)]] and [[John Fleming (U.S. politician)|Rep. John Fleming (R-LA)]].

According to the Caucus' webpage, its mission  is:
:"The mission of the Addiction Treatment and Recovery Caucus is to raise awareness and increase education regarding substance abuse and addiction treatment.  According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 23.5 million people aged 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol abuse problem in 2009, and only 2.6 million—11.2 percent of those who needed treatment—received it at a specialty facility.  Furthermore, substance abuse costs our nation more than $484 billion per year through lost earnings, health care expenditures, and costs associated with crime and accidents.This issue is also a pressing concern with our service men and women. The National Institute of Drug Abuse reports that combined with PTSD and TBI, substance abuse is a key concern with returning veterans. Prescription drug abuse has doubled among U.S. military personnel from 2002-2005 and tripled between 2005-2008. This caucus aims to help decrease the negative stigma that comes with these diseases and improve the lives of the people around the country suffering from addiction and substance abuse.

'''Sir Alexander Nisbet''' (1795–1874) was a [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]] notable for his role in early [[Penal transportation|convict transport]]s to Australia, and as H.M. Inspector of Hospitals for the [[Royal Navy]].

Alexander Nisbet was born in Scotland, son of Captain Alexander Nisbet, and joined the British [[Royal Navy Medical Service]] in 1812. He saw active service during the [[War of 1812|American War]] (1812-1814). In 1823 he completed a doctorate in medicine at [[Edinburgh University]], submitting a dissertation entitled ''Pneumonia Typhode''; and, began a long and successful career as a surgeon-superintendent serving on seven convict ships transporting convicts from Great Britain to Australia (1824-1840).

In 1844 Alexander became Deputy Director of Hospitals at [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich]]. On 12 December 1854, at Arley, Staffordshire, he married Lucy Susannah Davenport, daughter of the Rev. E.S. Davenport. In 1855 Nisbet was appointed Inspector of Hospitals and Fleets at [[Royal Hospital Haslar|Haslar Royal Hospital]], retiring from the Royal Navy in 1861. He was appointed as [[Physician to the Queen|Honorary Physician]] to [[Queen Victoria]] in 1873 and later that year he was knighted by Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]].

He died of "natural decay" at his home Arley Lodge in [[Lee, London]] at the age of seventy-nine, and is buried in [[Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries]].

'''BIA 10-2474''' is an experimental [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] inhibitor developed by the Portuguese pharmaceutical company [[Bial|Bial-Portela &amp; Ca. SA]]. It interacts with the human [[endocannabinoid system]].&lt;ref name=Bialstatement/&gt; The drug was in development for the treatment of a range of different [[medical conditions]] from [[anxiety disorder]] to [[Parkinson's disease]], also for the treatment of [[chronic pain]] of [[multiple sclerosis]], [[cancer]], [[hypertension]] or the treatment of [[obesity]].&lt;ref name=Breizh &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breizh-info.com/2016/01/15/rennes-biotrial-bialessai-therapeutique/|title=Essai thérapeutique mortel à Biotrial Rennes. Le contenu du test du Bia 10 – 2474 de Bial révélé [exclusif]|publisher=Breizh-info.com|date=15 January 2016|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clinical trial with this drug was underway in Rennes, France, in January 2016, in which [[serious adverse event]]s occurred affecting five participants, including the death of one man.&lt;ref name=Bialstatement/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANSM Statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rennes2/&gt; The underlying mechanism that caused the acute neurotoxicity of this molecule remains unknown.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinnerk /&gt;

==Structure and action==
The chemical name of BIA-10-2474 is 3-(1-(cyclohexyl(methyl)carbamoyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)pyridine 1-oxide.&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt; BIA-10-2474 is a long-acting [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] (FAAH) that increases levels of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[anandamide]] in the [[central nervous system]] and in peripheral tissues (that is, the rest of the body other than the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]).&lt;ref name=Bialstatement&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bial.com/en/pressroom.138/news.140/phase_i_clinical_trial_rennes.a558.html|title=News Release - Phase I Clinical Trial Rennes|publisher=www.bial.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt;

In normal tissues, the [[enzyme]] FAAH degrades [[anandamide]] and other [[endocannabinoid system|endocannabinoid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s, which relieve [[pain]] and can affect [[eating]] and [[sleep]] patterns. FAAH inhibitors have been proposed for a range of [[nervous system]] [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]] including [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[alcoholism]], pain and [[nausea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery and Development of Inhibitors of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH)(pre-print published online 28 June 2011)|author1=Katerina Otrubova |author2=Cyrine Ezzili |author3=Dale L.

The Portuguese pharmaceutical company [[Bial]] holds several [[patent]]s on [[fatty acid amide hydrolase|FAAH]] [[enzyme inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

The structure and synthesis of BIA 10-2474 is disclosed in a Bial patent as 'compound 362', part of a Bial [[patent family]] [[Priority right|dating from]] December 2008.&lt;ref name=synthpatent&gt;{{cite patent

The patent discloses limited details about BIA 10-2474, mainly the screening assay results for each of the several hundred [[Drug discovery|candidate compounds]] to evaluate the effect on FAAH activity. For compound 362 (that is, BIA 10-2474), an ''in vitro'' assay in rat brain showed only modest FAAH inhibition, however, mice given compound 362 at 3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg orally had less than 2% the normal level of FAAH activity in both brain and [[liver]] tissues after 8 hours. Inhibition of other enzymes affected by cannabinoids ([[monoacylglycerol lipase]] and liver [[carboxylesterase]]) was performed as a screen for biological selectivity for a small number of compounds, but compound 362 was not included.&lt;ref name=synthpatent/&gt; These results appear to be [[high-throughput screening]] data only, and no more definitive data are included (such as inhibitory concentration ([[IC50]]) or [[inhibition constant]] (Ki) values that characterise the potency of the molecule's inhibition of, or binding with, the target).&lt;ref name=southanblog/&gt;

The [[Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé]] (ANSM) reported that the compound has a rat IC50 of 1.1-1.7 micromolar, and that this is 200 times the concentration required for inhibition with a different FAAH inhibitor developed by Pfizer (that is, much weaker). As such, the ANSM described the molecule as "a compound with a relatively poor specificity for the endocannabinoid FAAH".&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-de-Rennes-Compte-rendu-de-la-premiere-reunion-du-CSST-inhibiteurs-de-la-FAAH|publisher=Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM) |title=Version anglaise : Minutes of the Temporary Specialist Scientific Committee (TSSC) meeting on "FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase) Inhibitors" of 15/02/2016 (08/03/2016)|date=7 March 2016|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same report, the ANSM also noted that the inhibitor is irreversible, not [[Enzyme inhibitor#Reversible inhibitors|reversible]] as claimed by the manufacturer Bial.

Publication of the chemical structure created considerable interest among chemists, with some sharing online their assessment of likely binding interactions between BIA 10-2474 and ''in vivo'' targets.&lt;ref name=southanblog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdsouthan.blogspot.se/2016/01/molecular-details-related-to-bia-10-2474.html |title=Molecular details related to BIA 10-2474 |author=Christopher Southan, University of Edinburgh|date=23 January 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collabchem.com/2016/01/21/lets-do-it-all-again-updating-predictions-for-the-real-bia-10-2474/|title=Lets do it all again updating predictions for the ‘real’ BIA 10-2474|author=Sean Ekins|publisher=Collaborative Chemistry Forum|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one analysis using standard software modelling packages found that although FAAH emerged as the primary target for BIA 10-2474, a number of other proteins rated highly as well. These other targets included [[histone deacetylase]]s, [[MST1R|macrophage-stimulating protein receptor]] and [[hormone-sensitive lipase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alzforum.org/news/community-news/will-death-french-drug-trial-lead-tighter-phase-1-rules|title=Will Death in French Drug Trial Lead to Tighter Phase 1 Rules? |publisher=www.alzforum.org; Biomedical Research Forum|author=Madolyn Bowman Rogers |date=29 January 2016|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exact mechanism of action leading to BIA 10-2474 toxicity remains unknown, the final report by the ANSM Committee concluded it was likely one of two possible mechanisms "inhibition of other serine hydrolases, or harmful effect from the imidazole‐pyridine "leaving" group". The report also theorised that this leaving group "may produce an isocyanate to which many brain proteins are likely to bind".&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt; A 2017 research article suggested the off-target activity of BIA 10-2474 may affect lipid metabolism in neurones.&lt;ref name=Hinnerk&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/new-clues-why-french-drug-trial-went-horribly-wrong | title=New clues to why a French drug trial went horribly wrong|author=Hinnerk Feldwisch-Drentrup |publisher=[[Science (magazine)|Science]]| date=8 June 2017 | accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preclinical studies==
According to a company statement, a project to develop FAAH inhibitors was initiated by Bial in 2005, and studies with this compound began in 2009 with pre-clinical ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' pharmacological and toxicological evaluation.&lt;ref name=Bialstatement/&gt; The French medicines regulator (ANSM) released a version of the [[Protocol (science)|clinical trial protocol]],&lt;ref name=protocolansm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ansm22jan/&gt; after the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' leaked a (more recent) version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Drame de Rennes : le protocole de l'essai clinique en accusation|url = http://sante.lefigaro.fr/actualite/2016/01/21/24518-drame-rennes-protocole-lessai-clinique-accusation|website = sante.lefigaro.fr|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lefigaro/&gt; The protocol presents a summary of what appears to be a full package of [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]], [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Toxicology testing|toxicological]] studies that might be expected to support a [[first-in-man study]]. The manufacturer Bial refused the regulator's request to release the [[Investigator's brochure]] and the product dossier (the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier; IMPD), citing French law on trade secrets.&lt;ref name=ansm22jan/&gt;

An expert committee, established by the French medicines regulator after the trial, requested clarification from Bial of a range of preclinical issues.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt;

===Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics===

In terms of animal [[pharmacodynamics]], the trial protocol reports that the biological activity of BIA 10-2474 was tested in models of predictive efficacy in treating pain. “BIA 10-2474 produced [[analgesic]]/[[anti-inflammatory]] activity in the mouse Formalin-Paw and Tail-Flick tests in a time-and dose-dependent manner. BIA 10-2474 also markedly potentiated the antinociceptive effects of exogenous anandamide in the mouse Formalin-Paw and Tail-Flick tests”. In other words, BIA 10-2474 worked as a pain-killer in mice using two different tests (the “analgesic/anti-inflammatory” effect); and, in mice that had been given a dose of the neurotransmitter anandamide, BIA 10-2474 also improved its effects in numbing pain (“antinociceptive” effect).&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt; The expert committee of the ANSM took the view that this was insufficient basis for commencing human trials, and that further evidence of BIA 10-2474 as an analgesic was warranted.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt; The Committee's final report noted that in fact the original formalin paw study report presented additional data for the gabapentin comparator which was omitted in the Investigators Brochure.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt; The final ANSM report stated that "doses used in these tests differ greatly (from 0.3 to 10 mg/Kg), without it being possible to trace a dose‐effect curve or to estimate an effective dose 50 (which is a surprising shortcoming)".&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;

In terms of animal [[pharmacokinetics]], in rats and dogs given a [[radio labelling|radio-labelled]] dose of BIA 10-2474, the drug was detectable in the [[blood]] for up to a day afterwards (oral or i.v.). Oral [[bioavailability]] was not reported.  Terminal [[Biological half-life|half-life]] (persistence in the blood) of the BIA 10-2474 in rats was 45 hours (oral) or 4 hours (i.v.) and in dogs it was 104 hours (oral) or 52 hours (i.v.). The authors made no prediction of a likely half-life in humans. Around two-thirds of the total dose was [[Clearance (medicine)|eliminated]] in the [[urine]], about one-fifth in the [[faeces]] and the remainder was heavily metabolized in all species studied (rat, mouse, dog, monkey). [[Metabolism]] of BIA 10-2474 was essentially complete by 72 hours. Main [[metabolites]] were not described. The studies used total detectable [[radioactivity]] to calculate half-life and did not assess what proportion of this was due to metabolites.&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt;

The preliminary report by the French Inspector General for Social Affairs (IGAS), for the French Ministry of Health, remarked on the difference between the rat oral vs. I.V. half life, and, that in light of the adverse events seen in humans on repeated dosing, this may indicate "a mechanism of accumulation".&lt;ref name=IGAS /&gt; Separately, accumulation of BIA 10-2474 given orally in humans was supported by pharmacokinetic data from the trial itself, reviewed by the ANSM expert committee. The molecule showed non-linear pharmacokinetics at doses between 40–100&amp;nbsp;mg, suggesting elimination pathways had become saturated, leading to accumulation.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt;

The final report by the ANSM Committee noted the drug had a very steep dose-effect curve in humans "going from absence of to almost complete inhibition" over a narrow concentration range.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-de-Rennes-Rapport-final-du-CSST-inhibiteurs-de-la-FAAH|title=Essai clinique de Rennes - Rapport final du CSST " inhibiteurs de la FAAH "|publisher=Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé(ANSM)|date=19 April 2016|accessdate=22 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530091645/http://www.ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-de-Rennes-Rapport-final-du-CSST-inhibiteurs-de-la-FAAH|archive-date=2016-05-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also found, based on clinical data from the Rennes trial, that complete inhibition by BIA 10-2474 was very long-acting, and persisted well beyond the point where it was no longer detectable in blood of the trial subjects.

===Safety pharmacology and toxicology===

The protocol presents a summary of [[safety pharmacology]] studies in two species (rat, dog) and repeated dose toxicity studies in four species (13-week sub-chronic studies in mouse, dog and monkey; a 26-week chronic study in the rat). Of note, few adverse events were observed in any of the studies, with the oral [[No-observed-adverse-effect level|No Observed Adverse Effect Level]] (NOAEL) varying between 10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day in rats to 75&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day in monkeys. The authors suggest that these were the maximum doses tested in these studies, though it is not clear. The authors also report no effects of significance in the animal models used for the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] safety pharmacology studies, which studied a dose of up to 300&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day. The protocol nominates a human NOAEL of 100&amp;nbsp;mg as a [[human equivalent|human equivalent dose]] to the 26-week rat NOAEL, though with no description how this was calculated. The summary presented however includes no assessment of the relevance of the animal species selected for study (that is, in terms of physiological and genetic similarities with humans and the [[mechanism of action]] of the study drug).&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt; Early reports that the molecule had been studied in chimpanzees turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Barbara Casassus |title=France investigates drug trial disaster |journal=The Lancet |volume=387 |issue=10016 |pages=326 |date=23 January 2016 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00154-9|url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2816%2900154-9.pdf |pmid=26842439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-french-drug-trial-reports-of-one-patient-dying-and-five-others-in-hospital-and-of-the-paris-prosecutors-office-having-opened-an-investigation-into-what-happened|title=Expert reaction to French drug trial - reports of one patient dying and five others in hospital and of the Paris prosecutor's office having opened an investigation into what happened|publisher=Science Media Centre, London|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a hearing convened by the ANSM in March 2016, Bial clarified that the apparently extensive animal toxicology studies (and number of species) was due to a delay in commencement of clinical development, thus some studies had already been completed that would not have been required for a Phase I study. The ANSM Committee found no evidence that the studies had been performed because the company had doubts as to the tolerance of the molecule.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;

Notably absent from the protocol were calculations of receptor occupancy; predictions of ''in vivo'' ligand binding saturation levels; measures of [[target affinity]] or assessment of non-target binding interactions as suggested by the European guidance for Phase I studies (depending on whether BIA 10-2474 could be considered to require 'special consideration' as outlined in the guideline).&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500002988.pdf|title=Strategies to identify and mitigate risks for first-in-human clinical trials with investigational medicinal products (CHMP/SWP/28367/07)|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=1 September 2007|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these issues, the French regulator's expert committee pointed out, based on the company's IC50 data, that complete FAAH inhibition should have been achieved with a dose of 1.25&amp;nbsp;mg in humans. In fact, the trial tested doses up to 80 times more (100&amp;nbsp;mg BIA 10-2474) than should have been required.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt; The ANSM committee also requested data on non-target enzyme affinity from the manufacturer Bial.

Although the protocol summary reports no animal deaths during the studies, the ANSM expert committee reported that in fact several monkeys died or had to be euthanised during the dose escalation studies and that an explanation from Bial was pending. Also, two animals had to be euthanised in the 13-week dog study due to lung lesions - both from the top dose group.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Regulatory-Safety/Bial-cannot-rule-out-link-between-BIA-10-2474-and-lung-lesions-in-study-dogs|title=Bial cannot rule out link between BIA 10-2474 and lung lesions in study dogs|author=Gareth MacDonald|publisher=In-Pharma Technologist|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these animal deaths were described in the trial protocol.&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt;

It is not clear whether Bial disclosed these adverse animal findings either to Biotrial or to the ANSM in their application for clinical trial authorisation.&lt;ref name=schubhan/&gt;

The findings presented in the trial protocol provide no explanation for the type and severity of events that would be later observed in Rennes.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt; The preliminary report from the IGAS investigation, released by the French Minister for Health in February 2016, found there was no legal requirement in France for the trial sponsor to disclose all pre-clinical data to the ANSM. The Minister described this as an opportunity for improvement.&lt;ref name=ministry2/&gt; Nevertheless, the IGAS report commented that the investigation thus far had not found any reason to fault the ANSM's authorisation of the trial based on the preclinical data.&lt;ref name=IGAS /&gt;

The final report by the ANSM Committee concluded regarding the preclinical studies that "no aspects of the data that the TSSC has studied constituted a signal likely to contraindicate administration in humans." The report went on however to criticise Bial's Investigator's Brochure: "the brochure contains many mistakes, inaccuracies, figure inversions or incorrect translation of source documents, making understanding difficult in several aspects. This is highly surprising given the regulatory importance of this document."&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;

==Phase I clinical trial==

===Overview===

In 2015 Biotrial, a [[contract research organization]], initiated a [[first-in-man study|first-in-human]] [[clinical trial|trial]] of BIA 10-2474 in healthy volunteers, with secondary endpoints to investigate neuropathic pain.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt; The study was approved by the French regulatory authority, the [[Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé|ANSM]], on 26 June 2015, and by the Brest regional ethics committee on 3 July 2015.&lt;ref name="ANSM Statement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/La-survenue-d-effets-graves-ayant-entraine-l-hospitalisation-de-6-patients-dont-un-en-etat-de-mort-cerebrale-a-conduit-a-l-arret-premature-d-un-essai-clinique-du-laboratoire-BIAL-Point-d-information |title=La survenue d’effets graves ayant entraîné l’hospitalisation de 6 patients, dont un en état de mort cérébrale, a conduit à l’arrêt prématuré d’un essai clinique du laboratoire BIAL - Point d'information |work=Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament, France (ANSM) |date=15 January 2016 |access-date=2016-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118211225/http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/La-survenue-d-effets-graves-ayant-entraine-l-hospitalisation-de-6-patients-dont-un-en-etat-de-mort-cerebrale-a-conduit-a-l-arret-premature-d-un-essai-clinique-du-laboratoire-BIAL-Point-d-information |archive-date=2016-01-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial protocol was leaked by ''[[Le Figaro]]''&lt;ref name=lefigaro &gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.youscribe.com/catalogue/tous/current-affairs-and-social-debate/current-affairs-events/document-le-protocole-de-l-essai-clinique-de-rennes-2691486|title=Clinical Study Protocol N° BIA-102474-101 (Version 2.0, 16 October 2015)|publisher=Le Figaro|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before a different version was released by ANSM.&lt;ref name=protocolansm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ansm22jan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-BIA-102474-101-du-laboratoire-BIAL-Publication-du-protocole-clinique-Point-d-Information|title=Essai clinique BIA-102474-101 du laboratoire BIAL : Publication du protocole clinique|publisher=Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé|date=22 Jan 2016|language=fr|access-date=2016-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131012212/http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-BIA-102474-101-du-laboratoire-BIAL-Publication-du-protocole-clinique-Point-d-Information|archive-date=2016-01-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturer Bial refused the regulator's request to release the [[Investigator's brochure]] and the product dossier (Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier), citing French law on trade secrets.&lt;ref name=ansm22jan/&gt;

===Trial details===
The study was entitled "A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, combined single and multiple ascending dose study including food interaction, to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of BIA 10-2474, in healthy volunteers". The trial commenced on 9 July 2015 at a single centre in the city of [[Rennes]], and commenced recruitment of 128 healthy volunteers, both men and women aged 18 to 55. Participants of the study were to receive €1,900 and, in turn, asked to stay at Biotrial's facility for two weeks during which time they would take the drug for ten days and undergo tests.&lt;ref name=Breizh /&gt;&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/more-details-emerge-fateful-french-drug-trial| author=Martin Enserink| title=More details emerge on fateful French drug trial| publisher=[[Science Magazine]]| date=16 January 2016| accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study drug was presented as capsules in three different strengths (0.25, 2.5 and 10&amp;nbsp;mg). The protocol describes four distinct parts to the study:
* a single dose ascending part
* a [[Crossover study|cross-over]] part to evaluate fed vs. fasting conditions (could be either single or multiple dose)
* a multiple dose ascending part
* a pharmacodynamics part to evaluate the effect of BIA 10-2474 vs placebo with different challenge agents&lt;ref name=protocolansm/&gt; 
The protocol specifies the first three parts would be [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] but the pharmacodynamics part would be [[Open-label trial|open label]]. According to the protocol, dose levels and numbers of groups could be increased, or were not yet defined, and would depend on what was observed with initial dosing, (an approach known as [[Adaptive clinical trial|adaptive trial design]]). Thus many details of the key multi-dose part are not included in the trial protocol.&lt;ref name=protocolansm/&gt; The absence of these details was criticised by scientists and in the media,&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statslife.org.uk/news/2660-rss-issues-statement-regarding-tragic-first-in-man-clinical-trial| title=RSS issues statement regarding tragic 'first-in-man' clinical trial|publisher=Royal Statistical Society |date=26 January 2016|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the ANSM published further details of the dosing.&lt;ref name=ansm27Jan/&gt; The [[Royal Statistical Society]] was particularly critical, stating that it had "clear statistical reservations about the trial's study design", and that the protocol lacked features such as a [[risk assessment]], recommended in the wake of the [[TGN1412]] incident to prevent severe adverse events occurring in these circumstances.&lt;ref name=RSS/&gt;

===Starting dose and subsequent doses===
For the single dose part of the study, the protocol describes eight groups of eight volunteers (3:1 [[Random assignment|randomised]]) who were to receive single doses of BIA 10-2474 at 0.25, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, 40 and 100&amp;nbsp;mg, with the possibility of additional groups to be added if no [[maximum tolerated dose]] was reached.&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt; In describing the rationale for the starting dose, the authors of the protocol conclude that:
 ''No target organ was identified during toxicology studies and few adverse clinical findings were observed at the highest dose tested. For the single ascending dose part [of the clinical trial], a starting dose of 0.25 mg was judged to be safe for a first-in-human administration.''&lt;ref name=protocolansm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/content/download/84681/1069223/version/1/file/protocole_BIAL_102474+101-22012016131259.pdf|title=Clinical Study Protocol N° BIA-102474-101 (Version 1.2, 1 July 2015)|via=ANSM|date=1 July 2015|accessdate=22 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protocol provides for the first two subjects of the first single dose cohort to receive the first dose as a sentinel dose, that is, either 0.25&amp;nbsp;mg BIA 10-2474 or a placebo on the first day, then wait for 24h before treating the other 5:1 subjects. In the event no safety concerns had emerged in the foregoing, all other single- and multi-dose groups were to be dosed with a 10-minute interval between recipients.&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt;

For the multiple ascending dose part of the study, the protocol planned four groups of eight volunteers (3:1 [[Random assignment|randomised]]) who were to receive a single dose orally, once daily for 10 days at different dose levels. However, the protocol defines no doses for these groups, stating that this will be based on the outcome of the single dose portion of the trial. Further dose groups up to a maximum of eight groups could be added depending on whether adverse events were observed. The authors note that nonetheless, the starting dose will not exceed 33% of the [[maximum tolerated dose]] (MTD) identified in the single dose groups (or 33% of the maximum administered dose if the MTD is not reached).&lt;ref name=protocolansm /&gt;

Further details of the study as it was actually conducted have been published by the French agency (ANSM). The dose groups for the single dose part were as described in the protocol, with no additional groups undertaken. In the crossover part, a single 40&amp;nbsp;mg dose was given to a group of 12 subjects. In the multiple dose ascending part, the doses were 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20 and 50&amp;nbsp;mg BIA 10-2474, each to be given once per day for 10 days to groups of 8 volunteers (3:1 randomised). The severe adverse events were observed in the 50&amp;nbsp;mg dose group.&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ansm27Jan&gt;{{Cite web|title = Essai clinique BIA-102474-101- Bial/Biotrial : Chronologie|url = http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-BIA-102474-101-Bial-Biotrial|publisher = Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM)|access-date = 2016-01-28|archive-url = https://archive.is/20160128115750/http://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Essai-clinique-BIA-102474-101-Bial-Biotrial|archive-date = 2016-01-28|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANSM expert committee reported&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt; that complete FAAH inhibition should have been achieved by a dose of 1.25&amp;nbsp;mg remarking that:
 ''It appears unjustified to plan to test a dose (100 mg) 80 times higher than that presumed to induce complete and prolonged FAAH inhibition.''&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt; 
Further, the ANSM committee remarked that the gap between the 20&amp;nbsp;mg and 50&amp;nbsp;mg dose cohorts, in effect, skipped a dose based on extrapolation from the single dose part of the study, and that the progression to 50&amp;nbsp;mg was too large a jump. On reviewing the subject data from the trial itself, the committee noted that BIA 10-2474 showed non-linear pharmacokinetics at doses between 40–100&amp;nbsp;mg (that is, the molecule appeared to be accumulating at higher doses) and that most likely the elimination mechanism had become saturated. Thus dosing at 50&amp;nbsp;mg daily was - each day - 40 times more than required to achieve complete inhibition, and in practice this dose level resulted in accumulation.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt;

===Trial status at the time of serious adverse events===

According to Bial and the Rennes University Hospital, by the time the serious adverse reactions emerged, 116 subjects had been recruited and 84 other volunteers had received the drug during the trial, with no [[serious adverse event]]s being reported.&lt;ref name=Bialstatement/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://social-sante.gouv.fr/actualites/presse/discours/article/accident-grave-dans-le-cadre-d-un-essai-clinique-intervention-de-marisol|title=Accident grave dans le cadre d’un essai clinique - Intervention de Marisol Touraine à Rennes|date=15 January 2016|work=Ministère des Affaires Sociales, de la Santé et des Droits des Femmes, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rennes2/&gt; The single dose part (up to 100&amp;nbsp;mg BIA 10-2474), the fed vs. fasting part, and the first four dose groups of the multi-dose part of the study had each been completed in 2015. Notably, the administration of 20&amp;nbsp;mg BIA 10-2474 once daily for 10 consecutive days elicited no serious adverse events in the six volunteers who received it.&lt;ref name=ansm22jan/&gt;&lt;ref name=ansm27Jan/&gt;

Dosing of eight volunteers in the highest multi-dose dose group in the BIA 10-2474 trial commenced on 6 January 2016. Six of the participants received 50&amp;nbsp;mg per day of the drug while two received placebo.&lt;ref name=Bialstatement/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement" /&gt; The first subject became ill on the evening of the 5th day of dosing (10 January). On the following day, the other subjects received a 6th dose at 8:00am before the trial was suspended later that day (11 January).&lt;ref name=ansm27Jan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biotrial/&gt;

==Death and serious adverse events==
The fifth dose level (50&amp;nbsp;mg per day for 10 days) of the multi-dose part of study had been underway for five days when the first volunteer became ill and was hospitalized at the [[Rennes University Hospital]] on the evening of 10 January 2016 with [[symptom]]s similar to a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=ladepeche/&gt; The following day, the man lapsed into a coma and was shortly thereafter declared [[brain dead]].&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rennes2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chu-rennes.fr/sections/autres_professionnel/relations_presse/dossiers_et_communiq/du_16_au_20_mars_les/downloadFile/FichierJoint_13/17_janvier_2016_-_CP_CHU_de_Rennes_-_Point_de_situation_n2.pdf|title=COMMUNIQUE DE PRESSE: Point de situation n°2 concernant les patients hospitalisés au CHU et les personnes volontaires incluses dans l'essai clinique réalisé par le centre de recherche privé Biotrial pour le compte de la société Bial |publisher=University Hospital Rennes| date=17 January 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ansm27Jan/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35320895|title=France clinical trial: 90 given drug, one man brain-dead|publisher=BBC|date=January 15, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-health-test-idUSKCN0UT131| author=Matthias Blamont| title= French drug trial disaster leaves one brain dead, five injured |publisher=Reuters| date=January 15, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hospital, the man died at midday on 17 January 2016.&lt;ref name=Rennes2/&gt; Four of the other five men in the same dosage group were also hospitalized between 10–13 January&lt;ref name=ladepeche&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2016/01/15/2256528-accident-grave-lors-d-un-essai-therapeutique-pres-de-rennes.htmlwith|title=Accident "inédit" lors d'un essai clinique: un homme en état de mort cérébrale, cinq hospitalisés|publisher=La Depeche|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suffering injuries similar to the man who died, including deep [[haemorrhagic]] and [[Necrosis|necrotic]] [[lesions]] seen on [[brain MRI]]. All the MRI findings, though widely varying in severity, were of the same form and seen in the [[hippocampus]] and [[pons]] of the affected individuals.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt;  Biotrial stopped the study on 11 January and both the ANSM and regional ethics committee were notified on 14 January.&lt;ref name=Bialstatement/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANSM Statement"/&gt;

The men who were hospitalised were all from the group which received the highest dose of the multiple ascending part of the trial. A neurologist at the University of Rennes Hospital Center, Professor Pierre-Gilles Edan, stated in a press conference with the French Minister for Health, that 3 of the 4 men who were displaying neurological symptoms "already have a severe enough clinical picture to fear that even in the best situation there will be an irreversible handicap" and were being given [[corticosteroid]]s to control the [[inflammation]].&lt;ref name=ladepeche/&gt; The sixth man from the group was not showing adverse effects but was hospitalized on 15 January 2016 for observation.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35327053|title=France clinical trial: 'No known antidote' to drug|publisher=BBC News|date=15 January 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=science /&gt; Other study volunteers who had received doses with no ill effects were asked to return for further testing.&lt;ref name="ANSM Statement"/&gt;

The man who died was later named by local news media as Guillaume Molinet, 49, an artist and father of four from Guilliers, a town in the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Breton]] [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Morbihan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/bretagne/rennes-35000/essai-clinique-le-patient-decede-etait-un-artiste-morbihannais-3979793|title=Essai clinique: le patient décédé était un artiste|publisher=L'Edition du Soir Ouest France|author1=Linda BENOTMANE |author2=Olivier CLERO |date=19 January 2016|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the man's brother Laurent Molinet, Mr Molinet was recruited as a stand-by and went to Rennes not expecting to be dosed, only being given BIA 10-2474 because another volunteer dropped out.

The journal also sought comment from Jean-Marc Gandon, the president and chief executive of the CRO Biotrial, who said "he cannot immediately respond to queries from Nature, that he is focused on trying to save the patients and that the company will respond later".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-in-the-dark-after-french-clinical-trial-proves-fatal-1.19189|title=Scientists in the dark after French clinical trial proves fatal|journal=Nature|volume=529|author1=Declan Butler |author2=Ewen Callaway |pages=263–264|date=18 January 2016|issue=21 January 2016|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19189|pmid=26791697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotrial stated its position that "The trial was conducted in full compliance with the international regulations and Biotrial’s procedures, in particular the emergency procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biotrial.com/news/message-from-biotrial.html |title=Message from Biotrial |publisher=www.biotrial.com |date=15 January 2016 |accessdate=17 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628163607/http://www.biotrial.com/news/message-from-biotrial.html |archive-date=2016-06-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biotrial.com/news/communication-from-biotrial.html|title=Communication from Biotrial February 5th, 2016|publisher=www.biotrial.com |date=5 February 2016 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2016 it remained unclear whether Bial disclosed the adverse animal findings to Biotrial, including the deaths of monkeys and dogs in several studies. François Peaucelle, the director general of Biotrial, is reported to have told Le Figaro. “We received a 15-page summary of the tests that was based on data that would have filled a lorry. From that data, there was nothing worrying in view of the dosage we were administering to humans.”&lt;ref name=schubhan/&gt;

===French authorities===
The Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament (ANSM) announced an investigation, and that an inspection of the trial site was already underway.&lt;ref name="ANSM Statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bioworld/&gt; and formation of a specialist committee of [[pharmacology|pharmacologists]], [[toxicology|toxicologists]] and [[neurology|neurologists]] to review all existing data on FAAH inhibitor drugs.&lt;ref name=ansm22jan/&gt; The French health minister [[Marisol Touraine]] who visited the trial site in Rennes and spoke with the victims' families, called the events “an accident of exceptional gravity, promised to investigate the matter via the [[:fr:Inspection générale des affaires sociales|Inspector General for Social Affairs]] (IGAS) with a final report due end of March.&lt;ref name="Ministry Statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ministry2/&gt;&lt;ref name=bioworld/&gt; A [[judiciary|judicial]] investigation was also initiated after the [[:fr:Procureur général (France)|Office of the Chief Prosecutor]] for Paris announced it would look into potential charges of involuntary injury through its public health enforcement section, seeking assistance from the [[Gendarmerie]] in Rennes and the [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Ministry of Justice's]] Office for the Environment and Public Health.&lt;ref name=bioworld/&gt;

The ONIAM (Office National d’Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux), responsible for medical injury compensation, stated only 10 accidents had occurred during clinical trials over the past 15 years per its records, and that those cases had “consequences infinitely less serious” than the incident in Rennes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/17/man-dies-rennes-hospital-drug-trial-left-him-brain-dead|title=Man dies in Rennes hospital after drug trial left him brain dead |author=Agence France-Presse|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 January 2016|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reports from the authorities suggested that the causes of the brain injuries was likely to be due to the mechanism of BIA 10-2474 and the doses employed in the trial.&lt;ref name="ANSM Comite Minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGAS/&gt; ANSM Director General Dominique Martin said "It is clearly the molecule that is the cause”, following the publication of the ANSM expert committee's initial findings on 7 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/07/french-drug-trial-man-dead-expert-report-unprecidented-reaction|title=Man who died in French drug trial had ‘unprecedented’ reaction, say experts|author=AFP Paris|publisher=The Guardian Online|date=8 March 2016|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the French Health Minister announced several new measures for clinical trials in France, including the establishment of an expert group within the ANSM for review of first in human and early phase studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/france-tightens-rules-wake-fatal-clinical-trial|title=France tightens rules in wake of fatal clinical trial |author=Martin Enserink|publisher=Science|date=23 May 2016|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inspection générale des affaires sociales reports====
The Inspection générale des affaires sociales (IGAS) released a preliminary report on 5 February 2016.&lt;ref name=IGAS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/fevrier_2016_-_note_etape_-_accident_essai_clinique.pdf|title=NOTE D’ETAPE : ENQUETE SUR DES INCIDENTS GRAVES SURVENUS DANS LE CADRE DE LA REALISATION D’UN ESSAI CLINIQUE|publisher=Inspection générale des affaires sociales|date=February 2016|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Minister of Health indicated that the cause of the death of one of the subjects had not been identified; it claimed Biotrial failed three major issues: The study should have been stopped when the first subject was hospitalized so  the drug would not have been given to five others; the incident should have been reported immediately, namely January 10, not four days later; all other subjects should have been notified right away asking them if they would like to continue in the study.&lt;ref name=ministry2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/todesfall-bei-biotrial-studie-welche-fehler-wurden-gemacht-a-1075734.html |title= Todesfall bei Medikamententest: Ministerin wirft Institut Biotrial Fehler vor |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Minister noted further that a number of the trial protocol provisions had been too vague and not precise enough; that the eligibility criteria should have been more explicit regarding substance use habits of the volunteers and that there was no legal requirement for the sponsor to disclose all pre-clinical data to the ANSM. The Minister announced that all clinical trials in France in the event of a serious, unexpected adverse event such as this would be explicitly required to re-consent the remaining trial participants.&lt;ref name=ministry2/&gt; The Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP) in Brest, a research ethics committee, has asked Bial for the exclusion criteria on the consuming cannabis and other psychoactive substances.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Casassus. France releases interim report on drug trial disaster. The Lancet. Volume 387, Issue 10019, 13–19 February 2016, Pages 634–635. {{DOI|10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00318-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotrial published a detailed response on its website, expressing its disappointment to learn of the report via the media and not prior to its publication from the Health Ministry.&lt;ref name=Biotrial&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biotrial.com/news/press-release-february-4th-2016.html|title=PRESS RELEASE - IGAS Status Report: Clarifications from Biotrial|publisher=www.biotrial.com | date=5 February 2016 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated the trial was halted as soon as it became apparent that the first volunteer had a serious adverse event, and that the man's initial symptoms on 10 January had been mild enough that he was expected to return to the trial facility on 11 January which is why it did not re-consent all volunteers. CHU informed Biotrial at 10:00 am on 11 January that the man had likely had a [[stroke]], at which point the trial was halted, though it was not known whether the stroke had anything to do with the study drug. This was after further doses had been given to the other volunteers (at 8:00 am that morning). Biotrial's statement offered no comment on the time taken between the trial halt at 10:00 am on the 11th and the notification of the authorities three days later on the 14th.&lt;ref name=Biotrial/&gt;

====ANSM Comité Scientifique Spécialisé Temporaire====
The final report from the ANSM Committee appointed to investigate the matter concluded in April 2016 that:
''[T]he most likely hypothesis to date is that of toxicity specific to the molecule via its binding to other brain cell structures, facilitated by (1) its low specificity for its target enzyme; (2) use of multiple doses a lot higher than those leading (at least in humans) to complete and lasting FAAH inhibition, and; (3) its probable gradual accumulation in the brain, undoubtedly related to the specific pharmacokinetic features of BIA 10‐2474.''&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;

The Committee also criticised the clinical study design which "probably significantly contributed to the accident", noting that administration of the top multi-dose groups did not and could not take into account emerging pharmacokinetic data from latest dose groups and offered no chance to adjust the dose as adverse events emerged. The choice of dose escalation levels (20 to 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;mg) was based on pharmacokinetic data from the 10&amp;nbsp;mg group and data from the 50&amp;nbsp;mg dose group (that would have clearly shown non-proportional dose kinetics) were not yet available when administration to the 100&amp;nbsp;mg multi-dose group commenced.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;

The Committee made six recommendations, which it invited European and International regulators to consider (reproduced here in brief):
*Justification and demonstration of pharmacological activity predictive of efficacy in humans cannot be considered to be secondary. [P]harmacology studies [should be sufficient] to establish a dose‐effect curve (where appropriate) [and] to be reasonably predictive of real‐life, future therapeutic efficacy.  
*A neuropsychological assessment with clinical interview and cognitive tests should be a compulsory part of assessment during volunteer screening, inclusion and clinical monitoring in a Phase 1 trial for drugs with "central nervous system" tropism. 
*All first‐in‐human and Phase 1 protocols should, unless unnecessary, provide for the doses to be tested in volunteers to be adjusted according to the data collected in volunteers already having been exposed during the trial. 
*During first‐in‐human and Phase 1 trials, volunteer safety should take precedence over any practical, economic or regulatory considerations. 
*Dose escalation strategies in first‐in‐human and Phase 1 trials should take account of considerations based on common clinical and pharmacological sense.
*The Committee would like to see a debate opened at European and international level, on access to data from ongoing or previous first‐in‐human and Phase 1 trials.&lt;ref name=ANSMfinal/&gt;

===Agencies outside France===
A [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) spokesperson said in January 2016 that "EU authorities will look carefully at the findings to determine if further measures are needed to protect health of clinical trial participants. Until EU authorities have the full picture, it is not possible to say whether any revisions to EU guidelines are required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2016/01/19/23925/EMA-Will-Assess-ANSM-Review-of-Botched-Clinical-Trial-in-France/|title=EMA Will Assess ANSM Review of Botched Clinical Trial in France|publisher=RAPS Regulatory Affairs Professional Society|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in July 2016, the agency proposed to revise its key first-in-human clinical trial guideline, the last significant revision having been published in response to the 2006 [[TGN1412]] clinical trial that had had similarly dire effects in its trial volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/europe-overhauls-rules-first-human-trials-wake-french-disaster |title=Europe overhauls rules for ‘first-in-human’ trials in wake of French disaster |author=Hinnerk Feldwisch-Drentrup |publisher=Science |doi=10.1126/science.aag0686 |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EMA stated the proposal aimed to address risks posed by complex trials, such as the one undertaken in Rennes, having 'several steps of clinical development within a single clinical trial protocol'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2016/07/news_detail_002572.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1 |title=Proposals to revise guidance on first-in-human clinical trials |publisher=European Medicines Agency, London |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Investment Bank]], which provided 110 million euros in funding for Bial's FAAH inhibitor programme stated it had been in contact with the company about the incident, but that "it would be premature to consider recall of the EIB loan at this stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/acceb104-c0fe-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html|title=Drugmaker in fatal trial received EU funds|author1=Andrew Ward |author2=Peter Wise |publisher=The Financial Times|date=24 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a statement that it was in contact with its counterparts the ANSM as well as the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] and announced investigations into FAAH inhibitors as a [[drug class]]."FDA is in the process of collecting and reviewing safety information pertinent to FAAH inhibitors under investigation in the US. FDA will work with sponsors to ensure the safety of participants in clinical studies and take regulatory action as appropriate." Later, in August 2016, the Agency issued a further statement: "The Agency has found, based on the available information, that BIA 10-2474 exhibits a unique toxicity that does not extend to other drugs in the class, called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors."&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm482740.htm|title=FDA works with regulatory partners to understand French-based Biotrial phase 1 clinical study|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German drug regulator, the [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices|Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM)]] issued a statement 19 January that no clinical trials with FAAH inhibitors were underway in Germany, but that it had authorised seven such trials previously, which were completed without serious incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfarm.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2016/pm1-2016.html|title=Zwischenfall bei einer klinischen Prüfung in Frankreich: keine vergleichbaren Fälle in Deutschland.

==Outcome for trial participants==
The Rennes University Hospital provided updates on the remaining volunteers in the study and the treating specialists later published a medical report describing the sickened volunteers in November 2016 in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=NEJM&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kerbrat et al. |title=Acute Neurologic Disorder from an Inhibitor of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=375 |issue=18 |pages=1717 |date=3 November 2016 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1604221|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1604221 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published medical report described the adverse events as "An acute and rapidly progressive neurologic syndrome [of which] the main clinical features were headache, a cerebellar syndrome, memory impairment, and altered consciousness". The authors were of the view that "the toxic effects we observed were related to drug accumulation. This hypothesis is supported by the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of BIA 10-2474 for doses higher than 40 to 100 mg" and as reported by the ANSM's expert committee. The authors were not however granted access to information from the post-mortem of the man who died.&lt;ref name=NEJM /&gt;

News reports from March 2016 described the condition of Stéphane Schubhan (42), a professional photographer from [[La Flèche]], [[Sarthe]] and participant of the top dose cohort. Mr. Schubhan "sleeps badly, has nightmares, sees double at all times, walks with difficulty, and succumbs to dizziness and nausea if he stands more than 10 minutes at a time" and does not know if he will be able to work again. Mr. Schubhan said he had participated in a previous clinical trial, but in this case he was never informed about the animal deaths that were later revealed and would never have consented to take part had he known. Doctors have told Schubhan that they hope he will improve over the coming 6–12 months but that they do not know what the outcome will be.&lt;ref name=schubhan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/survivor-of-lethal-french-drug-trial-speaks-out-1.2554593|title=Survivor of lethal French drug trial speaks out|author=Lara Marlowe|publisher=The Irish Times|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under French Law, all clinical trial participants are protected by the 1988 [[Loi Huriet Sérusclat|Huriet Law]] on the protection of persons in clinical research.

Following the events in Rennes, [[Janssen-Cilag|Janssen]] announced that it was temporarily suspending dosing in two Phase II clinical trials with its own FAAH inhibitor, [[JNJ-42165279]], headlining the decision as "precautionary measure follows safety issue with different drug in class". Janssen was emphatic that no serious adverse events had been reported in any of the clinical trials with JNJ-42165279 to date. Janssen did not state whether the suspension, though voluntary, was at the request of the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janssen.com/janssen-research-development-llc-voluntarily-suspends-dosing-phase-2-clinical-trials-experimental|title=Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC Voluntarily Suspends Dosing in Phase 2 Clinical Trials of Experimental Treatment for Mood Disorders|publisher=Janssen.com|date=17 January 2016|accessdate=21 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125052230/http://www.janssen.com/janssen-research-development-llc-voluntarily-suspends-dosing-phase-2-clinical-trials-experimental|archive-date=2016-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension was to remain in effect until more information is available about the BIA 10-2474 study.{{update inline|date=April 2016}}

Pfizer had previously been developing an FAAH inhibitor PF-04457845 for indications including osteoarthritis pain and trauma. A spokesperson commented after the events in Rennes that "we [Pfizer] did explore the potential of a FAAH-inhibitor for osteoarthritic pain in Phase 2 trials, however, no significant efficacy was observed. The FAAH-inhibitor was recently being evaluated in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder but this trial was discontinued in 2015 for business reasons. We do not have any active trials in this area".&lt;ref name=in-pharma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Regulatory-Safety/FAAH-inhibitor-safety-under-microscope-after-Bial-drug-trial-death|title=FAAH inhibitor safety under microscope after Bial drug trial death|publisher=In-Pharma Technologist|author=Gareth MacDonald| date=19 January 2016|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanofi also had been developing an FAAH inhibitor candidate SSR411298 for the treatment of depression. However, a spokesperson stated in January 2016 that "we have no projects in development that target this enzyme".&lt;ref name=in-pharma/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4931">The use of '''cannabis in Belize''' is common and largely tolerated; however, possession can result in fines or imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubbard|first=Kirsten|title=Drug Laws and Penalties in Central America|url=http://gocentralamerica.about.com/od/culturehistory/p/Central-America-Drug-Laws-And-Penalties.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possession or use of 10 grams or less on private premises was decriminalized in November 2017.

==History==
Belize was until the 1980s the fourth-largest exporter of cannabis to the United States, behind Colombia, Mexico, and Jamaica. But since the mid-1980s, Belize's production has dropped dramatically due to eradication efforts by the Belizean government, supported by the United States. By 1994, Belizean production was at "negligible levels."&lt;ref name="MunizBeruff2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Humberto Garcia Muniz|author2=Jorge RodrIguez Beruff|title=Security Problems and Policies in the Post-Cold War Caribbean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxW_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24493-5|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
According to a 2016 report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] approximately 8.5% of all Belizeans use [[cannabis]]. Belize was ranked 18th out of all countries in prevalence of cannabis use, higher than both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belize weighs in on world weed list|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2016/12/02/belize-weighs-world-weed-list/|accessdate=30 April 2017|work=Breaking Belize News|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decriminalization ==
In 2012, the Government of Belize announced that it was considering decriminalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decriminalization of Marijuana |url=http://www.belize.gov.bz/public/Data/271616513971.pdf |date=16 July 2012 |publisher=Government of Belize |accessdate=5 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505234807/http://www.belize.gov.bz/public/Data/271616513971.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, 2017, the [[House of Representatives (Belize)|House of Representatives]] passed an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act decriminalizing possession or use of 10 grams or less on private premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marijuana Decriminalization Legislation Passed By House|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=42333|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=7 News Belize|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law in early November by the Governor General,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marijuana.com/news/2017/11/belize-decriminalizes-marijuana-possession/&lt;/ref&gt; despite objections from the [[National Evangelical Association of Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.bz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14372:churches-complain-about-marijuana-law&amp;catid=40:politics&amp;Itemid=90&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legalization ==
Although legalization of cannabis has never been officially considered by the government, some prominent public figures in Belize have supported the idea. In 2017, the [[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[John Briceño]], stated, "It is time for us to stop locking up our young people for a stick of weed. The time has come for us to decriminalize marijuana smoking and prepare the necessary research to move to legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes and in small quantities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caye Caulker group says decriminalizing marijuana will improve the economy|url=https://www.sanpedrosun.com/business-and-economy/2017/04/29/caye-caulker-group-says-decriminalizing-marijuana-will-improve-economy/|accessdate=30 April 2017|work=The San Pedro Sun|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 op-ed, former Senator [[Lisa Shoman]] stated, "There is no rational excuse to refuse to move past decriminalization to legalization of personal use amounts for adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shoman|first1=Lisa|title=Marijuana - Time to legalize it!|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/04/20/marijuana-time-legalize-it/|accessdate=30 April 2017|work=Breaking Belize News|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
In 2016, an American tourist off a cruise ship was arrested for purchasing 1.8 grams of cannabis in Belize City. Her charges were dismissed, with the judge noting the cannabis was sold openly to her and she appeared to believe it was legal, and she was cautioned against ever possessing drugs in Belize again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=36039 |title=Court Says Cruise Visitor’s Cannabis Cool |publisher=7 News Belize |date=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coccidia''' ('''Coccidiasina''') are a [[Class (biology)|subclass]] of microscopic, [[spore]]-forming, single-celled [[obligate intracellular parasite]]s belonging to the [[apicomplexa]]n class [[Conoidasida]].&lt;ref name=UTS&gt;{{cite web
  | others=  Compiled by S.J. Brands
  | title = The Taxonomicon &amp; Systema Naturae
  | website = Taxon: Genus Cryptosporidium 
  | publisher = Universal Taxonomic Services, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

As obligate intracellular parasites, they must live and reproduce within an [[animal]] cell. Coccidian parasites infect the intestinal tracts of animals,&lt;ref name=iziko&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.museums.org.za/bio/apicomplexa/index.htm
|title= Biodiversity explorer: Apicomplexa (apicomplexans, sporozoans)
|publisher=Iziko Museums of Cape Town }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are the largest group of apicomplexan protozoa.

Infection with these parasites is known as [[coccidiosis]]. Coccidia can infect all mammals, some birds, some fish, some reptiles, and some amphibians. Most species of coccidia are species-specific in their host. An exception is ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which can infect all mammals, although it can only undergo sexual reproduction in cats. Depending on the species of coccidia, infection can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and nervous system effects and changes to behavior, and may lead to death. Healthy adults may recover without medication—but those who are immunocompromised or young almost certainly require medication to prevent death. Humans generally become infected by eating under-cooked meat, but can contract infection with ''T. gondii'' by poor hygiene when handling cat waste.

==Taxonomy==

The class is divided into four orders, which are distinguished by the presence or absence of various asexual and sexual stages:

*Order [[Agamococcidiorida]] Levine-1979
*Order [[Eucoccidiorida]] Léger &amp; Duboscq-1910
*Order [[Ixorheorida]] Levine-1984
*Order [[Protococcidiorida]] Kheisin-1956

The order Eucoccidiorida is divided into two suborders. These two groups differ in their sexual development: [[Meiosis|syzygy]] for [[Adeleorina]] and independent gametes for [[Eimeriorina]].

The first suborder, Adeleorina, comprises coccidia of invertebrates and the coccidia that alternate between blood-sucking invertebrates and various vertebrates; this group includes ''[[Haemogregarina]]'' and ''[[Hepatozoon]]''. There are seven families in this suborder.

The second suborder, Eimeriorina, comprises coccidia of a variety of coccidia many of form cysts. A number of genera, including ''[[Toxoplasma]]'' and ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', infect vertebrates.

==Coccidiosis==

===Transmission===
Infected animals spread spores called [[Apicomplexan life cycle|oocysts]] in their stool.  The oocysts mature, called sporulation.  When another animal passes over the location where the feces were deposited, they may pick up the spores, which they then ingest when grooming themselves.  The spores may also be ingested by mice; when another animal eats the mouse it becomes infected.

Some species of coccidia are transmissible to humans, including [[toxoplasma]] and [[cryptosporidium]].&lt;ref name=marvista&gt;{{cite web|title=Coccidia|url=http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_coccidia.html|website=Mar Vista Animal Medical Center|accessdate=28 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101031440/http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_coccidia.html|archivedate=1 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infection===
Inside the host, the sporulated oocyst opens, and eight sporozites are released.  Each one finds a home in an intestinal cell and starts the process of reproduction.  These offspring are called merozoites.  When the cell is stuffed full of merozoites, it bursts open, and each merozoite finds its own intestinal cell to continue the cycle.&lt;ref name=marvista /&gt;

===Symptoms of infection===
As the infection continues, millions of intestinal cells may become infected.  As they break open, they produce a bloody, watery diarrhea.  This can cause dehydration, and can lead to death in young or small pets.&lt;ref name=marvista /&gt;

===Diagnosis and treatment===
Coccidiosis can be diagnosed by finding oocysts in [[Stool test|fecal smears]]. In early stages of the disease, there may be very few oocysts being shed, and a negative test does not rule out the disease.

Coccidiosis is most commonly treated through the administration of [[coccidiostat]]s, a group of medications that stop coccidia from reproducing. In dogs and cats, the most commonly administered coccidiostat is [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa-based]] [[antibiotic]]s.  Once reproduction stops, the animal can usually recover on its own, a process that can take a few weeks, depending on the severity of the infection and the strength of the animal's immune system.&lt;ref name=marvista /&gt;

'''Colin Chisholm''' M.D. (1755–1825) was a Scottish surgeon, medical writer and [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27Chisholm%27%29 Royal Society database, ''Chisholm; Colin (1755–1825)''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Chisholm served as a military surgeon to the British forces in the [[American War of Independence]]. After the war was over, he moved to practise medicine in [[Grenada]]; he went there in 1783, at the invitation of [[John Rollo]].&lt;ref name="Clyde41"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Francis Clyde|title=Health in Grenada|year=1985|publisher=Vade-Mecum Press |page=41|isbn=0946836205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790 he visited [[Demerara]], purchasing a cotton plantation. He also picked up an eye remedy from the [[Arawak Indians]], based on a ''[[Bignonia]]'' genus root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Francis Clyde|title=Health in Grenada|year=1985|publisher=Vade-Mecum Press |page=33|isbn=0946836205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793 Chisholm was awarded the M.D. degree by [[King's College, Aberdeen]]. In 1795 he was made surgeon-general to the ordnance. Attached to [[Ralph Abercromby]]'s expedition, he then spent five months in the [[Virgin Islands]] in 1797, and was promoted to inspector-general of hospitals.&lt;ref name="Clyde41"/&gt;

Chisholm retired on half-pay in 1800, moving to his estate in Demerara, where he spent three years growing cotton. Then he migrated back to Europe.&lt;ref name="Clyde41"/&gt; He settled in [[Bristol]], where he had a good medical practice.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Chisholm, Colin|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chisholm was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 24 November 1808. His latter days were mainly spent in retirement on the continent. He died in [[Sloane Street]], London, at the beginning of 1825.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Besides papers in medical journals, including the ''Medical Repository'', [[Andrew Duncan, the younger|Andrew Duncan]]'s ''Medical Commentaries'', and Duncan's ''Annals of Medicine'', Chisholm was the author of:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''An Essay on the Malignant Pestilential Fever introduced into the West India Islands from Boulam, on the coast of Guinea, as it appeared in 1793 and 1794'', London, 1795 (second edition, much enlarged, 2 vols. London, 1801). This work on "pestilential fever" (a generic term—the disease is now recognised as [[yellow fever]]&lt;ref name="Curtin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip D. Curtin|title=The Image of Africa: British Ideas and Action, 1780–1850. Vol.1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7k2eBK4mpwC&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=20 June 2013|year=1964|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-83025-0|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was based on Chisholm's experiences on Grenada in 1793. A ship, the ''Hankey'', arrived carrying infectious disease presumed to be from [[Bolama]], in what is now [[Guinea-Bissau]]. Chisholm gave an account, designed to identify the cause of disease in Grenada as [[Infectious disease|contagion]]. The theory of contagious disease being contentious, there was criticism, and the second edition amplified the argument with the example of the American [[Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793]].&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Charles Booth|title=John Haygarth, Frs (1740–1827): A Physician of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXS07n2njQYC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=1 January 2005|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-254-2|pages=124–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the term "Bulam fever" was applied to yellow fever, and [[William Pym]] wrote on it under that name in 1815.&lt;ref name="Curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Pym]]|title=Observations upon the Bulam fever, which has of late years prevailed in the West-Indies, on the coast of America, at Gibraltar, Cadiz, and other parts of Spain: with a collection of facts proving it to be a highly contagious disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiZFAAAAcAAJ|accessdate=20 June 2013|year=1815|publisher=Callow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy on yellow fever continued well into the 19th century. [[Usher Parsons]] writing in 1836 denied it was contagious, and stated that [[quarantine]] was useless against it, while citing the views of Chisholm (on two kinds of yellow fever), Pym and [[James Fellowes (physician)|James Fellowes]], and believers in "[[contingent contagion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Samuel Stewart|title=The Naval Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPw_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA357|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=1836|publisher=United States Naval Lyceum|pages=357–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Ormiston McWilliam]] had his 1847 report on an outbreak at [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] published by the UK Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=17747|title=McWilliam, James Ormiston|first=Lynn|last=Milne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1794 Chisholm married Elizabeth Cooper in Inverness.&lt;ref name="Clyde41"/&gt; His daughter Janet (c.1800–1890) married Thomas Waddington (1792–1869), a son of the cotton merchant William Waddington (1751–1818) who emigrated to France. [[William Henry Waddington]] was their son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=S. Seikaly |editor2=R. Baalbaki |editor3=P.

'''Computer-assisted interventions''' (CAI) is a field of research and practice, where [[medical]] interventions are supported by computer-based tools and methodologies. Examples include:
*[[Medical robot|Medical robotics]]
*Surgical and interventional navigation
*Imaging and image processing methods for CAI
*Clinical feasibility studies of computer-enhanced interventions
*Tracked and guided [[Biopsy|biopsies]]
*Alignment of pre-procedure images with the patient during the procedure
*Intraoperative decision supports
*Skill analysis and workflow studies in CAI
*Clinical studies of CAI showing first-in-man or early efficacy results
*[[User interface|User interfaces]] and visualization systems for CAI
*Surgical and interventional systems
*Novel surgical devices and sensors
*User performance studies 
*Validation and evaluation of CAI technology

The basic paradigm of patient-specific interventional medicine is a closed loop process, consisting of 
# combining specific information about the patient with the physician’s general knowledge to determine the patient’s condition; 
# formulating a plan of action; 
# carrying out this plan; and 
# evaluating the results.

The experience gathered over many patients may be combined to improve treatment plans and protocols for future patients. This process has existed since ancient times. Traditionally, all these steps have taken place in the physicians head. The ability of modern computer-based technology to assist humans in processing and acting on complex information will profoundly enhance this process in the 21st Century.

==Surgical Process Modeling and Analysis==
In order to gain an explicit and formal understanding of [[surgery]], the field of analyses and modelling of [[surgical procedures]] has recently emerged. The challenge is to support the [[surgeon]] and the [[surgical procedure]] through the understanding of [[Operating Room]] (OR) activities, with the help of [[sensor]]- or human-based systems. Related surgical models can then be introduced into a new generation of Computer-Assisted Interventions systems to improve the management of complex multimodal information, improve surgical workflows, increase surgical efficiency and the quality of care in the OR. Models created by these different approaches may have a large impact in future surgical innovations, whether for planning, intra-operative or post-operative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Lalys F, Jannin P. Surgical process modelling: a review. International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery. 2013.DOI 10.1007/s11548-013-0940-5&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of describing the surgical procedure as a sequence of tasks was first introduced by MacKenzie et al. (2001).&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie CL, Ibbotson AJ, Cao CGL, Lomax A. Hierarchical decomposition of laparoscopic surgery: a human factors approach to investigating the operating room environment. Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol. 2001; 10(3): 121-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  and formalised in Jannin et al., 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Jannin P, Raimbault M, Morandi X, Seigneuret E and Gibaud B. Design of a neurosurgical gestures model for multimodal image guided surgery. Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery. 2001; 102-107&lt;/ref&gt; The term Surgical Process (SP) has been defined as a set of one or more linked procedures or activities that collectively realise a surgical objective within the context of an organisational structure defining functional roles and relationships.&lt;ref name="neumuth2009"&gt;Neumuth T, Jannin P, Strauss G, Meixensberger J, Burgert O. Validation of Knowledge Acquisition for Surgical Process Models. J AMIA. 2008; 16(1): 72-82.&lt;/ref&gt; This term is generally used to describe the steps involved in a surgical procedure. A Surgical Process Model (SPM) has been defined as a simplified pattern of an SP that reflects a predefined subset of interest of the SP in a formal or semi-formal representation. It relates to the performance of an SP with support from a workflow management system.

Surgical process models are described from observer based acquisition,&lt;ref name="neumuth2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jannin P Morandi X. Surgical models for computer-assisted neurosurgery. Neuroimage. 2007; 37(3): 783-91.&lt;/ref&gt; or sensor-based acquisition (such as signals,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadi A, Sielhorst T, Stauder R, Horn M, Feussner H, Navab N.

'''Dyssynergia''' is any disturbance of [[Muscle|muscular]] coordination, resulting in uncoordinated and abrupt movements. This is also an aspect of [[ataxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=27461|title=Dyssynergia -- Medical Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical for dyssynergic patients to split a movement into several smaller movements. Types of dyssynergia include [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 1]], [[bladder sphincter dyssynergia]], and [[anal sphincter dyssynergia]].

Dyssynergia can be caused by disruption or damage between the [[brainstem]] and the [[sacrum|sacral]] [[spinal cord]]. Damage to the spinal cord can be caused by injury or acquired through hereditary means such as [[myelodysplasia]]. Other hereditary means of dyssynergia can be from [[multiple sclerosis]] and various manifestations of transverse [[myelitis]].

In addition, most brain damage to the [[cerebellum]] will cause dyssynergia. The cerebellum is split into three separate parts: the [[archicerebellum]] (controls equilibrium and helps to move the eye, head and neck), midline vermis (helps to move lower body), and lateral hemisphere (control of arms and quick movements). Damage to any part of the cerebellum can cause a disconnect between nerve cells and muscles, causing impaired muscle coordination.

==Types==

===Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 1===
[[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 1]] is a rare, [[neurodegenerative]] disorder characterized by [[myoclonus]], [[intention tremor]], progressive [[ataxia]] and occasionally [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="ramsayhunt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ramsayhunt.org/epon.shtml | title = Ramsay Hunt Syndrome | accessdate = 2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ninds"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyssynergia/dyssynergia.htm | title = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | date = February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bladder sphincter dyssynergia===
[[Bladder sphincter dyssynergia]] also known as detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is the decrease of [[detrusor]] (wall muscle of the bladder) pressure which causes unwanted urination. This is very common in spinal cord injuries and [[multiple sclerosis]] patients. There is a malfunction between the central nervous system, urinary sphincters, and detrusor muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoffel|first1=John|title=Detrusor Sphincter Dyssynergia: a Review of Physiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment Strategies|journal=Translational Andrology and Urology|date=February 5, 2016|volume=5|pages=127–135|doi=10.3978/j.issn.2223-4683.2016.01.08|pmc=4739973|pmid=26904418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anal sphincter dyssynergia===
[[Anal sphincter dyssynergia]] also known as pelvic floor dyssynergia is the weakening of the [[pelvic floor]] or sphincters in the anus. The pelvic floor are the muscles that attach to the pelvis in the abdomen. Anal sphincter dyssynergia can be caused by obstructions, but mostly improper relaxing of the anal sphincters or pelvic floor muscle during defecation. Also if there is a decrease in intrarectal pressure defecation can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seong|first1=Moo-Kwung|last2=Kim|first2=Tae-Won|title=Significance of defecographic parameters in diagnosing pelvic floor dyssynergia|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|date=March 26, 2013|volume=84|pages=225–230|pmc=3616276|doi=10.4174/jkss.2013.84.4.225|pmid=23577317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Anal sphincter dyssynergia===
[[Anal sphincter dyssynergia]] tends to be one of the most predicted diagnoses with a patient suffering from symptoms like chronic constipation and [[fecal incontinence|inability to control bowel movements]]. Diagnosis techniques for dyssynergia have been known to be expensive and aren’t commonly offered at some countrywide hospitals. Fortunately, there are still special tests and examinations that can be done given the proper medical care and treatment to properly detect and diagnose dyssynergia. Those following treatments include: [[anorectal manometry]] (balloon expulsion test and anal sphincter EMG), defecography studies, and digital rectal examinations (DRE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tantphlachiva|first1=Kasaya|last2=Priyanka|first2=Rao|last3=Rao|first3=Satish|title=Digital Rectal Examination Is a Useful Tool for Identifying Patients With Dyssynergia|journal=Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology|date=November 2010|volume=8|issue=11|pages=955–960|url=http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(10)00678-6/fulltext|accessdate=March 30, 2016|doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2010.06.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anorectal manometry====
Anorectal manometry involves two separate tests: the balloon expulsion test and anal sphincter [[electromyography]] (EMG). These tests are performed in order to properly identify and diagnose dyssynergia. In order to prepare for these tests, a patient must fast and perform specific enemas recommended by their doctor two hours before their tests. When undergoing the balloon expulsion test, the patient has a small balloon inserted into their rectum, which is then inflated and filled with water. The patient is then instructed to go to the nearest bathroom and to attempt to defecate the balloon, where the time it takes is recorded by the doctors. An abnormal or prolonged time of expulsion of the balloon is seen as a problem in the anorectum region of the body and may lead to the diagnosis of dyssynergia, since the patient has a lack of control over their anorectal muscle contractions. Another technique used by doctors to test for dyssynergia is the anal sphincter EMG. This test involves the insertion of an electrode into the patient’s anal cavity, where they are asked to relax and push, as if they are trying to defecate. The electrical activity and contractile pressures of the patient’s anorectal contractions are recorded on a computer monitor and examined by the doctor. If the electrical activity of the contractions appear normal, but the patient still results in constipation, it would indicate that there is a problem in the muscle activity or that there might be a tear in the muscle. This can help lead to a diagnosis of dyssynergia or an alternative surgical cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patient Information on Anorectal Manometry|url=http://www.motilitysociety.org/patient/pdf/Anorectal%20Manometry%20Patient%20Information%208%205%202005.pdf|website=Motility Society|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defecography studies====
In defecography studies, doctors take an X-Ray of the patient and examine their rectum as it empties during defecation. Before the examination, patients are instructed to drink barium an hour before the examination. Barium paste is then inserted into the rectal and anal cavity, and for female patients X-Ray dye is placed on the urinary bladder and in the vagina. The barium is used so that the digestive tract, such as the intestines, rectal cavity, and anal cavity can be seen clearly on the X-Ray and the muscle movements can be examined by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defecography|url=http://www.ddc.musc.edu/public/tests/diagnostic-radiology/defecography.html|website=MUSC Health|publisher=Medical University of South Carolina|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital rectal examinations====
During a digital rectal examinations (DRE), a doctor will wear a lubricated latex glove and gently insert one finger, or digit, into the patient’s anus to perform a physical examination of the lower pelvic regions. This test is traditionally used for men to check the prostate gland for any abnormal bumps or growths, and for women to check the uterus and ovaries. This test can help identify complications that may be causing abnormal bowel habits, which can help properly diagnose cases of dyssynergia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staller|first=Kyle|date=2015-09-07|title=Role of Anorectal Manometry in Clinical Practice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11938-015-0067-6|journal=Current Treatment Options in Gastroenterology|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=418–431|doi=10.1007/s11938-015-0067-6|issn=1092-8472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Bladder sphincter dyssynergia===

====Medication====
[[Alpha blockers]] have been studied when treating people with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). [[Terazosin]] has shown no reduction in voiding pressures with people who have suffered from spinal cord injuries, while [[Tamsulosin]] was given to patients with MS and resulted in improvement of post void residual measurements. However, it is not advised to use alpha blockers due to the lack of data supporting their success.
Anti-spasmodic medications have also been tested on people with DSD. Oral Baclofen has limited benefit in treating DSD because it has low permeability across the blood brain barrier.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoffel|first1=John|title=Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia: a review of physiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies|journal=Translational Andrology and Urology|date=Feb 2016|volume=5|pages=127–135|pmc=4739973|pmid=26904418|doi=10.3978/j.issn.2223-4683.2016.01.08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PTCA stent NIH.gif|right|thumb|Diagram of coronary angioplasty and stent placement.  Urethral stent is similar to that used in heart.]]

====Catheterization====
Intermittent [[catheters]] are used most frequently to treat DSD. The catheter is able to be inserted and removed from a person's bladder several times a day, so it is not permanently installed. This is to help people who struggle to empty their bladder. It is recommended that a person does not empty their bladder until a catheter is installed and stabilized. By having the catheter, the goal is to help reduce spasms within the sphincter. Ultrasound can be used to help track how effective the use of the catheter is. If a person struggles with using an intermittent catheter, than an indwelling catheter can be used instead. The indwelling has the same function, however it is designed to remain in the bladder.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== Botox ====
[[Botox|Botulinum A Toxin]] (BTX A) is injected into the external sphincter via cystoscopic or [[ultrasound]]. Botox blocks the release of [[acetylcholine]], a neurotransmitter that is needed for muscle contraction. With the release of acetylcholine inhibited, muscles will become more relaxed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== Urethral stents ====
Urethral stents are thin wires that are placed within the urethra to either treat or prevent obstruction of urine flowing from the kidney. The stents can either be placed temporarily or permanently.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== Sphincterotomy ==== 
[[Sphincterotomy]] is the most invasive treatment to use when treating DSD. The purpose of the treatment is to create a low pressure within the bladder as well as impair the external sphincter. [[Electrocautery]] is used to cut out the external sphincter, which can result in a lot of bleeding. A catheter is then used to help relieve pressure that can occur.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynard|first1=J M|last2=Vass|first2=J|last3=Sullivan|first3=M E|last4=Mamas|first4=M|title=Sphincterotomy and the treatment of detrusor–sphincter dyssynergia: current status, future prospects|journal=Spinal Cord|volume=41|pages=1–11|doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3101378|url=http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v41/n1/full/3101378a.html|accessdate=March 30, 2016|pmid=12494314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EQ-5D was first introduced in 1990 by the EuroQol Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EuroQol Group|date=1990-12-01|title=EuroQol--a new facility for the measurement of health-related quality of life|journal=Health Policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|volume=16|issue=3|pages=199–208|issn=0168-8510|pmid=10109801|doi=10.1016/0168-8510(90)90421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was initially formed in 1987 with the researchers of multidisciplinary areas from five European countries; Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Finland, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euroqol.org/about-eq-5d/working-paper-series/file/EuroQol_Working_Paper_Series_Manuscript_15003_-_Richard_Brooks_01.pdf.html|title=28 Years of the EuroQol Group: An Overview|last=Brooks|first=Richard|date=December 2015|website=EQ-5D|publisher=EuroQol Research Foundation|access-date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked cooperatively with the aim of developing an instrument which is not specific to disease but standardized and can be used as a complement for existing [[Quality of life (healthcare)|health-related quality of life]] (HRQoL) measures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euroqol.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/PDF/Folders_Flyers/EQ-5D-3L_UserGuide_2015.pdf|title=EQ-5D-3L User Guide|last=Reenen|first=Mandy van|date=April 2015|website=EQ-5D|publisher=EuroQol Research Foundation|access-date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabin|first=R.|last2=de Charro|first2=F.|date=2001-07-01|title=EQ-5D: a measure of health status from the EuroQol Group|journal=Annals of Medicine|volume=33|issue=5|pages=337–343|issn=0785-3890|pmid=11491192|doi=10.3109/07853890109002087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other required characteristics of the new instrument were capable of being sent as a postal questionnaire for self-completion, easy to complete, applicable to everyone, can produce a single index value, and can take into account the health status ‘worse than dead’.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Components ==
The EQ-5D questionnaire is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in "work, study, housework, family or leisure activities". In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.

In evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the [[visual analogue scale]] (EQ-VAS).

=== Descriptive system ===

====EQ-5D-3L====
When EQ-5D was first developed, the scale used in the health state description part was three-level; having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as "I have no problems in walking about", "I have some problems in walking about", and "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). 12321 indicates having no problems in mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight problems in self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme problems in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) different health states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== EQ-5D-Y ====
A 'youth version' of the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system was developed for self-completion by children and younger people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wille|first=Nora|last2=Badia|first2=Xavier|last3=Bonsel|first3=Gouke|last4=Burström|first4=Kristina|last5=Cavrini|first5=Gulia|last6=Devlin|first6=Nancy|last7=Egmar|first7=Ann-Charlotte|last8=Greiner|first8=Wolfgang|last9=Gusi|first9=Narcis|date=2010-04-20|title=Development of the EQ-5D-Y: a child-friendly version of the EQ-5D|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-010-9648-y|journal=Quality of Life Research|language=en|volume=19|issue=6|pages=875–886|doi=10.1007/s11136-010-9648-y|issn=0962-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes equivalent dimensions to the original EQ-5D-3L, phrased so as to be more easily understood and relevant for younger people. The dimensions are: 'mobility', 'looking after myself', 'doing usual activities', 'having pain or discomfort' and 'feeling worried, sad or unhappy'.

==== EQ-5D-5L ====
Although its brevity contributed a lot for the wide use of EQ-5D, the three-level scale showed some limitations. The major drawback is that it has much fewer descriptive capability of health status compared to other generic instruments. For example, the [[Health Utilities Index]] Mark 2 and Mark 3 (HUI 2 and HUI 3) and the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) can define 24,000, 972,000, and 18,000 unique health states, while EQ-5D-3L can do only 243.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a consequence, it suffers from ceiling and flowing effect and showed low sensitivity to catch small changes of health status especially when used to patients with milder conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herdman|first=M.|last2=Gudex|first2=C.|last3=Lloyd|first3=A.|last4=Janssen|first4=Mf|last5=Kind|first5=P.|last6=Parkin|first6=D.|last7=Bonsel|first7=G.|last8=Badia|first8=X.|date=2011-12-01|title=Development and preliminary testing of the new five-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L)|journal=Quality of Life Research: An International Journal of Quality of Life Aspects of Treatment, Care and Rehabilitation|volume=20|issue=10|pages=1727–1736|doi=10.1007/s11136-011-9903-x|issn=1573-2649|pmc=3220807|pmid=21479777}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve such constraints of the three-level scale, the new version of EQ-5D with five-level scale was developed (EQ-5D-5L).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euroqol.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/PDF/Products/Sample_UK__English__EQ-5D-5L_Paper_Self_complete_v1.0__ID_24700_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The number of levels of severity was increased to five in this new version; having no problems, having slight problems, having moderate problems, having severe problems and being unable to do/having extreme problems. The new version can define 3,125 (=5&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) different health states. Some of the wordings of the scale were revisited to be clearer and the instruction for EQ-VAS was simplified. No changes were made for the five dimensions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The validity and reliability of the EQ-5D have been assessed for the different language versions and various health conditions, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, COPD, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Hout|first=Ben|last2=Janssen|first2=M. F.|last3=Feng|first3=You-Shan|last4=Kohlmann|first4=Thomas|last5=Busschbach|first5=Jan|last6=Golicki|first6=Dominik|last7=Lloyd|first7=Andrew|last8=Scalone|first8=Luciana|last9=Kind|first9=Paul|date=2012-08-01|title=Interim scoring for the EQ-5D-5L: mapping the EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L value sets|journal=Value in Health: The Journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research|volume=15|issue=5|pages=708–715|doi=10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008|issn=1524-4733|pmid=22867780}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5L system showed improved responsiveness compared to the 3L system, and also good validity and reliability . EQ-5D-5L has also been recommended to the elderly population as a generic health status measurement, in combination with other supplementary measurements to capture all related aspects in their quality-of-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulamu|first=Norma B.|last2=Kaambwa|first2=Billingsley|last3=Ratcliffe|first3=Julie|date=2015-11-09|title=A systematic review of instruments for measuring outcomes in economic evaluation within aged care|url=http://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-015-0372-8|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s12955-015-0372-8|pmc=4640110|pmid=26553129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ===
Visual analogue scale is the second part of the questionnaire, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20&amp;nbsp;cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. There are notes at the both ends of the scale that the bottom rate (0) corresponds to " the worst health you can imagine", and the highest rate (100) corresponds to "the best health you can imagine".  In the EQ-5D-3L version, the respondents has to draw a line from the box on the questionnaire to the scale indicates the health state of the interviewed day, while the EQ-5D-5L version asks to mark X on the scale to indicate the today's health and write the number of the scale marked in the empty box on the questionnaire.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A well-known limitation of visual analogue scale is end-of-scale bias that respondents are less likely to use the extreme ends of the scale for rating their health status. However, it is still useful and the simplest direct method for valuing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) weights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Sarah J.|last2=Ali|first2=Shehzad|date=2010-01-01|title=Health outcomes in economic evaluation: the QALY and utilities|journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=96|pages=5–21|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldq033|issn=1471-8391|pmid=21037243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Valuation process ==
Once the health status is assessed from the description part, the 5-digit number can be converted into a preference weight which is also referred to as a single weighted index score. It can be done by using methods for generating HRQoL weights, such as visual analogue scale (VAS), the [[time-trade-off]] (TTO), and the standard gamble (SG). The choice of the valuation methods can vary. The initial purpose of having visual analogue scale in the EQ-5D questionnaire was to get preference weights using the scale, but the time-trade-off has become favored because it is a "choice task", not a "rating task" which easily involves some scaling bias.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Time-trade-off is recommended when performing cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as an outcome, but other methods could be chosen for different type of analyses. A value set was developed using time-trade-off in many countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Japan, and Germany.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The index score of a value set derived from the general population sample can be regarded as a "''societal'' valuation of the respondent's health state" in that country. In contrast, the scores from the visual analogue scale in the questionnaire indicates the respondent's ''own'' assessment of his/her health status".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0233-1_2|title=Guidelines for analysing and reporting EQ-5D outcomes|last=Krabbe|first=Paul|last2=Weijnen|first2=Tom|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048162611|editor-last=Brooks|editor-first=Richard|pages=7–19|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0233-1_2|editor-last2=Rabin|editor-first2=Rosalind|editor-last3=Charro|editor-first3=Frank de}}&lt;/ref&gt; A value set derived from the general population sample has been criticized for a lack of a compelling theoretical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandjour|first1=Afschin|title=Theoretical Foundation of Patient v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3819">An '''electrically conducting yarn''' is a [[yarn]] that conducts [[electricity]]. Conducting yarns are used to manufacture [[carpet]]s and other items that dissipate [[static electricity]], &lt;ref name =patent&gt;[http://www.freshpatents.com/Electrically-conductive-yarn-dt20051222ptan20050282009.php Electrically conductive yarn], a patent description&lt;/ref&gt; such as work clothes in highly flammable environments, e.g., in the [[petrochemistry]] industry.

There are several methods known to manufacture electrically [[conductive textile]]s. The simplest way is to incorporate metal wires or wire meshes into fabrics. Another approach is to use metalized yarns. In [[staple yarn]]s, it is possible to spin short strands of regular yarns with metal yarns. Electrically conducting yarns may be made of a central metal strand with regular yarn woven around it. &lt;ref name=patent/&gt; It is however also possible to coat a base polymer (such as [[Nylon 6|Polyamide 6]] or [[Polyester]]) with metal like silver. Yarns of that sort are for example "Shieldex"[https://www.statex.de/en/] or "SwicoSilver"[https://www.swicofil.com/commerce/brands/swicosilver].

An altogether different approach involves yarns based on [[conductive polymer]]s, such as [[polyaniline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112593262/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Polyaniline-coated PET conductive yarns: Study of electrical, mechanical, and electro-mechanical properties], ''[[Journal of Applied Polymer Science]]'' (2006) Volume 101, Issue 3  , Pages 1252 - 1256 
{{doi|10.1002/app.22799}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[FAO]] has always highlighted [[information]] and [[Knowledge sharing]] as priority areas in fighting [[hunger]] and achieving [[food security]].&lt;ref&gt;See ARTICLE I of FAO Constitution: The Organization shall collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture. http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5584E/x5584e0i.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[FAO]] identified that [[countries]] could improve their national programmes on [[agriculture]] and [[food security]] if they could access [[FAO]]'s information through a cross-sectoral (or [[interdisciplinary]]) country-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;Programme of Work and Budget 2002–2003:  http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/003/y1194e/y1194e06b.htm#P11324_311453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Programme of Work and Budget 2004–2005: http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/006/y9859e/Y9859e07a.htm#P10820_371793&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the existence of a large number of country-based [[information systems]] in FAO, the information managed by the various systems lacked [[System integration|integration]]. Information tended to be generated and used in a circumscribed manner and tailored to a specific system, department or [[sector (economic)|sector]].

The [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/ FAO Country Profiles] portal, initially called FAO Country Profiles and Mapping Information System, was launched in 2002 responding to the Organization's need to provide [[FAO]] web site's users an easy to use mechanism to find FAO country-specific [[information]] without the need to [[Search engine technology|search]] individual [[FAO]] [[web sites]], [[databases]] or [[systems]]. The system was designed to integrate [[Scientific modelling|analytical]] and [[multilingual]] information with thematic databases and [[Digital data|digital]] [[map]] [[Disciplinary repository|repositories]] and to facilitate access to information on multiple factors contributing to national [[food insecurity]].

Since its launch, the system has grown by incorporating more and more [[FAO Country Profiles#Data sources|data sources]]. This was achieved thanks to a [[corporate]] effort to reduce [[information silo]]s and the adoption of [[international standards]] for country-based [[information management]] throughout the Organization.

== Country Profiles ==

The methodology behind the [[FAO]] Country Profiles is rather simple; it links, reuses and repackages data and information from most relevant existing [[FAO]] [[databases]] and [[systems]].

The [[FAO]] Country Profiles covers current FAO Members and Associated Nations.&lt;ref&gt;FAO membership as the 17 November 2007: {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/Legal/member-e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714053406/http://www.fao.org/Legal/member-e.htm |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a country is selected, the portal presents to the user [[documents]], news feeds, [[statistical data]], project details and [[map]]s from relevant [[FAO Country Profiles#Data sources|FAO databases and systems]] for the selected [[country]] and categorized according to thematic areas.

The thematic areas are grouped in two categories:

* FAO Core Activities: these correspond to  [[FAO]]'s main areas of expertise, such as, [[natural resources]], [[economics]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fisheries]] and technical cooperation. This grouping is based on the work of the corresponding [[FAO]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of FAO departments and divisions, please see http://www.fao.org/about/depart/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Global issues: these are themes that [[FAO]] identified as priority areas for action, and include [[biodiversity]], [[biotechnology]], [[climate change]], [[diseases]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]], [[emergency]] and aid, [[food security]] and [[food safety|safety]], [[trade]] and [[prices]], [[water management]]. These priority areas correspond to [[FAO]]'s strategic response to a fast-changing world where issues ranging from [[biotechnology]] to [[climate change]] and [[trade]] present new challenges and choices to governments and the general public.

===Data sources ===

Country pages provide access to or integrate the following thematic profiles and systems.&lt;ref name="Inventory of resources"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/resources.asp Inventory of data sources used in the FAO country profiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925011534/http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/resources.asp |date=2009-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geopolitical Ontology in Country Profiles August 12 2009 v 1.png|thumb|200px|right| Geopolitical information section in the FAO Country Profiles.]]

There are various [[international standards]] and [[coding systems]] to manage country information. Historically, systems dealing with different types of data used different coding systems that were tailored to specific data type requirements. For example, [[statistical systems]] in the [[United Nations]] commonly use the M-49 classification and pigmentation&lt;ref&gt;Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[UN]] code) or the [[FAOSTAT]] area classification;&lt;ref&gt;FAOSTAT standardized list of country/territories and groupings: http://faostat.fao.org/site/441/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; mapping systems could use [[geographic coordinates]] or [[Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)|GAUL]] codes; textual systems (document repositories or web sites) could use [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] or [[AGROVOC]] keywords; etc.

The FAO Country Profiles provide access to systems managing [[statistics]], [[documents]], [[map]]s, [[news feeds]], etc., therefore one of its key aspects to succeed was the mapping of all these [[country codes]].

For this purpose a [[geopolitical ontology]] was developed.&lt;ref&gt;For linking country-based heterogeneous data at [[FAO]], please see:[http://www.semanticuniverse.com/articles-integrating-country-based-heterogeneous-data-united-nations-fao%E2%80%99s-geopolitical-ontology-and Integrating Country-based heterogeneous data at the United Nations: FAO's geopolitical ontology and services.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925091739/http://www.semanticuniverse.com/articles-integrating-country-based-heterogeneous-data-united-nations-fao%E2%80%99s-geopolitical-ontology-and |date=2009-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ontology, among other features, maps [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO2]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|ISO3]], [[AGROVOC]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090219154825/http://www.fao.org/faoterm/index.asp?lang=en FAOTERM], [[Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)|GAUL]], [[UN]], and [[UNDP]] codes for all countries.

== Global Resources ==

Besides the profiles for each country the portal also provides access to other important global resources, such as:

=== Low-Income Food Deficit Countries (LIFDC) ===
The FAO Country Profiles keeps updated for the public the list of [[LIFDC]] countries. This list is revised every year according to the methodology explained below. The new list of the LIFDC,&lt;ref&gt;For an updated list of Low-Income Food Deficit Countries, please check this page: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc/en/&lt;/ref&gt; stands at 62 countries, four less than in the (2012) list. These are: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Timor-Leste]], [[Republic of Moldova]]. While [[Moldova]] graduated from the list on the basis of net food-exporter criterion, the other graduated based on income criterion.

==== LIFDC methodology====

The classification of a country as low-income food-deficit used for analytical purposes by [[FAO]] is traditionally determined by three criteria:

# A country should have a [[per capita income]] below the "historical" ceiling used by the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;For operational and analytical purposes, the World Bank’s main criterion for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Classifications are set each year on 1 July. These official analytical classifications are fixed during the World Bank's fiscal year (ending on 30 June), thus countries remain in the categories in which they are classified irrespective of any revisions to their per capita income data. (Source: [[The World Bank]])&lt;/ref&gt; to determine eligibility for [[International Development Association|IDA]] assistance and for 20-year [[IBRD]] terms, applied to countries included in the World Bank categories I and II.&lt;ref&gt;Several important distinctions among member countries are commonly used at the World Bank Group. Countries choose whether they are part of Part I or Part II primarily on the basis of their economic standing. Part I are almost all industrial countries and donors to IDA and they pay their contributions in freely convertible currency. Part II countries are almost all developing countries, some of which are donors to IDA. Part II countries are entitled to pay most of their contribution to IDA in local currency. Please see: "A Guide to the World Bank Group", The World Bank, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the historical ceiling of per capita [[gross national income]] (GNI) for 2006, based on the World Bank Atlas method,&lt;ref&gt;Please see: [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20452009~menuPK:64133156~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419~isCURL:Y~isCURL:Y,00.html The World Bank Atlas Method]&lt;/ref&gt; was US$1,735, i.e. higher than the level established for 2005 ($1,675).
# The net food [[trade]]&lt;ref&gt;Net food trade refers to the gross imports less gross exports of food&lt;/ref&gt; position of a country averaged over the preceding three years for which statistics are available, in this case from 2003 to 2005. Trade volumes for a broad basket of basic foodstuffs ([[cereals]], [[root]]s and [[tubers]], [[pulses]], [[oilseeds]] and oils other than tree crop oils, [[meat]] and [[dairy products]]) are converted and aggregated by the [[calorie]] content of individual [[commodities]].
# A self-exclusion criterion is applied when countries that meet the above two criteria specifically request FAO to be excluded from the LIFDC category.

In order to avoid countries changing their LIFDC status too frequently - typically due to short-term, [[exogenous]] shocks - an additional factor was introduced in 2001. This factor, called "persistence of position", would postpone the "exit" of a LIFDC from the list, despite the country not meeting the LIFDC [[income]] criterion or the [[food-deficit]] criterion, until the change in its status is verified for three consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of countries and economies sorted by their gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, please see [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FAO Member Countries and Flags ===

The FAO Country Profiles is FAO's source for dissemination of [[FAO]]'s Member Nations and Associated Nations&lt;ref&gt;The list of FAO member countries and date of entry is available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/Legal/member-e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714053406/http://www.fao.org/Legal/member-e.htm |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; official flags.&lt;ref&gt;The list of FAO member countries and flags is available at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/&lt;/ref&gt; The update of any [[country flag]] is coordinated with the other [[United Nations]] agencies. All flags are made available in a standardized manner which also aims to help web site owners to ensure that they always display the official country flag.

The standard URL for any given country flag would be composed by: the generic URL: "http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/" to which the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2]] code for the country is added, plus the image format suffix ".gif". For instance, the URL for the [[Argentine flag|Argentina flag]] would be: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/AR.gif, with AR being the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;One of several international coding systems (some of the others being: [[ISO2]], [[ISO3]], [[AGROVOC]], [[FAOSTAT]], [[FAOTERM]], [[GAUL]], [[UN]], and [[UNDP]]) for territories and groups.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Early criticism of the [[FAO]] Country Profiles was that, in its inception phase, it only contained very few resources. Since 2002, the number of available resources has increased to cover country-based information and data, directly linked from [[FAO]]'s web pages or [[FAO]]'s digital repositories.&lt;ref name="Inventory of resources"/&gt; Over the last years, another identified area for improvement was the simplicity of the system methodology, being the resources only linked from country pages and thus, lacking real integration. This need was addressed by starting to integrate additional data, such as, the fisheries charts or the news and events items taken from [[AgriFeeds]]. In addition, in order to provide more complete country profiles, the system started to link or integrate  non-[[FAO]] resources.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The consistency, degree of [[Viscosity|fluidity]], and other mechanical properties  are important in understanding how long food can be stored, how stable it will remain, and in determining food texture. The acceptability of food products to the consumer is often determined by food texture, such as  how spreadable and creamy a food product is. Food rheology is important in [[quality control]] during food  manufacture and processing.&lt;ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:PeanutButter.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Peanut butter in the jar]]
There is a large body of literature on food rheology because  the study of food rheology entails unique factors beyond an understanding of the basic rheological dynamics of  the flow and deformation of matter. Food can be classified according to its rheological state, such as a [[solid]], [[gel]], [[liquid]], [[emulsion]] with associated rheological behaviors, and  its rheological properties can be measured.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;
{{cite book
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYE586GZtRsC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Food+Rheology&amp;ei=6fqzSu-WJJHyMrSv_bcP#v=onepage&amp;q=Food%20Rheology&amp;f=false

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These properties will affect the design of  [[food processing]] plants, as well as [[shelf life]] and other important factors, including  sensory properties that appeal to consumers. Because foods are structurally complex, often a mixture of fluid and solids with varying properties within a single mass, the study of food rheology is more complicated than  study  in fields such as the rheology of [[polymers]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; However, food rheology is something we experience every day with our perception of food texture (see below) and basic concepts of food rheology well apply to polymers physics, oil flow etc. For this reason, examples of food rheology are didactically useful to explain the dynamics of other materials we are less familiar with. Ketchup is commonly used an example of [[Bingham fluid]] and its flow behavior can be compared to that of a polymer melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Rheology Experiments for Master students|url=http://giandonet.altervista.org/Marco/Rheology/experimental%20rheology%20TP.html|work= Aix-Marseille University - Course of Rheology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

==Psychorheology==
Psychorheology is the sensory judgement of rheological properties. It is a term used in the [[food industry]], to describe how a food "feels" to the mouth. It is not necessarily straightforward to predict how a food will "feel" based purely on the true rheological properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szczesniak A. S.|title=Psychorheology and texture as factors controlling the consumer acceptance of food|journal=Cereal Foods World|date=December 1991|volume=35|issue=12|pages=1201–1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important factor in food rheology is [[consumer]] perception of the product. This perception  is affected by how the food looks on the plate as well as how it feels in the mouth, or "[[mouthfeel]]". Mouthfeel is influenced by how food moves or flows once it is in a person's mouth and determines how desirable the food is seen to be.&lt;ref name="texture"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Gelre Hospitals''' ({{lang-nl|Gelre Ziekenhuizen}}) is a group of hospitals comprising hospitals in [[Apeldoorn]] and [[Zutphen]], and an outpatient clinic in [[Lochem]]. As of 31 December 2006, Gelre Hospitals maintains a total of 925 beds, 115 full-time physicians (for a total of 190 physicians), and 3300 total personnel. Gelre Hospitals serves as a teaching hospital for medical residents in 12 specialties, as well as for nurses and laboratory, radiological and surgical assistants.

==Locations==

===Lukas ([[Apeldoorn]])===
Lukas hospital is the largest hospital in the Gelre group. It is located in the southern part of Apeldoorn ({{coord|52|10|52|N|5|56|50|E|region:NL}}) and offers all common medical specialties with the exception of cardiothoracic surgery and neurosurgery. It has a 24/7 [[emergency department]]. During 2005 - 2008, it underwent major renovation and expansion, allowing all units from the Juliana site, which was closed in 2009, to move to the Lukas site.

===[[Zutphen]]===
The Zutphen hospital is the second largest hospital in the Gelre group. It is located in the southeastern part of [[Zutphen]] ({{coord|52|7|27|N|6|13|5|E|region:NL}}) and offers all common medical specialties with the exception of cardiothoracic surgery and neurosurgery. It has a 24/7 [[emergency department]]. An out-of-hours [[general practitioner]]s clinic is co-located with the emergency department. In 2011, the hospital moved to a new building. The previous building, known as Spittaal, built in 1974, was demolished in 2013.

===Polikliniek Lochem ([[Lochem]])===
The outpatient clinic in Lochem ({{coord|52|9|20|N|6|25|23|E|region:NL}}) offers outpatient services for most common specialties, such as cardiology and neurology, including laboratory and basic radiologic facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4121">'''Hagiotherapy''' is the term used to describe the medieval practice of using religious relics, prayers, pilgrimages etc. to alleviate sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Susan ''The Performance of Self: Ritual, Clothing and Identity During the Hundred Years War (Middle Ages)'' University of Pennsylvania Press (28 May 2002) {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1806-0}} p.186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2st-PkahafIC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=hagiotherapy&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=35ttS6bmNY62ywSX3ojnDQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=hagiotherapy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to treat epilepsy during the Middle Ages with [[Saint Valentine]] particularly associated with the treatment as an 'epilepsy specialist'.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez-Ibor Jr, JJ and Maria Ines Lopez-Ibor Alcocer "Religious Experience and Psychopathology"  in  Peter Verhagen, Herman M. Van Praag, Juan Jose López-Ibor, John Cox, Driss Moussaoui
''Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries: Implications for Clinical Practice (World Psychiatric Association)' ' WileyBlackwell (29 Dec 2009) {{ISBN|978-0-470-69471-8}} p.213, pdf of chapter at [http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/18/04706947/0470694718-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hagiotherapy" was revived under the influence by pope [[John Paul II]]'s encyclica ''Salvifici doloris''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html Salvifici doloris]&lt;/ref&gt; as a pseudo-therapeutic method of healing a man's "spiritual soul" on the premise of "religious experience". A known practicing therapist is [[Tomislav Ivančić]], who founded Center for Spiritual Help in [[Zagreb]]. Prokop Remeš in the Czech Republic is treating addicts in Bohnice Psychiatric Hospital in Prague. His style of hagiotherapy isn't founded on the "Salvifici doloris" encyclical, it is a type of group existential psychotherapy (Yalom, Frankl), which focuses on eliminating dysfunctional behaviour patterns from one's life. This hagiotherapy uses biblical text as background to project one's own experiences against to active a greater understanding of text: one of the main instruments of hagiotherapy is projective work with biblical texts.

Prof. Tomislav Ivančić recently defined hagiotherapy as scientific discipline which aims to heal human soul.

His thesis was that every human being does not have only physical and psychological dimension, but also spiritual dimension (human soul) that has its own scientific laws and it should be subject of scientific research.

Human spirit (soul) can be sick, just as can be human body and mind, so it needs to be treated accordingly.

One of examples prof. Ivančić was talking about many times was an addiction. He was concerned with the fact that so many patients relapse some time after treatment. He explained it with the fact that they were treated only on mental level, and not on spiritual level. According to his opinion, addiction is basically spiritual issue, so it needs to be treated on spiritual level.

A '''health fair''' is an educational and interactive event designed for [[outreach]] to provide basic [[preventive medicine]] and [[screening (medicine)|medical screening]] to people in the community or employees at work in conjunction with [[workplace wellness]]. It can also be a [[public health]] [[Health intervention|intervention]].

Health fairs are typically offered in the community, on site corporations, work sites, churches or schools. The consist of a variety of vendors and exhibitors that educate on all aspects of health, wellness, fitness and lifestyle improvements. Topics can include such things as [[chiropractic]], [[acupuncture]], [[fitness clubs]] and [[hospitals]].It is very common to see health screenings such as [[cholesterol testing]] or [[blood pressure screenings]].  Health Fairs are advertised and promoted ahead of time by print media, radio, or television and are usually a one-day event.

Health fairs are often organized and run by professional health fair organization companies but can also be done by [[medical providers]], [[benefits directors]], [[medical students]] or [[nurses]].

One example of a health fair is the [[Florida Keys Health Fairs]].

==Critics==

Some health fairs promote unnecessary and potentially harmful testing.

Some tests performed are actually not [[screening test]]s, like weight and blood pressure, which are appropriate screening tests for the general population. Instead, they are specialized tests, like vascular ultrasound, which are only appropriate for patients with relevant [[risk factors]]. When these tests are performed on the general population, they lead to false positive diagnoses, and dangerous and expensive follow-up testing, which have a risk of strokes and death. Many doctors feel that it is unethical for hospitals and doctors to cooperate with commercial testing services that market directly to the consumer, especially since many of the marketing claims are false.&lt;ref name="Annals"&gt;{{cite journal

For example, a for-profit business called HealthFair offers four cardiovascular disease screening packages, all of which include the following six tests: [[echocardiogram]], [[electrocardiogram]], [[carotid artery ultrasound]], [[abdominal aortic aneurysm ultrasound]], [[hardening of the arteries]] test, and [[peripheral arterial disease]] test. HealthFair charges $179 for the six tests.

[[Public Citizen]] sent letters to 20 hospitals on June 19, 2014, urging them to cut their relationships with HealthFair. Public Citizen said that HealthFair’s “heavily promoted, community-wide cardiovascular health screening programs are unethical and are much more likely to do harm than good,” and cited peer-reviewed evidence in support of their claims. For example, the [[American College of Cardiology Foundation]] and the [[American Heart Association]] recommend against echocardiograms in asymptomatic adults without hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/pressroomredirect.cfm?ID=4220 Public Citizen. HealthFair Cardiovascular Screening Packages Are Unethical, Mislead Consumers, Do More Harm Than Good.] Public Citizen website. Press release. Accessed July 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Terry Diaz, HealthFair's Chief Operating Officer, wrote, “Public Citizen is an organization dedicated to the creation of a single-payer system of healthcare called ‘Medicare for All’ which would be run and controlled by the government. This is strikingly opposite to our mission of helping make healthcare consumer-driven, a private choice between a patient and his/her physician, free from government intervention. Our goal is to educate and empower the consumer to decide what is best for them.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140809171413/http://healthfair.com/HealthFair%20Response%20to%20Public%20Citizen%20Document.pdf HealthFair Response to Public Citizen Document.] HealthFair website. 2014.

'''Hearing Health Foundation (HHF)''' is a 501c3 [[nonprofit]] organization whose mission is to prevent and cure hearing loss and tinnitus through groundbreaking research, and promote hearing health. In 2011, the Deafness Research Foundation changed its name to Hearing Health Foundation.&lt;ref name="prnewswire1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deafness-research-foundation-announces-new-name-and-reaffirms-its-unwavering-dedication-to-the-prevention-research-and-cure-for-hearing-loss-129803073.html|title=Deafness Research Foundation Announces New Name|date=14 September 2011|newspaper=PRNewswire|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HHF was founded as the Deafness Research Foundation in 1958, by Collette Ramsey Baker, a woman who lived with a substantial hearing loss. Since then, HHF has worked to provide funding for basic, clinical and translational research in hearing and balance science, and worked towards research and treatments for people with hearing loss, tinnitus, and other hearing conditions.  This includes funding research that led to the development of [[cochlear implant]]s and treatments for [[otosclerosis]] (abnormal bone growth in the ear) and [[ear infections]]. In the 1990s HHF advocated in Washington, D.C., for [[universal neonatal hearing screening]] legislation, to detect hearing loss at birth.

The primary aims of the foundation are to promote awareness of hearing health and the prevention of [[noise induced hearing loss]], provide [[seed money]] to researchers focused on hearing and balance science through grants, and to find better therapies and cures for hearing loss and tinnitus through the Hearing Restoration Project (HRP) and Emerging Research Grants (ERG) programs.

== History ==
The Deafness Research Foundation was founded by Collette Ramsey-Baker on February 1, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearinghealthfoundation.org/our-history |title=Hearing Health Foundation History |publisher=Hearinghealthfoundation.org |date=1958-02-01 |accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Waverly, Tennessee]], Collette lived with substantial hearing loss for many years before she had her hearing completely restored at age 35, with an early fenestration operation. She then founded the Deafness Research Foundation (DRF). A recurrent model for the renowned painter [[Howard Chandler Christy]] and an avid golfer, she received letters of commendation from US Presidents [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[Helen Keller]] and Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collette Ramsey Baker|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tcpalm/obituary.aspx?n=collette-ramsey-baker&amp;pid=142683060#fbLoggedOut|publisher=TC Palm|accessdate=7 January 2013|date=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, DRF and the American Academy of Otolaryngology created the National Temporal Bone Banks Program, to collect and study the human temporal bone, and to encourage temporal bone donation. In 1992 the NIDCD National Temporal Bone, Hearing and Balance Pathology Resource Registry was founded as a nonprofit organization by the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) of the National Institutes of Health to continue and expand on the activities of the former National Temporal Bone Banks Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbregistry.org/what-is-the-registry/|title=What is the Registry?|publisher=National Temporal Bone Registry|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1972, the DRF was funding research on [[cochlear implants]], with later grants in single channel to multi-channel implants, speech perception among cochlear implant users, and implants in children. Substantial research and significant contribution in the prevention and treatment of [[middle ear infection]] was made by researchers who were awarded grants. In 1977 the DRF funded research in outer ear [[hair cell]] motility that led to a new method for measuring the health of a newborn's ear, and began funding research to understand how sensory cells transmit sounds from the world to the brain.

The DRF funded research led, in 1987, to the discovery of spontaneous regeneration of hair cells in chickens, thus igniting the field of hair cell regeneration in humans. Research on the regrowth of cochlea cells may lead to medical treatments that restore hearing. Unlike birds and reptiles, humans and other mammals are normally unable to regrow the cells of the inner ear that convert sound into neural signals when those cells are damaged by age or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edge AS, Chen ZY |year=2008 |title=Hair cell regeneration |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=377–82 |pmid=18929656 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the DRF funded Meniere's Disease Study Center for improved evaluation and better treatments of [[Ménière's disease]].

In celebration of the 50th Anniversary, the DRF rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearinghealthfoundation.org/our-history |title=Hearing Health Foundation History|publisher=Hearinghealthfoundation.org |date=1958-02-01 |accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization decided to change its name from The Deafness Research Foundation to Hearing Health Foundation to better communicate the foundation's mission to prevent and cure hearing loss and tinnitus through groundbreaking research, and promote hearing health. On September 14, 2011 the Chair of the Board, Clifford P. Tallman, Jr., announced the name change of the DRF to Hearing Health Foundation and presented a new research consortium, the Hearing Restoration Project.&lt;ref name="prnewswire1"/&gt;

Through its Emerging Research Grants (ERG), HHF provides seed money to researchers, particularly those whose work is focused on areas of otology that have been under-researched and under-represented through traditional funding mechanisms. Through ERG, HHF has awarded over millions of dollars through more than 2,200 scientific research grants to researchers.

Many of HHF's grantees have also received federal grants. Former grantees make up 20 percent of recipients of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology Award of Merit. Many researchers we funded go on to obtain [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]] funding for their work.

Hearing Health Foundation supports research in the following areas:
* Fundamental Auditory Research – development, genetics, molecular biology, physiology, anatomy, and regeneration biology
* [[Cochlear implants]]
* Surgical therapy for [[otosclerosis]]
* [[Hair cell]] regeneration
* [[Hearing aid|Hearing aids technology]]
* [[Central Auditory Processing Disorder]](CAPD)
* [[Stria vascularis of cochlear duct|Stria Vascularis]]
* [[Noise-induced hearing loss]]
* [[Presbycusis]] or age-related hearing loss
* Viral infections causing [[hearing loss]]
* Sudden [[deafness]]
* [[Ototoxicity]] or drug-induced hearing loss
* [[Temporal bone]] pathology
* [[Otitis media]], or ear infections
* [[Usher Syndrome]]
* Vestibular and Balance Disorders (dizziness and [[vertigo]], [[Meniere's disease]])
* [[Tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears)
* [[Hyperacusis]] (decreased tolerance of sound)

=== Hearing Restoration Project ===
The Hearing Restoration Project is a consortium of 14-senior scientists working collaboratively on scientific research towards inner ear hair cell regeneration and accelerate the time frame for developing a cure for hearing loss. The HRP brings together researchers from [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Washington]] and elsewhere with the goal of researching and developing a genuine cure for most forms of acquired hearing loss by regenerating the inner ear hair cells that enable hearing.

==== Strategic research plan ====
* Phase 1 – Discovery research: Scientists have identified various pathways for hair cell regeneration. Since there are many potential gene targets, they continually utilize bioinformatics methods to winnow down and determine which are most relevant. Researchers have shown in the mouse neighboring supporting cells remain after deafening.
* Phase 2 – Recent technological advances have enabled researchers to examine single hair cells rather than entire clusters. This aids in the study of gene expression immediately after a single hair cell is damaged. Researchers are examining early events that occur in the hair cells of zebrafish and chicks, but not in mice.  The genes not undergoing the same expression in the mouse as in the other two animal models will be targets for manipulation.
* Phase 3 – Develop treatments: Experimental models from Phase 2 will be used to screen for possible treatments.

==== Cell regeneration summit and webinars ====
* In 2011, Hearing Health Foundation hosted a public-focused health conference bringing together leaders in the field of cell regeneration research in the ear to discuss current research and potential therapies to restore hearing as part of the HRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperacusisresearch.org/hearing-health-summit-2011/|title=Hearing Health Summit 2011|publisher=hyperacusisresearch.org|accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 21, 2015, Hearing Health Foundation hosted at live-video research briefing to provide updates on research programs and progress. Dr. Peter Barr-Gillespie, Scientific Director, Hearing Restoration Project presented on the Hearing Restoration Project.

== Prevention and education ==
Hearing Health Foundation publishes the ''Hearing Health'' magazine, Hearing Health E-News, and a weekly blog to supply information about current research and technologies related to hearing loss, tinnitus, and other hearing conditions, as well as provides general information about the Foundation's work, education, and prevention efforts.

The '''International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use''' ('''ICH''') is a project that brings together the regulatory authorities of [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] and experts from the [[pharmaceutical industry]] in the three regions to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical product registration.

The purpose of ICH is to reduce or eliminate the need to duplicate the testing carried out during the research and development of new medicines by recommending ways to achieve greater harmonisation in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for product registration. Harmonisation would lead to a more economical use of human, non-human animal and material resources, and the elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development and availability of new medicines while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, and efficacy, and regulatory obligations to protect public health.

ICH guidelines have been adopted as law in several countries, but are only used as guidance for the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Institutional Review Board |first=Elizabeth A |last=Bankert |author2=Robert J. Amdur |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |year=2006 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1980s, what is today the [[European Union]] began harmonising regulatory requirements. In 1989, Europe, Japan, and the United States began creating plans for harmonisation; '''International Council of Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use''' (ICH) was created in April 1990 at a meeting in [[Brussels]].

In 2015, International Conference on Harmonisation changed its name to the International Council for Harmonisation while becoming a legal entity in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2015/10/26/23473/ICH-Makes-Organizational-Changes/ ICH Makes Organizational Changes], Zachary Brennan, 26 October 2015, Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jliedu"&gt;[http://www.jliedu.com/blog/ich-is-now-international-council-on-harmonisation-a-legal-swiss-entity/ ICH is now International Council for Harmonisation – a Legal Swiss Entity], James Lind Institute&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2015 ICH conducted the initial meeting of their new assembly.&lt;ref name="jliedu" /&gt;

==Structure==
The ICH has four major parts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/about/faqs/article/how-is-ich-structured.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ICH Steering Committee
# ICH Coordinators
# ICH Secretariat
# ICH Working Groups

The Steering Committee, made of six ICH Parties, governs the ICH, determining the policies and procedures, selecting topics for harmonisation and monitoring progress of harmonisation initiatives. The ICH consists of:
* [[European Commission]]
* [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA)
* [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)]] (MHLW)
* [[Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association]] (JPMA)
* [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)
* [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA)

The ICH Coordinators represents each ICH Party to the ICH Secretariat on a day-to-day basis.

The ICH Secretariat is primarily concerned with preparations for, and documentation of, meetings of the Steering Committee as well as coordination of preparations for Working Group (EWG (Expert Working Group), IWG (Implementation Working Group), Informal WG) and Discussion Group meetings.

The ICH Working Groups are created by the Steering Committee when a new topic is accepted for harmonisation, and is charged with developing a harmonised guideline that meets the objectives outlined in the Concept Paper and Business Plan.

Face-to-face meetings of the EWG will normally only take place during the biannual SC meetings. Interim reports are made at each meeting of the SC.

If consensus is reached the EWG will sign the ''Step 2 Experts Signoff'' sheet and submit it to the SC to request adoption.
If there is no agreement in the EWG within the time frame the SC may extend the time frame, suspend or abandon the harmonization project.

===Step 2: Confirmation of EWG consensus by the SC===
Step 2 is reached when the SC agrees, based on the report of the EWG, that there is sufficient scientific consensus on the technical issues for the draft guideline. This text is signed off by the SC as ''Step 2 Final Document''.

===Step 3: Regulatory consultation and discussion===
The draft becomes subject of consultation in the three regions. It is published in the European Union (as draft [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use|CHMP]] or [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use|CVMP]] guideline), Japan (after translation by [[MHLW]]), and the USA (as draft guideline in the [[Federal Register]]) and everybody within these regions can comment on it. There is also an opportunity for companies, associations and authorities in non-ICH regions to comment on the draft, which is distributed by [[IFPMA]] and [[WHO]]. After obtaining all consultation results, the EWG will be resumed. A new rapporteur will be appointed from the regulatory party, preferably from the same region as the previous rapporteur. The same procedure described in Step 1 is used to address the consultation results into the ''Step 2 Final Document''. The draft document to be generated as a result of the Step 3 phase is called [[Step 4 Experts Document]].

If industry and regulatory EWG members agree on the alterations as a result of the consultation, the Step 4 Experts Document is signed by the EWG regulatory experts only (''Step 4 Experts Signoff'') and submitted to the SC to request adoption as Step 4 of the ICH process.

===Step 4: Adoption of an ICH harmonised tripartite guideline===
Step 4 is reached when the SC agrees that there is sufficient scientific consensus on the technical issues.
If one industry party has strong objections to the adoption of the guideline due to deviations of the revised draft from the original consensus the regulatory parties may agree that a revised document should be submitted for further consultation. In this case, the EWG discussion may be resumed.

The Step 4 Final Document is signed off by the SC signatories for the regulatory parties of ICH as an [[ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline]].

===Step 5: Implementation===
The ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline moves immediately to the final step of the process that is the regulatory implementation. This step is carried out according to the same national/regional procedures that apply to other regional regulatory guidelines and requirements, in the [[European Union]], Japan, and the United States.

Information on the regulatory action taken and implementation dates are reported back to the SC and published by the ICH Secretariat on the ICH website and in the annual press statement.

== Early Life == 

Wadsworth was born in 1942 during the Second World War as the eldest of four children. Her family moved to Sevenoaks where her father established a GP practice after his demobilisation.
== Career == 

Following an education at [[The New School at West Heath|West Heath School]], Jane went on to become a reader in Mathematics at [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews University]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jane-wadsworth-1251436.html|title=Obituary: Jane Wadsworth|date=1997-07-19|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She met her husband, Michael Wadsworth, in [[London]] and the couple moved to [[Edinburgh]] where they started their young family. Following their return to London, Jane began working part-time at the Institute for Social Sciences in Medical Care.  

When her youngest child began school, Jane returned to education and completed an MSc in Medical Statistics at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine|London School of Hygiene]]. This was followed by a series of research positions in London, [[Bristol]] and [[Exeter]] before she took on the position of Lecturer in Medical Statistics at [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School|St. Marys Hospital Medical Schoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in l 1983. While with the hospital Wadsworth contributed to several clinical studies, inclining a study of pelvic pain syndrome with Professor Richard Beard and the Nation Childhood Encephalophathy Study with Professor David Miller.

When the Aids epidemic arrived, Wadsworth became involved in determining the pattern of the [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]] throughout Britain. This was the first attempt to conduct a study about sexual behaviour in the UK and gave Jane Wadsworth the opportunity to take the leading role in initiating her own research programme for the first time. During this period, Wadsworth’s personal life became more strained, however, and her marriage broke up in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

After several years of laying the foundations for sex research, Wadsworth, together with Julia Field, Anne Johnson and Kaye Wellings, embarked on a national study during which they interviewed 18,876 men and women about their sex lives. The study was filmed by Horizon for television and the women briefly found themselves in the eye of the media.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

In 1994, Wadsworth and her fellow researcher published Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle detailing the results of the survey. A version of this, Sexual Behaviour in Britain, was serialised in the [[The Independent|Independent on Sunday]]. As the first of its kind, the [[National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles|National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle]] (NATSAL) became both the gold standard and the model for subsequent studies for a number of countries the world.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

== Awards and Honours == 

The Jane Wadsworth clinic for Sexual Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peoplefirstinfo.org.uk/marketplace/cat/vendor/3771|title=People First - Marketplace|website=peoplefirstinfo.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the Jefferiss wing at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St. Marys Hospital, Paddington]], was named for her.

'''Keren – Vocational Rehabilitation Centers in Israel''' is an [[Israel]]i [[public trust]] organization dedicated to [[vocational rehabilitation]]. Founded in 1964 by the Ministry of Welfare &amp; Social Services, it hosts vocational assessment units and rehabilitation centers throughout Israel.

The Keren VRC Network consists of 14 Vocational Rehabilitation Centers, 4 Youth Vocational Rehabilitation Centers, 5 Computer Aided Training, Education and Communication (CTEC) Karten Centers and 47 [[supported employment]] and sheltered work enclaves.

The Keren is geared by the belief that every human being has an equal right to actively and fully participate in society and that work is a central feature of participation and inclusion, as well as crucial facet of a person's [[self-esteem]] and [[quality of life]].

==Target Populations==
The Keren Works with people with physical, sensorial, emotional, mental and developmental disabilities, either from birth or of recent onset. The Keren also works with people with [[employment barrier]]s, such as new immigrants, chronically unemployed individuals, single mothers and troubled or disabled youth.

The '''Limón Dam''', part of the '''Olmos Transandino Project''', is an under construction multi-purpose concrete-face rock-fill [[embankment dam]] on the [[Huancabamba River]] in northwestern [[Peru]], located to the south of [[Guabal, Cajamarca|Guabal]]. When completed, the project will help produce {{convert|4000|GWh}} of electricity per year and transfer water from the [[Cajamarca]] region west to [[Lambayeque Region|Lambayeque]], near [[Olmos District|Olmos]] for the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] and irrigation of {{convert|43,500|ha}} of [[Arable land|farmland]]. The greatest feature and engineering challenge of the project was digging the {{Convert|20|km|adj=on}} trans-Andean tunnel as it connects the Atlantic side of the Andes ([[Amazon basin]]) with the Pacific side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gob.pe/anexos/boletinvirtual/boletin3ingles.pdf Olmos Irrigation: A Work For Development (brochure)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919210237/http://www.presidencia.gob.pe/anexos/boletinvirtual/boletin3ingles.pdf |date=2009-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-04-05-peru-bores-through-andes-to-water-desert-after-century-of-dreams/ Peru Bores Through Andes To Water Desert After Century Of Dreams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303045217/http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-04-05-peru-bores-through-andes-to-water-desert-after-century-of-dreams/# |date=2014-03-03 }} ''Daily Maverick''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olmos Irrigation Project is the largest of seven [[Irrigation in Peru|irrigation projects in Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/04/us-peru-water-idUSBRE9330QT20130404 Peru bores through Andes to water desert after century of dreams] 4 April 2013 "The Olmos project, which critics say benefits mostly big agricultural companies rather than small farmers, is the most ambitious of seven massive irrigation works that are turning swaths of desert valleys near Peru's coast into profitable, producing fields."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and construction ==
The idea to divert the Huancabamba River to the fertile lands of [[Olmos District|Olmos]] was first envisioned in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://en.h2olmos.com/history.html|publisher=H2Olmos |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroelectric component was added in the 1940s and 1950s. Preliminary feasibility studies were conducted in the 1960s by [[Italconsult]], in 1979-1982 soviet engineers from [[Hydroproject]] prepared and approved new design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan Special Fund (JSF)  Project Profile|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=687186|publisher=Studies for the Olmos Irrigation Project |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Makarov |first=Oleg |script-title=ru:Русский след в Андах |trans-title= Russian footprint in the Andes |journal=Popular Mechanics (Russian Edition) |volume=9 |date=September 2013 |page=46 | language = Russian | url = http://www.popmech.ru/article/13598-russkiy-sled-v-andah/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnel excavation had been occurring since the 1950s and through the 1970s but work was halted in the 1980s due to a lack of funding. Construction on the project began in 2006 with the dam and Brazil's [[Odebrecht]] drilling the tunnel with a [[tunnel boring machine]] (TBM). Of the tunnel's {{Convert|20|km}} total length, {{Convert|12.5|km}} is being dug with a TBM. The dam was completed in 2009 and its reservoir began to impound the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olmos Project |url=http://www.cclam.org.pe/foros/05_proyecto_olmos.pdf |publisher=Lambayeque Government |accessdate=8 January 2012 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010905/http://www.cclam.org.pe/foros/05_proyecto_olmos.pdf |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel was completed on 20 December 2011 with a ceremony attended by Peru's President [[Ollanta Humala]].&lt;ref name=done&gt;{{cite web |title=Work wraps up on Olmos water transfer tunnel |url=http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/news_display.1567135009.html |publisher=Hydro World |accessdate=8 January 2012 |date=20 December 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrialinfo.com/showAbstract.jsp?newsitemID=151649 Peru's Olmos Hydropower Project PEOT Extends Bidding Timetable]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olmos Trans-Andean Tunnel |url=http://www.robbinstbm.com/case-study/olmos/ |publisher=Robbins |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, H2Olmos S.A. was awarded the contract for the irrigation system and it is expected to be operational in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans-Andean tunnel to pump water to Peru’s farmers |url=http://www.freshfruitportal.com/2011/02/09/trans-andean-tunnel-to-pump-water-to-peru%E2%80%99s-farmers/ |publisher=Fresh Fruit Portal |accessdate=8 January 2012 |date=9 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214081541/http://www.freshfruitportal.com/2011/02/09/trans-andean-tunnel-to-pump-water-to-peru%E2%80%99s-farmers/ |archivedate=14 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for the hydroelectric component, which is planned to consist of two power stations, was awarded to Sindicato Energético S.A. in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phases and Stages |url=http://en.h2olmos.com/phases-and-stages.html|publisher=H2Olmos|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project characteristics ==
The water transfer accomplished by the Limón Dam on the Huancabamba River will divert up to {{Convert|2.05|e6m3|acre.ft}} of water a year through the {{Convert|20|km|adj=on}} Olmos Transandino tunnel to the Olmos River Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Willis |first=Desiree |title=Tunnelling through the Mountains of Per |url=http://six4.bauverlag.de/sixcms_4/sixcms_upload/media/293/60_62_tu7.pdf |work=Tunnel |publisher=The Robbins Company|accessdate=8 January 2012|pages=60–62|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limón Dam is a {{Convert|43|m|adj=on}} high, {{Convert|320|m|adj=on}} long embankment dam that creates a reservoir of impounding {{Convert|44|e6m3|acre.ft}}. Water diverted by the dam is transferred via the tunnel to the Olmos River where it will be used to irrigate {{Convert|5500|ha}} of land. From there, water continues down the Olmos River where at two points, it will be used at hydroelectric power stations. At the base of the valley, water will settle in the Palo Verde Reservoir which will have a storage capacity of {{Convert|790|e6m3}}. The Palo Verde Dam will serve as a [[diversion dam]] and shift water from the reservoir to the remaining {{Convert|38000|ha}} of farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of The Works |url=http://en.h2olmos.com/description-of-the-works.html |publisher=H2Olmos|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olmos Irrigation Project |url=http://es.h2olmos.com/publicacion/8 |publisher=H2Olmos|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The project was profiled in the May 18, 2009 episode of ''[[Extreme Engineering#Season 7: 2009|Build it Bigger]]'' and the March 19, 2014 episode of ''[[Strip the City]]''.  It also featured in an episode of Mega Construction.

It also increases cell survival during the editing process up to sevenfold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/05/clipping-scissors-word-processor From Clipping Scissors to Word Processor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29734294 Multiplexed precision genome editing with trackable genomic barcodes in yeast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4137 Multiplexed precision genome editing with trackable genomic barcodes in yeast]&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform was made by the Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology (JIMB)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jimb.stanford.edu/ JIMB website]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a coalition of [[Stanford University]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].

==Overview==
[[Genetic engineering|Gene editing]] is used for a variety of tasks including the modifying of crops, the modifying of bacteria, and the modifying of [[Gene therapy|disease-causing genetic mutations in patients]]. For industrial and agricultural uses, CRISPR/Cas is more than sufficient, but for medicinal use, more precision is preferred. This is where MAGESTIC comes in. MAGESTIC achieves greater precision by using array-synthesized guide–donor oligos for the plasmid-based high-throughput editing and it also features a genomic barcode integration to prevent plasmid barcode loss (and also to enable robust phenotyping).

In essence, it allows to program the CRISPR machinery to cut at desired locations throughout the genome, and then to direct the cells to introduce designed edits at the DNA cut sites. As such, it is a very important tool for making [[Gene therapy|gene therapies]].

'''Motuihe Island''' lies between [[Motutapu Island|Motutapu]] and [[Waiheke Island|Waiheke]] islands in the [[Hauraki Gulf]] of [[New Zealand]], near [[Auckland]]. The island measures about {{convert|179|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, of which around {{convert|18|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are remnants of coastal forest. The island is a recreation reserve controlled by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC) and administered by the [[Motuihe Trust]]. It is a popular spot for day trips, accessible by 30-minute ferry trip from Auckland, by seaplane, or by private boat. The island is known for its beautiful beaches.&lt;ref name="DOCMAIN"&gt;"[https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/auckland/places/motuihe-island-recreation-reserve/ Motuihe Recreation Reserve]".

Motuihe Trust. Retrieved 27 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from ''Te Motu-a-Ihenga'', meaning 'Ihenga's Island' in [[Māori language|Māori]].&lt;ref name="DOCHIST"&gt;"[https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/auckland/places/motuihe-island-recreation-reserve/historic-motuihe-island/ Motuihe Recreation Reserve: History]". Department of Conservation. Retrieved 27 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The small island has had a colourful human history. Starting out as a Māori settlement place, at least two [[Pā (Māori)|pā]] fortification sites are known on the island. The locals are said to have grown [[Lagenaria|gourd]]s and [[taro]]. 
William Fairburn purchased Motuihe  in 1839 from William Jowett , Ko Nuki and Te Manago: chiefs of Te Iwi Tutu, [[Ngāi Tai]] and Ngatiwaki respectively. They paid one heifer, twenty blankets, ten axes, ten hoes, ten spades, six gowns, two red blankets, 12 dutch pipes, six iron pots and one shawl.

Very soon after arrival of the Europeans in the area, farming began in the 1840s. Groves of Norfolk pines and olive trees are remnants of this time.&lt;ref name="DOCHIST"/&gt;

A [[quarantine]] station was built on the western section of the island in 1873. It was first used in 1874 for [[scarlet fever]] arriving on an inbound ship and operated for almost 50 years, slowly growing in size. During the [[First World War]], the station was used as an internment camp whose most famous prisoner was [[Felix von Luckner|Count Felix von Luckner]] and his crew of the commerce raider ''[[SMS Seeadler (Windjammer)|SMS Seeadler]]''. Luckner organised an escape from the island in 1917, took over a [[scow]] and sailed to the [[Kermadec Islands]] where he was recaptured (and escaped again),&lt;ref name="DOCHIST"/&gt; though not before becoming something of an odd type of hero in the eyes of many New Zealanders, for the fact that his numerous and daring wartime escapades had killed only a single person.

With the outbreak of World War II, the buildings became a naval training base, [[HMNZS Tamaki|HMNZS ''Tamaki'']], and a number of newer buildings were added. The base remained a navy training ground until 1963, when its functions were moved to the [[North Shore City|North Shore]] mainland.&lt;ref name="DOCHIST"/&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[Image:Motuihe Island Panorama Of Wharf.jpg|thumb|right|The wharf on the southern side of the island, with the bay behind filled with day-tripper boats.]]
The island's trust organises an active programme of pest eradication and is slowly replanting sections of the island with native trees. Rats and mice were eradicated in 1996 and rabbits in 2004.&lt;ref name=ratcatcher/&gt; The conservation programme has reintroduced native species like the [[North Island saddleback]] (''tieke'').&lt;ref name="DOCFEAT"&gt;"[https://www.doc.govt.nz/news/stories/2014/october/helping-out-the-saddleback-on-motuihe-island/ Motuihe Recreation Reserve: Features]". Department of Conservation. Retrieved 27 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust maintains a small conservation presence on the island, and usually has a number of volunteers working at the local tree nursery or in other conservation programmes.

In early 2008, rat footprints were found in a tracking tunnel (a device to check for the presence of certain animals) on the island. This set off a substantial effort by the trust and DOC to catch the rodent, which was feared to be part of a larger infestation. The [[Brown rat|Norwegian rat]] was eventually trapped by a special hunting dog, allowing plans to release native [[red-fronted parakeet]]s (kākāriki) to continue as planned&lt;ref name=ratcatcher&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10505909 |title=Dog traps rat on 'pest-free' gulf island |author=Eriksen, Alanah |date=24 April 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2008, when 31 were brought by helicopter from [[Little Barrier Island]], where there is a relatively large population.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/news/article.cfm?mnarticle=kakariki-spread-wings-on-new-island-home-20-05-2008 Kakariki spread wings on new island home]". Massey University. 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, fifteen [[little spotted kiwi]] were released on the island.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10563029"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10563029 |title=Tiny kiwi move into a new island home |author=Gibson, Eloise |date=23 March 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, 350 'agents' of [[The Nikolai Organisation]] planted 22,400 native trees on Motuihe Island in just one day, which was 40% of the 2009 planting programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.scoop.co.nz/tag/the-nikolai-organisation-smirnoff-vodka/ Scoop Independent News] talks about The Nikolai Organisation planting 22,400 trees to beat Eco-Record&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2398674"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/2398674/Do-good-secret-society-to-invade-Hauraki-Gulf |title=Do-good 'secret society' to invade Hauraki Gulf |author=Hume, Tim |date=10 May 2009 |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret Agents' Storm New Eco-Record And Plant A 22,400-tree Forest in a Day on Motuihe Island|url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/category/organization/nikolai-organisation|accessdate=13 July 2010|newspaper=Voxy Online News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was unable to travel to the [[UK]] for an abortion, and after a [[hunger strike]] the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] granted an order to hydrate her against her will. After the 1992 [[X Case]] judgement, abortion should be legal in cases of suicide, and the then newly introduced [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013]] allows abortion in those cases.

'''Msizi Africa''' is an international charitable organisation set up by Lucy Caslon in 2007. Msizi means 'helper' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. The charity, based in [[South London]] and originally named '''Mants'ase Children's Home UK''', is registered with the UK [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity commission]]&lt;ref name=ccom&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends25%5C0001119525_AC_20140331_E_C.pdf Charity Commission, Msizi Africa account report 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and provides children in [[Lesotho]] with [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food. Msizi Africa actively supports and closely works with a number of local projects and collaborates with Letsema, a network of service providers working with orphans and vulnerable children in [[Lesotho]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sentebale.org.uk/html/Msizi.php Letsema] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717072323/http://sentebale.org.uk/html/Msizi.php |date=17 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since October 2015, Msizi Africa Lesotho has been registered as a Lesotho registered charitable organisation.&lt;ref name=sel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundayexpress.co.ls/food-aid-body-mulls-expansion|title=Food aid body mulls expansion|last=Sello|first=Limpho|publisher=Sunday Express, Lesotho|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lucy Caslon first heard about Mants'ase Children's Home, an [[orphanage]] in Lesotho, in news reports of [[Prince Harry]]'s visit to the home.&lt;ref name=Harry&gt;[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princeharry/casestudies/sentebale_mants_ase_children_s_home_204535420.html Prince Harry]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of an extensive trip through Africa in 2006 she decided to work at the orphanage as a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]. During this time she recognized that while the children in the home were fed, the food was not optimal in terms of nutrition and healthiness especially taking into consideration that many of the 50 children living in the home suffered from [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] infection and other health issues. She received financial help from family and friends back in the UK which allowed her to buy fruit, vegetables, meat and fish to complement the children's normal diet of [[maize]] meals and [[cabbage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mantsasechildrenshome.org/WebPages/History.html Mants'ase Childrens Home - History]&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the positive effects of this healthier nutrition on the children's wellbeing Lucy Caslon founded the Mants'ase Children's Home UK charity after she arrived back in London. It was first set up specifically to benefit the lives of the children at the Mants'ase orphanage. Later the charity was re-branded as Msizi Africa as the support was extended to children in South Africa and [[Zambia]].

Within three months after receiving her registration number in June 2007 Lucy Caslon was able to raise £30,000 from corporate sponsors despite running the charity in her spare time while working as [[Personal assistant|PA]] for a large property firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-1678154/Work-for-charity-for-a-year-all-expenses-paid.html | title=Work for charity for a year, all expenses paid | last=Loveless | first=Helen | publisher=[[Associated Northcliffe Digital|This is Money]], [[Daily Mail]] | date=12 July 2009 | accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Msizi Africa grew significantly after Lucy Caslon became one of eight winners of [[Vodafone]]s 2008’s [[Vodafone#Vodafone Foundation|World of Difference programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/914302/ |title=Vodafone Foundation offers bursaries to fund charity workers overseas |publisher=Third Sector Online |first=Hannah |last=Jordan |date=19 June 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed her to work full-time for her charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/last-call-for-vodafone-charity-dream-jobs-abroad-applications-14421930.html |title=Last call for Vodafone charity dream jobs abroad applications |last= |first= |date=21 June 2009 |work= |publisher=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by her success one of her corporate supporters decided to match Vodafone's scheme and continue to pay her salary for 2010 and 2011&lt;ref name=podcast /&gt; enabling the charity in the following years to help to relieve the hardship of around thousand children in Africa, where the AIDS [[pandemic]] has left many without parents or an extended family. Besides providing food Msizi Africa also repairs the houses of children who live on their own to ensure safer living conditions for them.&lt;ref name=podcast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalhollowayentrepreneurs.com/2010/11/lucy-caslon-msizi-africa-podcast/ |title=Lucy Caslon (Msizi Africa) podcast |publisher=Royal Holloway Entrepreneurs |first=Paul |last=King |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123185528/http://www.royalhollowayentrepreneurs.com/2010/11/lucy-caslon-msizi-africa-podcast/# |archive-date=23 November 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Cape Town]] charity Beautiful Gate had to care for additional several hundred mothers with babies and young children due to the [[Xenophobia in South Africa|xenophobic attacks]] aimed towards foreign nationals living in South Africa which erupted in May and June of that year. Msizi Africa donated funds to feed these families for several days.

Msizi Africa has in the past also supported Umthombo, a non-profit organisation based in [[Durban]], South Africa, by providing three meals a day for hundreds of homeless children in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fabulousmag.co.uk/fabmag/fabulous/features/826781/World-Cup-Report-The-Forgotten-Children.html | title=The forgotten children | first=Laura | last=Millar | date=30 May 2010| publisher=Fabulous |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder==

After graduating from [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] in 2003 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[History]] she worked in the charity sector for three years, first in the events team at [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]] and eighteen months later as corporate fundraiser with [[Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths|FSID]].

In 2006 she spent three months traveling [[East Africa|East]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] before volunteering for four months, from August to December, at the Mants'ase Children's Home. After her return to London in 2007 she founded a charity in order to raise money to continue the food improvement project she had started during her time in Lesotho. She spend her evenings and weekends to raise funds while working full-time for eighteen months as Team Secretary [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] Hospitality for [[DTZ]].

After the initial buildings have been built by local women the first child was admitted in February 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mantsasechildrenshome.org/WebPages/History.html The Mophato oa Mants'ase Society - History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacb.org/stories/southafrica/maekane_patrick.html Dictionary of African Christian Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; The Home is located in Qhalasi in the Mohale's Hoek district of the Kingdom of Lesotho.

The orphanage is the residential care facility of the Mophato oa Mants'ase Society whose [[Patron#Charity|patron]] is [[Queen 'Masenate Mohato Seeiso]] of Lesotho. It was one of the social projects visited by Prince Harry in 2004 during his first visit to the country. At a later visit in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkMdiqTpdFs Prince Harry and the Mants'ase Children's Home]&lt;/ref&gt; he launched there together with [[Prince Seeiso of Lesotho]] the [[Sentebale]] foundation&lt;ref name=Harry /&gt; which continues to assist the Society.
Msizi Africa supports the children's home by providing financial help to buy food, build housing and pay for staff salary. The orphanes lived in round houses ([[rondavel]]s), a typical type of building in that region, which were in a state of disrepair and Msizi Africa funded the building of a new [[dormitory]] complete with [[hygiene|ablution]] blocks. Since 2014 the orphanage receives their food support from local organisations inside Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mom-society.org/WebPages/Blog-page.html?entry=thank-you-so-much-msizi Thank you so much Msizi Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

===iZulu Orphan Projects===
In 2000 Chadd Bain returned to his native [[KwaZulu-Natal]] from the UK and started with two [[Zulu people|Zulu]] friends to educate and feed poor people in the rural area he had grown up in. He became involved with an orphanage called 'Nkosnathi' which he supported. In 2002 he met his later wife Kate and they started iZulu Orphan Projects (IOP), a non profit organisation which deals with orphans and widows affected by HIV and AIDS. From originally 80 orphans attending the 'Annual Orphan Christmas party', IOP supports now over 1600 children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izuluorphanprojects.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=169 iZulu Orphan Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310072332/http://www.izuluorphanprojects.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=169 |date=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chadd Bain's tragic death in a [[motorcycle]] accident in December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsrmtb.co.za/the-world-loses-chadd-bain/ |title=The world loses Chadd Bain |publisher=NSRMTB |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was in danger of failing and Msizi Africa pledged to feed 250 of the children and became Kate Bains biggest supporter enabling her to continue with the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womeninpubliclifeawards.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117:lucy-caslon-director-msizi-africa&amp;catid=12:voluntary-sector-achiever-of-the-year&amp;Itemid=14 |publisher=Dods Parliamentary Communications Ltd |title=Women in Public Life Awards - Lucy Caslon, Director, Msizi Africa |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Caslon climbed [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in September 2010 in order to raise money for that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/163680B3-DD7C-461B-8383-10880AB76284/0/LL103b.pdf |title=A mountain to climb for African's orphans |publisher=lambeth life |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/D9EEDD03-290B-4EB4-9E3B-BC17CC27618E/0/LL105b.pdf |title=Attitude over altitude as Lucy reaches Uhuru peak |publisher=lambeth life |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208183848/http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/D9EEDD03-290B-4EB4-9E3B-BC17CC27618E/0/LL105b.pdf# |archive-date=8 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.the-blue-org.uk/single.htm?ipg=12715 | title=Kilimanjaro Climb | year=2010 | publisher=THE BLUE, A Year in the life of Christ's Hospital School | accessdate=4 July 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace Matunda School and Orphanage===
Msizi Africa helped to fund the feeding programme of the ''Peace Matunda'' project founded in 2005 by Unambwe Zephania Kaaya.&lt;ref name="ccom" /&gt; It consists of an orphanage with 24 children and a school and Kindergarten with over 200 pupils located in the [[rainforest]] of [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]] in Northern [[Tanzania]], about 15&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[Arusha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacematunda.org/|title=Supporting Education &amp; Child Welfare in Tanzania|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimony and Majapereng feeding programmes===
Msizi Africa provided food to couples in villages surrounding the Mants'ase Children's Home who cook for local orphans and distribute food parcels. This project supports 160 children not only with food but also with [[school uniform]]s and medical care. The ''Testimony Feeding Programme'' (covering [[Mashaleng|Ha Potsane]], [[Mashaleng|Qalakheng]] and [[Ribaneng|Kubake]]) and the ''Majapereng Feeding Programme'' were located in nearby villages in the Mohale's Hoek district.

===The 28 Fund===
The 28 Fund was a campaign started by Msizi Africa in 2011 which aims to gain donation by [[direct debit]] accounts set up by supporters for 28 [[Penny (British decimal coin)|pence]] (or multiples of that amount) as it costs Msizi Africa 28 pence to feed one child for a day. The project was aimed at businesses as well as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldofdifference.vodafone.co.uk/news/archives/4639 |publisher=Vodafone |title=We talk to Msizi Africa about their new campaign |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''orgasmic platform''' is the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s of the outer third of the [[vagina]], labeled by [[Masters and Johnson]].  They swell considerably, and the [[pubococcygeus muscle]] tightens, reducing the diameter of the opening of the vagina. During orgasm, women experience rhythmic contractions of the orgasmic platform.
The orgasmic platform is brought about through the swelling of the bulbus vestibuli that narrows the vestibulum.
It is actually the narrowing and the extending of the lower 1/3 of the sheath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17851">{{short description|Mental health crisis response training for police officers}}
A '''crisis intervention team (CIT)''' is a police mental health collaborative program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pmhctoolkit.bja.gov/learning|title=Police Mental Health Collaborative Tool Kit|last=|first=|date=|website=BJA Police Mental Health Collaborative Program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "CIT" is often used to describe both a program and a training in law enforcement around the interactions between law enforcement and those living with a mental illness.

The [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] describes it as "CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) programs are local initiatives designed to improve the way law enforcement and the community respond to people experiencing [[mental health]] crises. They are built on strong partnerships between law enforcement, [[mental health provider]] agencies and individuals and families affected by mental illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nami.org/Law-Enforcement-and-Mental-Health/What-Is-CIT|title=NAMI- What is CIT|last=|first=|date=|website=NAMI|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mental health contacts and intervention by law enforcement became part of the profession with the [[Deinstitutionalisation|deinstitutionalization]] of nonviolent mentally ill patients in the 1960s. The goal was to allow people receiving treatment in an institution to continue to receive the treatment but from community service agencies. The money saved by hospital closing was to be transferred to outpatient community programs.

The money intended for outpatient services never found its way to the community. Funding for outpatient treatment services and programs are still lacking in most areas of the United States. This left a gap for people who were in need of services. Without the assistance many people stop their treatment programs; which resulted in many people becoming unstable while living in the community, with their families who were ill equipped to be caregivers.

When people living with the illness became [[psychotic]] or had poor quality of life in communities, the police became the go to resource for helping. Law enforcement has always been there to serve the most vulnerable in their community, which historically was viewed as victims of crime. With the lack of resources and treatment for people with mental illness they became the most vulnerable in many communities leading officers to become front line mental health workers.


In September 1987 [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, TN]] police responded to a 911 call involving a young man with a history of mental illness who was cutting himself with a knife and threatening suicide. When officers responded to the location they had ordered the man to drop the knife. The man became more upset and ran towards the officers with the knife still in his hand. Officers then discharged their firearms killing the man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Furor sparks call for crisis team.|last=Bayne|first=W|date=30 September 1987|work=Memphis Metro|access-date=|pages=B1-B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers were trained to use deadly force when they perceive their own or someone else’s life to be in grave danger. This incident was criticized because the perception on the call was the only life in danger was the man who wanted to kill himself. This occurred during a time of racial tension in Memphis and the man was African-America while both officers were white. This incident was the catalyst for the creation of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) in Memphis.

The [[Memphis Police Department]] joined in partnership with the Memphis Chapter of the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness|National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)]], mental health providers, and two local universities (the [[University of Memphis]] and the [[University of Tennessee]]) in organizing, training, and implementing a specialized unit. This unique and creative alliance was established for the purpose of developing a more intelligent, understandable, and safe approach to mental crisis events. This community effort was the genesis of the Memphis Police Department’s Crisis Intervention Team.

The Memphis CIT program has achieved remarkable success, in large part because it has remained a true community partnership. Today, the so-called “Memphis Model” has been adopted by more than 2000 communities in more than 40 states, and is being implemented statewide in several states, including Maine, Connecticut, Ohio, Georgia, Florida, Utah, and Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocit.org/crisis-intervention-team-history.html|title=Crisis Intervention Teams History|last=|first=|date=|website=Crisis Intervention Team|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
=== United States ===
==== Oregon ====

In the state of [[Oregon]], CIT programs were implemented after the death of [[James Chasse]], who was beaten and repeatedly [[Taser|tased]] by three [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] police officers in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Demsky |first=Ian |url=http://wweek.com/editorial/3252/8148/ |title=Why Did James Chasse Jr. Die? |website=[[Willamette Week]] |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2008-03-18 |archive-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110141035/http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3252/8148/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chasse, who suffered from [[schizophrenic|schizophrenia]], sustained 16 broken ribs, a broken shoulder and sternum, and major internal injuries. He was taken to the city jail, where the medical staff refused to admit him and ordered that he be taken to a hospital. But he died en route. The three officers were never indicted for their part in his death. Medics later testified that his broken ribs were most likely due to the emergency trauma care (CPR) he received.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Chasse's death prompted an outcry in the news media, in response to which Portland mayor [[Tom Potter]] instituted a CIT program. Other cities and counties in Oregon followed suit.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== Texas ====

Starting in late 2011, a group of Texas CIT officers met in Austin, Texas, to lay the foundation for Texas' first CIT Officer's Association. The association's goal is to promote mental health education as it pertains to law enforcement's interaction and care for the mentally ill. The association will also host an annual conference where stakeholders can discuss new options for better practices in the field. The Association launched its website in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas CIT Officer's Association Website|url=http://www.texascit.org|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Mexico ====
In Albuquerque, NM the police department began a Crisis Intervention Team program in 1996 after 6 people were killed in crisis related police shooting between 1994 and 1996. This increase of shootings was associated with victim participate homicides or suicide by cop. Sergeant William Pettit went to visit the Memphis Police Department, who established a crisis intervention team model in 1988, to learn about their program and bring back elements from it to create a Crisis Intervention Team program within the Albuquerque Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bower|first=Deborah|last2=Pettit|first2=Gene|date=February 2001|title=The Albuquerque Police Department's Crisis Intervention Team: A Report Card|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/fbi/crisis_interven.pdf|journal=FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albuquerque was hit again with community tragedies involving law enforcement interaction with people living with a mental illness that sparked an investigation by the Department of Justice in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/us/albuquerque-police-report-justice-department.html|title=Justice Dept. Accuses Albuquerque Police of Excessive Force|last=|first=|date=|website=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community voiced their concerns and the investigation by the DOJ also noted, “fatal confrontations with individuals experiencing mental health crises continue to cause significant public concern over the department’s ability and willingness to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals in distress. “ The finding letter also stated, “A significant amount of the force we reviewed was used against persons with mental illness and in crisis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2014/04/10/apd_findings_4-10-14.pdf|title=Finding Letter- Albuquerque Police Department|last=|first=|date=|website=US Department of Justice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this investigation the shooting of [[Shooting of James Boyd|James Boyd]] occurred.

The findings letter and outcry from the community ended in a court appointed settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. The settlement agreement indicated that all officers will be trained in CIT and that 40% of field officer would receive additional specialized training in interactions with people experiencing crisis. The agreement also stated that the department’s full time crisis intervention unit be staffed with 12 full time detectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabq.gov/mental-health-response-advisory-committee/documents/court-approved-settlement-agreement-final.pdf|title=Court Appointment Settlement Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Albuquerque|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

Some cities in Canada have implemented Crisis Intervention Teams based on three models.&lt;ref name="GlobalYatim"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/1472833/psychiatrists-in-blue-how-police-forces-deal-with-people-in-crisis/ |title=‘Psychiatrists in blue’: How police forces deal with people in crisis |work=Global News |accessdate=2018-09-18 |publisher=Shaw Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCIT (Mobile Crisis Intervention Team) model pairs a police officer with a nurse and responds to calls after first-responders have rendered or as first-responders render the scene safe.&lt;ref name="GlobalYatim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMHAcat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ontario.cmha.ca/news/mobile-crisis-rapid-response-team-first-ontario/ |title=Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team – a first for Ontario |publisher=CMHA Ontario |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TPSMCIT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/community/mcit.php |title=Mental Health |publisher="Toronto Police Service" |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RRT (Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team) model responds directly to calls relating to people in crisis.&lt;ref name="CMHAcat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HPSMRRT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hamiltonpolice.on.ca/prevention/mental-health/mobile-rapid-response-team |title=Mobile Rapid Response Team |publisher=Hamilton Police Service|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COAST (Crisis Outreach And Support Team) model sends teams by appointment through a hotline and often provides social services.&lt;ref name="CMHAcat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMHACOAST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://halton.cmha.ca/our-services/in-a-crisis/ |title=In a Crisis? - CMHA Halton Region Branch |publisher=CMHA Ontario |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities in Canada vary on which models they choose to implement.&lt;ref name="GlobalYatim"/&gt;

==== Toronto ====
The [[Toronto Police Service]] MCIT has existed since the year 2000&lt;ref name="TPSMCIT"/&gt;, however the unit received significant attention after the [[Death of Sammy Yatim | shooting death of immigrant Sammy Yatim]], where a Toronto Police officer intervened aggressively against Yatim who was holding a knife aboard a streetcar.&lt;ref name="GlobalYatim"/&gt; The expansion of the unit was recommended in a subsequent coroner's inquest into police shootings of suspects with edged weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/sites/default/files/content/mcscs/docs/ec167854.pdf |title=www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca |work=Inquest into the deaths of: Reyal Jardine Douglas, Sylvia Klibingaitis and Michael Eligon |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto Police MCIT teams are composed of mental health nurses from various local hospitals paired with a police officer. The team responds to calls as secondary responders.&lt;ref name ="TPSMCIT"/&gt;

==== Hamilton ====
The [[Hamilton Police Service]] is the first police service in Canada to implement all three models of crisis intervention programs.&lt;ref name="CMHAcat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalYatim"/&gt; The Crisis Response Unit implements the MCIT and MCRRT models as the Mobile Rapid Response Team, while the COAST model is implemented by the COAST and Social Navigator teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hamiltonpolice.on.ca/about/sections-units/crisis-response-unit |title=Crisis Response Unit |publisher=Hamilton Police Service |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that following the implementation of the COAST program, arrest rates for persons in crisis fell from 66% to 25%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hamiltonpolice.on.ca/prevention/mental-health/mobile-rapid-response-team |title=Mobile Rapid Response Team |publisher=Hamilton Police Service |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on average, police officers saved 580 hours per year.&lt;ref name="CMHAcat"/&gt;

==== Vancouver ====
The [[Vancouver Police Department]] has implemented the MCIT model using Car 87 since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouver.ca/police/organization/investigation/investigative-support-services/youth-services/community-response.html |title=Police Community Response Team |publisher = Vancouver Police Department |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalYatim"/&gt; The COAST model is implemented through both the Assertive Community Treatment Team (ACT) and the Assertive Outreach Team (AOT). The ACT is composed primarily of mental health professionals, and provides social services for patients with high-risk or long-term mental health issues. The AOT provides support to patients with mental health issues as they leave detention in hospital or jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouver.ca/police/organization/investigation/investigative-support-services/youth-services/mental-health.html |title=Mental Health Unit |publisher = Vancouver Police Department |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Population Council''' is an international, nonprofit, [[non-governmental organization]]. The Council conducts research in  [[biomedical|biomedicine]], [[social science]], and [[public health]] and helps build research capacities in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/mediacenter/PC_Key_Facts.html Population Council | Media Center | Key Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/about/index.html#Overview Population Council | About the Council&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of its research relates to [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]]; while its other major program areas are in [[reproductive health]] and its relation to poverty, youth, and gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/news/family-planning-not-just-for-women|title=Family Planning: Not Just for Women {{!}}  Population Council|website=www.popcouncil.org|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Population Council strives to teach boys that they can be involved in contraceptive methods regardless of stereotypes that limit male responsibility in child bearing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The organization held the license for [[Norplant]] contraceptive implant, and now holds the license for Mirena [[intrauterine system]]. The Population Council also publishes the journal ''[[Population and Development Review]]'', which reports scientific research on the interrelationships between [[human population|population]] and [[socioeconomic development]]. It also provides a forum for discussion on related issues of public policy and ''[[Studies in Family Planning]]'', which focuses on public health, social science, and biomedical research involving [[sexual and reproductive health]], [[fertility]], and [[family planning]].

==Organization==
Established in 1952 by [[John D. Rockefeller III]], with important funding from the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], the Council is governed by an international board of trustees. After many years of evolving, the 2006 council board includes leaders in many different fields. These include: biomedicine, business, economic development, government, health, international finance, media studies, philanthropy, and social science.

Headquartered in [[New York City]], the Population Council has 18 offices in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]] and does work in more than 60 countries. With an annual budget of around $74 million, it employs more than 500 people from 33 countries with expertise in a wide array of scientific disciplines. Roughly 55 percent are based outside the United States.

John D. Rockefeller III convened distinguished scientists in Williamsburg, Virginia, under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, to begin the search for a better understanding of [[Demography|demographic]] trends. Shortly thereafter, in 1952, he established the Population Council as an independent, nonprofit organization. He serves as the Council's first president.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popcouncil.org/about/timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraception ==

The Council conducts biomedical research to develop [[contraceptives]] and social science research to better understand the factors influencing access to and decision-making around contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/rh/program.html Population Council | Reproductive Health Program Description&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its research on reproductive and immunological processes serves, not only as the basis for the development of new contraceptive methods that reach out to both men and women, but also for new hormone therapies and AIDS-prevention products. The council is involved in a "collaboration with industry partner ProMed Pharma to develop innovative new vaginal rings that may make STI prevention more acceptable and effective for women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/news/new-population-council-data-on-hiv-and-sti-prevention-tools-and-strategies|title=New Population Council Data on HIV and STI Prevention  Tools and Strategies Presented at HIVR4P 2016 {{!}}  Population Council|website=www.popcouncil.org|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the Council played a key role in documenting the large numbers of people in poor countries who lacked access to contraceptives and in conducting research to design and evaluate public [[family planning]] programs.This included bringing IUDs to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_zDCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT127&amp;lpg=PT127&amp;dq=population+council+in+the+1960s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Alan4edU1C&amp;sig=uwzugPWbcYUyuXYb_5KLzGkNEA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDpY7DsIzTAhXkqlQKHbN7DfMQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=population%20council%20in%20the%201960s&amp;f=false|title=Reproductive States: Global Perspectives on the Invention and Implementation of Population Policy|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|last2=Nakachi|first2=Mie|date=2016-01-04|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190493707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, the Council's biomedical researchers worked to develop contraceptive methods, such as the intrauterine device. The council has found that fertility is "most sensitive to changes in the proportions married and prevalence of contraception." A country's ideas around reproduction out of wedlock, its accessibility, and the public's opinion of birth control are instrumental in the region's fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bongaarts|first=John|date=1982-01-01|title=The Fertility-Inhibiting Effects of the Intermediate Fertility Variables|jstor=1965445|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume=13|issue=6/7|pages=179–189|doi=10.2307/1965445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An array of contraceptives available around the world today were developed by the Population Council, including: the [[IUD with copper|Copper T Intrauterine device]], [[Norplant]], [[Jadelle|Jadelle (Norplant II)]], and [[Intrauterine system|Mirena]]. More than 50 million Copper T IUDs have been distributed in over 70 countries. Norplant was replaced by [[Jadelle]].

The British medical journal ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' said of the Population Council, "Most non-governmental organizations claim to promote change; the Population Council actually has hard evidence of having changed the lives and expectations of hundreds of millions of people."&lt;ref&gt;The Lancet. (Vol. 361, June 7, 2003, review)&lt;/ref&gt;

== HIV Prevention ==
The Population Council provides programs all over the world that aim to address the prevention and treatment of the HIV virus. These programs help to develop new technologies and distribute them to marginalized populations, and also educate people about the HIV virus through workshops and mentorship services. For example, Empowering Girls and Young Women at High Risk of HIV Infection: A Capacity Strengthening Project is a project with locations in 15 different African countries that reaches girls and young women who have the highest risk of HIV transmission and provides them with resources to prevent the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/research/DREAMS-capacity-strengthening|title=Empowering Girls and Young Women at High Risk of HIV Infection: A Capacity Strengthening Project {{!}}  Population Council|website=www.popcouncil.org|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council is constantly conducting research to find high risk populations and the most cost-effective ways to get them the treatment they lack. The Council partners in a project called Link Up that is based in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Myanmar, and Uganda, which focuses on the population of young people ages 10 to 24 who represent a large proportion of HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/research/link-up|title=Link Up {{!}}  Population Council|website=www.popcouncil.org|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's research and involvement in this project helped to implement more effective strategies for improving the sexual and reproductive health of these populations.

== Gender-Based Violence ==
The Council helps to alleviate the harmful effects of sexual and [[Gender violence|gender based violence]] by offering education to both men and women about domestic violence and provide programs to help victims. Programs like "Opening Opportunities" help to develop the social networks of girls who are most at risk of being involved in sexual or gender based violence, and also connects them with mentors to help them stay safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/research/abriendo-oportunidades-opening-opportunities|title=Abriendo Oportunidades ("Opening Opportunities") {{!}}  Population Council|website=www.popcouncil.org|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Health Data ==
The research that the Population Council conducts, and the publications it releases based on that research, contributes significantly to the data that demographers and health officials require in order to promote public health. For instance, the Population Council was one of the first organizations to document statistics on HIV in Africa. The council also conducted the first study in India to assess the HIV risks that injecting drug users face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/research/key-populations-at-risk-for-hiv|title=Key Populations at Risk for HIV {{!}}  Population Council|website=www.popcouncil.org|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their persistent efforts help to provide information about and combat public health disparities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17266">Indian food security system, established by the [[Government of India]] under [[Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution]]  is to distribute  subsidized food and non-food items to [[Poverty in India|India's poor]]. This scheme was first launched in February 1944, during the [[Second World War]] and was launched in the current form in June 1947. Major commodities distributed include staple food grains, such as [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]] and [[kerosene]], through a network of fair price shops (also known as ration shops) established in several states across the country. [[Food Corporation of India]], a [[Government-owned corporation]], procures and maintains the PDS.

In coverage and [[public expenditure]], it is considered to be the most important [[food security]] network. However, the food grains supplied by the ration shops are not enough to meet the consumption needs of the poor or are of inferior quality. The average level of consumption of PDS seeds in India is only 1&amp;nbsp;kg per person / month. The PDS has been criticised for its [[urban bias]] and its failure to serve the poorer sections of the population effectively. The targeted PDS is costly and gives rise to much [[Political corruption|corruption]] in the process of extricating the poor from those who are less needy. Today, India has the largest stock of grain in the world besides China, the government spends Rs. 750 billion ($13.6 billion) per year, almost 1 percent of GDP, yet 21% remain undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=As Grain Piles Up, India’s Poor Still Go Hungry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/business/global/a-failed-food-system-in-india-prompts-an-intense-review.html?_r=1&amp;smid=FB-nytimes&amp;WT.mc_id=BU-E-FB-SM-LIN-AGP-060812-NYT-NA&amp;WT.mc_ev=click |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution of food grains to poor people throughout the country is managed by state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5.17 The Public Distribution System is -------

== Overview ==
The central and state governments shared the responsibility of regulating the PDS. While the central government is responsible for procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation of food grains, state governments hold the responsibility for distributing the same to the consumers through the established network of Fair Price Shops (FPSs). State governments are also responsible for operational responsibilities including allocation and identification of families below poverty line, issue of ration cards, supervision and monitoring the functioning of FPSs(Fair Price Shops){{Clarify|date=September 2011}}.
Under PDS scheme, each family below the poverty line is eligible for 35&amp;nbsp;kg of rice or wheat every month, while a household above the poverty line is entitled to 15&amp;nbsp;kg of foodgrain on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news |title=UP foodgrain scam trail leads to Nepal, Bangladesh |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-11/india/28265185_1_indo-nepal-foodgrains-indo-bangladesh |publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date= 11 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A below poverty line card holder should be given 35&amp;nbsp;kg of food grain and the card holder above the poverty line should be given 15&amp;nbsp;kg of food grain as per the norms of PDS. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of the distribution process.

==Fair Price shops==
A public distribution shop, also known as fair price shop (FPS), is a part of [[India]]'s public  system established by [[Government of India]] which distributes rations at a subsidized price to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Public Distribution  System |url=http://www.fcamin.nic.in/dfpd/EventListing.asp?Section=PDS&amp;id_pk=1&amp;ParentID=0 |date= |publisher=[[Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (India)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locally these are known as "[[ration]] shops" and chiefly sell wheat, rice and sugar at a price lower than the market price called Issue Price. Other essential commodities may also be sold. To buy items one must have a "Ration Card". These shops are operated throughout the country by joint assistance of central and state government. The items from these shops are much cheaper but are of average quality. Ration shops are now present in most localities, villages towns and cities. India has 478,000 shops constituting the largest distribution network in the world.

The introduction of rationing in India dates back to the 1940s Bengal famine. This rationing system was revived in the wake of acute food shortage during the early 1960s, before the [[Green Revolution]].It involves 2 types- RPDS and TPDS.

{{Prose|date=September 2011}}
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
The public distribution system of India is not without its defects. With a coverage of around 40 million below-poverty-line families, a review discovered the following structural shortcomings and disturbances:&lt;ref&gt;[http://planningcommission.gov.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/11th/11_v2/11v2_ch4.pdf Planning Commission 11th FYP document: Nutrition and Social Safety Net, on PDS and Defects and shortcomings]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Growing instances of the consumers receiving inferior quality food grains in ration shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=33645|title=Press Information Bureau|author=|date=|website=pib.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deceitful dealers replace good supplies received from the [[Food Corporation of India]] (FCI) with inferior stock and sell FCI stock in the black market.
# Illicit fair price shop owners have been found to create large number of bogus cards to sell food grains in the open market.
# Many FPS dealers resort to [[malpractice]], illegal diversions of commodities, holding and black marketing due to the minimum salary received by them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/9th/vol2/v2c2-3.htm Planning Commission 9th FYP on FPS and malpractices]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Numerous malpractices make safe and nutritious food inaccessible and unaffordable to many poor thus resulting in their food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkative-shambhu.blogspot.in/2011/09/public-distribution-system-evidence.html|title=Public Distribution System: Evidence from Secondary Data and the Field*|author=|date=|website=talkative-shambhu.blogspot.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Identification of households to be denoted status and distribution to granted PDS services has been highly irregular and diverse in various states. The recent development of Aadhar UIDAI cards has taken up the challenge of solving the problem of identification and distribution of PDs services along with Direct Cash Transfers.
# Regional allocation and coverage of FPS are unsatisfactory and the core objective of price stabilization of essential commodities has not met.
# There is no set criteria as to which families are above or below the poverty line. This non-ambiguity gives massive scope for corruption and fallouts in PDS systems because some who are meant to benefit are not able to.

Several schemes have augmented the number of people aided by PDS, but the number is extremely low. Poor supervision of FPS and lack of [[accountability]] have spurred [[Reseller|middlemen]] who consume a good proportion of the stock meant for the poor. There is also no clarity as to which families should be included in the below the poverty line list and which are not. This results in the genuinely poor being excluded whilst the ineligible get several cards. Awareness about the presence of the PDS and FPS to poverty-stricken societies, namely the rural poor has been dismal.

The stock assigned to a single family cannot be bought in installments. This is a decisive barrier to the efficient functioning and overall success of PDS in India. Many families below the poverty line are not able to acquire [[ration card]]s either because they are seasonal [[migrant worker]]s or because they live in unauthorized colonies. A lot of families also mortgage their ration cards for money. Lack of clarity in the planning and structuring of social safety and security programs in India has resulted in the creation of numerous cards for the poor. Limited information about the overall use of cards has discouraged families below the poverty line from registering for new cards and increased illegal creation of cards by such families to ensure maximum benefit for the family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/301915/government-fix-over-illegal-ration.html|title=Government in a fix over illegal ration cards|author=|date=30 December 2012|website=deccanherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve the current system of the PDS, the following suggestions are furnished for:
# Vigilance squad should be strengthened to detect corruption, which is an added expenditure for taxpayers.
# Personnel-in-charge of the department should be chosen locally.
# Margin of profit should be increased for honest business, in which case the market system is more apt anyway.
# F.C.I. and other prominent agencies should provide quality food grains for distribution, which is a tall order for an agency that has no real incentive to do so.
# Frequent checks &amp; raids should be conducted to eliminate bogus and duplicate cards, which is again an added expenditure and not foolproof.
# The Civil Supplies Corporation should open more fair price shops in rural areas.
# The fair price dealers seldom display rate chart and quantity available in the block-boards in front of the shop. This should be enforced.

In aggregate, only about 42% of subsidised grains issued by the central pool reach the target group, according to a Planning Commission study released in March 2008.

Food stamps given to the needy and to the underprivileged by issue of coupons, vouchers, electronic card transfer etc. they can purchase commodities at any shop or outlet. The state government would then pay back the grocery shops for the stamps said the finance minister in his budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Distribution System in India|url=https://iimahd.academia.edu/ArnabSaha/Papers/349179/Public_Distribution_System_in_India|publisher=Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the United Progressive alliance, which came to power in 2004, decided on a common minimum programme (CMP) and on the agenda was food and nutrition security. Under that the government had plans to strengthen the food security program DS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Common Minimum Programme of the Government of India|url=http://pmindia.nic.in/cmp.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418073521/http://pmindia.nic.in/cmp.pdf|archivedate=18 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, finance minister [[Arun Jaitley]] in his budget speech went contrary to the idea proposed in the CMP and proposed the idea of the food stamp scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Targeted(http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/03/stories/2004080300331000.htm)|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has proposed to try the scheme in few districts of India to see its viability.&lt;ref name="Food Stamps: A Model for India"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Stamps: A Model for India |url=http://ccsindia.org/ccsindia/images/policy%20review-FoodStamps.pdf |publisher=Centre for Civil Society|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the CMP the government had proposed that if it is viable it would universalise the PDS; if food stamps are introduced it would be a targeted public distribution system. A group of about 40 economists have cautioned the NAC headed by Sonia Gandhi against the food security bill as it would put an additional burden on the exchequer. They instead have advised to go ahead and experiment with food stamps and other alternative methods and pointed out the flaws in PDS. This set of economists hail from institutes like Delhi School of Economics, Indian Statistical Institute, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Centre for Development Studies, Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Princeton, London School of Economics, University of British Columbia, University of California and University of Warwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Allow alternatives to PDS, say experts |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/allow-alternatives-to-pds-say-experts/797955|accessdate=27 September 2011|newspaper=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a landmark judgment, [[Delhi High Court]] has ruled that fair price shops cannot be allotted to a [[Below Poverty Line (India)|below poverty line]] card holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delhi HC says Fair price shop can’t be allotted to BPL card holders|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/delhi-hc-says-fair-price-shop-cant-be-allotted-to-bpl-card-holders/|work=IANS |publisher=news.biharprabha.com |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Black===
[[Aaj Tak]] news channel on 14 October 2013 performed a sting operation on PDS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Black by AAJ TAK News Channel |url=http://aajtak.intoday.in/video/unfairmeans-in-pds-aaj-tak-exposes-in-his-sting-opreation-black-1-744536.html|publisher=AAJ TAK|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; named Operation Black. It shows how the distribution reaches to mills instead of fair price shops. All the documentation via computerisation is clean.

[[NDTV]] did a show which documented how the Government of Chhattisgarh's food department managed to fix its broken system so that the diversion of grain came down from about 50% in 2004-5 to about 10% in 2009-10.&lt;ref&gt;Truth vs Hype: The Hunger Project http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/truth-vs-hype/truth-vs-hype-the-hunger-project/277857&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the PDS suggests (as these two programmes show) that the situation varies quite a lot across the country.

==Distribution of food stumps==
;Opportunities
# It will reduce India's dependence on buffer stock for price stabilization and in turn reduce the cost
# It provides incentive must to deregulate the domestic market and thus will induce private entrepreneurs
# There is an immense need to develop appropriate marketing infrastructure and institutions to deal with trade in agricultural commodities.
# Appropriate policy changes are a must, for instance, in the post WTO period the international prices of wheat and rice came to their lowest levels. But in India due to high MSP's the prices were relatively high. Thus as a result importing was cheaper than buying from the domestic market. As a result, the government levied 50% tariff on wheat and 80% percent tariff on rice which further resulted in one of the outlandish incidents in the Indian history that was accumulation of buffer stocks which were exported which, incidentally, came back for sale at high MSP's for instance in 2002-03, the government sold 1.6 million tones to  exporters but in reality exports were only 0.682 million tones &lt;ref&gt;http://ccs.in/ccsindia/ecatalyst/april09/mrinal.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The government may have to set up a complete system for the same or would have to put this responsibility on post office, banks or such other institutions. In this process there could be leakages which are a matter of concern. There would also be a burden which would come on the poor class who has to benefit from the same of going and collecting the food stamps.&lt;ref name="Food Stamps: A Model for India"/&gt;

A '''radiation burn''' is damage to the [[skin]] or other [[biological tissue]] as an [[Radiobiology|effect of radiation]]. The radiation types of greatest concern are [[thermal radiation]], radio frequency energy, [[ultraviolet light]] and [[ionizing radiation]].

The most common type of radiation [[burn]] is a [[sunburn]] caused by UV radiation. High exposure to [[X-rays]] during diagnostic [[medical imaging]] or [[radiotherapy]] can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with [[cell (biology)|cells]] within the body—damaging them—the body responds to this damage, typically resulting in [[erythema]]—that is, redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often associated with [[radiation-induced cancer]] due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage [[DNA]], occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. [[Cavity magnetron]]s can be improperly used to create surface and internal burning. Depending on the [[photon]] [[energy]], [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] can cause very deep '''gamma burns''', with [[cobalt-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co]] internal burns are common. '''Beta burns''' tend to be shallow as [[beta particles]] are not able to penetrate deep into the person; these burns can be similar to sunburn.

Radiation burns can also occur with high power [[radio transmitter]]s at any frequency where the body absorbs radio frequency energy and converts it to heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/rfsafety/ ARRL: RF Exposure Regulations News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517081221/http://www.arrl.org/news/rfsafety |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) considers 50 watts to be the lowest power above which radio stations must evaluate emission safety. Frequencies considered especially dangerous occur where the human body can become [[resonance|resonant]], at 35&amp;nbsp;MHz, 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, 80-100&amp;nbsp;MHz, 400&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/rf-radiation-and-electromagnetic-field-safety ARRL: RF Radiation and Electromagnetic Field Safety]&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to [[microwave]]s of too high intensity can cause [[microwave burn]]s.

'''Radiation dermatitis''' (also known as '''radiodermatitis''') is a [[skin disease]] associated with prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;{{rp|131–2}} Radiation dermatitis occurs to some degree in most patients receiving radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid17785763"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consensus guidelines for the management of radiation dermatitis and coexisting acne-like rash in patients receiving radiotherapy plus EGFR inhibitors for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck |journal= Annals of Oncology|volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=142–9 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17785763 |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdm400 |url= |last1=Bernier |first1=J. |last2=Bonner |first2=J |last3=Vermorken |first3=J.

There are three specific types of radiodermatitis: acute radiodermatitis, chronic radiodermatitis, and eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Radiation therapy can also cause radiation cancer.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;{{rp|40}}

With interventional fluoroscopy, because of the high skin [[absorbed dose|dose]]s that can be generated in the course of the intervention, some procedures have resulted in early (less than two months after exposure) and/or late (two months or more after exposure) skin reactions, including necrosis in some cases.&lt;ref name="pmid10580952"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Severe skin reactions from interventional fluoroscopy: case report and review of the literature |journal=Radiology |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=773–6 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10580952 |doi= 10.1148/radiology.213.3.r99dc16773|url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10580952 |last1=Wagner |first1=LK |last2=McNeese |first2=MD |last3=Marx |first3=MV |last4=Siegel |first4=EL}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|773}}

Radiation dermatitis, in the form of intense erythema and [[blister|vesiculation]] of the skin, may be observed in radiation ports.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;{{rp|131}}

As many as 95% of patients treated with radiation therapy for cancer will experience a skin reaction. Some reactions are immediate, while others may be later (e.g., months after treatment).&lt;ref name="pmid12024597"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porock D, Nikoletti S, Kristjanson L |title=Management of radiation skin reactions: literature review and clinical application |journal=Plast Surg Nurs |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=185–92, 223; quiz 191–2 |year=1999 |pmid=12024597 |doi= 10.1097/00006527-199901940-00004|url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=linkout&amp;SEARCH=12024597.ui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acute radiodermatitis''' occurs when an "erythema dose" of ionizing radiation is given to the skin, after which visible erythema appears up to 24 hours after.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |display-authors=etal |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}  Radiation dermatitis generally manifests within a few weeks after the start of radiotherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid17785763"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  Acute radiodermatitis, while presenting as red patches, may sometimes also present with [[desquamation]] or blistering.&lt;ref name="Rapini2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |title=Practical dermatopathology |publisher=Elsevier Mosby |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-323-01198-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erythema may occur at a dose of 2&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] radiation or greater.&lt;ref name="pmid11459599"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valentin J |title=Avoidance of radiation injuries from medical interventional procedures |journal=Ann ICRP |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=7–67 |year=2000 |pmid=11459599 |doi= 10.1016/S0146-6453(01)00004-5|url=http://openurl.ebscohost.com/linksvc/linking.aspx?genre=article&amp;sid=PubMed&amp;issn=0146-6453&amp;title=Ann%20ICRP&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=7&amp;atitle=Avoidance%20of%20radiation%20injuries%20from%20medical%20interventional%20procedures.&amp;aulast=Valentin&amp;date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic ===
'''Chronic radiodermatitis''' occurs with chronic exposure to "sub-erythema" doses of ionizing radiation over a prolonged period, producing varying degrees of damage to the skin and its underlying parts after a variable latent period of several months to several decades.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;{{rp|40}}  In the distant past this type of radiation reaction occurred most frequently in [[radiologist]]s and [[radiographer]]s who were constantly exposed to ionizing radiation, especially before the use of [[x-ray filter]]s.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;{{rp|40}}  Restated, chronic radiodermatitis, squamous and

== Beta burns ==
"Beta burns" are shallow surface burns, usually of skin and less often of [[lung]]s or [[gastrointestinal tract]], caused by beta particles, typically from [[hot particle]]s or dissolved [[radionuclide]]s that came to direct contact with or close proximity to the body. They can appear similar to sunburn. Unlike gamma rays, beta emissions are stopped much more effectively by materials and therefore deposit all their energy in only a shallow layer of tissue, causing more intense but more localized damage. On cellular level, the changes in skin are similar to radiodermatitis.

High doses of radiation can cause rapid browning of skin, known as "nuclear tan".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The dose is influenced by relatively low penetration of beta emissions through materials. The [[Keratin#Cornification|cornified]] [[keratine]] layer of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] has enough stopping power to absorb beta radiation with energies lower than 70&amp;nbsp;keV. Further protection is provided by clothing, especially shoes. The dose is further reduced by limited retention of radioactive particles on skin; a 1 millimeter particle is typically released in 2 hours, while a 50 micrometer particle usually does not adhere for more than 7 hours. Beta emissions are also severely attenuated by air; their range generally does not exceed {{convert|6|ft|m}} and intensity rapidly diminishes with distance.&lt;ref name="medmagrad"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-k5h07NkFcC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |title=Medical management of radiation accidents|author1=Igor A. Gusev |author2=Angelina Konstantinovna Guskova |author3=Fred Albert Mettler |page=77|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=0-8493-7004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[eye lens]] seems to be the most sensitive organ to beta radiation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqbAS0E_b3QC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=62#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |page=35|title=Security Manager's Guide to Disasters: Managing Through Emergencies, Violence, and Other Workplace Threats|author=Anthony Manley|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=1-4398-0906-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; even in doses far below maximum permissible dose. [[Safety goggles]] are recommended to attenuate strong beta.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k90iAnFereYC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=beta+radiation+energies+isotopes&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=beta%20radiation%20energies%20isotopes&amp;f=false|page=36|title=Isotopes in the Earth Sciences|author1=H. -G. Attendorn |author2=Robert Bowen |publisher=Springer|year=1988|isbn=0-412-53710-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beta burns can occur also to [[plant]]s. An example of such damage is the [[Red Forest]], a victim of the [[Chernobyl accident]].

Careful washing of exposed body surface, removing the radioactive particles, may provide significant dose reduction. Exchanging or at least brushing off clothes also provides a degree of protection.

If the exposure to beta radiation is intense, the beta burns may first manifest in 24–48 hours by itching and/or burning sensation that last for one or two days, sometimes accompanied by [[hyperaemia]]. After 1–3 weeks burn symptoms appear; erythema, increased [[skin pigmentation]] (dark colored patches and raised areas), followed by [[epilation]] and [[skin lesion]]s. Erythema occurs after 5–15&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|Gy]], dry desquamation after 17&amp;nbsp;Gy, and [[bullous]] [[epidermitis]] after 72&amp;nbsp;Gy.&lt;ref name="medmagrad"/&gt; [[Chronic radiation keratosis]] may develop after higher doses. Primary erythema lasting more than 72 hours is an indication of injury severe enough to cause chronic radiation dermatitis. Edema of [[dermal papillae]], if present within 48 hours since the exposition, is followed by transepidermal [[necrosis]]. After higher doses, the [[malpighian layer]] cells die within 24 hours; lower doses may take 10–14 days to show dead cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fXzJrDfFgUC&amp;pg=PA690&amp;dq=fallout+particles+morphology&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Veterinary pathology|page=690|author1=Thomas Carlyle Jones |author2=Ronald Duncan Hunt |author3=Norval W. King |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1997|isbn=0-683-04481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhalation of beta radioactive isotopes may cause beta burns of lungs and [[nasopharyngeal]] region, ingestion may lead to burns of gastrointestinal tract; the latter being a risk especially for [[grazing]] animals.

* In first degree beta burns the damage is largely limited to epidermis. Dry or wet desquamation occurs; dry [[Wound healing#Proliferative phase|scabs]] are formed, then heal rapidly, leaving a depigmented area surrounded with irregular area of increased pigmentation. The skin pigmentation returns to normal within several weeks.
* Second degree beta burns lead to formation of [[blister]]s.
* Third and fourth degree beta burns result in deeper, wet [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ated lesions, which heal with routine medical care after covering themselves with dry scab. In case of heavy tissue damage, ulcerated necrotic [[dermatitis]] may occur. Pigmentation may return to normal within several months after wound healing.&lt;ref name="medmagrad"/&gt;

As shown, the dose thresholds for symptoms vary by source and even individually. In practice, determining the exact dose tends to be difficult.

Similar effects apply to animals, with fur acting as additional factor for both increased particle retention and partial skin shielding. Unshorn thickly wooled sheep are well protected; while the epilation threshold for sheared sheep is between 23–47&amp;nbsp;Gy (2500–5000 [[Roentgen equivalent physical|rep]]) and the threshold for normally wooled face is 47–93&amp;nbsp;Gy (5000–10000 rep), for thickly wooled (33&amp;nbsp;mm hair length) sheep it is 93–140&amp;nbsp;Gy (10000–15000 rep). To produce skin lesions comparable with [[orf (disease)|contagious pustular dermatitis]], the estimated dose is between 465–1395&amp;nbsp;Gy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzsrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22+plants&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A guide to environmental research on animals|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

=== Energy vs penetration depth ===
{{Medium-lived fission products}}
The effects depend on both the intensity and the energy of the radiation. Low-energy beta (sulfur-35, 170&amp;nbsp;keV) produces shallow ulcers with little damage to dermis, while [[cobalt-60]] (310&amp;nbsp;keV), [[caesium-137]] (550&amp;nbsp;keV), [[phosphorus-32]] (1.71&amp;nbsp;MeV), [[strontium-90]] (650&amp;nbsp;keV) and its daughter product [[yttrium-90]] (2.3&amp;nbsp;MeV) damage deeper levels of the [[dermis]] and can result in [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] radiation dermatitis. Very high energies from [[electron beam]]s from [[particle accelerator]]s, reaching tens of megaelectronvolts, can be deeply penetrating. Conversely, megavolt-scale beams can deposit their energy deeper with less damage to the dermis; modern radiotherapy electron beam accelerators take advantage of this. At yet higher energies, above 16&amp;nbsp;MeV, the effect does not show significantly anymore, limiting the usefulness of higher energies for radiotherapy. As a convention, surface is defined as the topmost 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm of skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v68J1dgCEn8C&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=radiotherapy+electron+beam+penetration+depth+mev&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=radiotherapy%20electron%20beam%20penetration%20depth%20mev&amp;f=false|page=522 |title=Handbook of radiotherapy physics: theory and practice|author1=Philip Mayles |author2=Alan E. Nahum |author3=Jean-Claude Rosenwald |publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=0-7503-0860-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-energy beta emissions should be shielded with plastic instead of lead, as [[heavy metal (chemistry)|high-Z]] elements generate deeply penetrating gamma [[bremsstrahlung]].

The electron energies from [[beta decay]] are not discrete but form a continuous spectrum with a cutoff at maximum energy. The rest of the energy of each decay is carried off by an [[antineutrino]] which does not significantly interact and therefore does not contribute to the dose. Most energies of beta emissions are at about a third of the maximum energy.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Beta emissions have much lower energies than what is achievable from particle accelerators, no more than few megaelectronvolts.

The energy-depth-dose profile is a curve starting with a surface dose, ascending to the maximum dose in a certain depth d&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (usually normalized as 100% dose), then descends slowly through depths of 90% dose (d&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) and 80% dose (d&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), then falls off linearly and relatively sharply though depth of 50% dose (d&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;). The extrapolation of this linear part of the curve to zero defines the maximum electron range, R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. In practice, there is a long tail of weaker but deep dose, called "bremsstrahlung tail", attributable to [[bremsstrahlung]]. The penetration depth depends also on beam shape, narrower beam tend to have less penetration. In water, broad electron beams, as is the case in homogeneous surface contamination of skin, have d&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; about E/3&amp;nbsp;cm and R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; about E/2&amp;nbsp;cm, where E is the beta particle energy in MeV.&lt;ref name="cliradphys"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3s0mI_BmZ4C&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=accelerator+burns+electron&amp;cd=37#v=onepage&amp;q=accelerator%20burns%20electron&amp;f=false|page=328 |title=Handbook of urology: diagnosis and therapy|author1=Mike Benjamin Siroky |author2=Robert D. Oates |author3=Richard K. Babayan |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2004|isbn=0-7817-4221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penetration depth of lower-energy beta in water (and soft tissues) is about 2&amp;nbsp;mm/MeV. For a 2.3&amp;nbsp;MeV beta the maximum depth in water is 11&amp;nbsp;mm, for 1.1&amp;nbsp;MeV it is 4.6&amp;nbsp;mm. The depth where maximum of the energy is deposited is significantly lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scidemos/QuantumRelativity/PenetrationandShielding/PenetrationandShielding.html |title=α, β, γ Penetration and Shielding |publisher=Fas.harvard.edu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a wide beam, the depth-energy relation for dose ranges is as follows, for energies in [[megaelectronvolt]]s and depths in millimeters. The dependence of surface dose and penetration depth on beam energy is clearly visible.&lt;ref name="cliradphys"/&gt;

== Causes ==
Radiation burns are caused by exposure to high levels of radiation. Levels high enough to cause burn are generally lethal if received as a whole-body dose, whereas they may be treatable if received as a shallow or local dose.

=== Medical Imaging ===
[[Fluoroscopy]] may cause burns if performed repeatedly or for too long.&lt;ref name="Bolognia"/&gt;

Similarly, [[Computed Tomography|computed tomography]] and traditional [[Projectional Radiography|projectional radiography]] have the potential to cause radiation burns if the exposure factors and exposure time are not appropriately controlled by the operator.

=== Radioactive fallout ===
Beta burns are frequently the result of exposure to [[radioactive fallout]] after [[nuclear explosion]]s or [[nuclear accident]]s. Shortly after the explosion, the [[fission product]]s have very high beta activity, with about two beta emissions per each gamma photon.

After the [[Trinity test]], the fallout caused localized burns on the backs of [[cattle]] in the area downwind.&lt;ref name="massburns"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |page=248|title=Mass burns: proceedings of a workshop, 13–14 March 1968|author=National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Fire Research, United States. Office of Civil Defense|publisher=National Academies|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fallout had the appearance of small flaky dust particles. The cattle showed temporary burns, bleeding, and loss of hair. Dogs were also affected; in addition to localized burns on their backs, they also had burned paws, likely from the particles lodged between their toes as hoofed animals did not show problems with feet. About 350–600 cattle were affected by superficial burns and localized temporary loss of dorsal hair; the army later bought 75 most affected cows as the discolored regrown hair lowered their market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2EzvHupWRkC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false|page=105 |title=The dragon's tail: radiation safety in the Manhattan Project, 1942-1946|author=Barton C.

The fallout produced by the [[Castle Bravo]] test was unexpectedly strong. A white snow-like dust, nicknamed by the scientists "Bikini snow" and consisting of contaminated crushed [[calcined]] [[coral]], fell for about 12 hours upon the [[Rongelap Atoll]], depositing a layer of up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. Residents suffered beta burns, mostly on the backs of their necks and on their feet,&lt;ref name="massburns"/&gt; and were resettled after three days. After 24–48 hours their skin was itching and burning; in a day or two the sensations subsided, to be followed after 2–3 weeks by epilation and ulcers. Darker-colored patches and raised areas appeared on their skin, blistering was uncommon. Ulcers formed dry scabs and healed. Deeper lesions, painful, weeping and ulcerated, formed on more contaminated residents; the majority healed with simple treatment. In general, the beta burns healed with some cutaneous [[scarring]] and depigmentation. Individuals who bathed and washed the fallout particles from their skin did not develop skin lesions.&lt;ref name="nuchandb"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CAUYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=65#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |title=Nuclear handbook for medical service personnel|author=United States. Dept. of the Army|page=18|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishing ship [[Daigo Fukuryu Maru]] was affected by the fallout as well; the crew suffered skin doses between 1.7–6.0&amp;nbsp;Gy, with beta burns manifesting as severe skin lesions, erythema, [[erosion (dermatopathology)|erosions]], sometimes necrosis, and skin [[atrophy]]. 23 U.S. radar servicemen of the 28-member weather station on [[Rongerik]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cr81ZHY-6H0C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false|page=29 |title=America's nuclear legacy|author=Wayne D.

Sixteen crew members of the aircraft carrier [[USS Bairoko (CVE-115)|USS Bairoko]] received beta burns and there was an increased cancer rate.&lt;ref name="medmagrad"/&gt;

During the Zebra test of the [[Operation Sandstone]] in 1948 three men suffered beta burns on their hands when removing sample collection filters from [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] flying through the [[mushroom cloud]]; their estimated skin surface dose was 28 to 149&amp;nbsp;Gy and their disfigured hands required [[skin graft]]s. A fourth man showed weaker burns after the earlier Yoke test.&lt;ref name="elemcontr"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKp3ridsHrYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22+harry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |title=Elements of controversy: the Atomic Energy Commission and radiation safety in nuclear weapons testing, 1947-1974|author=Barton C.

The [[Upshot-Knothole Harry|Upshot–Knothole Harry]] test at the [[Frenchman Flat]] site released a large amount of fallout. A significant number of sheep died after grazing on contaminated areas. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] however had a policy to compensate farmers only for animals showing external beta burns, so many claims were denied. Other tests on the Nevada Test Site also caused fallout and corresponding beta burns to sheep, horses and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQfG-U5iAPYC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=55#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |page=65|title=Bombs in the backyard: atomic testing and American politics|author=A.

=== Nuclear accidents ===
Beta burns were a serious medical issue for some victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]; from 115 patients treated in Moscow, 30% had burns covering 10–50% of body surface, 11% were affected on 50–100% of skin; the massive exposure was often caused by clothes drenched with radioactive water. Some firefighters suffered beta burns of lungs and nasopharyngeal region after inhalation of massive amounts of radioactive [[smoke]]. Out of 28 deaths, 16 had skin injuries listed among the causes. The beta activity was extremely high, with beta/gamma ratio reaching 10–30 and beta energy high enough to damage [[basal layer]] of the skin, resulting in large area portals for [[infection]]s, exacerbated by damage to [[bone marrow]] and weakened [[immune system]]. Some patients received skin dose of 400–500&amp;nbsp;Gy. The infections caused more than half of the acute deaths. Several died of fourth degree beta burns between 9–28 days after dose of 6–16&amp;nbsp;Gy. Seven died after dose of 4–6&amp;nbsp;Gy and third degree beta burns in 4–6 weeks. One died later from second degree beta burns and dose 1-4&amp;nbsp;Gy.&lt;ref name="radhorm"/&gt; The survivors have atrophied skin which is [[telangiectasia|spider veined]] and with underlying [[fibrosis]].&lt;ref name="medmagrad"/&gt;

The burns may manifest at different times at different body areas. The [[Chernobyl liquidator]]s burns first appeared on wrists, face, neck and feet, followed by chest and back, then by knees, hips and buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKPofdNV2C8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false|page=174 |title=Bioterrorism: psychological and public health interventions|author1=Robert J.

[[Industrial radiography]] sources are a common source of beta burns in workers.

Radiation therapy sources can cause beta burns during exposure of the patients. The sources can be also lost and mishandled, as in the [[Goiânia accident]], during which several people suffered external beta burns and more serious gamma burns, and several died. Numerous accidents also occur during radiotherapy due to equipment failures, operator errors, or wrong dosage.

Electron beam sources and particle accelerators can be also sources of beta burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7396251|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|year=1980|volume=9|title=Accidental beta radiation burns from an electron accelerator|vauthors=Burguieres TH, Stair T, Rolnick MA, Mossman KL |issue=7|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(80)80115-6|pages=371–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burns may be fairly deep and require skin grafts, tissue [[Segmental resection|resection]] or even [[amputation]] of fingers or limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=High Energy Electron Injury from Accelerator Machines (Cathode Rays): Radiation Burns of Chest Wall and Neck: 17-Year Follow Up of Atomic Burns|author=J.

==Teigin case==
[[Image:Shiina-Machi branch of the Teikoku Bank.JPG|thumb|left|Site of the "Teikoku Bank Incident"]]
On January 26, 1948, a man calling himself an [[epidemiologist]] arrived in a branch of the Imperial Bank (Teikoku Ginkō, aka Teigin) at Shiinamachi, a suburb of [[Toshima, Tokyo]], before closing time.  He explained that he was a public health official sent by US [[Occupied Japan|occupation authorities]] who had orders to [[inoculation|inoculate]] the staff against a sudden outbreak of [[dysentery]]. He gave all sixteen people present a pill and a few drops of liquid. Those present drank the liquid he gave, which was later thought to be a [[cyanide]] solution. When all were incapacitated, the robber took some money laying on the desks, which amounted to 160,000 yen (about $2,000 US at the time), but left the majority behind, leaving his motive unknown.  Ten of the victims died at the scene (one was a child of an employee) and two others died while hospitalized.

==Arrest and trial==
Hirasawa was caught by the [[police]] due to the Japanese habit of exchanging [[business card]]s with personal details. There had been two other extremely similar cases of attempted and actual theft at banks via the use of poison in the weeks and months before the robbery. In all cases the poisoner, a lone male, left a business card. The poisoner used a card which was marked "Jirō Yamaguchi" in one of the two incidents, but it was later found that said Yamaguchi did not exist: the card was a fake. The poisoner also used a real card which was marked "Shigeru Matsui" (of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Department of Disease Prevention) in another of the two incidents. The original owner of the card was found to have an alibi. Matsui told the police that he had exchanged cards with 593 people, but of these, 100 were of the type used in the poisoning incidents, of which eight remained in his possession. Matsui recorded the time and place of the business card exchange on the back of cards he received so the police set out to trace the remaining 92 cards. 62 cards were retrieved and their receivers cleared, a further 22 were deemed to have been irrelevant to the case. One of the remaining 8 cards was received by Hirasawa. The police were led to arrest Hirasawa because
#He could not produce the card he had received from Matsui. Hirasawa claimed to have lost the business card, together with his wallet, due to his having been the victim of pickpocketing.
#A similar amount of money to that stolen from the bank was found in Hirasawa's possession, the origin of which he refused to divulge. The origin of the money is unknown to this day (though some, such as the crime fiction novelist [[Seichō Matsumoto]], suggested Hirasawa received it by drawing pornographic pictures, a side business that would have been detrimental to Hirasawa's reputation as an artist).
#Hirasawa's alibi of having been taking a stroll in the vicinity of the crime scene could be neither verified nor substantiated.
#Hirasawa was identified as the poisoner by several witnesses (but only by two survivors, and see picture below).
#He confessed to having been involved in four previous cases of bank fraud (recanted together with his subsequent confession).

He was arrested on August 21, 1948. After police interrogation, which allegedly involved torture, Hirasawa confessed, but then recanted soon after. His later defence against his confession was based on partial insanity, alleging that he had been troubled with [[Korsakoff's syndrome]] (as a result of rabies inoculation) and so his confession was not reliable. The court, however, disagreed and Hirasawa was given the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] in 1950. Until 1949, a confession was solid evidence under the law, even if the police tortured a person to extract said confession. The [[Supreme Court of Japan]] upheld the death sentence in 1955. His attorneys tried to have the sentence revoked, submitting 18 pleas for retrial over the following years.

==Doubt over guilty verdict==
[[Image:Teigin case.jpg|thumb|Japanese police made the montage picture of the criminal, but his face was clearly not similar to Hirasawa.]]
He was sentenced to death, but there was originally no conclusive evidence. In addition, although 40 employees saw the crimes, there were only two people who identified him as the criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829904,00.html|title=Noose or Pneumonia?|accessdate=2008-02-09 |author= |date=1963-02-15 |work= |publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seichō Matsumoto]] presumed that the true culprit was a former member of [[Unit 731]] in his books ''A story of the Teikoku Bank Incident'' in 1959 and ''The Black Fog of Japan'' in 1960. Matsumoto also suspected that "the money of unknown origin" came from selling pornographic drawings. [[Kei Kumai]] protested Hirasawa's conviction by his film ''The Long Death'' in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyasiaonline.com/content/view/1435/53/|title=Obituary - Kei Kumai|accessdate=2008-02-03|author=|date=2007-05-24|work=|publisher=Reed Business Information|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Ministers of Justice in Japan]] did not sign his death warrant, so the death sentence was never carried out. Even [[Isaji Tanaka]], who on 13 October 1967 announced in front of the press that he had signed the death warrants of 23 prisoners in one go, did not sign Hirasawa's death warrant, stating that he doubted Hirasawa's guilt.

The poison was regarded as the readily obtainable [[potassium cyanide]] in Hirasawa's trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080123f2.html|title=Fight to clear mass-killer's name unending|accessdate=2008-02-03 |author= |date=2008-01-23 |work= |publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons given to doubt Hirasawa's guilt is because the victims' symptoms were clearly different from potassium cyanide poisoning, which is rapid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061126a7.html|title=Experts doubt Teigin Incident verdict|accessdate=2008-02-06 |author= |date=2006-11-26 |work= |publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keio University]]'s contemporary investigation claimed that the true poison may have been [[acetone cyanohydrin]], a military poison deliberately designed to be slow-acting, which Hirasawa could not have obtained.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cprBEpxvexgC&amp;pg=PA120#PPA119,M1 Unit 731: Testimony]'' ''[[Google Books]]''. via [[Tuttle Publishing]]. pp. 119-120 by Hal Gold (1996) {{ISBN|4-900737-39-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death in jail==
Hirasawa remained in prison as a condemned criminal for the next 32 years.&lt;ref name="south asia"&gt;{{cite web| author= | publisher=South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre|title=Japan Hanging on to Death Penalty |url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF75.htm |date=2003-04-23 | accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his time painting and writing his autobiography {{nihongo|''My Will: the Teikoku Bank Case''|遺書 帝銀事件}}.

In 1981, Makoto Endo became the leader of Hirasawa's lawyers. Besides the case, he took part in controversial trials such as that of [[Norio Nagayama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2002_Jan_28/ai_84013787|title=Endo, chief lawyer in 'Teigin Incident,' dies at 71| publisher=CNET Networks|date=2002-01-28 | accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense claimed that [[statute of limitations]] for his death penalty ran out in 1985. The [[death penalty]] has a 30-year statute of limitations under the [[Criminal Code of Japan]],&lt;ref name="south asia" /&gt; and so Endo appealed for his release. However, the Japanese court refused this argument, pointing out that the statute only applies in the case if a death row inmate escapes from prison and evades capture for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403EED71739F932A05756C0A963948260&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=sadamichi&amp;st=nyt|title=Court Refuses to Free A Death Row Japanese|publisher=The New York Times|date=1985-05-31|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese courts judge that the punishment begins when the minister signs the death warrant, which had never been done.&lt;ref name="south asia" /&gt; His health deteriorated in 1987. On April 30, 1987, [[Amnesty International]] petitioned the Japanese government to release him, but Hirasawa died of [[pneumonia]] in a prison hospital on May 10.

==Bids for a posthumous retrial==
Even after Hirasawa's death, his son by adoption, Takehiko Hirasawa, tried to clear his name. Takehiko was the son of one of Sadamichi's supporters; he became the painter's adopted son while in university to take up the task of getting a retrial for Sadamichi, as his relatives were reluctant to pursue the case due to social prejudice. Takehiko also worked to recover several of Sadamichi's lost paintings and held exhibitions of his work. He and his lawyers submitted a 19th plea for retrial; Sadamichi's brain damage was also proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uunet.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200802250056.html|title=Death-row inmate had brain damage|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|author=Shigeko Segawa|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2008-03-14}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, his lawyers had submitted new evidence to attempt to prove Hirasawa's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Keiji, ([[Kyodo News]]), "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120608f6.html 25 years after Teigin convict's death, exoneration efforts continue]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 June 2012, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Takehiko Hirasawa died alone at his home in [[Suginami Ward, Tokyo]], aged 54; he had lived there with his natural mother until her death at age 83 the previous December. His body was only found on 16 October by several retrial supporters who had worried about not hearing from him in some time. According to supporters, the pressures and uncertainties  surrounding the reopening of the case, together with his mother's death, had caused Takehiko to periodically display signs of instability and doubts about whether he could continue. He continued to persist with his objective of getting a posthumous retrial, though, writing after his mother's death on a website about the "Teijin Incident":

"It was her wish and mine and my late father’s to mark in history that Sadamichi Hirasawa is innocent. I will continue this struggle for years to come.”&lt;ref name="japantimes.co.jp"&gt;Hirano, Keiji, ([[Kyodo News]]), "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/10/16/national/death-of-inmates-adoptive-son-ends-teigin-retrial-bid/#.UzYHdI3c1jg Death of inmate’s adoptive son ends ‘Teigin’ retrial bid]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the time of Takehiko's death, he and his lawyers had assembled a team of psychologists to reexamine the witness accounts and investigation process from the trial, to determine if the evidence was credible by present standards. They had been scheduled to submit their position papers to the Tokyo High Court by the end of 2013, ahead of the court verdict on the retrial petition.&lt;ref name="japantimes.co.jp"/&gt;

On 4 December 2013, the Tokyo High Court announced it would drop the plea for a posthumous retrial for Sadamichi Hirasawa following his adopted son's death. As a result, the court effectively declared the case closed, unless other members of the Hirasawa family wish to pursue a retrial.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Keiji, ([[Kyodo News]]), "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/12/04/national/court-calls-end-to-plea-seeking-teigin-retrial/#.UzYM-Y3c1jg Court calls end to plea seeking Teigin retrial]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Based on the Hirasawa case is a 2009 novel, entitled ''Occupied City'', by English author [[David Peace]], who was long a resident in Japan. The case is also referenced in Ian Fleming's 11th James Bond novel, ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1964), though embellished and exaggerated.

The '''Source Water Protection Terms of Reference''' is the workplan for completing the [[source protection plan]] under the ''[[Clean Water Act, 2006]]'' in [[Ontario, Canada]].  The Terms of Reference is the first of three steps in the process; it lays out who does what, when it will happen and how much it will cost. It will guide the Source Protection Committee through the completion of the Assessment Report and the Source Protection Plan. The Terms of Reference is a work plan and budget that identifies:

The drinking water systems being included in the source protection planning process;

- A list of technical studies and tasks required to identify vulnerable areas and risks to drinking water within these areas ([[Assessment Report]])

- A list of tasks required to develop land use planning policies, risk reduction strategies and monitoring activities to address risks to drinking water in vulnerable areas ([[Source Protection Plan]])

- A list of matters affecting neighbouring watersheds that need to be worked on together;

- Who will coordinate the technical and planning tasks (municipalities, conservation authority staff or a partnership between the two); and

- Cost estimates and a schedule for completing all required tasks.

'''Surgeons of Hope'''' (SOH), is a [[New York City]], NY based [[non-profit]] established in 2001. It aims to provide every infant and child with a damaged heart an equal opportunity to receive life-saving surgery.

'''Motto: "It's not only what we bring. It's what we leave behind."''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surgeonsofhope.org/overview.php|title=Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heart Ambassador ==
* Diego Luna: In July 2018 Surgeons of Hope named their first Heart Ambassador, [[Diego Luna]]. The filmmaker, actor, and activist will be traveling with the nonprofit on upcoming missions to ensure that no child is left behind due to inaccessibility of services. &lt;ref&gt;https://surgeonsofhope.org/heart-ambassador/&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
Surgeons of Hope began its life-saving work with pilot programs in [[Cambodia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Senegal]], and [[Afghanistan]].  In 2008, it shifted focus to efforts in [[Latin America]]. Surgeons of Hope established a program in Nicaragua, the second poorest country in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Since 2008, it has constructed an advanced cardiac center, provided training to local medical teams, treated hundreds of children, and has more successful programs in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Peru]], and most recently [[Panama]] and [[Paraguay]], where we began our assessment missions to provide access to care for those who may not be able to travel, afford, or find life saving cardiac centers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surgeonsofhope.org/blog/|title=Thanks to your help great things will happen in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVDs), a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, on our global society is immense.  It is the number one cause of death globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/|title=Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An estimated 17.5 million people died from CVDs in 2015, representing 31% of all global deaths, with over 80% of CVD deaths taking place in low-and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/ahamah-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_480086.pdf|title=Heart Disease, Stroke and Research Statistics At-a-Glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People in low-and middle-income countries often do not have the benefit of integrated primary health care programs for early detection and treatment of people with risk factors. They also have less access to effective and equitable health care services, which respond to their needs.  As a result, many are detected late in the course of the disease and die younger.  The poorest populations are affected most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/|title=Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
SOH’s approach and solution is through: 1) CURE 2) CULTIVATE and 3) CONSTRUCT

1. Cure: In order to immediately help children with heart defects, Surgeons of Hope organizes and deploys volunteer medical teams, originating from a number of international and national academic hospitals. Each medical mission is designed to meet the goals and needs of partner communities.

2. Cultivate: 
* On-site Training: Visiting cardiac specialists provide training in the form of hands-on experience and lectures for local and regional medical professionals. Surgeons of Hope has sponsored 25 successful week-long training missions since 2008.  The local team is already independently operating and developing their own in-house training sessions.
* Of-site training: Surgeons of Hope organizes and sponsors trainings for physicians and nurses at cardiac facilities within Latin America.
* [[Telemedicine]]: As a low-cost adjunct to on-site training, telemedicine enables the Surgeons of Hope team to provide long-distance patient management and medical education.  Telemedicine also facilitates communication among affiliated clinics within the region.
3. Construct: Most developing countries lack the medical facilities to support basic health care, much less complex procedures like [[cardiac surgery]].  Access to a technologically-advanced facility is a critical component of the effort to provide equitable access to pediatric heart surgery.  With the aid of partner organizations, Surgeons of Hope constructs and equips medical facilities in communities in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surgeonsofhope.org/solution.html|title=Our Solution|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pilot Programs ==
* Cambodia: (2001-2006) The development of the Phnom Penh Heart Center was led by La Chaine de l’Espoir, the sister organization of Surgeons of Hope. The 28-bed Heart Center and 22-bed Children’s Pavilion officially opened in 2001, following an inauguration by [[King Sihanouk]], the Prime Minister of Cambodia, and the Minister of Health in Cambodia.  Since the opening of the center through 2006, Surgeons of Hope provided financial and surgical support, including three surgical missions, which resulted in 75 cardiac surgeries for children in need.  Thanks to the financial support of our generous donors, including [[Central Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Central Presbyterian Church]], [[Edwards Lifesciences]], [[Irving]]{{dn|date=August 2018}}, and AGA Medical Corp, all of the children treated during Surgeons of Hope missions could be accommodated by a member of their family at the Children’s Pavilion.  The Phnom Penh Heart Center also received important donations of equipment and supplies through the support of Surgeons of Hope, including an [[echocardiograph]] machine, three [[Philips]] ultrasounds from [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]], 600 [[stents]] from [[Medtronic]], and more than 60 [[cardiac valve]]s, courtesy of Edwards Lifesciences and Saint Jude Children’s Hospital.
* Afghanistan: (2005-2007) For decades, Afghanistan has faced constant political instability, conflict, and the destruction of its infrastructure, economy, and environment.  The healthcare system is one of the worst affected social sectors, with the majority of the population depending on external assistance. Shortly after [[9/11]], the founder of La Chaine de l’Espoir worked alongside the Afghani government and President Amid Karzai to develop plans for the [[French Medical Institute for Children]] in Kabul.  The first Cardiac surgeries were performed on Afghan children in 2005.  In cooperation with La Chaine de l’Espoir, Surgeons of Hope sent a medical mission led by Professor Lacour-Gayet of the [[University of Colorado]] and Children’s Hospital.  During this mission, 15 cardiac surgeries were performed on Afghani children with heart defects.
* Mozambique- (2001-2007) In 2001, the Maputo Heart Institute opened in Mozambique.  Former Vice President of la Chaine de l’Espoir and board member of Surgeons of Hope, Dr. Daniel Sidi, led the initiative.  The Maputo Heart Institute was designed to provide preventative care and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as well as to operate as an academic center for cardiac research and training.  In 2001, the 30-bed hospital opened.  Several years later, in 2006, the research center on cardiovascular diseases and [[endomyocardial fibrosis]], opened.  Through 2007, Surgeons of Hope and other affiliates sponsored up to five interventional surgical missions every year.
* Senegal: (1999-2004) For over ten years, La Chaine de l’Espoir has been actively involved in Senegal to help children with heart defects access medical and surgical care.  the contributions of La Chaine de l’Espoir and Surgeons of Hope Foundation have led to life-saving treatment or surgery for over 150 children and the donation of over $300,000 of medical supplies and equipment, as well as training for local healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surgeonsofhope.org/where-we-work.php|title=Pilot Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nicaragua Program ==
SOH started working in Nicaragua with La Mascota Hospital in [[Managua]] in 2008. [[Nicaragua]] is a lower middle income country with a GDP of $10.51 billion in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/nicaragua|title=Nicaragua|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 14 health projects monitored by the World Bank in Nicaragua; 3 dealing with [[Hurricane Felix]] reconstruction, 3 dealing with healthcare modernization, 2 dealing with community health, and only 1 focusing on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/projects/search?lang=en&amp;searchTerm=&amp;tab=map&amp;countryshortname_exact=Nicaragua|title=Projects &amp; Operations|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[WHO]] about 25% of Nicaragua’s entire population die from [[Cardiovascular disease|Cardio Vascular Disease]](CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nmh/countries/nic_en.pdf?ua=1|title=Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, SOH began constructing a pediatric heart facility in Managua in conjunction with the [[Ministry of Health]]. The facility officially opened in July 2013. As of 2016, just three years after opening, this local program completes four operations per week in complete autonomy.  In addition to treating children, the missions serve as a collaborative teaching source within the community.

Thousands of children and babies are waiting for our medical professionals to arrive and give them a chance at childhood. This past year (2017), our talented volunteers performed an astounding 19,210 outpatient consultations and 447 complex and delicate surgeries on babies and children, mending tiny hearts and giving families joy on every mission.

== Costa Rica Program ==
Surgeons of Hope’s first mission to [[Costa Rica]] took place in February 2016. The foundation was invited to travel to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] to enhance an existing surgical program at the Hospital Nacional De Ninos (National Children’s Hospital).  The goal of the mission was to perform 10 open-heart surgeries on infants and children with congenital heart defects and to provide coaching on complex procedures for the resident medical staff.  Twelve volunteers led by Dr. Chai, Pediatric Cardiac Surgeon at [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]], made up this team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surgeonsofhope.org/blog/|title=Thanks to your help great things will happen in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Catherine Deacon''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 2 February 1964, [[Musselburgh]]) is a Scottish public figure who has held leadership roles across the private, public and third sectors, and in academia and national politics.

She was [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] MSP for [[Edinburgh East and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East &amp; Musselburgh]] from 1999–2007 and served as Scotland’s first Cabinet [[Minister for Health and Community Care]] following the creation of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999. She was Assistant Principal External Relations at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 2012-2018 and has been a non-executive director of several companies. She was the first female Chair of the Institute of Directors from 2015-18 and was appointed Chair of the Scottish Police Authority on 4 December 2017.

==Education==
Deacon attended [[Musselburgh Grammar School]], where she was head girl and active in inter-schools debating. She studied at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MA (Hons) in Social Policy and Politics in 1987 and later an MBA in 1992. She was vice president of [[Edinburgh University Students' Association]], and chair of [[Scottish Labour Students]].

==Early career==
Deacon's early career was in [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] where she worked for seven years in research and management roles. After a spell in management consultancy and training in the private sector, she became director of [[MBA]] programmes at the [[Edinburgh Business School]], at [[Heriot-Watt University]], which included managing Scotland's first Consortium MBA programme for companies. Deacon was involved in the creation of the Business School as a new graduate school within the university.

Meanwhile, she rose through Labour ranks serving on the [[Scottish Labour Party's National Executive]] and was a founder member of the [[Devolution|pro-devolution]] pressure group, [[Scottish Labour Action]].

==Member of Scottish Parliament==
Deacon was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] as MSP for [[Edinburgh East and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East and Musselburgh]] in [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|May 1999]] and, though widely tipped for ministerial office, her appointment by First Minister [[Donald Dewar]] as Scotland’s first cabinet [[Minister for Health and Community Care]] came as a surprise to many.&lt;ref&gt;Leader column, The Herald (Glasgow), 18 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been education spokesperson in Dewar's [[election campaign]] team and  had been initially rejected as a candidate by Scottish Labour's controversial [[vetting]] process,&lt;ref&gt;"Holyrood hopeful gets a second chance", The Scotsman, 10 August 1998.
&lt;/ref&gt; eventually becoming the only person to appeal successfully. Despite this rocky start, Deacon  gained respect in the new Parliament and was regarded as one of Labour's most effective performers  - and was tipped as a possible future First Minister.&lt;ref&gt;"Holyrood Health", Sunday Herald magazine, 6 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she won Frontbencher of the Year in the Herald's inaugural Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, and was nominated alongside Donald Dewar and [[Alex Salmond]] for that year's Scottish Politician of the Year accolade.

[[Henry McLeish]] reappointed Deacon as Health Minister when he took over as First Minister following the death of Donald Dewar in November 2000 and she continued until McLeish’s resignation in November 2001. Deacon was offered a further Cabinet position by incoming First Minister [[Jack McConnell]] in November 2001 but, by then pregnant with her second child, decided instead to leave Government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/deacon-pregnancy-forced-me-to-resign-former-health-minister-breaks-silence-1.165924]"Deacon: pregnancy forced me to resign," The Herald, 1 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and go to the [[backbenches]].

During her time as Health Minister, Deacon led major changes in the governance and leadership of the [[National Health Service in Scotland]] and championed reforms in [[child health]], [[mental health]] and [[elderly care|older people's care]]. She was responsible for the first Scottish Health Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/onh/onh-02.htm] Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change, NHS Scotland, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

A critic of the flagship policy of [[Personal care|free personal care]], she argued against its introduction saying future costs were unknown and may not be sustainable – a view rejected by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. She won plaudits for her strong stance against militant [[anti-abortion]] campaigners,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/545829.stm] 'Stalin' jibe over abortions, BBC News. 2 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; though was criticised by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for her position on issues such as [[teenage pregnancy]] and [[contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;"Deacon and Winning at war over sex", The Scotsman, 4 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a backbench MSP, Deacon was regarded as a thoughtful and independent voice, served on several [[Scottish parliamentary committees|Parliamentary Committees]], including Enterprise and Audit.  She co-founded and chaired the Cross Party Group on Sexual Health and was involved in work on reproductive health and HIV/Aids both in the UK and abroad. The only Scottish member of the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|RSA UK]] Commission on Illegal Drugs, Communities and Public Policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thersa.org/projects/past-projects/drugs-commission/drugs-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627215048/http://www.thersa.org/projects/past-projects/drugs-commission/drugs-report |archivedate=27 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} The RSA UK Commission on Illegal Drugs, Communities and Public Policy. Published March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon was a critic of Government [[drugs policy]]. Her opposition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/deacon-defends-rebellion-on-iraq-msp-says-she-is-striking-a-blow-for-honest-and-open-debate-1.125893] "Deacon defends rebellion on Iraq", The Herald, 20 February 2003. Members debate in Scottish Parliament, 13 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Iraq War]] won her support among Labour Party members and the Scottish public, but left relationships strained with parliamentary colleagues. Deacon was re-elected as an MSP in 2003, securing the largest Labour majority in Edinburgh, and had been selected to fight her Edinburgh East and Musselburgh seat again in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 election]] but in August 2006, she announced her decision to stand down from the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/4790113.stm |title=Former minister to leave Holyrood |work=BBC News |date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon said she had had enough of the ‘raw tribalism of party politics’ and that she wanted to 'move on to seek new challenges and to channel my energies in other ways.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article162350.ece] Deacon Blue, Interview with Gillian Bowditch, Sunday Times Ecosse, 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after Parliament==
Deacon stood down from the Scottish Parliament in 2007, later leaving the Labour Party, while continuing to be engaged in wider [[public policy]] debate as an independent commentator. She has spoken widely on strategic leadership and change, arguing for greater co-operation across political and sectoral boundaries and less reliance on 'top-down policies'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qmu.ac.uk/community/QMUpubliclecturesachive]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Can Creativity and Common Sense Prevail? professorial lecture, Royal Society of Edinburgh, 4 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving politics, Deacon has held a portfolio of roles in higher education, business, the public and third sectors and has contributed to a range of governance and policy reviews in various areas of public life.  She was Professor of Social Change at [[Queen Margaret University]], Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/sir-tom-is-set-for-uni-honour-1-1201005/amp |title=Sir Tom is set for uni honour |work=The Scotsman |date=10 April 2007 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2007-2010 and, in 2010, became an Honorary Professor in the School of Social and Political Science, at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. She was Assistant Principal External Relations at the University of Edinburgh from 2012-2018 which involved developing the university's relationships with external stakeholders and encouraging greater collaboration between academia, policymakers and business.

'''Scottish Police Authority''':

In 2017, the Scottish Government announced Deacon's appointment as Chair of the Scottish Police Authority,[http://www.spa.police.uk/news/437924/428620/] the national body charged with oversight of Police Scotland, the UK's second largest police service. The third person to hold the position since the creation of a unified police service for Scotland in 2012. Deacon's appointment was widely welcomed, coming as it did on the back of significant criticism of the body and its previous Chair. Deacon signalled a series of early changes in the Authority including a more transparent and outward facing approach [http://www.spa.police.uk/news/437924/433056/] and the appointment of a number of new Board members [http://www.spa.police.uk/news/451209/].

Since becoming Chair, Deacon has presided over a number of changes in the leadership of Police Scotland. The previous Chief Constable Phil Gormley resigned in February 2017 and a number of new senior officers have since been appointed to the leadership team [http://www.spa.police.uk/news/479933/]. It is anticipated that a new Chief Constable will be announced in August 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6802">'''Water privatization in Algeria''' has been carried out in the country’s four largest cities – [[Algiers]], [[Annaba]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] and [[Oran]] – in 2005-08 through [[management contract]]s. Under a management contract a private company operates a water system for a defined period on behalf of a public authority and is remunerated through a fixed fee as well as a performance-based variable fee. In all four contracts the public partner is the local utility. The local utilities are all jointly owned by the national water holding company Algerienne de l’Eau and the national sanitation holding company ONA, which are both under the authority of the [[Ministry of Water Resources (Algeria)|Ministry of Water Resources]]. The Minister of Water Resources, Abdelmalek Sellal, said in late 2011 that what is fundamental to the management contracts is not so much to ensure 24-hour water supply, but to "instill a new management culture" that regards water "as a commercial good that requires technological know-how and management skills".&lt;ref name="GWI January 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Filou|first=Emilie|title=Algeria perseveres with outsourcing model|newspaper=Global Water Intelligence|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other Algerian cities publicly owned and managed utilities continue to provide water and sanitation services alone without the support of private companies. The government announced that it will decide in September 2012 whether management contracts should also be introduced in [[Setif]], [[Sidi Bel Abbes]] and [[Mostaghanem]].&lt;ref name="GWI January 2012"/&gt;

The [[World Bank]] provided technical assistance for the preparation of the privatization of the water and sanitation systems in Annaba, Constantine and Oran, all of which were awarded after competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maya Khelladi|title=Algeria : Reimbursable Technical Assistance for water sector|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/ALGERIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:21508095~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:312509,00.html|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has not been involved in the preparation of the privatization of Algiers, a contract that has been awarded without competitive bidding.

;Algiers
In November 2005 [[Suez Environnement]] of France was directly awarded a Euro 113 million, 5.5 year-management contract for Algiers. The local contractual partner, the Algiers water and sanitation utility SEAAL, was only created in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministère des Ressources en Eau:Office National d'Assainissement|title=La gestion déléguée|url=http://ona-dz.org/fr/?q=node/142|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government provides US$500m for investments during the period of the management contract. The utility has 460,000 subscribers and 4,400 employees. The objectives of the management contract are to distribute good quality water on a continuous basis, to improve bathing water quality, to rehabilitate infrastructure and to improve customer satisfaction. As of January 2009 the continuity of supply has increased from 16% to 80%, 7 beaches were opened to the public and extensive training has been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suez Environnement / SEAAL|title=An innovative public-private partnership in the  environment sector: THE MANAGEMENT CONTRACT  OF SOCIETE DES EAUX ET DE  L’ASSAINISSEMENT D’ALGER|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTWAT/Resources/4602122-1213366294492/5106220-1234469721549/21.4_Algiers.pdf|publisher=World Bank Water Week|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 continuity reached 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Algérie plus|title=Gestion déléguée de l’eau: résiliation du contrat de la SEATA à Annaba|url=http://www.algerie-plus.com/actualite/gestion-deleguee-de-leau-resiliation-du-contrat-de-la-seata-a-annaba/|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customer satisfaction increased from 70% in 2007 to 89% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Jahn, CEO of SEEAL: SEEAL performance in Algiers:From 8% to 100% 24/7 water supply in 3.5 years, in: Global water summit 2011:Focusing on performance, Global Water Intelligence 2011, p. 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt; The management contract was renewed for another five years and extended to the province of Tipaza in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Echorouk|title=Gestion de l’eau à Alger : contrat renouvelé pour SEAAL|url=http://www.echoroukonline.com/fra/actualite/11372-gestion-de-l%E2%80%99eau-%C3%A0-alger-%3A-contrat-renouvel%C3%A9-pour-seaal.html|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
;Oran
In November 2007 [[Aguas de Barcelona]] from Spain, itself a subsidiary of Suez, was awarded a Euro 30m, 5.5 year-management contract for the city of Oran after competitive bidding. The operator began its work in April 2008. The contractual partner is the water and sanitation utility for Oran, SEAOR.

;Annaba
In December 2007 [[Gelsenwasser]] from Germany was awarded a Euro 50 million 5.5 year- management contract for the city of Annaba. The contractual partner was the water and sanitation utility for the cities of Annaba and [[El Tarf]], SEATA. However, the investment program stalled and the government cancelled the contract in 2010. Gelsenwasser blamed the failure on slow procurement and a lack of means, while the Algerian authorities say the firm lacked the required expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gelsenwasser complains after Algeria contract ended.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gelsenwasser+complains+after+Algeria+contract+ended.-a0256881151|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Constantine
In June 2008 the Société des Eaux de Marseille (SEM) of France, a subsidiary of Suez and [[Veolia]], was awarded a Euro 28m 5.5 year-management contract for Constantine. A first bid had been unsuccessful. SEM had been the sole bidder when the contract was rebid. The contractual partner is the local water and sanitation utility SEACO. In 2010 the government said that SEM was behind schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forum Algérie Monde|title=La Société des Eaux de Marseille risque de perdre la gestion des eaux de Constantine|url=http://www.algerie-monde.com/forums/economie/7127-la-soci%E9t%E9-des-eaux-de-marseille-risque-de-perdre-la-gestion-des-eaux-de-constantine.html|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michel Valin, chief executive of SEACO, union disputes are a major challenge and technical issues are secondary to "getting his growing and increasingly young team to take ownership of the company." &lt;ref name="GWI January 2012"/&gt;

A '''zygote''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ζυγωτός ''zygōtos'' "joined" or "yoked", from ζυγοῦν ''zygoun'' "to join" or "to yoke")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zygote | title=English etymology of zygote | work=etymonline.com | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330174125/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zygote | archivedate=2017-03-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] formed by a [[fertilization]] event between two [[gametes]]. The zygote's [[genome]] is a combination of the DNA in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. In single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by [[mitosis]] to produce identical offspring.

[[Oscar Hertwig]] and [[Richard Hertwig]] made some of the first discoveries on animal zygote formation.

== Fungi ==

In fungi, the sexual fusion of haploid cells is called [[karyogamy]]. The result of karyogamy is the formation of a diploid cell called zygote or zygospore. This cell may then enter meiosis or mitosis depending on the life cycle of the species.

== Plants ==

In plants, the zygote may be [[Ploidy#Polyploidy|polyploid]] if fertilization occurs between meiotically unreduced gametes.

In [[embryophyte|land plants]], the zygote is formed within a chamber called the [[archegonium]].  In seedless plants, the archegonium is usually flask-shaped, with a long hollow neck through which the sperm cell enters. As the zygote divides and grows, it does so inside the archegonium.

== Humans ==
In human fertilization, a released ovum (a haploid secondary oocyte with replicate chromosome copies) and a haploid [[sperm]] cell ([[male]] gamete)—combine to form a single [[Ploidy|2n diploid]] cell called the zygote. Once the single sperm enters the oocyte, it completes the division of the second meiosis forming a haploid daughter with only 23 chromosomes, almost all of the cytoplasm, and the sperm in its own pronucleus.  The other product of meiosis is the second polar body with only chromosomes but no ability to replicate or survive. In the fertilized daughter, DNA is then replicated in the two separate pronuclei derived from the sperm and ovum, making the zygote's chromosome number temporarily [[Ploidy|4n diploid]]. After approximately 30 hours from the time of fertilization, fusion of the pronuclei and immediate mitotic division produce two [[Ploidy|2n diploid]] daughter cells called [[blastomere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69084/blastomere Blastomere  Encyclopædia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928075445/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69084/blastomere |date=2013-09-28 }}. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the stages of [[fertilization]] and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], the developing human is a ''preimplantation [[conceptus]]''. There is some dispute about whether this conceptus should no longer be referred to as an [[embryo]], but should now be referred to as an [[Proembryo#Preembryo in context of human development|proembryo]], which is terminology that traditionally has been used to refer to plant life. Some ethicist and legal scholars make the argument that it is incorrect to call the conceptus an ''embryo'', because it will later differentiate into both intraembryonic and extraembryonic tissues,&lt;ref&gt;Larsen's Human Embryology. 4th Ed. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and can even split to produce multiple embryos (identical twins). Others have pointed out that so-called extraembryonic tissues are really part of the embryo's body that are no longer used after birth (much as milk teeth fall out after childhood). Further, as the process of the embryo splits to form identical twins – leaving the original tissues intact – a new embryo is generated, rendering it no different from the process of cloning an adult human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Condic|first1=Maureen L.|title=Totipotency: What It Is And What It Is Not|journal=Stem Cells and Development|date=14 April 2014|pmc=3991987|pmid=24368070|doi=10.1089/scd.2013.0364|volume=23|pages=796–812}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the National Institutes of Health has made the determination that the traditional classification of pre-implantation embryo is still correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ospp.od.nih.gov/pdf/Volume1_revised.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130185105/http://ospp.od.nih.gov/pdf/VOLUME1_REVISED.PDF |archivedate=2009-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/martini10/chapter28/custom3/deluxe-content.html "Human Development"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153852/http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/martini10/chapter28/custom3/deluxe-content.html |date=July 22, 2011 }}. ''Embryology Atlas''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the processes of compaction, cell division, and blastulation, the conceptus takes the form of the [[blastocyst]] by the fifth day of development, just as it approaches the site of implantation.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Susan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2y6zOSQcn14C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=zygote&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=lwCTSf_4EoTOlQT4zdClAg#PPA80,M1 Maternal, Fetal, &amp; Neonatal Physiology,]'' p. 80 (Elsevier Health Sciences 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; When the blastocyst hatches from the [[zona pellucida]], it can implant in the endometrial lining of the uterus and begin the embryonic stage of development.

The human zygote has been genetically edited in experiments designed to cure inherited diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/article/editing-human-germline-cells-sparks-ethics-debate Human zygote edited genetically] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518191952/https://www.sciencenews.org/article/editing-human-germline-cells-sparks-ethics-debate |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other species ==

A ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'' zygote contains chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from both parents; such cells are generally rare, since normally cpDNA is inherited uniparentally from the mt+ mating type parent. These rare biparental zygotes allowed mapping of chloroplast genes by recombination.

==In protozoa ==

In the [[amoeba]], reproduction occurs by cell division of the parent cell: first the nucleus of the parent divides into two and then the cell membrane also cleaves, becoming two "daughter" Amoebae.
