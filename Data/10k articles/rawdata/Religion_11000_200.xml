'''''Bayʿah''''' ({{lang-ar|بَيْعَة}}, Pledge of allegiance"), in [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terminology]], is an [[oath of allegiance]] to a leader. It is known to have been practiced by the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. ''Bayʿah'' is sometimes taken under a written pact given on behalf of the subjects by leading members of the tribe with the understanding that as long as the leader abides by certain requirements towards his people, they are to maintain their allegiance to him. ''Bayʿah'' is still practiced in countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-77384488.html THE IMPASSE IN THE CIVIL WAR], [[Arab Studies Quarterly]], Lesch, Ann M., March 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Morocco]], ''bayʿah'' is one of the foundations of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|monarchy]]. 

== In Islamic history ==
The tradition of ''bayʿah'' can be traced back to the era of Muhammad. From the beginning bayʿah was taken by Muhammad as an oath of allegiance. Anybody who wanted to join the Islamic community did so by reciting the basic statement of the faith expressing his faith in the oneness of God and the [[prophethood]] of Muhammad. However, this differed from the proclamation of faith necessary to simply become a Muslim. In addition to this the prophet formally took bayʿah from the people and tribes. Through this formal act they entered the [[Ummah|Islamic community]] and showed their willingness to follow and obey Muhammad. The wordings of the oath differ in different traditions but it contains the ''[[shahada]]'' and prayers of repentance.

It is reported that at the occasion of annual gatherings outside [[Mecca]], Muhammad met people from Yathrib, later to be renamed [[Medina]], who accepted his call towards Islam. Muhammad then took ''bayʿah'' from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|title=Perspectives on the Security of Singapore: The First 50 Years|date=2015|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Qur'an ==
[[File:Bay'ah Ceremony of the Commanders of Islamic Revolution Committees with Ali Khamenei, 8 June 1989 (video).webm|thumb|Bay'ah Ceremony of the Commanders of [[Islamic Revolution Committees]] with Ali Khamenei, 8 June 1989]]

After the [[Pledge of the Tree]], which led to the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], the following was revealed in the [[Qur'an]] commemorating and appreciating the pledge and those who made it:

{{Quote|Certainly [[Allah]] was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity on them and rewarded them with a near victory, |[[Sura]] [[Al-Fath]], [[Ayah]] 18|{{Cite quran|48|18|s=r|t=s}}}}

=== History ===
The ''bay'ah'' of Rizwan, a collective initiation of thousands of Muslims at the hand of Muhammad, is mentioned in the Qur'an. The tradition was continued by the [[caliph]]s.

In subsequent ages, it was associated with [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders, and spiritual masters would initiate their followers. The practice still exists in Sufi orders around the world.

'''Bob Fu''' ({{zh|c=傅希秋|p=Fù Xīqiū}}) is a Chinese American pastor.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; He is the founder and president since 2002 of [[China Aid]], which provides [[legal aid]] to [[Christianity in China|Christians in China]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Bob Fu was born in [[Shandong]] in 1968 and studied [[English literature]] at [[Liaocheng University]] in the 1980s. He converted to Christianity after an American teacher gave him a biography of a Chinese Christian convert.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; After his studies, Fu taught English at the [[Central Party School of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]] in Beijing while participating in the [[house church]] movement.&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt; In 1996, Bob Fu and his family emigrated to Hong Kong and then the United States, after his wife became pregnant without the government permission to have a child.&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt; Fu founded the China Aid Association in [[Philadelphia]] in 2002 and also had a daughter named Tracy Fu, but moved its headquarters to [[Midland, Texas]] in 2004 and had another daughter named Melissa Fu.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Fu is also known for his role in helping negotiate [[barefoot lawyer]] [[Chen Guangcheng]]'s immigration to the United States; in this sense, has been described as a "liaison" between oppressed groups in China and foreign governments or media that can help them.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Fu Xiqiu was born in 1968 in [[Shandong]] province and started studying [[English literature]] at [[Liaocheng University]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; During his time at university, Fu engaged in political activism&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-china-usa-chinaaid-idUSBRE8420Y620120503|title=Texas pastor drives support for Chinese dissident|first=Chris|last=Baltimore|location=Midland, Texas|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started the process of joining the [[Communist Party of China]], with the intention of becoming a government official.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; His American professors would preach to students from a pocket bible after class.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/14/jesus_loves_china_too|title=Jesus Loves China, Too: Why I'm working to save my homeland, one soul at a time|first=Bob|last=Fu|date=2012-05-14|work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fu organized a group of students from his university to participate in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in Beijing. When he returned to Shandong, he was investigated but not detained, and ultimately decided not to join the Party.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; That year, an American English teacher gave him a biography of [[Xi Shengmo]], a 19th-century Chinese Christian convert.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; After reading the book, Fu decided to convert to Christianity as well.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

After completing his studies, Fu taught English at the [[Central Party School of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]] in Beijing while his wife Bochun Cai (b. 1966) studied at the [[Renmin University of China]].&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt; The couple evangelized widely, starting a campus church and secret [[bible school]] in [[Fangshan District]], Beijing.&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt; On May 9, 1996, the couple was detained for running a Christian training center in [[Fangshan District]], Beijing&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/080/1996/en/ |title=Document - People's Republic of China: Women in China: Detained, victimized but mobilized |date=July 1996 |publisher= Amnesty International |access-date=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for illegal evangelizing.&lt;ref name="PH"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.philly.com/1998-11-15/living/25732745_1_persecution-prayer-international-day |title=In Memory of Persecution Today Is The Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church Abroad.

Authorities said that Fu could keep his job and stay in the dormitory at the Communist Party school, and would not have to pay any fines.&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/article/167833/christians-freed-good-health |title= Christians freed in 'good health' |first=Daniel |last=Kwan |date=2012-07-14 |accessdate= 2013-06-23 |work= South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration and activism===
That same year, Fu's wife became pregnant in violation of the [[one-child policy]]. Rather than face the penalty, they emigrated to the then-British colony of Hong Kong, where Cai gave birth to Daniel Fu ({{zh|c=傅博恩|p=Fù Bó'ēn|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; The [[National Association of Evangelicals]] successfully lobbied the Clinton White House to get Fu [[political asylum]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt; where he immigrated in 1997, settling in [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; and attending nearby [[Westminster Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; In July 1998, Fu and Cai moved to neighboring [[Glenside, Pennsylvania]] to live with another Chinese family in a house purchased by an anonymous donor. They adopted the names "Bob" and "Heidi" at this time.&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt;

Fu founded the [[evangelism|evangelical]]&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; China Aid Association in 2002 in response to a crackdown on the [[Hubei]]-based unauthorized "South China Church" ({{zh|s=华南教会|p=Huánán Jiàohuì|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/04/30/11474717-who-is-fu-chinese-exile-is-gods-double-agent? |title=Who is Fu?

Fu has also taught at [[Oklahoma Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frc.org/university/freedom-and-christianity-in-china "Family Research Council: Freedom and Christianity in China"], 24 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/chinelgo36&amp;div=39&amp;id=&amp;page= 36 Chinese L. &amp; Gov't 1 (2003)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midland operations===
After being invited to visit [[Midland, Texas]] by a fellow pastor, he moved his operations there in 2004.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fu maintains "close association with Republicans and evangelical Christians".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/us/bob-fu-echoing-out-of-texas-is-a-chinese-voice-of-dissent.html?pagewanted=all|title=Echoing Out of Texas, Chinese Voice of Dissent for Religious Freedom|first=Andrew|last=Jacobs|date=2012-05-12|accessdate=2013-06-23|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has prayed in English in American churches, and has cultivated contacts in evangelical groups in Texas.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/21/153214450/for-chinese-dissidents-exile-can-mean-irrelevancy|title=For Chinese Dissidents, Exile Can Mean Irrelevancy|first=Michele|last=Kelemen|date=2012-05-21|accessdate=2013-06-23|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Fu arranged for Republican House representative [[Frank Wolf (Virginia)|Frank Wolf]] to meet with an unauthorized house church leader in China.&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; In 2009, Fu persuaded the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to grant asylum to the family of [[Gao Zhisheng]], a lawyer known for his defense of house Christians and other sensitive groups.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

In May 2012, Fu translated legal activist [[Chen Guangcheng]]'s appeal to travel to the US in a special [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] convened by representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (R-NJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hXOIxK9aPKYbBk3oTp_PxmVTjYxw?docId=CNG.b41219a01c75702af77de6bda6b28c4d.31|title=China activist pleads for help in call to US lawmakers|first=Michael|last=Mathes|date=2012-05-13|accessdate=2013-06-23|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fu criticized President [[Barack Obama]] of "abandoning" Chen for his handling of the case.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In America, [[New York University]] technicians mistakenly announced that they had found spyware installed on an [[iPad]] and [[iPhone]] that Fu gifted to Chen via his wife Heidi Cai.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Friends Like These: How a Famed Chinese Dissident Got Caught Up in America's Culture Wars |first=Jonathan |last=Allen |publisher= Reuters |location=New York |date=2013-11-25}} Accessed 2013-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen accused Fu of giving Chen a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] "enabl[ing Fu] to monitor his communications secretly", although Fu denied this, saying his technicians only installed [[Skype]] for Chen.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/world/asia/chinese-advocates-devices-were-loaded-with-spyware-nyu-says.html |title=Devices Given to Chinese Legal Advocate Had Tracking Spyware, N.Y.U. Says |first=Andrew |last=Jacobs |work=The New York Times |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate= 2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen and NYU later rescinded these accusations, which they said was based on a misunderstanding of the technology, and clarified that iPad and iPhone given to Mr. Chen by China Aid did not contain spyware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/8202073318.html "New York University, Jerome Cohen and ChinaAid, Bob Fu Release Joint Statement Regarding the Spyware Controversy"], 9 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China Aid==
According to Bob Fu, the China Aid Association aims to "spiritually and legally [equip]" Chinese people "to defend their faith and freedom",&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; with legal reforms ultimately "softening the soil for the Gospel" in China.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; The organization's 2010 tax listing lists its purpose as raising funds to pay the legal funds of indicted Christians in China.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The foundation funds [[house church]]es in China which dissent from the official [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement|Protestant]] and [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Catholic]] churches of China. To this end, it publishes a house church magazine with a distribution of 80,000 in China.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; It also provides money, training, and [[pen pal]] programs to Chinese religious leaders and their families.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Constable"/&gt; As a matter of policy, it opposes [[forced abortion]]s and [[compulsory sterilization]]s.&lt;ref name="Constable"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bob-fu-once-obscure-crusader-of-rights-in-china-is-now-famous-for-helping-dissident-chen-guangcheng/2012/05/02/gIQAz8lYxT_story.html|title=Bob Fu, once obscure crusader of rights in China, is now famous for helping dissident Chen Guangcheng|first=Pamela|last=Constable|date=2012-05-02|accessdate=2013-06-23|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, China Aid received $1.28 million in contributions and grants and $84,741 in other funds. Their staff consisted of 15 paid employees and 40 volunteers.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Two years later in 2012, China Aid had a budget of $1.5 million; offices in Midland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles; and a full-time staff of "dozens" in China and more than six in America.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/05/nation/la-na-bob-fu-20120506|title=Texas pastor a key player in Chen Guangcheng case|date=2012-05-05|accessdate=2013-06-23|first=Molly|last=Hennessy-Fiske|first2=Richard|last2=Simon|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization runs an annual China Aid gala at the Midland Country Club, which raised $400,000 in 2012.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Most of the money comes from Midland oil and gas industry donors; in relative terms, China Aid does not receive much support from the Chinese American community.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The oil town was the childhood home of [[George W. Bush]] and houses many evangelical [[pressure group]]s that advocate on behalf of Christians in non-Christian countries like [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; Many residents are on the board of China Aid.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The '''Bodh people''', also known as '''Bhot''',{{sfn|Bhasin|Singh|Walter|Bhardwaj|1983|p=16}} are an ethnic group of [[Himachal Pradesh]], India. They are found in [[Lahaul tehsil]], [[Lahaul and Spiti district]],{{sfn|Singh|Bhasin|Singh|2008|p=193}} predominantly in the [[Bhaga valley|Bhaga]] and [[Chandra valley]]s, but also to a lesser extent in [[Pattani valley]],{{sfn|Bhasin|Singh|Walter|Bhardwaj|1983|p=16}} Miyar Valley, in the upper reaches of [[Pangi, Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Paddar]] valley, [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

&lt;!--"Bodhs converse with one another in their mother tongue Lahauli dialect or Pattani dialect" (Bhasin 1983:16). not sure which one this is.--&gt;

==Art &amp; Craft in Himachal==
The art and craft of any region is a reflection of its environment,people and traditions. This statement is apt for Negi and Bodh tribes of Himachal Pradesh,which borrows elements from its scenic surroundings to create “pahari” jewellery,breathing a sense of rigour and sturdiness.

While some communities have unique traditions, some ornaments are common to all. These include neck ornaments are common to all. These include neck ornaments like hansli or small pendants called toke and the most cherished necklaces called the coin necklaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">'''Charlotta Roos''', née Wrangel (1771-1809) was a Swedish [[mediumship|medium]].

She was the daughter of the lieutenant and noble Henrik Herman Wrangel and Fredrika Philp. In 1791, she married the rich brewer and [[Swedenborgian]]ist  [[Sven Roos]] (1746-1798), in and in 1803, she married her cousin, lieutenant Wilhelm Philp (1777-1808).

Roos had a reputation for being able to predict the future, which was fashionable during the reign of [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and she made some predictions which attracted attention. In 1791, she predicted misfortune to King Gustav III, something he reportedly referred to on his death bed after the assassination by [[Jacob Johan Anckarström]] in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand (1913). Spåkvinnor och trollkarlar. Minne och anteckningar från Gustav III:s Stockholm (Andra upplagan). [Fortune tellers and magicians. Memory and notes from the Stockholm of Gustav III] Stockholm: Hugo Gebers Förlag. ISBN p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;  Roos and her spouse made an attempt to profit economically on her talent. They traveled to Paris in France, where they founded a ''Bureau d'Esprit à sa maniére'' with the intention to summon [[spirit]]s. In 1797, they returned to Sweden as, according to [[Carl Christoffer Gjörwell Sr.]], the spirits were not "inclined to arouse success in the now so carnal France".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Forsstrand (1913). Spåkvinnor och trollkarlar. Minne och anteckningar från Gustav III:s Stockholm (Andra upplagan). [Fortune tellers and magicians. Memory and notes from the Stockholm of Gustav III] Stockholm: Hugo Gebers Förlag. ISBN p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotta Roos were, as her spouse, a [[Swedenborgian]]. At the birth of her son, Jean Egalité, there were a conflict with the Swedish Lutheran Church and the Roos couple as to how the son should be baptized to satisfy the needs of both the church as well as the spiritual convictions of the parents.

The '''Christian film industry''' is an [[umbrella term]] for films containing a [[Christianity|Christian]] themed message or moral, produced by Christian filmmakers to a Christian audience, and films produced by non-Christians with Christian audiences in mind. They are often interdenominational films, but can also be films targeting a specific denomination of Christianity.

Popular [[mainstream]] studio productions of films with strong Christian messages or Biblical stories, like ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', ''[[The Book of Eli]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidemovies.moviefone.com/2010/01/15/book-of-eli-christian-messages-themes-audiences/ |title=Will Christian Audiences Embrace Denzel's 'Book of Eli'? |last=Chen |first=Sandie Angulo |date=January 15, 2010 |work=[[Moviefone]] |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]'' and ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'', are not specifically part of the Christian film industry, being more agnostic about their audiences' religious beliefs. These films generally also have a much higher budget, production values and better known film stars, and are received more favourably with film critics.

Many films from the Christian film industry are produced by openly confessing [[Christians]] in independent companies mainly targeting a Christian audience. This has been on the rise since the success of [[Sherwood Pictures]]' ''[[Fireproof (film)|Fireproof]]'',{{citation needed|reason=The following clause cites a source behind a paywall, but it couldn't possibly verify this content as it date from less than four months after the film's release.|date=July 2017}} which was the highest grossing [[independent film]] of [[2008 in film|2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123249904737100583 |title=What Christians Watch |last=Buss |first=Dale |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''[[Fireproof (film)|Fireproof]]'' may have been due in part to a door opened by the box office success of ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:Wymondham magic lantern.jpg|thumb|left|Magic lantern at the [[Wymondham]] Museum.]]
Before the invention of the [[movie projector]], European audiences gathered in darkened rooms to watch [[Magic lantern (projector)|magic lantern]] presentations. Catholic priest [[Athanasius Kircher]] promoted the magic lantern by publishing the book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' in 1680.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vermeir |first=Koen |title=The magic of the magic lantern (1660–1700) |publisher=Catholic University of Leuven |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=307142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy soon followed as priests and masons used the lanterns "to persuade followers of their ability to control both the forces of darkness and enlightenment" and temperance groups used the lanterns to fight alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herlihy |first=Patricia |title=The Alcoholic Empire: Vodka &amp; Politics in Late Imperial Russia |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=December 12, 2002 |pages=20 |isbn=0-19-516095-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VGpaXkYsukC&amp;pg=PA3#v=snippet&amp;q=alcoholism%20magic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s, missionaries such as David Livingston used the lanterns to present the Gospel in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Silvester C. |title=David Livingstone |publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |date=May 5, 2006 |pages=76 |isbn=1-4254-9628-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcYe5wFziLoC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=magic%20lantern}}&lt;/ref&gt; After movie theaters emerged, magic lanterns lost their popularity and disappeared from the public.

Throughout the late 19th and into the 20th century, there was much dispute among Christians as to "Christian film". Many thought motion picture was creating a [[Idolatry|graven image]], and shunned having anything to do with the film industry. Through the years, however, many Christians began to utilize motion picture for their own purposes.&lt;ref name="Sanctuary"/&gt; [[Herbert Booth]], as part of the [[Salvation Army]], claimed to be the first user of film for the cause of Christianity, in 1899.&lt;ref name="Sanctuary"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindvall |first=Terry |title=Sanctuary Cinema: Origins of the Christian Film Industry |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |date=February 12, 200 7|pages=56–57 |isbn=0-8147-5210-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, the Protestant Church encouraged film from the early 20th century, with Congregational minister, the Reverend Herbert Jump writing his influential pamphlet, The Religious Possibilities of the Motion Pictures, in 1910.

By the 1940s a renaissance of Christian filmmaking occurred as recorded by Andrew Quicke and Terry Lindvall in Celluloid Sermons: The Emergence of the Christian Film Industry, 1930-1986 (New York University Press, 2011), the sequel to Sanctuary Cinema.

=== 20th century ===
In the 1940s, Christian film libraries emerged. Christian businessmen interested in renting audio visual materials started libraries to rent films to churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christianmovies.com/article_details.php?article_id=5&amp;osCsid=76e3bm5jdrhu72lg9ti5gkc2g7/ | title=A HISTORY AND OVERVIEW OF CHRISTIAN FILMS | accessdate=2010-01-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey W. Marks started the Visual Aid Center in 1945. Circa 1968, Harry Bristow launched Christian Cinema in a small theater in the Germantown area of Philadelphia, and in the early '70s, the ministry moved to a theater in Ambler, Pennsylvania. Christian Cinema operated a movie theater that showed only Christian films, but closed down in the mid 1990s. The growth of Christian film libraries led to the Christian Film Distributors Association (CFDA) being formed in 1974. The CFDA began holding a conference each year for Christian filmmakers and distributors. The Christian Film and Video Association (formerly the Christian Film Distribution Association) gave out Crown Awards for films that "gloried Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kintz |first=Linda |author2=Julia Lesage |page=194 |title=Media, Culture, and the Religious Right |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |date=April 1998 |isbn=0-8166-3085-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 [[Ken Anderson (filmmaker)|Ken Anderson]], editor for a [[Youth for Christ]] magazine, decided to form a small Christian film studio. An old shut-down dancehall was purchased and moved onto some donated land to become the first home for [[Gospel Films]], which grew into the largest Christian film distributor. Seeing the potential of Christian films, the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] created [[World Wide Pictures]] as a subsidiary in 1951 to produce and distribute Christian films. Throughout the '50s and '60s Christian films were produced with increasing professionalism and ads for Christian films often appeared in magazines such as ''[[Christianity Today]]''.  A year earlier, the [[Protestant Film Commission]] began a series of non-theatrical feature films intended for rental to churches and other, related organizations.  [[Chapel Films]], servicing Catholic interests with feature and short subjects, already dated back to the 1930s.

=== Movie theaters and film festivals ===
Since ''[[The Great Commandment]]'' opened in movie theaters in 1941, many Christian filmmakers have attempted to pursue theatrical releases. World Wide Pictures was a pioneer in partnering with churches to bring Christian films to the cinema. Gateway Films (now [[Gateway Films/Vision Video]]) was "formed with the express purpose of communicating the Christian Gospel in the secular motion picture theaters" and released ''[[The Cross and the Switchblade]]'' in 1972. In 1979, the ''[[Jesus (1979 film)|Jesus]]'' film appeared in theaters across the United States. This film, based on the [[Gospel of Luke]], was made for $6 million by [[Campus Crusade for Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/movies/baptism-by-celluloid.html |title=Baptism by Celluloid |last=Foer |first=Franklin |date=February 8, 2004 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian films have been released to theaters since that time, such as ''[[The Omega Code]]'' (1999), ''[[Megiddo: The Omega Code 2]]'' (2001), ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004), ''[[Facing the Giants]]'' (2006), ''[[The Ultimate Gift]]'' (2007), ''[[Amazing Grace (2006 film)|Amazing Grace]]'' (2007), ''[[Fireproof (film)|Fireproof]]'' (2008), ''[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' (2008), ''[[The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry]]'' (2009), ''[[To Save a Life]]'' (2010), ''[[Preacher's Kid (film)|Preacher's Kid]]'' (2010), ''[[Letters to God]]'' (2010), ''[[What If... (film)|What If...]]'' (2010), ''[[The Grace Card]]'' (2011), ''[[Soul Surfer (film)|Soul Surfer]]'' (2011), ''[[Courageous (film)|Courageous]]'' (2011), ''[[October Baby]]'' (2012), ''[[Home Run (film)|Home Run]]'' (2013), ''[[Grace Unplugged]]'' (2013), ''[[I'm in Love with a Church Girl]]'' (2013), ''[[Son of God (film)|Son of God]]'' (2014), ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]]'' (2014), ''[[Persecuted (film)|Persecuted]]'' (2014), ''[[Old Fashioned (film)|Old Fashioned]]'' (2015), ''[[Do You Believe? (film)|Do You Believe?]]'' (2015), ''[[War Room (film)|War Room]]'' (2015), ''[[Beyond the Mask]]'' (2015), and ''[[Risen (2016 film)|Risen]]'' (2016).

In 1993, Tom Saab launched the [[Merrimack Valley Christian Film Festival]] in [[Salem, New Hampshire]]. Each year this festival is held during [[Easter]] week and draws an audience of thousands to a theater to watch Christian films for free. Saab's organization Christian Film Festivals of America has also presented film festivals in [[Salinas, California]] and [[Orlando, Florida]]. In October 1999, the Voice of Pentecost Church in San Francisco hosted the 1st Annual [[WYSIWYG Film Festival]]. Other Christian film festivals include [[San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival]], [[168 Hour Film Project]], and the [[Redemptive Film Festival]].

=== Recent years ===
[[File:ChristianCinema.png|thumb|right|[[ChristianCinema.com]] is a website that lists movies related to Christianity.]]
In 2006, nearly 50 Christian-faith films were produced. The films grossed an average $39 million. All five of the major Hollywood studios have created marketing departments to target the growing demand for faith-based and family fare. ''Movieguide'' publisher [[Ted Baehr]] said, "There is competition for the Christian audience now that there hasn't been before. I thought at some point it would level off, but so far it's getting bigger and bigger. It's more than I could have possibly imagined. One of the audiences that has become stable and even grown for books, music and movies is the Christian audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/030507dnentholyhollywood.26a80a.html |title=Hollywood makes room for holiness |date=March 8, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of Christian movies and Christian films has led to the establishment of many online retailers that focus their business exclusively on the sale and distribution of Christian movies online and family-friendly films such as Parables.tv, FishFlix.com, ChristianCinema.com and ChristianMovies.com. [[Parables TV]] also provides streaming and linear TV. In 2013, FishFlix.com opened the first ever DVD store devoted completely to Christian DVDs in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/religion/tulsa-physician-with-roots-in-turkey-sells-christian-movies/article_8892f34d-f8ca-562c-8e29-ed6bdc5acf77.html |title=Tulsa physician with roots in Turkey sells Christian movies |date=November 23, 2013 |work=[[Tulsa World]] |publisher=''[[Tulsa World]]'' |accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 film ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]]'' is one of the all-time most successful independent Christian films&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/gods-not-dead-3-is-in-the-works-says-actor-producer-david-ar-white-interview-172138/|title='God's Not Dead 3' Is in the Works, Says Actor-Producer David AR White (Interview)|author=Jeannie Law|publisher=''[[The Christian Post]]''|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 film ''[[War Room (film)|War Room]]'' became a [[List of 2015 box office number-one films in the United States|Box Office number-one film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simanton |first=Keith |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4102&amp;p=.htm |title=Weekend Report -'War Room' Walks to #1 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=2015-09-06 |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vox (website)|Vox]], "most of the shows and movies that incorporated religion in 2016 positioned it not as an add-on to life that a person could take or leave, but rather as a system of beliefs among and overlapping with other systems of beliefs, whether political, national, or ideological".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/14/13899722/religion-tv-movies-2016-sausage-party-silence-innocents-americans-rectify|title=How 2016's movies and TV reflected Americans’ changing relationship with religion|author=Alissa Wilkinson| work = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian film in Africa ==

=== South Africa ===
Faith-based, family-values films are popular in [[South Africa]] due to its predominantly Christian audience. ''[[Faith Like Potatoes]]'', Regardt van den Bergh's feature film biopic of [[Angus Buchan]], a farmer turned preacher, bolted the genre{{clarify|date=January 2014}} when it was released in South Africa in 2006. When [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the film in April in the U.S., it sold more than 230,000 DVDs in the first three months, making it one of the top-selling DVDs in the Christian market.

=== Nigeria ===
Nigerian Christians are actively contributing to the booming Nigerian film industry known as [[Nollywood]]. Christian films makes up about 20% of Nigerian films. Independent companies, ministries, and large churches producing hundreds of Christian films often see themselves as an alternative to Nollywood. Nevertheless, they have participated in mainstream success and many of the films appear on [[Nigerian Television Authority|state television channels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/november/7.17.html |title=Nigeria: Christian Movie Capital of the World |last=Zylstra |first=Sarah Eekhoff |date=October 27, 2009 |work=[[Christianity Today]] |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Redeemed Christian Church of God]] founded Dove Studios, which has become the country's biggest movie studio and distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/26/church-movies.html|title=Nigerian church transforms into movie mogul |date=March 26, 2006|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50,000 copies of their movies were sold before April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=20963&amp;sec=75&amp;cont=3 |title=Redeemed Church Takes Nollywood by Storm |last=Murphy |first=Brian |date=March 25, 2006 |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=WorldWide Religious News |accessdate=October 30, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel Film Festival (GOFESTIVAL) is also a major Nigeria film attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernghana.com/movie/4613/3/gofestival-2009-media-unveil-in-ibadan.html |title=A Celebration of Gospel Cinematic Excellence |last=Stephen |first=Alayande |date=April 21, 2009 |work=The News |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Ganga dynasty''' or '''Chodaganga dynasty'''&lt;ref&gt;The Second Pandyan empire, A.D. 1190–1312 by A.J. Thinakaran, 1987, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; was a medieval Indian dynasty that reigned from [[Odisha|Kalinga]]  from the 11th century to the early 15th century. The territory ruled by the dynasty consisted of the whole of the modern-day [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]] as well as parts of [[West Bengal]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Chhattisgarh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-225335/Ganga-dynasty Ganga Dynasty] britannica.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110030546/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-225335/Ganga-dynasty |date=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early rulers of the dynasty ruled from Dantapura; the capital was later moved to [[Kalinganagara]] (modern Mukhalingam), and ultimately to [[Kataka (city)|Kataka]] (modern Cuttack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B.

The dynasty was founded by King [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]], son of Rajaraja Devendravarman and grandson of Vajrahasta of the Imperial Gangas of [[Kalinganagara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Itihas, Volumes 19-22|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Andhra Historical Society, Volumes 6-7|author=Andhra Historical Research Society, Rajahmundry, Madras|publisher=Andhra Historical Research Society., 1931|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Culture: Journal of the Indian Research Institute, Volume 12|author=Indian Research Institute|publisher=I.B.

The rulers of Eastern Ganga dynasty defended their kingdom from the constant attacks of the [[Muslim]] rulers. This kingdom prospered through trade and commerce and the wealth was mostly used in the construction of temples. The rule of the dynasty came to an end under the reign of King Bhanudeva IV (1414–34), in the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Journal/Journal2/pdf/ohrj-03.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410142527/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Journal/Journal2/pdf/ohrj-03.pdf |date=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the fall of [[Mahameghavahana dynasty]], [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] was divided into different kingdoms under feudatory chiefs. Each of these chiefs bore the title Kalingadhipathi (Lord of Kalinga). The beginnings of what became the Eastern Ganga dynasty came about when Indravarma I defeated the [[Vishnukundin]] king, Indrabhattaraka and established his rule over the region with Kalinganagara (or [[Mukhalingam]]) as his capital, and [[Dantapura]] as a secondary capital. The Ganga kings assumed various titles viz. ''Trikalingadhipathi'' or ''Sakala Kalingadhipathi'' (Lord of three Kalinga or all three Kalingas namely [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] proper (South), [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] (North), and [[Western Odisha|Kosala]] (West)).

[[Mukhalingam]] near [[Srikakulam]] of Andhra Pradesh bordering Odisha has been identified as Kalinganagara, the capital of the early Eastern Gangas.&lt;ref name=sen/&gt;

After the decline of the early Eastern Gangas reign, the [[Chalukya]]s of [[Vengi]] took control of the region. Vajrahastha I, a descendant of the early Eastern Ganga dynasty took advantage of the internal strife and revived the power of the Ganga dynasty. It was during their rule that [[Shaivism]] took precedence over [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. The magnificent Srimukhalingam Temple at [[Mukhalingam]] was built during this period.

In the 11th century, the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] brought the Ganga Kingdom under their rule.&lt;ref name=sen/&gt;

===Intermarriage===
The Eastern Gangas were known to have intermarried with the [[Chola]]s as well as [[Chalukya]]s. The early state of the dynasty may have started from the early 8th century.

===Anantavarman Chodaganga===
[[File:PURI JAGANATHA TEMPLE, PURI, ORISSA, INDIA, ASIA.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jagannath_Temple,_Puri|Jagannath Temple]] at [[Puri]], built by [[Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva|Maharaja Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva]].]]
The dynasty was founded by [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]]. He is believed to have ruled from the [[Ganges River]] in the north to the [[Godavari River]] in the south, thus laying the foundation of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. Also during his rule, the great [[Jagannath_Temple,_Puri|Jagannath Temple]] at [[Puri]] was built.&lt;ref name=sen/&gt; He assumed the title of Trikalingadhipathi (ruler of the three [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s which comprise [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] proper, [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] north and [[Western Odisha|Koshala]] west) in 1076 CE, resulting in him being the first to rule all three divisions of Kalinga.&lt;ref name="india1"/&gt;

===Intrudes===
Rajaraja III ascended the throne in 1198 and did nothing to resist the Muslims of Bengal, who invaded Orissa in 1206. Rajaraja's son Anangabhima III, however, repulsed the Muslims and built the temple of Megheshvara at Bhuvaneshvara. [[Narasimhadeva I]], the son of Anangabhima, invaded southern Bengal in 1243, defeated its Muslim ruler, captured the capital ([[Gauḍa region|Gauda]]), and built the Sun Temple at Konark to commemorate his victory. With the death of Narasimha in 1264, the Eastern Gangas began to decline; the sultan of Delhi invaded Odisha in 1324, and [[Musunuri Nayaks]]{{cn|date=May 2018}} defeated the Odishan powers in 1356. Narasimha IV, the last known king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, ruled until 1425. The "mad king," Bhanudeva IV, who succeeded him, left no inscriptions; his minister Kapilendra usurped the throne and founded the Suryavamsha dynasty in 1434–35.

===Legacy===
The Eastern Gangas were great patrons of religion and the arts, and the temples of the Ganga period rank among the masterpieces of [[Hindu architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/225335/Ganga-dynasty Ganga dynasty (Indian dynasties) - Encyclopædia Britannica].

'''The Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Moldova (ELCRM)''' (unofficial English translation; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Евангелическо-лютеранская церковь в Республике Молдова (ЕЛЦРМ)) is a small [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church body in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]]. Reverend Vladimir Moser is the superintendent of the ELCRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lutheran.md/ |title=Data|website=lutheran.md}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Lutheran Church in Moldova has its roots in the 18th century.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In 1994 Natalia and Vladimir Moser, with a group of German Lutheran families, started to rebuild the Lutheran church in Moldova. In 1997 Vladimir Moser was ordained and appointed as a preacher of the Lutheran congregation in [[Tiraspol]]. Moser founded congregations in [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]], [[Chișinău]], [[Rîbnița]], and [[Camenca]]. In the spring of 1999, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Moldova was registered formally with the Moldovan authorities.&lt;ref name="nordiskostmission.se"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordiskostmission.se/tidningen/no2006_1.pdf |title= Brochure|website=www.nordiskostmission.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norsk Luthersk Lekmannsmisjon (NLL) started missionary work in Moldova in the fall of 1999 and created a formal cooperation agreement with the ELCRM. A little later the Nordisk Östmission (NÖ) also began missionary work in Moldova. also in cooperation with the ELCRM. Financial support from NÖ, has made it possible for the ELCRM to buy the Lutheran Center, a car and a garage for the church, instruments for revival meetings, as well as liturgical equipment.&lt;ref name="nordiskostmission.se"/&gt;

The 1997 [[Constitution of the Maldives|Constitution]] of the [[Maldives]] designates [[Islam]] as the official [[state religion]]. The Government interprets this provision to impose a requirement that all citizens must be Muslims, and as such '''[[Freedom of religion]] in the Maldives''' is formally non-existent. The law prohibits the practice by [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] citizens of any religion other than Islam, and the Constitution precludes non-Muslims from voting, obtaining citizenship, and holding public positions. 
The president, who is required to be a Sunni Muslim, is the "supreme authority to propagate the tenets of Islam." Government regulations are based on [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Non-Muslim foreigners are prohibited from worshiping publicly, or from encouraging local citizens to participate in any other religion. Only certified Muslim scholars can give [[fatwa|fatawa]].
{{As of|2007}}, freedom of religion remained severely restricted, with some individual [[societal abuses]] or [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice. According to many officials and interlocutors, most citizens regarded Islam as one of their society's most distinctive characteristics and believed that it promotes harmony and national identity.&lt;ref name="state31"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90231.htm|title=Maldives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who denies [[Islam]], are regarded as rebels and they are subject to the capital punishment.

==Religions demography==
{{main|Religion in the Maldives}}
The country has an area of {{convert|500|sqmi|km2}} distributed across 1,200 coral atolls and islands, with a population of around 450,000.

The population is a distinct ethnic group with historical roots in [[South Indian]], [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], and [[Arab]] communities {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. The vast majority of the Muslim population practices [[Sunni Islam]]. Non-Muslim foreigners, including more than 500,000 tourists who visit annually (predominantly [[Europe]]ans and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) and approximately 54,000 foreign workers (mainly [[Pakistanis]], [[Sri Lankans]], [[India]]ns, and [[Bangladeshis]]), are in general allowed to practice their religions only in private. Although Muslim tourists and Muslim foreign workers are allowed to attend local [[mosque]] services, most practice Islam in private or at mosques located at the resorts where they work and live.&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. 
"The 1997 Constitution designates [[Islam]] as the official state religion, and the Government interprets this provision to impose a requirement that all citizens must be Muslims."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

In addition, "many citizens, at all levels, understand the Constitution as requiring all Maldivians to be Muslim. The Constitution also stipulates that the President must be Sunni Muslim and has the "supreme authority to propagate the tenets of Islam."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"Chapter II of the Constitution relating to the fundamental rights and duties of citizens does not provide for the right to freedom of religion or belief. Furthermore, the Constitution precludes non-Muslims from voting, obtaining citizenship, and holding public positions."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"The "[[Law on the Protection of the Religious Unity]]" states that both the Government and the people must protect religious unity. Any statement or action contrary to this law is subject to criminal penalty; if found guilty, sentences range from a fine to imprisonment."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt; and in extreme cases the capital punishment.
 
"The Government follows civil law based on Shari'a, in such a way that civil law is subordinate to Shari'a. Thus, in the event that a situation is not covered by civil law, as well as in certain cases such as divorce and adultery, Shari'a is applied."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"Non-Muslim foreign residents are allowed to practice their religions only if they do so privately, and provided that they do not encourage local citizens to participate."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"Foreigners were not allowed to import any items deemed "contrary to Islam," including alcohol, pork products, or idols for worship. Alcoholic beverages were available to tourists on resort islands, but it remains against the law to offer alcohol to a local citizen."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"Mosques were not required to register with the Government. The Government maintained and funded most mosques" and [[Muslim holidays]] are generally national holidays.&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"The primary responsibility of [[imam]]s was to present Friday sermons. They used a set of government-approved sermons on a variety of topics and were not legally empowered to write sermons independently. No one, not even an imam, may publicly discuss Islam unless invited to do so by the Government. According to government officials, this rule was in place to maintain a moderate Islamic environment rather than a fundamentalist one."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"Men who wish to act as imams must sit for public exams and present their scores and credentials to the [[Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs]], chaired by the Chief Justice. The Supreme Council is empowered to certify imams. However, if the Supreme Council denies certification, the petitioner can appeal to the [[Board of Education]]."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

"Islamic instruction was a mandatory part of the school curriculum, and the Government funded the salaries of instructors of Islam. While Islamic instruction was only one component of the curriculum used in the majority of schools, there was one school which used [[Arabic]] as its medium of instruction and focused primarily on Islam. Many people who sought further religious education obtained it in [[Saudi Arabia]], Pakistan, or other Islamic countries. Schools offered religious education for women; however, there were no female imams."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

===Forced religious conversion and persecution of individuals===
In 2007, according to the [[U.S. State Department]] "There were reports of [[forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States."&lt;ref name="state31"/&gt;

In 2010, Ismail Mohamed Didi, a Maldivian [[Atheism|atheist]] who was being investigated for his "lack of belief" and had sought asylum in Britain allegedly committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south+asia-10644685&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iheu.org/atheist-kills-himself-escape-100-muslim-nation&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2010, Mohamed Nazim, a student of [[philosophy]] from a devout Muslim family, was at a public meeting in the Maldives discussing the subject of religion.  He declared at the meeting that his own comparative studies on philosophy had meant he could not accept Islam, and declared himself to be an [[Atheism|atheist]].  He was immediately arrested, under the pretext of saving him from being attacked for his beliefs by others at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30855 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60kifXA19?url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30855 |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three days of intense counseling and the threat of a state-imposed death sentence he publicly converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/30901/Maldivian_who_renounced_Islam_reverts&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the Maldivian Police submitted his case to their public prosecutors office as of 29 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haveeru.com.mv/english/details/31961/Police_file_case_against_Nazim,_despite_reversion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
According to the [[Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief]]'s February 2007 report, "members of local congregations on some of the islands do not allow foreign manual laborers to attend the mosque." The government denied these allegations.

When the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief visited the Maldives' only prison, she found non-Muslim prisoners "unable to perform their prayers due to the objections of their Maldivian cellmates." There were no accommodations made for [[Hindu]] prisoners with dietary restrictions.

The Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief also reported on the issue of women wearing [[hijab|headscarves]]. She received reports that women were being pressured to cover by relatives, other citizens, self-proclaimed preachers, or newly formed political parties. Furthermore, she was told that women began to cover after state-owned media reported that the 2004 [[tsunami]] was the "result of Maldivians failing to live in accordance with Islam." There was one report of a female student who was excluded from school for wearing a headscarf. However, female civil servants wore the scarf at work without any difficulty.

On Human Rights Day, 10 December 2011, protesters led by [[Ismail Khilath Rasheed]], calling themselves ‘Silent Solidarity’, gathered at the Artificial Beach to protest religious intolerance in the Maldives. They were attacked and threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/protesters-calling-for-religious-tolerance-attacked-with-stones-threatened-with-death-29260 |title=Protesters calling for religious tolerance attacked with stones, threatened with death |publisher=Minivan News |date=2011-12-10|accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 February 2012, the [[National Museum (Maldives)|National Museum]] was stormed by a handful of men who then destroyed priceless Buddhist statues from the nation's pre-Islamic era of over eight centuries ago, which "effectively erased all evidence of our Buddhist past" according to a senior museum official. Authorities banned footage of the aftermath, to prevent harm to the nation's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jayasinghe|first=Amal|title=Trouble in paradise: Maldives and Islamic extremism|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gpQRnwpootZot3dABRpS168QzLbg?docId=CNG.b7b84d73ae0e2b3179e9deb594bd393e.481|publisher=AFP|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for Civil and Political rights, based in Geneva, Switzerland and the Human Rights Committee are working to establish new guidelines with the Maldivian government on human rights.
The Committee has welcomed the following legislative and institutional measures taken by the State: The removal by the Parliament, in 2008, of the gender bar on running for presidency; the enactment of the Anti-Domestic Violence Act, in April 2012. 
The July 27, 2012, Human Rights Committee report listed more recommendations and principal matters of concern and expressed hope that the Maldivan State Party would continue on its path for equal rights, freedom of religion, and decriminalization of same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;http://thebesttropicalvacationspots.com/human-rights-{{Not a typo|comm|itee}}-report-the-maldives-7272012/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The '''Halacha Yomis''' Program (or ''Halacha Yomit'', as it is known in Israel) is a learning program which covers the entire [[Shulchan Aruch]] [[Orach Chaim]] followed by the [[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]. The cycle takes about 4 years to complete. Every day, Jewish participants study 3 se’ifim (subsections) of Shulchan Aruch or 5 se’ifim of Kitzur. 

Kitzur Shulchan Aruch is covered in addition to Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim to include the generally applicable halachos not included in Orach Chaim. The Halacha Yomis was started circa 1950 by Rabbi [[Yonah Sztencl]], under the guidance of many Orthodox Jewish leaders of the time, including the [[Chazon Ish]]. The Halacha Yomis, and the Mishna Yomis (also started at about the same time), were launched in the memory of the six million Jews that were murdered in the [[Holocaust]].

== Calendar ==

The current daily sections that are being studied can be found at [http://www.dafyomi.co.il/calendars/yomi/ymi78-14.htm] and [http://www.MinyanMaps.com Minyan Maps.com ]. A blog discussion of the day's learning is found at [http://www.MinyanMaps.com/halacha www.MinyanMaps.com/halacha].

Rollins was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the only child of Iris and Paul Garfield.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-14/magazine/tm-7341_1_henry-rollins/2|title=The Angriest Man in Los Angeles :  Rock Poet Henry Rollins Doesn't Drink, Smoke or Do Drugs--He Just Burns|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Life-on-road-suits-Rollins-fine-263878.php |title=Life on road suits Rollins fine |publisher= The News Times (Danbury, CT)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comeinandburn.com/archive/hqmay97.htm |title=An Unofficial Henry Rollins &amp; Rollins Band Website |publisher=Come In And Burn |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins is of [[Jewish]] ancestry through his father.

==Music career==

===State of Alert===
{{Main|State of Alert}}
After high school, Rollins attended [[American University]] in Washington D.C. for one semester, but dropped out in December 1979.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/ |title=An Interview With Henry Rollins &amp;#124; The Daily |publisher=Dailyuw.com |date=1996-11-27 |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708041440/http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/ |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began working minimum-wage jobs, including a job as a courier for kidney samples at the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name="popenter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/henryrollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=Sklar, Ronald |publisher=PopEntertainment.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins developed an interest in [[punk rock]] after he and his friend [[Ian MacKaye]] procured a copy of [[The Ramones]]' eponymous [[Ramones (album)|debut album]]; he later described it as "akin to shooting heroin." From 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including [[Teen Idles]]. When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins's ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; [[Bad Brains]] singer [[H.R.]] would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.&lt;ref name="a26"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Washington punk band the Extorts lost their frontman [[Lyle Preslar]] to [[Minor Threat]]. Rollins joined the others of the band to form State of Alert (S.O.A.), and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the band's five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, ''No Policy'', and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's [[Dischord Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p442659|pure_url=yes}} |title=State of Alert &gt; Overview |accessdate=2007-08-16 |author=DePasquale, Ron |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around April of 1981, drummer Simon Jacobsen was replaced by Ivor Hanson. At the time, Hanson's father was a top admiral in the [[US Navy]] and his family shared living quarters with the [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[United States Naval Observatory]]. The band held their practices there and would have to be let in by [[United States Secret Service]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119194742/https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archivedate=November 19, 2018 |title=An incomplete oral history of Henry Rollins' D.C. years | first=Ryan | last=Kearney | date=February 9, 2012 | work= "wjla.com" | access-date=November 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, "I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and ''loved'' to get in the dust-ups." By this time, Rollins had become the assistant manager of the Georgetown [[Häagen-Dazs]] ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.&lt;ref name="a27"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Flag===
{{Main|Black Flag (band)}}

In 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag's ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist [[Chuck Dukowski]] and later inviting the band to stay in his parents' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Azzerad, 2001. p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist [[Dez Cadena]] allowed Rollins to sing "Clocked In", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.&lt;ref name="a28"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist.&lt;ref name="a28" /&gt; The band was impressed with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder [[Greg Ginn]] was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.&lt;ref name="a29"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Black Flag logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|The band's logo was created by artist [[Raymond Pettibon]]]]
After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo [[tattoo]]ed on his left biceps&lt;ref name="popenter" /&gt; and also on the back of his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers.&lt;ref name="a29" /&gt; Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Flag at the Cuckoo's Nest|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|work=It All Happened - A Living History of Live Music|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101030125/http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|archivedate=January 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: "That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult would do that. [...] My little eyes were opened big time."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Before concerts, as the others of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts, grinding his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in [[Anacortes, Washington]], ''Sub Pop'' critic [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] wrote: "Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1983, Rollins' stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of the audience who attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a "macho asshole".&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A legal dispute with [[Unicorn Records]] held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the band's tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist [[Dez Cadena]] had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; 1984's [[heavy metal music]]-influenced ''[[My War]]'' featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the band's members also grew their hair to confuse the band's hardcore punk audience.&lt;ref name="a47"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Flag's change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Dan|title=10 Concert Fights Caught on Tape|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-concert-fights-caught-on-tape-20130625|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I really want to do to them."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist [[Michael Azerrad]] later commented that "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself."&lt;ref name="a47" /&gt; &lt;!-- Get in the Van book release? --&gt; Rollins has since replied that "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself."&lt;ref name="smhinterview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/henry-rollins/2008/04/03/1206851089537.html |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2008-04-04 |author=Jensen, Erik|work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rollins Band and solo releases===
{{Main|Rollins Band}}
[[File:HenryRollins Performing 1993.jpg|thumb|300px|Rollins performing with the [[Rollins Band]] in 1993]]
Before Black Flag disbanded in August 1986, Rollins had already toured as a solo spoken word artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |title=Lip Service – Henry Rollins |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Waggoner, Eric |publisher=[[Seattle Weekly]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014220714/http://seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |archivedate = October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released two solo records in 1987, ''[[Hot Animal Machine]]'', a collaboration with guitarist [[Chris Haskett]], and ''[[Drive by Shooting]]'', recorded as "Henrietta Collins and the Wifebeating Childhaters";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/punk_newwave_postpunk/support/Rollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins/Black Flag |accessdate=2007-09-09 |author=Hoffmann, Frank |publisher=Survey of American Popular Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins also released his second spoken word album, ''[[Big Ugly Mouth]]'' in the same year. Along with Haskett, Rollins soon added [[Andrew Weiss (guitarist)|Andrew Weiss]] and [[Sim Cain]], both former members of Ginn's side-project [[Gone (band)|Gone]], and called the new group Rollins Band. The band toured relentlessly,&lt;ref name="amgrollins"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p191773|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rollins Band &gt; Biography |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Prato, Greg |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their 1987 debut album, ''[[Life Time (Rollins Band album)|Life Time]]'', was quickly followed by the outtakes and live collection ''Do It''. The band continued to tour throughout 1988; in 1989 another Rollins Band album, ''[[Hard Volume]]'' was released.&lt;ref name="amghenry"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5299|pure_url=yes}} |title=Henry Rollins &gt; Biography |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Huey, Steve |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another live album, ''Turned On'', and another spoken word release, ''Live at McCabe's'', followed in 1990.

In 1991, the Rollins Band signed a distribution deal with Imago Records and appeared at the [[Lollapalooza]] festival; both improved the band's presence. However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend [[Joe Cole (roadie)|Joe Cole]] were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins's home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwebproject.org/rollins.html |title=Primal Scream: Henry Rollins speaks |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author1=Carvin, Andy |author2=Crone, Chris |publisher=EdWebProject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although traumatized by Cole's death, as chronicled in his book ''Now Watch Him Die'', Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album ''[[Human Butt]]'' appeared in 1992 on his own record label, [[2.13.61]]. The Rollins Band released ''[[The End of Silence]]'', Rollins's first charting album.&lt;ref name="amghenry" /&gt;

The following year, Rollins released a spoken-word double album, ''The Boxed Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r77934|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Boxed Life &gt; Overview |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rollins Band embarked upon the ''End of Silence'' tour; bassist Weiss was fired towards its end and replaced by funk and jazz bassist [[Melvin Gibbs]]. According to critic Steve Huey, 1994 was Rollins's "breakout year".&lt;ref name="amghenry" /&gt; The Rollins Band appeared at [[Woodstock 94]] and released ''[[Weight (album)|Weight]]'', which ranked on the Billboard Top 40. Rollins released ''[[Get in the Van|Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag]]'', a double-disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name; he won the Grammy for [[Best Spoken Word Recording]] as a result. Rollins was named 1994's "Man of the Year" by the American men's magazine ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' and became a contributing columnist to the magazine. With the increased exposure, Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and [[VH1]] around this time, and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' playing a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022646/bio |title=Henry Rollins Biography |accessdate=2007-09-14 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Rollins Band's record label, Imago Records, declared itself bankrupt. Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career. He released ''Everything'', a recording of a chapter of his book ''[[Eye Scream]]'' with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''. The Rollins Band signed to [[Dreamworks Records]] in 1997 and soon released ''[[Come in and Burn]]'', but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing ''[[Black Coffee Blues]]'' in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released ''[[Think Tank (Rollins)|Think Tank]]'', his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.

By 1998, Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles [[hard rock]] band called [[Mother Superior (band)|Mother Superior]], and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, ''[[Get Some Go Again]]'', was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's ''[[Nice (Rollins Band album)|Nice]]'' and 2003's ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''. After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight|Tom Green Live!]]'', Rollins stated that he "may never do music again",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=61600 |title=Henry Rollins on 'Tom Green Live' |date=November 5, 2006 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064937/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=61600 |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to ''Trebuchet'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/henry_rollins_Student_protests_are_great/|title=Henry Rollins:Student Protests are Great|date=January 11, 2011|publisher=Trebuchet Magazine|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Culture Brats'', Rollins admitted he had sworn off music for good – "... and I must say that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturebrats.com/2011/03/tramp-last-mile-our-interview-with.html |title=Tramp The Last Mile: Our Interview With Henry Rollins |publisher=Culture Brats |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rollins admitted a disdain for rehashing old music for the sake of it - "I don't want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that's for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/exclusive-interview-henry-rollins-speaks-about-punk-rock-19402/#BWirroYp4ESgox7S.99|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Henry Rollins speaks about punk rock|author=Kevin Wells|publisher=Commdiginews.com|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same topic, Rollins more recently said in 2016 "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn't have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and traveling in groups." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Goggins |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/the-last-word-henry-rollins |title=Henry Rollins on touring, spoken word &amp; nostalgia |publisher=The Skinny |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollins is a guest star on [[Damian Cowell]]'s 2017 album ''Get Yer Dag On!''.

===Musical style===
As a vocalist, Rollins has adopted a number of styles through the years. He was noted in the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore]] scene for what journalist [[Michael Azerrad]] described as a "compelling, raspy howl."&lt;ref name="a26" /&gt; With State of Alert, Rollins "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer."&lt;ref name="a27" /&gt; He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'', however, Black Flag began to incorporate a [[Swung note|swing beat]] into their style. Rollins then abandoned his [[State of Alert]] "bark" and adopted the band's swing.&lt;ref name="a32"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins later explained: "What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In both incarnations of the Rollins Band, Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as "[[Liar (Rollins Band song)|Liar]]" (the song begins with a one-minute spoken diatribe by Rollins), barked his way through songs (such as "Tearing" and "Starve"), and employed the loud-quiet dynamic. ''Rolling Stone''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Anthony DeCurtis names Rollins a "screeching hate machine" and his "hallmark" as "the sheets-of-sound assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again |title=Rollins Band: Get Some Go Again |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173915/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Rollins Band, his lyrics focused "almost exclusively on issues relating to personal integrity," according to critic Geoffrey Welchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight |title=Rollins Band: Weight |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=Welchman, Geoffrey |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173910/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Lyrics etc. --&gt;

===As producer===
In the 1980s, Rollins produced an album of acoustic songs for the famed convict [[Charles Manson]] titled ''Completion''. The record was supposed to be released by [[SST Records]], but the project was canceled because the label received death threats for working with Manson. Only five test presses of ''Completion'' were pressed, two of which remain in Rollins' possession.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/15/henry-rollins-charles-manson&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Rollins produced Australian hard rock band the [[The Mark of Cain (band)|Mark of Cain]]'s third full-length album ''[[Ill at Ease (The Mark of Cain album)|Ill at Ease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ill at Ease |website=The Mark of Cain |url=http://www.tmoc.com.au/js_albums/ill-at-ease/ |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joe Cole Murder, 1991==
Rollins and his best friend [[Murder of Joe Cole|Joe Cole]], son of actor [[Dennis Cole]], were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers in December 1991 outside their shared [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach, California]] home. Cole died after being shot in the face, but Rollins escaped.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-02/entertainment/ca-151_1_henry-rollins |title=Singer-Poet Henry Rollins Fuels His Art With Rage - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1999-01-12 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder remains unsolved.

In an April 1992 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interview, Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with the blood of Cole. Rollins said "I dug up all the earth where his head fell—he was shot in the face—and I've got all the dirt here, and so Cole's in the house. I say good morning to him every day. I got his phone, too, so I got a direct line to him. So that feels good."&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

In a 2001 interview with Howard Stern, Rollins was asked about rumors that he had Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because, days prior to the incident, record producer [[Rick Rubin]] – a fan of Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album ''[[The End of Silence]]'' and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that there was money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: "My place is going to get popped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/nmceYEk7ou8?t=36m49s ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Kr3JbpXXc |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollins has included Cole's story in his spoken word performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[DVD Verdict]] |title=Henry Rollins: Live At Luna Park |first=Patrick |last=Bromley |date=May 6, 2004 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/rollinslunapark.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304232037/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/rollinslunapark.php |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online journalism===
In September 2008, Rollins began contributing to the "Politics &amp; Power" [[weblog|blog]] at the online version of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rollins, Henry |title=Are We Really Going to Elect Sleepy John? |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/politics/2008/09/are-we-really-going-to-elect-sleepy-john.html |date=September 9, 2008 |work=VF Daily's Politics &amp; Power Blog |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830133848/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/politics/2008/09/are-we-really-going-to-elect-sleepy-john.html |archivedate=August 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2009, his posts have appeared under their own sub-title, ''Straight Talk Espresso''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nancy Reagan Stem Cell Research Good Time Hour Presents ... |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/politics/2009/03/the-nancy-reagan-stem-cell-research-good-time-hour-presents.html |date=March 10, 2009 |work=VF Daily's Politics &amp; Power Blog |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830075055/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/politics/2009/03/the-nancy-reagan-stem-cell-research-good-time-hour-presents.html |archivedate=August 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His posts consistently direct harsh criticism at [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] politicians and pundits, although he does occasionally target those on the left.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In August 2010, he began writing a music column for ''[[LA Weekly]]'' in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{cite news | first = Henry | last = Rollins | title = Fanatics!

In the months leading up to the [[2012 United States Presidential election]], Rollins broadcast a YouTube series called "Capitalism 2012", in which he toured the capital cities of the US states, interviewing people about current issues.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Spoken word===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2018}}
Rollins also has toured all over the world doing spoken word performances and his shows frequently last for over three hours. His spoken word style encompasses stand up comedy, accounts of experiences he's had in the world of music and during his extensive travels around the globe, self-deprecating stories about his own shortcomings, introspective recollections from his own life (such as the death of his friend, Joe Cole), commentaries on society and playful, sometimes vulgar, anecdotes.

===Video games===
Rollins was a playable character in both ''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY]]'' and ''[[Def Jam Fight for NY: The Takeover]]''.  Rollins is also the voice of Mace Griffin in ''[[Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter]]''.

==Campaigning and activism==
[[File:Henry Rollins in Iraq with USO tour.jpg|thumb|right|Rollins signing a guitar while on a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) tour in [[Iraq]] in 2003]]
Rollins has become an outspoken human rights activist, most vocally for [[LGBT rights by country|gay rights]]. In high school, a gay classmate of Rollins' was bullied by classmates to the point of attempting suicide. Rollins has cited this as the main catalyst of his "anti-homophobia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Big Think|title=Henry Rollins on Gay Marriage|date=2012-07-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF7vNVmb2fo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m11s|accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins frequently speaks out on justice on his spoken word tours and promotes equality, regardless of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instinctmagazine.com/celebrity-interviews/henry-rollins.html |title=Henry Rollins |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=Rollins, Henry |publisher=InstinctMagazine.com |date=2007-06-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610202932/http://instinctmagazine.com/celebrity-interviews/henry-rollins.html |archivedate=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the host of the WedRock [[benefit concert]], which raised money for a pro-gay-marriage organization.

During the [[Iraq War]], he started touring with the [[United Service Organizations]] to entertain troops overseas while remaining against the war, leading him to once cause a stir at a base in [[Kyrgyzstan]] when he told the crowd: "Your commander would never lie to you. That's the vice president's job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2005-12-22-uso-cover_x.htm |title=USO cheers troops, but Iraq gigs tough to book |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author1=Kasindorf, Martin |author2=Komarow, Steven |date=2005-12-22 |quote=Rollins, 44, has made six USO tours.

He has also been active in the campaign to free the "[[West Memphis Three]]"—three young men who were believed by their supporters to have been wrongfully convicted of murder, and who have since been released from prison, but not exonerated. Rollins appears with [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] frontman [[Chuck D]] on the [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] song "Rise Above" on the benefit album ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]'', the first time Rollins had performed Black Flag's material since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r608078|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three |accessdate=2007-08-15 |author=Prato, Greg |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing his activism on behalf of US troops and veterans, Rollins joined ''[[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]]'' (IAVA) in 2008 to launch a public service advertisement campaign, CommunityofVeterans.org, which helps veterans coming home from war reintegrate into their communities. In April 2009, Rollins helped IAVA launch the second phase of the campaign which engages the friends and family of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at SupportYourVet.org.

On December 3, 2009, Rollins wrote of his support for the victims of the [[Bhopal disaster]] in India, in an article for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/12/twenty-five-years-after-the-disaster-bhopal-is-still-ill.html |title=Twenty-five Years After the Disaster, Bhopal Is Still Ill |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 years–to the day–after the [[methyl isocyanate]] gas leak from the [[Union Carbide Corporation]]'s pesticide factory exposed more than half a million local people to poisonous gas and resulted in the death of 17,000. He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jennifer-davies.com/index/home/Entries/2010/2/5_Henry_Rollins.html |title=Henry Rollins on positive anger – audio interview with Jennifer Davies (2 mins) |publisher=Jennifer-davies.com |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713102036/http://www.jennifer-davies.com/index/home/Entries/2010/2/5_Henry_Rollins.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins summed up his approach to activism, "This is where my anger takes me, to places like this, not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/switzerland/rollins-still-wakes-up-angry-every-day.shtml |title=Henry Rollins radio interview with World Radio Switzerland (10 mins) |publisher=Worldradio.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414135449/http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/switzerland/rollins-still-wakes-up-angry-every-day.shtml |archivedate=April 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu minorities also reside in Central and East Kalimantan, the city of Medan (North Sumatra), South and Central Sulawesi, and Lombok (West Nusa Tenggara). Hindu groups such as Hare Krishna and followers of the Indian spiritual leader Sai Baba are present in small numbers. Some indigenous religious groups, including the "Naurus" on Seram Island in Maluku Province, incorporate Hindu and animist beliefs, and many have also adopted some Protestant teachings."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless as of 2017, Indonesia has the largest number of Hindus living in the region and outside of [[South Asia]].

==History==
[[File:Religious map of Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Religion map in Indonesia with Hinduism shown in red (Note this map only shows "official religions" not actual.]]
The natives of [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] practiced indigenous [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], beliefs common to the [[Austronesian people]]. Native Indonesians venerated and revered [[ancestor|ancestral spirits]]; they also believed that some [[spirits]] may inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or any sacred place. This unseen [[spiritual entity]] that has [[supernatural]] power is identified by ancient Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese as "[[hyang]]" that can mean either [[divinity|divine]] or [[ancestral]]. In modern [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], "hyang" tends to be associated with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ebook3000.com/dictionary/Southeast-Asia--A-Historical-Encyclopedia--From-Angkor-Wat-to-East-Timor--3-Volume-Set-_132751.html | title = Southeast Asia: A historical encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor (3 volume set) | author = Ooi, Keat Gin (editor) | publisher = ABC-CLIO | date = 2004 | accessdate = 8 August 2016 | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160808051416/http://www.ebook3000.com/dictionary/Southeast-Asia--A-Historical-Encyclopedia--From-Angkor-Wat-to-East-Timor--3-Volume-Set-_132751.html | archivedate = 8 August 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Hinduism===
[[File:Tarumanagara.svg|thumb|Archeological evidence suggests [[Tarumanagara]] as one of the earliest known Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia. The map shows its geographic spread in West Java in the 5th century CE.]]
Hindu influences reached the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] as early as the first century.&lt;ref name=jgonda&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], The Indian Religions in Pre-Islamic Indonesia and their survival in Bali, in {{Google books|X7YfAAAAIAAJ|Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 3 Southeast Asia, Religions|page=1}}, pp. 1-54&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to [[78 AD]]. Stories from the [[Mahabharata]] Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; whose versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now [[Tamil Nadu]] and southern [[Andhra Pradesh]]).&lt;ref name=jgonda/&gt; The Javanese prose work ''[[Tantu Pagelaran]]'' of the 14th century, which is a collection of ancient tales, arts and crafts of Indonesia, extensively uses [[Sanskrit]] words, Indian deity names and religious concepts. Similarly ancient ''[[Candi of Indonesia|Chandis]]'' (temples) excavated in Java and western Indonesian islands, as well as ancient inscriptions such as the 8th century [[Canggal inscription]] discovered in Indonesia, confirm widespread adoption of [[Shiva]] lingam iconography, his companion goddess [[Parvati]], [[Ganesha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Arjuna]], and other Hindu deities by about the middle to late 1st millennium AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Hall (2011), A History of Early Southeast Asia, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0742567610}}, Chapter 4 and 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Chinese records of [[Faxian|Fa Hien]] on his return voyage from [[Ceylon]] to [[China]] in 414 AD mention two schools of Hinduism in Java,&lt;ref name=jgonda/&gt; while Chinese documents from 8th century refer to the Hindu kingdom of King Sanjaya as ''Holing'', calling it "exceedingly wealthy," and that it coexisted peacefully with Buddhist people and Sailendra ruler in [[Kedu Plain]] of the Java island.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Hall (2011), A History of Early Southeast Asia, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0742567610}}, pp. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major theories for the arrival of Hinduism in Indonesia include that South Indian sea traders brought Hinduism with them, and second being that Indonesian royalty welcomed Indian religions and culture, and it is they who first adopted these spiritual ideas followed by the masses. Indonesian islands adopted both Hindu and Buddhist ideas, fusing them with pre-existing native folk religion and Animist beliefs.&lt;ref name="junemcdaniel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=June|date=August 1, 2010|title=Agama Hindu Dharma Indonesia as a New Religious Movement:  Hinduism Recreated in the Image of Islam|journal=Nova Religio|volume=14|issue=1|pages=93–111|doi=10.1525/nr.2010.14.1.93}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-09-23--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the kingdom of [[Kutai]] in [[East Kalimantan]], [[Tarumanagara]] in [[West Java]], and Holing ([[Kalingga]]) in [[Central Java]], were among the early Hindu states established in the region. Excavations between 1950 and 2005, particularly at the ''Cibuaya'' and ''[[Batujaya]]'' sites, suggests that [[Tarumanagara]] revered deity Wisnu ([[Vishnu]]) of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy (2014), Lost Kingdoms: Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Early Southeast Asia, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|978-0300204377}}, pp. 130-135&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Hindu kingdoms of Java built many square temples, named rivers on the island as Gomati and Ganges, and completed major [[irrigation]] and infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;Dalsheimer and Manguin (1998), [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/befeo_0336-1519_1998_num_85_1_2545 Visnu mitrés et réseaux marchands en Asie du Sud-Est : nouvelles données archéologiques sur le Ier millénaire apr. J.-C.], Bulletin de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient, pp. 87-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richadiana Kartakusama (2006), Archaeology: Indonesian Perspective (Editors: Truman Simanjuntak et al.), Yayasan Obor Indonesia, {{ISBN|979-2624996}}, pp. 406-419&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable ancient Indonesian Hindu kingdoms were [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]], famous for the construction of one of the world's largest Hindu temple complexes - the [[Prambanan]] temple, followed by [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] and [[Singhasari]]. Hinduism along with Buddhism spread across the archipelago. Numerous sastras and [[sutra]]s of Hinduism were translated into the Javanese language, and expressed in art form. Rishi [[Agastya]], for example, is described as the principal figure in the 11th century Javanese text ''Agastya parva''; the text includes [[purana]]s, and a mixture of ideas from the [[Samkhya]] and [[Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], The Indian Religions in Pre-Islamic Indonesia and their survival in Bali, in {{Google books|X7YfAAAAIAAJ|Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 3 Southeast Asia, Religions|page=14}}, pp. 1-54&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu-Buddhist ideas reached the peak of their influence in the 14th century. The last and largest among the Hindu-Buddhist Javanese empires, [[Majapahit]], influenced the Indonesian archipelago.

===Hinduism in colonial era===
[[File:Bali Omkara Red.png|thumb|200px|The Balinese Om symbol]]
[[Sunni]] Muslim traders of the Shafi'i [[fiqh]], as well as Sufi Muslim traders from India, [[Oman]] and [[Yemen]] brought Islam to Indonesia.&lt;ref name=gbindonesia&gt;Gerhard Bowering et al. (2012), The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691134840}}, pp. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known mention of a small Islamic community midst the Hindus of Indonesia is credited to [[Marco Polo]], about 1297 AD, whom he referred to as a new community of Moorish traders in [[Perlak, Aceh|Perlak]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laffan, The Makings of Indonesian Islam: Orientalism and the Narration of a Sufi Past, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691162164}}, pp. 3-6&lt;/ref&gt; Over 15th and 16th centuries, a Muslim campaign led by Sultans attacked Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms and various communities in the Indonesian archipelago, with each Sultan trying to carve out a region or island for control.&lt;ref&gt;Taufiq Tanasaldy, Regime Change and Ethnic Politics in Indonesia, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004263734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four diverse and contentious Islamic Sultanates emerged in north Sumatra ([[Aceh]]), south Sumatra, west and central Java, and in southern Borneo ([[Kalimantan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Bowering et al., The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691134840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Sultanates declared Islam as their state religion and pursued war against each other as well as the Hindus and other non-Muslim [[infidel]]s. Hindu, Buddhist, [[Confucian]] and Animist communities in these Indonesian Sultanates bought peace by agreeing to pay [[jizya]] tax to the Muslim ruler, while others began adopting Islam to escape the jizya tax. For example, jizya was imposed on unbelievers of Islam in [[Sumatra]], as a condition for peace by the local Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;David Morgan and Anthony Reid, The New Cambridge History of Islam: Volume 3, The Eastern Islamic World, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107456976}}, pp 587-589&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, Indonesian people continued their old beliefs and adopted a syncretic version of Islam. In other cases, Hindus and Buddhists left and concentrated as communities in islands that they could defend. Hindus of western Java, for example, moved to [[Bali]] and neighboring small islands.&lt;ref name=jfox&gt;James Fox, Indonesian Heritage: Religion and ritual, Volume 9 of Indonesian heritage, Editor: Timothy Auger, {{ISBN|978-9813018587}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this era of religious conflict and inter-Sultanate warfare was unfolding, and new power centers were attempting to consolidate regions under their control, European colonialism arrived.&lt;ref name=jfox/&gt; The Indonesian archipelago was soon dominated by the Dutch colonial empire.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (2000), Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, Merriam-Webster, {{ISBN|978-0877790440}}, pp. 516-517&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch colonial empire helped prevent inter-religious conflict, and it slowly began the process of excavating, understanding and preserving Indonesia's ancient Hindu-Buddhist cultural foundations, particularly in Java and western islands of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Jean Gelman Taylor pp. 21-83"&gt;Jean Gelman Taylor, Indonesia: Peoples and Histories, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0300105186}}, pp. 21-83 and 142-173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism in the modern era===
[[File:Saraswati Sarasvati Swan Sculpture.jpg|thumb|200px|A Balinese-style sculpture of the Hindu deity [[Saraswati]] installed by the Indonesian government.]]
After Indonesia gained its independence from Dutch colonial rule, it officially recognized only monotheistic religions under pressure from political Islam. Further, Indonesia required an individual to have a religion to gain full Indonesian citizenship rights, and officially Indonesia did not recognize Hindus.&lt;ref name=mramstedt/&gt; It considered Hindus as ''orang yang belum beragama'' (people without religion), and as those who must be converted.&lt;ref name=mramstedt&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the Indonesian Ministry of Religion declared Bali and other islands with Hindus as needing a systematic campaign of proselytization to accept Islam. The local government of Bali, shocked by this official national policy, declared itself an autonomous religious area in 1953. The Balinese government also reached out to India and former Dutch colonial officials for diplomatic and human rights support.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, Introduction chapter&lt;/ref&gt; A series of student and cultural exchange initiatives between Bali and India helped formulate the core principles behind [[Balinese Hinduism]] ([[vedas|Catur Veda]], [[Upanishad]], [[Puranas]], [[Itihasa]]). In particular, the political self-determination movement in Bali in mid 1950s led to a non-violent passive resistance movement and the joint petition of 1958 which demanded Indonesian government recognize Hindu Dharma.&lt;ref name=mramstedt/&gt; This joint petition quoted the following Sanskrit mantra from Hindu scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Picard (2003), in Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, Chapter 4, pp. 56-74&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Om tat sat ekam eva advitiyam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Translation: Om, thus is the essence of the all prevading, infinite, undivided one.|Joint petition by Hindus of Bali|14 June 1958&lt;ref name=mramstedt/&gt;}}

The petition's focus on the "undivided one" was to satisfy the constitutional requirement that Indonesian citizens have a monotheistic belief in one God. The petitioners identified ''Ida Sanghyang Widhi Wasa'' as the undivided one. In the Balinese language this term has two meanings: the Divine ruler of the Universe and the Divine Absolute Cosmic Law. This creative phrase met the monotheistic requirement of the Indonesian Ministry of Religion in the former sense, while the latter sense of its meaning preserved the central ideas of [[dharma]] in ancient scripts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mramstedt/&gt; In 1959, Indonesian President [[Sukarno]] supported the petition and a Hindu-Balinese Affairs section was officially launched within the Ministry of Religion.

Indonesian politics and religious affairs went through turmoil from 1959 to 1962, with Sukarno dissolving the Konstituante and weakening the impact of communist movement in Indonesia along with political Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pp. 12-16&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, officially identifying their religion as Hinduism was not a legal possibility for Indonesians until 1962, when it became the fifth state-recognized religion. This recognition was initially sought by Balinese religious organizations and granted for the sake of Bali, where the majority were Hindu. Between 1966 and 1980, along with Balinese Hindus, large numbers of Indonesians in eastern Java, as well as parts of South [[Sulawesi]], North Sumatra, Central and South Kalimantan officially declared themselves to be Hindus.&lt;ref name="Martin Ramstedt 2003 pp. 17-18"&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; They politically organized themselves to press and preserve their rights. The largest of these organizations, Parisada Hindu Dharma Bali, changed its name to [[Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia]] (PHDI) in 1986, reflecting subsequent efforts to define Hinduism as a national rather than just a Balinese concern.&lt;ref name="Martin Ramstedt 2003"&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hindus in Bali, with their large majority, developed and freely practiced their religion, in other islands of Indonesia they suffered discrimination and persecution by local officials as these Hindus were considered as those who had left Islam, the majority religion. However, the central government of Indonesia supported the Hindus.&lt;ref name="Martin Ramstedt 2003 pp. 17-18"/&gt; In the 1960s, Hinduism was an umbrella also used by Indonesians whose faith was Buddhism and Confucianism, but when neither of these two were officially recognized. Furthermore, Hindu political activists of Indonesia worked to protect people of those faiths under rights they had gained at the Indonesian Ministry of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pp. 17-20&lt;/ref&gt;

To gain official acceptance and their rights in a Muslim-dominated country, Hinduism in Indonesia was politically forced to adapt.&lt;ref name=junemcdaniel/&gt; Currently [[Hindu Dharma]] is one of the five officially recognized monotheistic religions in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=junemcdaniel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosen |first=N |title=Religion and the Indonesian Constitution: A Recent Debate |journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies |volume=36 |issue=03 |pages=419 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2005-09-08 |url=http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00002795/01/hosen-JSEAS.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1017/S0022463405000238 |id= |accessdate=2006-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828034442/http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00002795/01/hosen-JSEAS.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk religions and animists with a deep concern for the preservation of their traditional ancestor religions declared their religion to be Hinduism, considering it a more flexible option than Islam, in the outer islands. In the early seventies, the [[Toraja]] people of [[Sulawesi]] were the first to realize this opportunity by seeking shelter for their indigenous ancestor religion under the broad umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the [[Karo Batak]] of [[Sumatra]] in 1977. In central and southern Kalimantan, a large Hindu movement has grown among the local indigenous [[Dayak people|Dayak]] population which lead to a mass declaration of 'Hinduism' on this island in 1980. However, this was different from the Javanese case, in that conversions followed a clear ethnic division. Indigenous Dayak were confronted with a mostly Muslim population of government-sponsored (and predominantly Madurese) migrants and officials, and deeply resentful at the dispossession of their land and its natural resources.

Compared to their counterparts among Javanese Hindus, many Dayak leaders were also more deeply concerned about Balinese efforts to standardize Hindu ritual practice nationally; fearing a decline of their own unique 'Hindu Kaharingan' traditions and renewed external domination. By contrast, most Javanese were slow to consider Hinduism at the time, lacking a distinct organization along ethnic lines and fearing retribution from locally powerful Islamic organizations like the Nahdatul Ulama (NU).

Several native tribal peoples with beliefs such as [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Sunda Wiwitan]], [[Toraja]]n Aluk To Dolo, and [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] [[Parmalim|Malim]], with their own unique syncretic faith, have declared themselves as Hindus in order to comply with Indonesian law, while preserving their distinct traditions with differences from mainstream Indonesian Hinduism dominated by the Balinese. These factors and political activity has led to a certain resurgence of Hinduism outside of its Balinese stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;Ravi Kumar, Hindu Resurgence in Indonesia, Suruchi Publishers, {{ISBN|978-9381500477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, June (2013), A Modern Hindu Monotheism: Indonesian Hindus as ‘People of the Book’.

==General beliefs and practices==
{{see also|Hinduism|Balinese Hinduism}}
[[File:Acintya Bali.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Acintya]] is the Supreme God in Balinese [[Hinduism]].]]
The general beliefs and practices of ''Agama Hindu Dharma'' are a mixture of ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of [[Pancasila (politics)|''panca sila'']].&lt;ref name=junemcdaniel/&gt;&lt;ref name=syamashita&gt;Shinji Yamashita (2002), Bali and Beyond: Explorations in the Anthropology of Tourism, Berghahn, {{ISBN|978-1571813275}}, pp. 57-65&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray.&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt; However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognized beliefs that comply with its national ideology.&lt;ref name=junemcdaniel/&gt;&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Picard (2003), in Hinduism in Modern Indonesia (Editor: Martin Ramstedt), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pp. 56-72&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam.&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref name=jmcdaniel2013&gt;June McDaniel (2013), A Modern Hindu Monotheism: Indonesian Hindus as ‘People of the Book’, Journal of Hindu Studies, Oxford University Press, Volume 6, Issue 1, {{doi|10.1093/jhs/hit030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Forge (1980), Balinese Religion and Indonesian Identity, in Indonesia: The Making of a Culture (Editor: James Fox), Australian National University, {{ISBN|978-0909596590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Putu Setia (1992), Cendekiawan Hindu Bicara, Denpasar: Yayasan Dharma Naradha, {{ISBN|978-9798357008}}, pp. 217-229&lt;/ref&gt; contest whether these Indonesian government recognized and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.

Some of these officially recognized Hindu beliefs include:&lt;ref name=syamashita/&gt;&lt;ref name=jmcdaniel2013/&gt;
*A belief in one supreme being called 'Ida Sanghyang Widi Wasa', 'Sang [[Hyang]] Tunggal', or '[[Acintya|Sang Hyang Acintya]]'. God Almighty in the Torajanese culture of Central Sulawesi is known as "Puang Matua" in Aluk To Dolo belief.
*A belief that all of the gods are manifestations of this supreme being. This belief is the same as the belief of [[Smartism]], which also holds that the different forms of God, [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva|Siva]] are different aspects of the same Supreme Being. Lord Shiva is also worshipped in other forms such as "Batara Guru" and "Maharaja Dewa" ([[Shiva|Mahadeva]]) are closely identified with the Sun in local forms of Hinduism or [[Kebatinan]], and even in the [[genie]] lore of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kekai |first=Paul |url=http://sambali.blogspot.com/2005_02_02_archive.html |title=Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan: Wednesday, February 02, 2005 |publisher=Sambali.blogspot.com |date=2005-02-02 |accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A belief in the [[Trimurti]], consisting of:
**[[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], the creator
**Wisnu or [[Vishnu]], the preserver
**Çiwa or [[Shiva]], the destroyer
*A belief in all of the other Hindu gods and goddesses ([[Hyang]], [[Devata|Dewata]] and Batara-Batari)

The sacred texts found in ''Agama Hindu Dharma'' are the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref name="Martin Ramstedt 2003"/&gt; They are the basis of Indian and Balinese Hinduism. Other sources of religious information include the Universal Hindu [[Purana]]s and the [[Itihasa]] (mainly ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''). The epics ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' became enduring traditions among Indonesian believers, expressed in shadow puppet (''[[wayang]]'') and dance performances. As in India, Indonesian Hinduism recognizes four paths of spirituality, calling it ''Catur Marga''.&lt;ref name=murdana&gt;Murdana, I. Ketut (2008), BALINESE ARTS AND CULTURE: A flash understanding of Concept and Behavior, Mudra - JURNAL SENI BUDAYA, Indonesia; Volume 22, page 5-11&lt;/ref&gt; These are bhakti mārga (path of devotion to deities), jnana mārga (path of knowledge), karma mārga (path of works) and raja mārga (path of meditation). Bhakti marga has the largest following in Bali.&lt;ref name=murdana/&gt; Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindus believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it ''Catur Purusartha'' - [[dharma]] (pursuit of moral and ethical living), [[artha]] (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), [[kama]] (pursuit of joy and love) and [[moksha]] (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Ida Bagus Sudirga (2009), Widya Dharma - Agama Hindu, Ganeca Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9795711773}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IGP Sugandhi (2005), Seni (Rupa) Bali Hindu Dalam Perspektif Epistemologi Brahma Widya, Ornamen, Vol 2, Number 1, pp. 58-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Balinese Hinduism is an amalgamation of Indian religions and indigenous animist customs that existed in Indonesian archipelago before the arrival of Islam and later Dutch colonialism.&lt;ref name=nsimmonds&gt;Nigel Simmonds, Bali: Morning of the World, Periplus, {{ISBN|978-0804843966}}, pp. 41-43&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates many of the core beliefs of Hinduism with arts and rituals of Balinese people. In contemporary times, Hinduism in Bali is officially referred by Indonesian Ministry of Religion as ''Agama Hindu Dharma'', but traditionally the religion was called by many names such as Tirta, Trimurti, Hindu, Agama Tirta, Siwa, Buda, and Siwa-Buda.&lt;ref name=mprm&gt;Michel Picard and Rémy Madinier, The Politics of Religion in Indonesia - Syncretism, Orthodoxy, and Religious Contention in Java and Bali, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415613118}}, Chapter 5 and notes to the chapter&lt;/ref&gt; The terms Tirta and Trimurti emanate from Indian Hinduism, corresponding to Tirtha (pilgrimage to spirituality near holy waters) and Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) respectively. As in India, Hinduism in Bali grew with flexibility, featuring a diverse way of life. It includes many of the Indian spiritual ideas, cherishes legends and myths of Indian [[Purana]]s and Hindu Epics, as well as expresses its traditions through unique set of festivals and customs associated with a myriad of [[hyang]]s - the local and ancestral spirits, as well as forms of animal sacrifice that are not common in India.&lt;ref name=mprm/&gt;

;Balinese Hindu temple
{{main article|Balinese temple}}
The [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temple]] is called ''Pura''. These temples are designed on square [[Hindu temple]] plan, as an open air worship place within enclosed walls, connected with series of intricately decorated gates to reach its compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Davison (2003), Introduction to Balinese Architecture, Periplus, {{ISBN|978-0794600716}}, pp 32-45&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these temples has a more or less fixed membership; every Balinese belongs to a temple by virtue of descent, residence, or affiliation. Some house temples are associated with the family house compound (also called ''banjar'' in Bali), others are associated with rice fields, and still others with key geographic sites. In rural highlands of Bali, ''banua'' (or ''wanwa'', forest domain) temples in each ''desa'' (village) are common.&lt;ref name=tar2&gt;Thomas Anton Reuter (2002), Custodians of the Sacred Mountains: Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824824501}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The island of Bali has over 20,000 temples, or about one temple for every 100 to 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Descutner (2004), Asian Dance, {{ISBN|978-0791077771}}, pp. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Temples are dedicated to local spirits as well as to deities found in India; for example, Saraswati, Ganesha, Wisnu, Siwa, Parvati, Arjuna, and others. The temple design similarly amalgamate architectural principles in Hindu temples of India and regional ideas.

Each individual has a family deity, called Kula dewa, who resides in the temple called the family temple that the individual and his family patronize. Balinese Hindu follow a 210-day calendar (based on rice crop and lunar cycles), and each temple celebrates its anniversary once every 210 days.&lt;ref name=nsimmonds/&gt; Unique rituals and festivals of Balinese Hindus, that are not found in India, include those related to death of a loved one followed by cremations, cockfights, tooth filings, Nyepi and Galungan. Each temple anniversary, as well as festivals and family events such as wedding include flowers, offerings, towering bamboos with decoration at the end and a procession. These are celebrated by the community with prayers and feast.&lt;ref name=nsimmonds/&gt; Most festivals have a temple as venue, and they are often occasions for prayers, celebration of arts and community. Some traditions, in contrast, involve animist rituals such as ''caru'' (animal blood sacrifice) such as ''Tabuh Rah'' (lethal cockfighting) or killing of an animal to appease ''buta kala'' (spirits of the earth) - however, the animal sacrifices are conducted outside the premises of a temple.&lt;ref name=tar2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Indonesia Handbook,  3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, &amp; Jane Bickersteth], (Footprint - Travel Guides) 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

;Balinese Hindu arts
{{main article|Balinese art}}
Dance, music, colorful ceremonial dresses and other arts are a notable feature of religious expression among Balinese Hindus. As in India, these expressions celebrate various mudra to express ideas, grace, decorum and culture. Dance-drama is common. Various stories are expressed. For example, one involves a battle between the mythical characters [[Rangda]] the witch (representing adharma, something like disorder) and [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] the protective spirit represented with a lion mask (representing [[dharma]]), in which performers fall into a trance, the good attempts to conquer evil, the dancers express the idea that good and evil exists within each individual, and that conquering evil implies ejecting evil from oneself. The dance-drama regularly ends undecided, neither side winning, because the primary purpose is to restore balance and recognize that the battle between dharma and adharma (good and evil) is within each person and a never ending one.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Belo (1966), Bali: Rangda and Barong, University of Washington Press, {{ISBN|978-0404629151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]], or [[dharma]], is a major symbolic and ritual paradigm found in various festivities, dances, arts and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Anton Reuter (2002), Custodians of the Sacred Mountains: Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824824501}}, pp 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Rituals of the life cycle are also important occasions for religious expression and artistic display. Ceremonies at puberty, marriage, and, most notably, cremation at death provide opportunities for Balinese to communicate their ideas about community, status, and the afterlife.

;Balinese Hindu society
Scholars&lt;ref name=mprm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Annette (1985), Music, dance, and social organization in two Balinese villages, Indonesia Circle, School of Oriental &amp; African Studies, Routledge, 13(37), pp. 45-62&lt;/ref&gt; dispute the degree and nature of social stratification in medieval and contemporary Balinese Hindu society. The social structure consisted of ''catur wangsa'' (four varnas) - ''brahmana'' (priests), ''satriya'' or "Deva" (warriors), ''waisya'' (merchants), and ''sudra'' (farmers, artisans, commoners).&lt;ref&gt;Howe, L.E.A. (1989), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27863998 Hierarchy and equality: variations in Balinese social organization], Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde Deel 145, 1ste Afl. (1989), pp. 47-71&lt;/ref&gt; There is no historical or contemporary cultural record of untouchables in Balinese Hindu society. The wangsa - termed castes by some accounts, classes by other accounts - were functional, not hierarchical nor segregated in Hindu society of Bali or Java. Further, there was social mobility - people could change their occupation and caste if they wished to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, in The Lab, the Temple, and the Market (Editor: Sharon Harper), {{ISBN|978-0889369207}}, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Among the interior highlands of Bali, the desa (villages) have had no wangsa, the social status and profession of a person has been mutable, and marriages not endogamous.&lt;ref name=tar2/&gt; Historical inscriptions suggest Balinese Hindu kings and village chiefs have come from all sections of its society - priests, warriors, merchants and artisans.

==Javanese Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hinduism in Java}}
[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|200px|The 9th century [[Prambanan]] Shiva temple, the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia.]]
[[File:Candi Sambisari 2013-11-14 03.jpg|thumb|200px|Java's Hindu temple, Candi Sambisari.]]
Both [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] were subject to considerable cultural influence from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The earliest evidences of Hindu influences in Java can be found in 4th century [[Tarumanagara]] inscriptions scattered around modern [[Jakarta]] and [[Bogor]]. In the sixth and seventh centuries many maritime kingdoms arose in Sumatra and Java which controlled the waters in the [[Straits of Malacca]] and flourished with the increasing sea trade between China and India and beyond. During this time, scholars from India and China visited these kingdoms to translate literary and religious texts.

From the 4th to the 15th century, Java had many Hindu kingdoms, such as Tarumanagara, [[Kalingga]], [[Medang Kingdom|Medang]], [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]], [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]]. This era is popularly known as the Javanese Classical Era, during which Hindu-Buddhist literature, art and architecture flourished and were incorporated into local culture under royal patronage. During this time, many Hindu temples were built, including 9th century [[Prambanan]] near [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], which has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. Among these Hindu kingdoms, Majapahit kingdom was the largest and the last significant Hindu kingdom in [[Indonesian history]]. Majapahit was based in East Java, from where it ruled a large part of what is now Indonesia. The remnants of the Majapahit kingdom shifted to [[Bali]] during the sixteenth century after a prolonged war by and territorial losses to Islamic sultanates.&lt;ref name="Jean Gelman Taylor pp. 21-83"/&gt;

The heritage of Hinduism left a significant impact and imprint in [[Javanese people|Javanese]] art and culture. The [[wayang]] puppet performance as well as [[wayang wong]] dance and other Javanese classical dances are derived from episodes of Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Although the majority of Javanese now identify as Muslim, these art forms still survive. Hinduism has survived in varying degrees and forms on Java; in recent years, conversions to Hinduism have been on the rise, particularly in regions surrounding a major Hindu religious site, such as the [[Klaten]] region near the [[Prambanan]] temple. Certain ethnic groups, such as the [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]] and [[Osing people|Osing]], are also associated with Hindu religious traditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Robert Hefner, Hindu Javanese, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691028569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tengger Hindus of Java===
The [[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] community follows a Hindu tradition stretching back to the Majapahit Empire. There are strong similarities between the Hinduism in [[Bali]] and the Tengger variety; both are called [[Hindu Dharma]]. However, the Tengger variety does not have a caste system and the Tengger people's traditions are based on those originating from the [[Majapahit]] era. For the Tengger, [[Mount Bromo]] ([[Brahma]]) is believed to be a holy mountain. Every year the Tengger hold a ritual known as [[Yadnya kasada]].

[[File:PuraLuhurPoten.jpg|thumb]]
Pura Luhur Poten (The temple holds a significant importance to the Tenggerese.. The temple organises the annual Yadnya Kasada ceremony)

===Osing Hindus of Java===
In spite of the Dutch attempts to propagate Islam and Christianity among the Osings, many still stuck to their old beliefs. Today, a large Hindu population still exists among the Osings.
The Osings share a similar culture and spirit with the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], and the Hindus celebrate ceremonies like Nyepi. Just like the [[Balinese people]], the Osing people also share the [[puputan]] tradition.The Osing people differs from the [[Balinese people]] in terms of social stratification. The Osing people does not practice [[caste system]] like the [[Balinese people]], even though if they are Hindus.

==Hinduism elsewhere in the archipelago==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Vrouwen maken een rondgang bij de Hindoe tempel Sri Mariamman TMnr 20018361.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tamil Hindus walking around the [[Sri Mariamman Temple, Medan|Sri Mariamman Temple]], in [[Medan]]]] 
Among the non-Balinese communities considered to be Hindu by the government are, for example, the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] adherents of the [[Kaharingan]] religion in [[Kalimantan Tengah]], where government statistics counted Hindus as 15.8% of the population {{as of|1995|lc=on}}. Many [[Manusela people|Manusela]] and [[Nuaulu]] people of [[Seram]] follow Naurus, a syncretism of Hinduism with animist and Protestant elements.&lt;ref name="USStateDep"/&gt; Similarly, the [[Tana Toraja]] of [[Sulawesi]] have identified their animistic religion as Hindu. The [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] of Sumatra have identified their animist traditions with Hinduism. Among the minority [[Indian Indonesian|Indian]] ethnic group, Tamils and Punjabis of Medan, Sumatra and the Sindhis in Jakarta practice their own form of Hinduism which is similar to the Indian Hinduism, the Indians celebrating Hindu holidays more commonly found in India, such as [[Deepavali]] and [[Thaipusam]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/city/article/12881.html My Jakarta: Bhavana Sutrisna Tirtadinata] The Jakarta Globe&amp;nbsp;— March 14, 2009{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bodha]] sect of [[Sasak]] people on the island of [[Lombok]] are non-Muslim; their religion is a fusion of Hinduism and Buddhism with animism; it is considered Buddhist by the government.  In parts of [[Samarinda]] and [[Lombok]] especially [[Cakranegara]], [[Nyepi]] is celebrated.

About half of the people of the small island of Tanimbarkei kei ,practice a variant of the Hindu religion, which involves a form of ancestoral worship.The tiny island of Tanimbarkei is not part of Tanimbar, as the name might suggest, but is one of the [[Kai Islands]]. It is inhabited by fewer than 1000 very traditional people.

The Hindu organisation Ditjen Bimas Hindu (DBH) carries out periodic surveys through its close connections with Hindu communities throughout Indonesia. In 2012 its studies stated that there are 10,267,724 Hindus in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="kemenag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=id&amp;u=http://bimashindu.kemenag.go.id/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DDitjen%2BBimas%2BHindu%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DJ48%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official|title=Google Translate|publisher=translate.google.co.uk|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PHDI (Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia) along with other some other religious minority groups claim that the government undercounts non-Muslims in census recording.&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USDOS,,IDN,,4cf2d09264,0.html|title=Refworld &amp;#124; 2010 Report on International Religious Freedom - Indonesia|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|publisher=unhcr.org|accessdate=2014-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019172110/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USDOS,,IDN,,4cf2d09264,0.html|archivedate=2012-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 census recorded the number of Hindus at 4,012,116, some 80% of them residing in the Hindu heartland of Bali.&lt;ref name="bps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&amp;wid=0|title=Sensus Penduduk 2010 - Penduduk Menurut Wilayah dan Agama yang Dianut|publisher=sp2010.bps.go.id|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official Census (2010)===
According to the 2010 Census, there were a total of 4,012,116 Hindus in Indonesia,&lt;ref name="bps"/&gt; compared to 3,527,758 Hindus in 2000 Census. While the absolute number of Hindus increased, the relative percentage of Hindus in Indonesia decreased from 2000 to 2010 because of lower birth rates among the Hindu population compared to the Muslim population. The average number of births per Hindu woman varied between 1.8 and 2.0 among various islands, while for the Muslim population it varied between 2.1 and 3.2 per woman.

===Official Census (2000)===
According to the 2000 census, Hindus made up 1.79% of the total Indonesian population. Bali had the highest concentration of Hindus with 88.05% of its population professing Hinduism agama. The percentage of Hindus in the total population declined from the 1990 census, and this is largely attributed to lower birth rates and immigration of Muslims from Java into provinces with high Hindu populations. In Central Kalimantan there has been progressive settlement of Madurese from Madura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) - Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/8B48F0B6DD311D70C1257566005C542D?OpenDocument |title=West and Central Kalimantan: Limited livelihood opportunities and failed compensation for lost property hamper recovery of Madurese returnees |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731095855/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/8B48F0B6DD311D70C1257566005C542D?OpenDocument |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108407.htm |title=Indonesia |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mopw.gov.pk/ulema/papers/Indonesia/Table%20Mr%5B1%5D.%20Rozy%20Munir.xls 1 mopw.gov.pk]{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bimashindu.kemenag.go.id/data-umat.php?year=2009&amp;Submit=Cari Data Umat Hindu Tahun 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425143044/http://bimashindu.kemenag.go.id/data-umat.php?year=2009&amp;Submit=Cari |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The details are given below:

==Hindu holidays in Indonesia==
[[File:Street decoration for Galungan celebration.jpg|thumb|200px|Street decoration in Bali for the Hindu festival [[Galungan]]. It celebrates the victory of [[dharma]] over adharma (right over wrong).&lt;ref&gt;Eiseman, Fred (1989), Bali: Sekala and Niskala Volume I: Essays on Religion, Ritual and Art, Periplus Editions, {{ISBN|0-945971036}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*[[Galungan|Hari Raya Galungan]] occurs every 210 days and lasts for 10 days. It celebrates the coming of the gods and the ancestral spirits to earth to dwell again in the homes of their descendants. The festivities are characterized by offerings, dances and new clothes. The ancestors must be suitably entertained and welcomed, and prayers and offerings must be made for them. Families whose ancestors have not been cremated yet, but remain buried in the village cemetery, must make offerings at the graves. [[Kuningan]] is the last day of the holiday, when the gods and ancestors depart until the next Galungan.
*[[Saraswati|Hari Raya Saraswati]] is dedicated the goddess of learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal of life as a human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, [[Brahma]], who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, [[Shatarupa]]. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar ([[palm-leaf manuscripts]]), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks the start of the new year according to the Balinese [[Pawukon]] calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balispirit.com/events/bali_ceremony_ritual.html |title=Bali Cultural Ceremony and Ritual |publisher=Balispirit.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nyepi|Hari Raya Nyepi]] is a Hindu Day of Silence or the Hindu New Year in the Balinese Saka calendar. The largest celebrations are held in Bali as well as in Balinese Hindu communities around Indonesia. On New Year's Eve the villages are cleaned, food is cooked for two days and in the evening as much noise is made as possible to scare away the devils. On the following day, Hindus do not leave their homes, cook or engage in any activity. Streets are deserted, and tourists are not allowed to leave hotel complexes.  The day following Nyepi night, everything stops for a day except emergency services such as ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;Nyoman S. Pendit (2001), Nyepi: kebangkitan, toleransi, dan kerukunan, Gramedia Pustaka Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9796865710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nyepi is determined using the Balinese calendar, the eve of Nyepi falling on the night of the new moon whenever it occurs around March/April each year. Therefore, the date for Nyepi changes every year. Nyepi night is a night of community gathering and burning of effigies island-wide (similar to Holika in India), while the next day is the day of total peace and quiet (unlike [[Holi]] which is full of dancing, coloring, merry making and noise).

==Social life==
[[File:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkartta, Candi Siliwangi Shrine.jpg|thumb|Balinese Hindus built a shrine dedicated to [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] [[Hindu]] [[King Siliwangi|King Sri Baduga Maharaja Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata]] in [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]], [[Bogor]], West Java.]]

[[File:Mall culture jakarta12.jpg|thumb|Many [[Indonesians]] use Hindu names such as [[Vishnu|Wisnu]]. The police officer above has the name written "Tri Wisnu"]]
A common feature among new Hindu communities in Java is that they tend to rally around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship.

The ''Parisada Hindu Dharma'' changed its name to ''Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia'' in 1984, in recognition of its national influence spearheaded by [[Gedong Bagus Oka]]. One of several new Hindu temples in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of [[Semeru|Mt. Semeru]], Java's highest mountain. When the temple was completed in July 1992, with the generous aid of wealthy donors from Bali, only a few local families formally confessed to Hinduism. A pilot study in December 1999 revealed that the local Hindu community now has grown to more than 5000 households.

Similar mass conversions have occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of [[Blambangan]], the last Hindu polity on Java. A further important site is Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri), where the Hindu king and prophet [[Jayabaya]] is said to have achieved spiritual liberation ([[moksa]]).

A further Hindu movement in the earliest stages of development was observed in the vicinity of the newly completed Pura Pucak Raung (in the Eastern Javanese district of [[Glenmore (Indonesia)|Glenmore]]), which is mentioned in [[Balinese literature]] as the place where the Hindu saint [[Maharishi Markandeya]] gathered followers for an expedition to Bali, whereby he is said to have brought Hinduism to the island in the fifth century AD.

An example of resurgence around major archaeological remains of ancient Hindu temple sites was observed in [[Trowulan]] near Mojokerto. The site may be the location of the capital of the Hindu empire [[Majapahit]]. A local Hindu movement is struggling to gain control of a newly excavated temple building which they wish to see restored as a site of active [[Hindu]] worship. The temple is to be dedicated to Gajah Mada, the man attributed with transforming the small [[Hindu]] kingdom of [[Majapahit]] into an empire.

In [[Karanganyar Regency|Karanganyar]] region in Central Java, the renovated 14th century [[Cetho]] temple on the slope of [[Mount Lawu]] has become the center of Javanese Hinduism and gain patronage of Balinese temples and royal houses.
A new [http://www.sahasraadhipura.org/ temple] is being built East of Solo ([[Surakarta]]). It is a Hindu temple that has miniatures of 50 sacred sites around the world. It is also an active kundalini yoga meditation center teaching the sacred Javanese tradition of sun and water meditation. There are many westerners as well as Javanese joining in.

Although there has been a more pronounced history of resistance to Islamization in East Java, Hindu communities are also expanding in Central Java (Lyon 1980), for example in [[Klaten]], near the ancient Hindu monuments of [[Prambanan]]. Today the Prambanan temple stages various annual Hindu ceremonies and festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi.

In [[West Java]], a Hindu temple [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]] was built on the slope of [[Mount Salak]] near the historic site of ancient [[Sunda Kingdom]] capital, [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] in modern [[Bogor]]. The temple, dubbed as the largest Balinese Hindu temple ever built outside Bali, was meant as the main temple for the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] Hindu population in the [[Greater Jakarta]] region. However, because the temple stands in a Sundanese sacred place, and also hosts a shrine dedicated to the famous Sundanese king, [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]], the site has gain popularity among [[Sundanese people|locals]] who wish to reconnect their ties with the ancestors.

==Tourism==
[[File:Odalan procession.JPG|thumb|right|Colourful and festive Hindu rituals of Bali is one of island's attraction]]
The predominantly Hindu island of Bali is the largest tourist draw in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/todays-headlines/foreign-tourist-arrivals-to-indonesia-jump-22.6-in-january-2014/item1716 Foreign Tourist Arrivals to Indonesia Jump 22.6% in January 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Next to natural beauty, the temple architecture, the elaborate Hindu festivals, rich culture, colorful art and vivid dances are the main attractions of Balinese [[Tourism in Indonesia|tourism]]. As a result, tourism and hospitality services are flourishing as one of the most important sources of income and generation of Balinese economy. The high tourist activity in Bali is in contrast with other provinces in Indonesia where the Hindu population is not significant or is absent.

==Symbolism==
The National emblem of Indonesia is called [[Garuda Pancasila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/symbol-and-the-state/state-emblem.html |title=State Emblem |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Indonesia.go.id |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garuda]], the discipled carrier or vehicle ([[vahana]]) of Lord [[Vishnu]], appears in many ancient [[Hindu]] temples of ancient Indonesia. ''Garuda Pancasila'' was designed by [[Sultan Hamid II]] from [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], supervised by [[Sukarno]], and was adopted as the national emblem on 11 February 1950.

==Barbados==
Today, [[Barbados]] has 2,000 Indians living in the country. They came as recently immigrants from Guyana. Because of the huge Indian population, Hinduism became one of the growing religions of Barbados.

==Cayman Islands==
Hinduism is a minority religion in the [[Cayman Islands]] and is one the smallest religions. Hinduism is a comparatively new arrival, as there were only 98 Hindus in the Caymans according to the 2000 census. The 2010 Census showed the number of Hindus surpassing 450, possibly due to emigration from Guyana and India. Hinduism now accounts for 0.8% of the total Cayman Islands population.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Jamaica==
{{see|Hinduism in Jamaica}}

[[Jamaica]] was once home to 25,000 Hindus until the mid 20th century. However, most of them converted to Christianity. In the last few decades, the population of Hindus in Jamaica decreased steeply. In the 1970s, 5,000 identified themselves as Hindus. Since then, the Hindu population of Jamaica has risen and it has become the second largest religion (after Christianity) in Jamaica. [[Diwali]] (pronounced Divali), the festival of lights, is celebrated in Jamaica every year. There were 1,453 Hindus in Jamaica according to the 2001 census.

[[Image:Swords14.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King of Swords from the [[Rider-Waite|Rider-Waite Tarot deck]]]]
'''King of Swords''' is a card used in Latin suited playing cards which include [[tarot|tarot decks]]. It is part of what [[tarot reading|tarot card readers]] call the "[[Minor Arcana]]"

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

  | date = 1980
  | isbn = 0-7156-1014-7
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==
The king of swords card from the minor arcana is often used to depict a mature man with sound intellectual understanding and reasoning. This card depicts a man who is strong-hearted, decisive, and intellectually oriented. 

The king of swords can also depict a man who is ruthless or excessively  judgmental; the querent is therefore advised to balance his intellectual orientation with emotional understanding.

The official title is '''Sultan of Sokoto''' and includes the title "''[[Amir-ul-Momineen]]''". The post has become increasingly ceremonial since British rule, but the Sultan, considered a spiritual leader in the Muslim community in [[Nigeria]], can still carry a lot of weight with [[Fula people|Fulani]] and [[Hausa people]] from northern Nigeria.

Shaihu [[Usman dan Fodio]], the founder of the dynasty of [[Sokoto State]] and of the [[Fulani Empire]] (consisting of the [[Fula people#Fulbe jihad states|Fulbe Jihad states]] of which Sokoto was suzerain), never used the high style of Sultan ([[Muhammed Bello|his son]] was the first to do so), but was simply titled ''Amir al-Mu´minin'', also styled ''[[Lamido]] Julbe'' (which literally means Governor of the believers in Fulani). The sultan of Sokoto is the leader of the [[Qadiriyya]] [[sufi]] order, historically the most important Muslim position in Nigeria and senior to the [[Kano Emirate Council|Emir of Kano]], the leader of the less populous [[Tijaniyya]] [[sufi]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201411281799.html All Africa: "Nigeria: Updated - Kano Blasts Claim Over 60" By Ismail Mudashir] November 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Sultans==
As mentioned above, the Sultans were also styled ''Amir al-Mu´minin'' and ''[[Sarkin]] Musulmi'' ("King of the Muslims", basically the autochthonous form of the former, which is the Arabic style of [[Caliph]]s and other independent sovereign Muslim rulers that claim legitimacy from a community of Muslims); [[King|Mai]], occurring in various Sultans' surnames, is another autochthonous title.

[[Legion of Honor|Chevalier]] '''Louis de Jaucourt''' ({{IPA-fr|də ʒokuʁ|lang}}; 16 September 1704 – 3 February 1779) was a French scholar and the most prolific contributor to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. He wrote about 18,000 articles on subjects including [[physiology]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[pathology]], and [[political history]], or about 25% of the entire encyclopaedia, all done voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1989_num_7_1_1036  Frank A. Kafker: ''Notices sur les auteurs des dix-sept volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie. Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie.'' 1989, Volume 7, Numéro 7, p.&amp;nbsp;144]&lt;/ref&gt; In the generations after the ''Encyclopédie''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, mainly due to his aristocratic background, his legacy was largely overshadowed by the more bohemian [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, but by the mid-20th century more scholarly attention was being paid to him.

==Biography==
Jaucourt was born in Paris, the younger son of an aristocratic family. As he could not entirely rely on inheritance or status to support himself, Jaucourt became a scholar. He studied theology in Geneva, [[natural sciences]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and medicine in [[Leiden]].  Upon returning to France, he spent the next 20 years writing the ''Lexicon medicum universalis'', a six-volume work on [[anatomy]]. He sent it to be published in [[Amsterdam]] to avoid French censorship but the ship carrying the sole manuscript sank, and 20 years of labour was lost. He also wrote a biography of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;published with the pseudonym of L. de Neufville, Histoire de la vie, et des Ouvrages de Mr. Leibnitz, Amsterdam, 1734&lt;/ref&gt;

He practised medicine and was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in London and member of the academies of [[Berlin]], Stockholm (elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1756), and [[Bordeaux]]. 

== The ''Encyclopédie'' ==
Jaucourt volunteered to work on the ''Encyclopédie'', recruited by publisher [[Michel-Antoine David]] starting with the second volume of the work. He began modestly, with only a few articles in each of the next several volumes, but gradually became more and more involved. Between 1759 and 1765 he wrote on average 8 encyclopaedia articles per day, for a total of 17,266 out of 71,818 articles (or about 25%), making him by far the single most prolific contributor to ''Encyclopédie''. His contributions come to some 4,700,000 words. He was especially active in the later volumes, writing between 30% and 45% of the articles in volumes 10 to 17. This earned him the nickname ''l'esclave de l'Encyclopédie'' (the slave of the Encyclopedia).

By the publication of the eighth volume, Diderot saw fit to thank his collaborator for his tireless dedication to the project, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we have raised a shout of joy like the sailor when he espies land after a sombre night that has kept him midway between sky and flood, it is to M. de Jaucourt that we are indebted for it. What has he not done for us, especially in these latter times? With what constancy has he not refused all the solicitations, whether of friendship or of authority, that sought to take him away from us? Never has sacrifice of repose, of health, of interest been more absolute and more entire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.148/--foreword-to-volume-viii?rgn=main;view=fulltext|title=Foreword, to volume VIII|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unlike other editors, Jaucourt was independently wealthy and asked for no payment for his full-time labours. He employed a group of secretaries, out of his own pocket, to help with the effort and to take his dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edelstein|first=Dan|last2=Morrissey|first2=Robert|last3=Roe|first3=Glenn|date=2013|title=To Quote or not to Quote: Citation Strategies in the "Encyclopédie"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/43291299|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=74|issue=2|pages=213–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his works consisted of summarising full books and other longer works into encyclopaedia articles, with much content copied verbatim from existing sources, earning him the derision of some contributors that favored more original thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=Dennis J.|date=1973|title=The Chevalier de Jaucourt and the English Sources of the Encyclopedic Article "Patriote"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40372418|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=16|pages=23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaucourt did not consistently create original articles expressing his own opinions and views of his subjects, but rather implicitly showed his personal beliefs through the careful cultivation of certain passages, emphasis and reiteration, and even word choice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=James|date=1950|title=Jaucourt's Use of Source Material in the Encyclopédie|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2908748|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=65|issue=6|pages=391|doi=10.2307/2908748|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors he selected also show how he chose which messages to disseminate under the broader context of each article. For example, in his article on "Government" Jaucourt draws nearly verbatim from the writings of [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edelstein|first=Dan|last2=Morrissey|first2=Robert|last3=Roe|first3=Glenn|date=2013|title=To Quote or not to Quote: Citation Strategies in the "Encyclopédie"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/43291299|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=74|issue=2|pages=225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the politically incendiary tone of the works Jaucourt copied and paraphrased from, he concealed the names and publication information of much of his source material. Often to avoid censure, the writer would misattribute quotations, such as when he borrowed a fellow philosophe's quote decrying tyranny and attributing it to [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edelstein|first=Dan|last2=Morrissey|first2=Robert|last3=Roe|first3=Glenn|date=2013|title=To Quote or not to Quote: Citation Strategies in the "Encyclopédie"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/43291299|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=74|issue=2|pages=226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote mainly on the sciences, especially medicine and biology. He took a firmly [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanist]] approach to the subject. This is in sharp contrast to the other major contributor in this area, [[Ménuret de Chambaud]], who had a firmly [[vitalist]] view.

While his main focus was on science and biology, he also covered a wide array of other subjects. It is in his works on history and society that his political and philosophical views become clearly evident. He wrote articles of central importance on war, monarchy, people, and [[Muhammad]]. His writing is never as openly political as other contributors such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], but it is clear that he possessed deeply held views. Some of his works, such as those on historical subjects clearly contain radical and anti-clerical messages through implied comparisons between the ancient past and modern France, such as in his article "Paris". Presenting criticisms through these parallels allowed Jaucourt to both bypass the censors that plagued most contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'' and to allow his commentaries on society in a less overt but still impactful way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jaucourt also criticized [[Divination]] and superstition, following [[Francis Bacon]] in interpreting superstition primarily as an intellectual error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 53 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also did important works on [[slavery]], the [[slave trade]], and [[black people]], all strongly condemning slavery as counter to both natural rights and liberties.{{Citation needed|reason=Unclear where in the Encyclopédie he did that, or what secondary sources make such claims|date=June 2018|https://www.etudes-litteraires.com/jaucourt-encyclopedie.php=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.etudes-litteraires.com/jaucourt-encyclopedie.php|title=Jaucourt, Encyclopédie, article Traite des nègres|access-date=2018-12-01|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not regarded today as one of the foremost contributors to Enlightenment theory or political thought, Jaucourt's writings demonstrate great dedication to many Enlightenment principles. As he delineates in his article "Traite des nègres," he believed that the commodification of human life is abhorrent and that every person has the fundamental right of freedom. He also rejected superstition and held that while superstition should be cast aside, even superstitions were preferable to beliefs instilled by coercion or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Alastair|date=1986|title=Denis Diderot and the Limits to Reason|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40372604|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=22|pages=50|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died, aged 74, in [[Compiègne]].

'''Mawlā''' ({{lang-ar|مَوْلًى}}), plural '''mawālī''' ({{lang|ar|مَوَالِي}}), is a [[Polysemy|polysemous]] [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] word, whose meaning varied in different periods and contexts.&lt;ref name="Wensinck"&gt;A.J. Wensinck, Encyclopedia of Islam 2nd ed, Brill. "Mawlā", vol. 6, p. 874.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]] it is used in two senses: Lord; and guardian, trustee, helper.&lt;ref name="Wensinck"/&gt; In the pre-Islamic era the term originally applied to any form of [[Tribes of Arabia|tribal association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ignác |last=Goldziher | authorlink=Ignác Goldziher | title=Muhammedanische Studien |url=https://archive.org/details/muhammedanisches00gold |year=1889 |publisher=Halle |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early Islamic era, this institution was adapted to incorporate new converts to [[Islam]] into the Arab-Muslim society and the word ''mawali'' gained currency as an appellation for non-Arab Muslims.

== Etymology ==
The word ''mawla'' is derived from the [[Semitic root|root]] ''w-l-y'', meaning "to be close to", "to be friends with", or "to have power over". ''Mawla'' can have reciprocal meanings, depending on whether it is used in the active or passive voice: "master" or "slave/freedman", "patron" or "client", "uncle" or "nephew", or simply friend. Originally, ''mawāli'' were clients of an Arab tribe, but with the advent of Islam, the term came to refer to non-Arab Muslims and other client allies of the [[Muslim community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jamila |last=Bargach |title=Orphans of Islam: Family, Abandonment, and Secret Adoption in Morocco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1kewcuLS2AC&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-0027-3 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The term originated in pre-Islamic society to refer to a politically-active class of slaves and freedmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|date=1980-09-01|title=Mawlas: Freed slaves and converts in early Islam|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01440398008574811|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|volume=1|issue=2|pages=132–177|doi=10.1080/01440398008574811|issn=0144-039X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=8A_gAXDtVAEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=history+of+the+term+mawla&amp;ots=ZixQgEcmSi&amp;sig=_0vrlqEGoTN6PvEKvEOVBqGnwh0&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mawla&amp;f=false|title=Roman, Provincial and Islamic Law: The Origins of the Islamic Patronate|last=Crone|first=Patricia|date=2002-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521529495|location=|pages=45 ss|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it gained prominence during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 661-750 CE/41–132 AH), as many non-Arabs mainly [[Persian people|Persian]] subjects and later [[Turkish people|Turkic]] Abbasid slaves converted to Islam. The influx of non-Arab converts to Islam created a new difficulty in incorporating them into tribal Arab society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=RqdcXWARYCQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=history+of+the+term+mawla&amp;ots=v9V6cFdlRZ&amp;sig=EtRgv-IS1i8QWxUzxFxMGVpVBJ0&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20the%20term%20mawla&amp;f=false|title=Patronate and Patronage in Early And Classical Islam|last=Bernards, Monique|first=and Nawas, John|publisher=Brill|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution appeared to be the creation of a contract, a wala', through which the non-Arab Muslims acquired an Arab patron (mawla). They continued to pay a similar tax that was required from the [[people of the book]] and were generally excluded from government and the military until the end of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. In Khorasan and Persia, the Arabs held most of the higher positions in the armed forces and in the upper echelons of government.

The [[Abbasid Revolution]] in 750 CE challenged the political and social privileges held so far by the Arabs. The key figure in this revolution was [[Abu Muslim Khorasani]]. He was a Persian, born in Isfahan and therefore had impeccable credentials of birth with the exploited Persian majority. The legacy of Umayyad excesses had created extreme bitterness among the local population. Unfair taxation had fostered dislike of the Arabs among the Persians. Under the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rulers of the 9th century, the non-Arab converts comprised an important part of the army. The institution of wala' as a requirement to enter Muslim society ceased to exist but acquired political significance with the formation of troops entirely composed of mainly-Turkic freedmen in the service of the caliph, a practice that persisted through the Ottoman period. Together, the rise to power of those ethnic groups restricted the power of the Abbasid [[caliph]] in [[Baghdad]].

[[Abu Hanifa]] was the founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of [[fiqh|jurisprudence]] within [[Sunni Islam]] and lived through the Abbasid Revolution. He famously stated in one of his [[dictum]]s: “The belief of a newly converted Turk is the same as that of an Arab from [[Hejaz]]”. However, the Umayyads resented such reforms, and Abu Hanifa was jailed for his activism.

A '''mobed [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈmoʊ'bɛd,-bæd/]]''' or '''mobad''' (Middle Persian:𐭬𐭢𐭥𐭯𐭲) is a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] cleric of a particular rank. Unlike a ''[[herbad]]'' (''ervad''), a ''mobed'' is qualified to serve as celebrant priest at the [[Yasna]] ceremony. A ''mobed'' is also qualified to train other priests.

In general (lay) use, the term is also used as an honorific to denote any priest, of any rank. For instance, [[Hormizd I]] appointed [[Kartir]] ''moabadan-moabad'', which is frequently translated as 'priest of priests', but more precisely indicates 'high priest of high priests'.

The term 'mobed' is a contraction of [[Middle Persian]] ''magu-pati'', the first half of the expression apparently deriving from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''𐬨𐬀𐬔𐬀'' ''maga-'' or ''magu-'' (of uncertain meaning), and with Avestan 𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 ''-paiti'' meaning "master" or "teacher". Through Old Persian 𐎶𐎦𐏁 ''magush'' and Ancient Greek μάγος ''magos'', [[Iranian languages|Old Iranian]] ''magu-'' is also identified as the origin of the Latin word ''magus'', a "[[magi|magi''an'']]". Through the Greek adjective μαγικός ''magikos'' and Old French ''magique'', 'mobed' is distantly related to the English language word "[[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]".

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|right|"Moses with the Ten Commandments" by [[Rembrandt]] (1659)]]

The '''Mosaic covenant''' (named after [[Moses]]), also known as the '''Sinaitic covenant''' (named after the [[biblical Mount Sinai]]), refers to a [[Covenant (biblical)|biblical covenant]] between [[God]] and the [[Israelites#Biblical Israelites|biblical Israelites]], including their [[proselytes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12391-proselyte Jewish Encyclopedia: Proselyte]: "...Isa. lvi. 3-6 enlarges on the attitude of those that joined themselves to Yhwh, "to minister to Him and love His name, to be His servant, keeping the Sabbath from profaning it, and laying hold on His covenant.""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8|HE}}: "thy stranger that is within thy gates"&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment and stipulations of the Mosaic covenant are recorded in the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], traditionally attributed to [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]] and collectively called the [[Torah|Torah or Pentateuch.]] This covenant is sometimes also referred to as the [[Law of Moses]], Mosaic Law, or the [[613 Mitzvot]], or commandments (singular: mitzvah). 

==Historical-critical scholarship==
{{See also|Historical criticism}}

The concept of a covenant began long before the biblical era, specifically the beginnings of Israel. According to George E. Mendenhall,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Mendenhall&lt;/ref&gt; covenants were originally established as legal customs and then later were replicated in the field of religion. These covenants were created on the basis of an oath, a promise between two parties followed by performance. Engaging in an oath implied that the more powerful party would ensure that the other received proper punishment if it were to default. In the case of religion, the god(s) would be carrying out punishment. Such covenants assured that either blessings or curses be enacted in response to the circumstances. The initial covenant between God and Abraham follows the form of the suzerain covenant; what is significant is that Israel has no duties to uphold; the covenant is not conditional. Future covenants between Israel and God would be conditional. This is clearly expressed in Deuteronomy 11:13-21, recited twice-daily as part of the foundational prayer, the Shema. This passage declares that as long as Israel is faithful to God it will be blessed with ample crops but should it follow other gods the land will not support it. The cost of not following this covenant is harsh. 

In addition to the legal influence in regards to the creation of covenants, Mendenhall also addresses the theory behind blood ties and their significance to the concept of a covenant. As stated in the bible, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are the descendants of Israel and because of their shared blood, they consequently form a bond. This blood tie is compared to the tie that is established by a covenant, and implies that without their shared blood, covenants would be the only way to ensure such unification of a religious group. Furthermore, Mendenhall notes two additional theories noting how covenants may have begun with the work of Moses, or are even thought to have been established during a true historical event with a valid setting. Regardless of the theories, the creation of covenants may be a mystery to scholars for centuries to come, however, the use of covenants evidenced throughout the biblical sources is an undeniable fact.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendenhall|first1=George E.|title=Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition|publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research|pages=49–76|jstor=3209151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mendenhall, the covenant was not just an idea, but actually a historical event. This event was the formation of the covenant community. Wandering the desert, the clans left Egypt following Moses. These people were all of different backgrounds, containing no status in any social community. With all these circumstances they formed their own community by a covenant whose texts turned into the Decalogue. The Israelites did not bind themselves to Moses as their leader though and Moses was not a part of the covenant. Moses was just seen as a historical figure of some type sent as a messenger. The Israelites followed the form of the suzerainty treaty, a particular type of covenant common in the Near East and were bound to obey stipulations that were set by Yahweh, not Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendenhall|first1=George E.|title=Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition|publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research|pages=49–76|jstor=3209151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Mendenhall's input and perspective, Weinfeld&lt;ref&gt;M. Weinfeld&lt;/ref&gt; argues that there are two forms of covenants to have occurred throughout the Hebrew Bible: 1.) the obligatory type &amp; 2.) the promissory type. These translate to a “political treaty” as evidenced by the Hittite Empire, and a “royal grant” as shown through the covenants tied to Abraham and David. A treaty entails a promise to the master by the vassal and ultimately protects the rights of the master. This consequently works in a manner that promotes future loyalty of the vassal since the [[suzerain]] had previously done favors for them. A grant on the other hand pertains to an obligation from the master to his servant thus ensuring protection of the servant’s rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=Apr–Jun 1970|volume=90|pages=184–203|jstor=598135|doi=10.2307/598135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of covenant emphasizes focus on rewarding loyalty and good deeds that have already been done. Weinfeld supports his characterization of a treaty by identifying the parallels exposed through the covenant between Yahweh and Israel. Similarly, he utilizes the Abrahamic and Davidic covenant to reveal its correspondence with a royal grant. In spite of the numerous theories revolving covenants in the ancient Near East, Weinfeld ensures his readers that the covenants exposed in the Old Testament fall beneath one of the two plausible types he has identified, either an obligatory type or a promissory type.

In an article comparing covenants and forms of treaties common at the time, Mendenhall focuses on Hittite suzerainty treaties. These treaties, established between an emperor (suzerain) and inferior king (vassal), were defined by several important elements. The treaties were based on past aid or good fortune that the suzerain had previously delivered unto the vassal and the obligations that the vassal, therefore, had to the suzerain. This foundation for a treaty relationship is similar to the foundation for the Mosaic covenant and the [[Decalogue]], according to Mendenhall. God had delivered the Israelites from Egypt in the [[The Exodus|Exodus]], and they therefore are obligated to follow the commandments in the Decalogue. As the vassal, God has no further obligations towards the Israelites—but it’s implied that God will continue to protect them as a result of the covenant.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, George E. (Sept. 1954). "Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition". ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' (New Haven, Conn.: The American Schools of Oriental Research)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], God established the Mosaic covenant with the [[Israelites]] after he saved them from slavery in Egypt in the events of [[the Exodus]]. Moses led the Israelites into the promised land known as Canaan.

The Mosaic covenant played a role in defining the [[United Monarchy|Israelite kingdom]] (c. 1220-c. 930 BCE), and subsequently the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] (c. 930-c. 587 BCE) and northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (c. 930-c. 720 BCE), and [[Yehud Medinata]] (c.539-c.333 BCE), and the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] (140-37 BCE), and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132-136 CE), and [[Rabbinic Judaism]] c. 2nd century to the present.

Rabbinic Judaism&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah]&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the Mosaic covenant was presented to the [[Jewish people]] and [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]] (which includes the [[Proselytes|biblical proselytes]]) and does not apply to [[Gentiles]], with the notable exception of the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] which apply to all people.

==Christianity==
{{main article|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of the famous [[Sermon on the Mount]] of [[Jesus]] in which he [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|commented on the Old Covenant]]. [[Christian theology|Christians believe]] that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{bibleverse||Hebrews|8:6}} etc. See also {{CathEncy|wstitle=Epistle to the Hebrews}}: "The central thought of the entire Epistle is the doctrine of the Person of Christ and His Divine mediatorial office.... There He now exercises forever His priestly office of mediator as our Advocate with the Father (vii, 24 sq.)."&lt;/ref&gt; Painting by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], Danish painter, d. 1890.]]

The Mosaic covenant or Law of Moses, which Christians generally call the "Old Covenant" in contrast to the [[New Covenant]], has played an important role in the [[Origins of Christianity|shaping of Christianity]]. It has been the source of serious dispute and contention seen in [[Jesus]]' [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|expounding of the Law]] during his [[Sermon on the Mount]], the [[circumcision controversy in early Christianity]], and the [[Incident at Antioch]] which has led scholars to dispute the relationship between [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]]. The [[Book of Acts]] says that after the [[ascension of Jesus]], [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], the first [[Christian martyr]], was killed when he was accused of speaking against the [[Second Temple|Jerusalem Temple]] and the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|6:8-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in {{bibleref2|Acts|15:1-21}}, the [[Council of Jerusalem]] addressed the circumcision controversy in early Christianity.

'''Old John Neptune''' ([[Penobscot]], (July 22, 1767 – May 8, 1865) was elected Lieutenant-Governor at [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Indian Island]], [[Old Town]], [[Maine]], in 1816, a life-time position. Born into the Eel clan, John had a powerful father, John (Orsong) Neptune, who had been the tribe's war chief. As the most powerful leader of the Penobscot for almost half a century, he was popularly (but incorrectly) known as "the Governor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Prins |first1= Harald E.L.|last2= McBride |first2= Bunny.|title= Asticou's Island Domain: Wabanaki Peoples at Mount Desert Island 1500-2000, Vol.1 |url= |year= 2007 |publisher= National Park Service |location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also feared, he had the reputation of being a [[shaman]] (''m'teoulino,'' in the Penobscot language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Eckstorm |first1= Fannie Hardy |authorlink1= Fannie Hardy Eckstorm |title= Old John Neptune and Other Maine Indian Shamans  |url= |year= 1945 |publisher= Southworth-Anthoensen Press |location= Portland, Maine |pp= 254–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:For the genus of marine molluscs, see [[Oscilla (gastropod)|''Oscilla'' (gastropod)]].
'''Oscilla''', a word applied in [[Latin language|Latin]] usage to small figures, most commonly masks or faces, which were hung up as offerings to various deities, either for propitiation or expiation, and in connection with festivals and other ceremonies. It is usually taken as the plural of ''oscillum'' (diminutive of ''os''), a little face. As the ''oscilla'' swung in the wind, ''oscillare'' came to mean to swing, hence in [[English language|English]] ''[[oscillation]]'', the act of swinging backwards and forwards, periodic motion to and fro, hence any variation or fluctuation, actual or figurative.

Many ''oscilla'' or masks, representing the head of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] or of different rustic deities, are still preserved. There is a marble ''oscillum'' of Bacchus in the [[British Museum]]. Others still in existence are made of earthenware, but it seems probable that wax and wood were the ordinary materials. Small rudely shaped figures of wool, known as ''pilae'', were also hung up in the same way as the ''oscilla''.

The festivals at which the hanging of oscilla took place were:

* The ''[[Sementivae|Sementivae Feriae]]'', or [[sowing]] festivals, and the ''Paganalia'', the country festivals of the tutelary deities of the ''pagi''; both took place in January. Here the oscilla were hung on trees, such as the vine and the olive, oak and the pine, and represented the faces of [[Liber]], Bacchus or other deity connected with the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of the soil ([[Virgil]], ''[[Georgics]] ii.382-396).
* The ''[[Feriae Latinae]]''; in this case games were played, among them swinging (''oscil(atio)''; cf. the Greek festival of [[Aeora]] (see [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]]). [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] (s.v. ''Oscillum'', ed. Muller, p. 194) says that this swinging was called ''oscillatio'' because the swingers masked their faces (''os celare'') out of shame.
* At the ''[[Compitalia]]'', Festus says (Paulus ex Fest., ed. Muller, p. 239) that ''pilae'' and ''effigies viriles et muliebres'' made of wool were hung at the crossroads to the [[Lares]], the number of ''pilae'' equalling that of the slaves of the family, the ''effigies'' that of the children; the purpose being to induce the Lares to spare the living, and to be content with the ''pilae'' and images. This has led to the generally accepted conclusion that the custom of hanging these ''oscilla'' represents an older practice of expiating [[human sacrifice]]. There is also no doubt a connection with [[lustration]] by the purifying with air.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">'''Our Lady of Endor Coven''', also known as '''Ophite Cultus Sathanas''', was a [[satanism|Satanic]] cult claimed to have been founded in 1948&lt;ref&gt;''Herbert Arthur Sloane'', by Catherine Yronwode, 2012. [http://www.satanservice.org/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Arthur_Sloane Full article].&lt;/ref&gt; by Herbert Arthur Sloane (born September 3, 1905, died June 16, 1975) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], though some argue that it was not conceived of until 1968, after Sloane's contact with the [[Church of Satan]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofsatan.com/regarding-herbert-a-sloane.php "Regarding Herbert A. Sloane and his affiliation with the Church of Satan"], by Magus Peter H. Gilmore, based on archival research by Magistra Peggy Nadramia, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The group was heavily influenced by [[gnosticism]] (especially that found in the contemporary book by [[Hans Jonas]], ''The Gnostic Religion''), and worshipped ''Sathanas'', their name for [[Satan]] (''Cultus Sathanas'' is a Latin version of ''Cult of Satan'').  Sathanas (or Satan), was defined in gnostic terms, as the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] who revealed the knowledge of the true God to [[Eve]].  That it called itself "Ophite" is a reference to the ancient gnostic sect of the [[Ophites]], who were said to worship the serpent. The "Lady of Endor" is a reference to the [[Witch of Endor]]. Sloane's Coven was first publicly documented in the middle of 1968, when British occult writer [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]] said that he had received a letter from a Satanist "lodge" in [[Toledo, Ohio]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iCYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2001,1865314&amp;dq=richard-cavendish&amp;hl=en ''Witches reported active in Toledo'', [[Toledo Blade]], 3 Dec 1968, p2]&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1967 interview with Sloane with a Toledo newspaper about his occult &amp; fortune telling business made no mention of it &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19670806&amp;id=mwhPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5622,1342183&amp;hl=en ''Toledo's Crystal Ball Business'', by Tom Gearhart [[Toledo Blade]], 6 Aug 1967, p11]&lt;/ref&gt;. While current scholars of Satanism point out that there is no substantial evidence showing Our Lady of Endor Coven existing prior to 1966&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Esotericism'', by Egil Asprem, Kennet Granholm, 2014, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;, some also point out that it is likely that his group did have roots prior to that time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''It seems probable the group was in existence before 1966, although I have not found any traces of it in literature prior to that date. Sloane himself suggested that he was already operating in the 1940s, but given the many parallels with Wicca the group displayed, it is more likely its date of origin must be located sometime after 1953, the year Gerald Gardner's neopagan cult of witchcraft came into the open.''&lt;ref&gt;Ruben van Luijk, ''Children of Lucifer: The Origins of Modern Religious Satanism'', Oxford Studies in Western Esotericism, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beliefs==

Sloane refers in his June 1968 letter to his group as "Our Lady of Endor Coven, The Ophitic Cultus Sathanas" and clarifies that it was [[Sathanas]] in the form of the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]] who brought the knowledge (''[[gnosis]]'') of the true God to Eve when she ate of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]. This true God is above the [[Demiurge|creator god]] of this world. He writes that [[Cain]] was the first Satanic priest and performed the first [[Satanic Mass]] (which explains Cain being punished by the creator god). According to Sloane, True Satanists then, are following the way of the Serpent and of Cain, as the early ophitic gnostics were. This terminology is summed up in Hans Jonas' book within a few pages, titled "Eve and the Serpent", and "Cain and the Creator":
&lt;blockquote&gt;...it is the serpent that persuades Adam and Eve to taste of the fruit of knowledge and thereby to disobey their Creator...Indeed, more than one gnostic sect derived its name from the cult of the ''serpent'' ("Ophites" from the Gk. ''ophis''; "[[Naassenes]]" from the Heb. ''nahas''--the group as a whole being termed "ophitic")&lt;ref&gt;''The Gnostic Religion'', by Hans Jonas, 1958, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This general Serpent is also the wise Word of Eve. This is the mystery of Eden: this is the river that flows out of Eden. This is also the mark that was set on Cain, whose sacrifice the god of this world [the creator god] did not accept whereas he accepted the bloody sacrifice of Abel: for the lord of this world delights in blood.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gnostic Religion'', by Hans Jonas, 1958, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sloane believed in a [[horned god]], which he said was revealed to him in the woods when he was a child. This horned god, according to him, was the original and most ancient god ever worshipped by humans (he explains that anthropology has proven this). After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'', he said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane had become very active in the [[Spiritualist Church]] movement, being a minister in a Spiritualist Church since the 1930s, and traveling to various locations in Ohio to perform services. He describes his coven of Sathanas as developing out of his occupation with [[Spiritualism]]. Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (the founder of the [[Wicca]] movement, who died in 1964), concerning Sloane's interest in portraying true witches as worshiping Satan, or "Sathanas", a view which Gardner himself fought against in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31-34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt;. However, Sloane did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Etymology of Wicca|wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]"&lt;ref&gt;This remark indicates Sloane's superficial knowledge of the ancient [[Yazidis|Yezedee]] religion of the Middle East. While their Muslim detractors accuse the Yezedees of being Satan-worshippers, the Yezedees themselves hotly deny being such.&lt;/ref&gt;. When the [[Church of Satan]] appeared in the 1960s, Sloane began corresponding with [[Anton LaVey]], with an interest in finding more Satanists to participate in his own organization.&lt;ref&gt;''From the Church of Satan Archives'', by Peggy Nadramia, 2016. [http://www.churchofsatan.com/from-the-cos-archives.php Full article].&lt;/ref&gt; Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and selections from it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31-34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The church claims to have more than one million followers worldwide and 500 churches located in ten countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://web.perfect-liberty.or.jp/index.html |title = PL Home Page |date = September 27, 2007 |author = Church of Perfect Liberty |accessdate = 2007-11-02 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103081717/http://web.perfect-liberty.or.jp/index.html |archivedate = November 3, 2007 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of the parishes are located in [[Japan]], but due to the active missionary work in the 1960s PL was established in [[South America]] and the [[United States]] as well. In the 21st century it also has a presence in [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Peru]]. The [[Oceania]]n headquarters was founded in the 1990s in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. Small communities exist in Europe as well, especially in [[France]], [[Portugal]] and [[Hungary]].

1970 saw the construction of the {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} ''[[Dai Heiwa Kinen Tō|PL Peace Tower]]'', a monument to all the people who have died in war, from the beginning of time.&lt;ref name="PLHistory"/&gt;

==Organization==
PL's spiritual leader, the Patriarch, is called ''Oshieoya-sama'' (English: Father of the Teachings). The third and current Patriarch of the church is Takahito Miki.&lt;ref name="PLHistory" /&gt; Miki is also the vice president of ''Shinshuren'', the Federation of New Religious Organizations of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rk-world.org/news/newsarc04.html |title = RK World News Archives 2004 |date = December 2004 |author = Rissho Kosei-kai |accessdate = 2007-12-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071116065241/http://www.rk-world.org/news/newsarc04.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, these steps were made out of granite and later in 1985, it was covered by '[[Panchaloha]]', a composition of five metals such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[tin]]. One who undertakes Sabarimala pilgrimage must mark his foots over these steps by carrying an 'irumudikettu' and undergoing a [[vrata]]m (penance) of 41 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ayyappaseva.org/blog/18_holy_steps_-pathinettam_padi-_and_its_significance|title=18 Holy Steps (Pathinettam Padi) and its significance|website=www.ayyappaseva.org|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrims who climbed the Pathinettampadi for 18 times needs to plant a young coconut tree at Sannidhanam and thereby becomes a 'Guruswami'. In the past, devotees used to break coconuts on these steps which was later restricted and replaced.

== Symbolism of eighteen steps ==
[[File:18 steps at sabarimala.jpg|right|thumb|Pilgrims climbing the eighteen sacred steps at Sannidhanam]]
The first five steps represents 'Panchendriyas', which are the five human [[sense]]s such as eye, ear, nose, skin and mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ayyappasamaaj.org/apps/blog/show/2014715-meaning-of-pathinettampadi-the-holy-18-steps-|title=Ayyappa Samaaj|website=Ayyappa Samaaj|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next eight steps represents "Ashtaragas' which includes Kama (desire), [[Krodha (Mental factor)|Krodha]] (anger), Lobha (inordinate desire), Moha (attachment), Madha (pride), Matsarya (unhealthy competition), Asuya (jealousy) and Dhumb (braggy). The next three steps represents 'Thrigunas' or the three qualities of Sathva, [[Rajas]] and Thamas. The final two steps indicates Vidya (knowledge) and Avidya (ignorance of knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabarimala.tdb.org.in/node/194|title=Pathinettam Padi {{!}} Sabarimala Sree Ayyappa Temple|website=sabarimala.tdb.org.in|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps also symbolizes the eighteen hills that surrounds the Sabarimala temple which are [[Ponnambalamedu]], Gaudanmala, Nagamala, Sundaramala, Karimala, Mathangamala, Mayiladummala, Sreepadamala, Thevarmala, [[Nilakkal]]mala, Thalapparamala, Chittambalamala, Ghalkimala, Puthusserymala, [[Kalaketty]]mala, Inchipparamala, Sabarimala and Neelimala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathinettampadi|last=Sree|first=Ayyappan|publisher=Siso books|year=2002|isbn=817797033X|location=Pattom, Thiruvananthapuram|pages=106, 107|quote=|via=First edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who cross all these steps become purified and attains eligibility to get the [[Darśana|darshan]] of lord [[Ayyappan|Ayyappa]].

== Significane of eighteen in Hinduism ==
The number 18 has a unique position and significance within [[Hinduism]]. Some of them are the following;
* The [[puranas]] and upa-puranas wrote by [[Vyasa|Veda Vyasa]] are eighteen in number.
* The historic [[Kurukshetra War|Kurukshethra war]] in [[Mahabharata]] lasted for eighteen days and it had eighteen [[Akshauhini]] armies.
* Mahabharatha has [[The 18 parvas|eighteen parva]]s.
* The [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Vedas]] have eighteen chapters.
* Sabarimala temple is surrounded by eighteen hills and it has eighteen steps.

== Padi pooja ==
The padi pooja is a ritualistic pooja performed by the [[thantri]] accompanied by the [[Melshanthi]] (chief priest) to the eighteen hill deities who guards [[Ayyappa]].

[[File:SinagogaPortuguesaAmsterdao.JPG|thumb|The exterior of the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]], the synagogue for the [[Sephardic]] community which was inaugurated in 1675 and is still in use by the Jewish community]]
The '''Portugees-Israëlitisch Kerkgenootschap''' (PIK) (Portuguese Israelite Religious Community) is the community for [[Sephardic]] [[Jews]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Sephardic Jews have been living in the Netherlands since the 16th century with the forced relocation of [[Spain|Spanish]] but above all [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Jews from their home countries due to the [[Inquisition]]. Nowadays some 270 families are connected to the PIK, also sometimes called PIG, which stands for '''Portugees-Israëlitische Gemeente''' (Portuguese Israelite Congregation).

==History==
The PIK was founded in 1814 under the reign of [[Willem I of the Netherlands|Willem I]], although the first steps towards a central organization of Jewish communities in the Netherlands were already taken in 1808, under command of the Napoleonic king, [[Louis Bonaparte]]. Both the [[Ashkenazi]] as well as the [[Sephardic]] communities were included. This lasted until 1871, when the PIK (founded in 1870 by dissatisfied Sephardic Jews after arguments about where the central organization which represented all Jews in the Netherlands was to be settled and after the wish to remove itself from their Ashkenazi co-religionists) removed itself from the Ashkenazi community and became a fully independent segment within Dutch Judaism.

Center of Sephardic life in the Netherlands was Amsterdam, although throughout time, communities also existed in places like [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] (twice, in the 17th and in the 19th century), [[Middelburg]] and [[Naarden]]. At the eve of the [[Holocaust]], some 4,300 Sephardic Jews were living in the Netherlands, the majority of them in Amsterdam. Most of them were killed; at the end of the war, an estimated 800 were still alive.

==Today==
[[File:SPAmster.JPG|right|thumb|Interior of the Amsterdam Esnoga]]

Currently the PIK, or PIG, has some 270 families (an estimated 600 persons) affiliated to it. The community regularly holds services in the monumental [[Amsterdam Esnoga|Esnoga]] synagogue or Snoge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bma.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/groot/snoge.html | title=Esnoga Synagogue, Mr. Visserplein | publisher=Amsterdam Heritage | accessdate=8 December 2006 | language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Amsterdam near [[Waterlooplein]]. There is also a small PIG-Sephardic synagogue in [[Amstelveen]] with weekly activities. Almost all community members live in Amsterdam and surroundings. The PIG also has a youth group, called J-PIG ('''Jongeren Portugees-Israëlitische Gemeente''') (Youngsters' Portuguese Israelite Community). Chief Rabbi (''chacham'') of the community was S. Rodrigues Pereira, one of the few rabbis that survived the Holocaust. Since he died the community has been led by rabbis B. Drukarch, S. Haliwa and since about 1998 by Rabbi Dr. P.B. Toledano, who lives in London but visits Amsterdam frequently.

==Cemeteries==

Several Sephardic Jewish cemeteries have been founded since the first Jews settled in the Netherlands in the 16th century. Some of them have grown to be huge monuments of a once lively community. On the most well-known is [[Beth Haim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jhm.nl/amsterdam_eng.aspx?deelkaart=4&amp;ID=27 | title=Portuguese Cemetery Beth Haim | publisher=Jewish Historical Museum | accessdate=8 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bma.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/groot/bethhaim.html | title=The monumental Beth Haim Cemetery | publisher=Amsterdam Heritage | accessdate=8 December 2006 | language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ouderkerk aan de Amstel]]. Jews have been buried there since the year 1614 (making it the oldest Jewish cemetery in the Netherlands); until 1642, several [[Ashkenazi]] Jews were also buried at the cemetery, before buying their own piece of land to bury their dead near the village of [[Muiderberg]]. Throughout history, some 28,000 Sephardic Jews were buried at Beth Haim, making it one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands. Among the ones buried at this monumental site are rabbi [[Menasseh ben Israel]], diplomat [[Samuel Pallache]] and the parents of philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]].

Other Sephardic cemeteries are found in [[Middelburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~vriespr/joga.html | title=Sephardic cemetery in Middelburg, founded 1655 | accessdate=8 December 2006 | language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amersfoort]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]].

In some [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, the '''reader''' is responsible for reading aloud excerpts of the [[scripture]] at a [[liturgy]].  In early Christian times, the reader was of particular value due to the rarity of [[literacy]].

== Latin liturgical rites ==
{{further|Latin liturgical rites}}
In the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], the term "'''[[lector]]'''" or "'''reader'''"&lt;ref&gt;The term "lector" is used in preference to that of "reader" in the official English text of the [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]] ("reader" is found in no. 352 of this document, but not elsewhere), but "reader" is used in the English version of the [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini_en.html Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation ''Verbum Domini''], which capitalizes "Reader" to indicate an "instituted" reader or lector.&lt;/ref&gt; can mean someone who in a particular [[liturgy]] is assigned to read a [[Bible|Biblical]] text other than the [[Gospel]]. (Reading the Gospel at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is reserved specifically to the [[deacon]] or, in his absence, to the [[priest]].) But it also has the more specific meaning of a person who has been "instituted" as a lector or reader, and is such even when not assigned to read in a specific liturgy. This is the meaning in which the term is used in this article.

In this sense, the office was formerly classed as one of the four [[minor orders]] and in recent centuries was generally conferred only on those preparing for ordination to the priesthood. With effect from 1 January 1973, the apostolic letter ''Ministeria quaedam''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6MINORS.HTM|title=Pope Paul VI - Ministeria Quaedam|work=ewtn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 15 August 1972 decreed instead that:
# What up to now were called minor orders are henceforth to be called ''ministries''.
# Ministries may be assigned to lay Christians; hence they are no longer to be considered as reserved to candidates for the sacrament of orders.
# Two ministries, adapted to present-day needs, are to be preserved in the whole Latin Church, namely, those of reader and acolyte. The functions heretofore assigned to the [[subdeacon]] are entrusted to the reader and the acolyte...
# The reader is appointed for a function proper to him, that of reading the word of God in the liturgical assembly. Accordingly, he is to proclaim the readings from sacred Scripture, except for the gospel in the Mass and other sacred celebrations; he is to recite the psalm between the readings when there is no psalmist; he is to present the intentions for the general intercessions in the absence of a deacon or cantor; he is to direct the singing and the participation by the faithful; he is to instruct the faithful for the worthy reception of the sacraments. He may also, insofar as may be necessary, take care of preparing other faithful who are appointed on a temporary basis to read the Scriptures in liturgical celebrations. That he may more fittingly and perfectly fulfill these functions, he is to meditate assiduously on sacred Scripture.
:Aware of the office he has undertaken, the reader is to make every effort and employ suitable means to acquire that increasingly warm and living love and knowledge of Scripture that will make him a more perfect disciple of the Lord.

Canon 1035&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3Q.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text - IntraText CT|work=intratext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]] requires candidates for [[deacon|diaconal]] ordination to have received and have exercised for an appropriate time the ministries of lector and acolyte and prescribes that institution in the second of these ministries must precede by at least six months ordination as a deacon.

Instituted lectors, who are all men, are obliged, when proclaiming the readings at Mass, to wear an [[alb]] (with [[cincture]] and [[amice]] unless the form of the alb makes these unnecessary).  Others who perform the function of lector, but who are not instituted in the ministry of lector, are neither required nor forbidden by universal law of the Latin Church to wear an alb: "During the celebration of Mass with a congregation a second priest, a deacon, and an instituted reader must wear the distinctive vestment of their office when they go up to the ambo to read the word of God. Those who carry out the ministry of reader just for the occasion or even regularly but without institution may go to the ambo in ordinary attire, but this should be in keeping with the customs of the different regions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/11/ContentIndex/133/Start/126|title=Chapter III: Offices and Ministries in the Celebration of the Liturgy of the Word within Mass|work=catholicliturgy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other lay ministers, they may wear an alb or "other suitable attire that has been legitimately approved by the Conference of Bishops".&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Order of Mass, 339&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the England and Wales episcopal conference nor that of the United States has specified a particular alternative attire.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf|format=PDF|title= General Instruction of the Roman Missal (England and Wales), 339|website=liturgyoffice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the dioceses of the United States of America, a cassock and surplice may be worn as "appropriate and dignified clothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-6.cfm|title=Chapter VI:  The Requisites for the  Celebration of Mass|work=usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]] speaks as follows of those who, without being lectors in the specific sense, carry out their functions at Mass: "In the absence of an instituted lector, other lay people may be deputed to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture, people who are truly suited to carrying out this function and carefully prepared, so that by their hearing the readings from the sacred texts the faithful may conceive in their hearts a sweet and living affection for Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/roman-missal/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-3.cfm|title=101|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Instruction thus makes no distinction between men and women for proclaiming the scriptural readings in the absence of an instituted lector.

In its sections the same document lists the lector's specific duties at Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/roman-missal/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-4.cfm|title=194-198|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traditionalist Catholic]] organizations such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]], the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] and the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]] are authorized to use the pre-1973 rite for their members who receive the office of lector.&lt;ref&gt;"Only in [[institute of consecrated life|Institutes of Consecrated Life]] and [[society of apostolic life|Societies of Apostolic Life]] which are under the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei]], and in those which use the [[liturgy|liturgical]] books of the ''[[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|forma extraordinaria]]'', is the use of the ''[[Roman Pontifical|Pontificale Romanum]]'' of 1962 for the conferral of minor and major orders permitted" ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html Instruction on the Application of ''Summorum Pontificum'', 30 April 2011], 31).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX) and other traditionalist Catholic bodies in dispute with the Holy See, such as [[sedevacantism|sedevacantists]], use it without seeking authorization.

== Eastern liturgical rites ==
{{further|Eastern Rite (disambiguation){{!}}Eastern liturgical rites}}
[[Image:Reader ordination.jpg|thumb|Tonsuring of readers in a seminary by a Russian Orthodox bishop. The readers being ordained are wearing the short phelon (in white).]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine tradition]], the reader (in [[Greek language|Greek]], {{lang|grc|Ἀναγνώστης}} ''Anagnostis''; in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], Чтец ''Chtets'') is the second highest of the minor orders of clergy.  This order is higher than the Doorkeeper (now largely obsolete) and lower than the [[subdeacon]]. The reader's essential role is to read the [[Old Testament]] lessons ("parables") and the [[Epistle]] lessons during the [[Divine Liturgy]], [[Vespers]] and other services, as well as to chant the [[Psalm]]s and the verses of the [[Prokimenon|Prokimen]], [[Alleluia]] and certain [[antiphon]]s and other hymns during the divine services. Due to this fact, it often falls to the reader within a parish to construct the variable parts of the divine services according to the often very complicated rules.  This can lead to a very intimate knowledge of the structure of and rules pertaining to the services.  There is a special service for the [[ordination]] of a reader, although in contemporary practice a [[layman]] may receive the [[priest]]'s blessing to read on a particular occasion.

Immediately before ordination as a reader, the candidate is [[tonsure]]d as a sign of his submission and obedience upon entry into the clerical state.  It is a separate act from ordination.  The tonsure is performed only once, immediately prior to the actual ordination of a reader, which the ordination rite refers to as "the first degree of priesthood".  However, it is not the means whereby a person becomes a reader. Readers, like subdeacons, are ordained by ''Cheirothesia'' - literally, "to place hands" - whereas ''[[Christian laying on of hands|Cheirotonia]]'' - "to stretch out the hands" - is practised at the ordination of the higher clergy: bishops, priests and deacons.&lt;ref name="Ordination"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7106|title=The Sacramental Life of the Orthodox Church - Liturgy &amp; Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|author=|date=|website=www.goarch.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is through ordination - not the tonsure - that one is made a reader or subdeacon; this is highlighted by the fact that the tonsure is performed only once and is not repeated before the ordination of a subdeacon. The confusion has arisen by the common reference to a man being "tonsured a reader" which, while widespread, is not technically correct.  The office of a reader subsumes that of a ''[[taper-bearer]]'', and the service of ordaining a reader mentions both functions.

[[File:Lukijaksivihkiminen.jpg|thumb|left|The ordination of a reader in Finland.]]
Readers are permitted to (and should in accordance with his particular church's practices) wear a [[cassock]] as a sign of his suppression of his own tastes, will, and desires, and his canonical obedience to God, his bishop, and the liturgical and canonical norms of the Church, although many do so only when attending services (again in accordance with particular church practices). Readers will generally not wear a [[clergy shirt]], and may not perform any of the duties reserved for a deacon, priest or bishop.

This short phelon is then removed (and never worn thereafter) and replaced with a [[sticharion|stikhar]], which the reader wears thereafter whenever he performs his liturgical duties. This practice is not universal, however, and many bishops and priests will allow a reader to perform his function dressed only in a cassock or (if a [[monk]]) a [[Cassock|riassa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovo.net/289_y.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a bishop will decree what vesting practice he wishes to be followed within his own [[diocese]]; for an example, see holy-trinity.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holy-trinity.org/liturgics/tikhon.lit1.html|title=HTC: Liturgical Order #1|work=holy-trinity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; section VIII.

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[icon]]s often show readers and church singers wearing a stikhar-like garment (more loose and flowing than the modern stikhar) and a pointed hat with the brim pulled out to the sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.oca.org/IconDirectory/LG/GreatLent/sundayorthodoxy.jpg|title=Icon Directory, lower left corner|author=|date=|website=oca.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinctive garb is now obsolete.

In [[Eastern Thrace]], during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period and prior to the tragedy of 1922, some lay people were selected through symbolic [[tonsure]] and [[Cheirothesia]] to receive the ecclesiastical blessing and rank of {{Interlanguage link multi|''Anagnostis''|el|3=Αναγνώστης}} not only because of their literacy but also in recognition of their philanthropic and benevolent patronage of the Church and [[Orthodoxy]]. Most adopted "Αναγνώστης" (''Anagnostis'') as their given name, and this name was subsequently given as a baptismal name to their male grandchildren.

==Protestantism==

===Anglicanism===
{{main|Lay Reader}}

Minor orders were discontinued in the reformed [[Church of England]]. The modern office of Reader was introduced in 1866 and is distinct from the traditional minor order of reader.  It is the office of a licensed lay minister and, for this reason, a person holding the office is referred to as a "lay Reader" in many parts of the Anglican Communion.  After a period of theological training (often, in the case of the Church of England, three years of evening classes), a lay person is licensed to preach and lead public worship.  A Reader is not a member of the clergy and cannot preside at the [[Eucharist]], officiate at [[wedding|marriages]], [[absolution|absolve]] or [[blessing|bless]]. The Reader is licensed to lead non-sacramental worship (including, in some cases, [[funeral]]s), may assist in the leadership of eucharistic worship and may preach. An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Reader usually wears a blue [[tippet]] with [[choir dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://readers.cofe.anglican.org/|title=Anglican Readers' web site - Home Page|work=anglican.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodism===

In the [[United Methodist Church]] and similar to the Anglican office, a Certified Lay Minister is a certified lay servant, certified lay missioner, (or equivalent as defined by his or her central conference), who is called and equipped to conduct public worship, care for the congregation, assist in program leadership, develop new and existing faith communities, preach the Word, lead small groups, or establish community outreach ministries as part of a ministry team with the supervision and support of a clergyperson.  The role of Certified Lay Minister is intended for missional leadership in churches or other ministry settings as part of a team ministry under the supervision of a clergyperson, and they are ''assigned'' to a local church by the District Superintendent, unlike ordained clergy who are ''appointed'' by a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/leadership-resources/clm-faqs#anchor1|title=CLM FAQs|work=umc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azerbaijan]] is an overwhelmingly Muslim country. Estimates include 96.9% (CIA),&lt;ref name=CIAFB&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|website=CIA|accessdate=23 May 2015|date=May 18, 2015|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 90.7% (Berkley Center, 2012),&lt;ref name=BCRPWA&gt;{{cite web|title=Berkley Center for Religion Peace and World Affairs|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/azerbaijan|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=23 May 2015|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 99.2% (Pew Research Center, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf MAPPING THE GLOBAL MUSLIM POPULATION]| PEW FORUM| October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of the population identifying as [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name=BCRPWA/&gt;
Most are adherents of [[Shia Islam]] (approximately 85%&lt;ref&gt;http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), with a minority (15%) being [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]],  differences traditionally have not been defined sharply.&lt;ref name=CIAFB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan - Presidential Library - Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;   Most Shi'a are adherents of [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|orthodox Ithna Ashari]] school of Shi'a Islam. Following many decades of Soviet atheist policy, religious affiliation is nominal in Azerbaijan and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity than religion.  Traditionally villages around Baku and Lenkoran region are considered stronghold of Shi'ism. In some northern regions, populated by Dagestani (Lezghian) people, [[Sunni Islam]] is dominant. Folk Islam is widely practiced but there is little evidence of an organized Sufi movement.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The rest of the population adheres to other faiths or are non-religious, although they are not officially represented.&lt;ref name=CIAFB/&gt; Other traditional religions or beliefs that are followed by many in the country are the Armenian Apostolic Church (in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]), the Russian Orthodox Church, and various other Christian denominations.

Like all other [[post-Soviet states]] formerly ruled by the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]]; article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] ensures the liberty of worship, to choose any faith, or to not practice any religion, and to express one's view on the religion. 
The law of the Republic of Azerbaijan (1992) "On freedom of faith" ensures the right of any human being to determine and express his view on religion and to execute this right. However, a 1996 law states that foreigners have [[freedom of conscience]], but are denied the right to "carry out religious propaganda", i.e., to preach, under the threat of fines or deportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Corley, Felix | date= November 1, 2005| title=AZERBAIJAN: Selective obstruction of foreign religious workers| format= | work= Forum 18 | url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=680| accessdate=2006-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to paragraphs 1-3 of Article 18 of the Constitution the religion acts separately from the government, each religion is equal before the law and the propaganda of religions, abating human personality and contradicting to the principles of humanism is prohibited. At the same time the state system of education is also secular.

==Islam==

{{main|Islam in Azerbaijan}}
Until recently Islam in Azerbaijan was relatively relaxed. Although the vast majority of Azerbaijanis identified themselves as Muslims, surveys in the late Soviet and early post-Soviet era generally found that less than a quarter of those who considered themselves Muslims "had even a basic understanding of the pillars of Islam", according to researchers Emil Souleimanov and Maya Ehrmann.&lt;ref name=RMSARI/&gt; According to a survey conducted in 2000, fewer than 7 percent of respondents considered themselves "firm believers," while just 18 percent confessed observance of [[salat]] (ritual prayer, one of the pillars of Islam).&lt;ref&gt;Anar Valiyev, "[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6401 Azerbaijan: Islam in a Post-Soviet Republic]," ''Meria'', 9, no. 4 (December 2005), accessed June 20, 2012, {{cite web |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue4/jv9no4a1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205051947/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue4/jv9no4a1.html |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }} (dead link).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for many Azerbaijanis, Islam tended toward a more ethnic/nationalistic identity than a purely religious one.&lt;ref name=RMSARI&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Souleimanov|first1=Emil|last2=Ehrmann|first2=Maya|title=The Rise of Militant Salafism in Azerbaijan and Its Regional Implications|journal=Middle East Policy Council|date=Fall 2013|volume=XX|issue=3|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal/middle-east-policy-archives/rise-militant-salafism-azerbaijan-and-its-regional-implications?print|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated four fifths of Muslims in Azerbaijan are [[Shi'as]] of the [[Twelver]] branch. The remainder are [[Sunnis]] belonging to the [[Hanafi]] branch and inhabit primarily the northern and western areas of the republic.&lt;ref name=RMSARI/&gt; [[Folk Islam]] is widely practiced but there is little evidence of an organized [[Sufi]] movement.

After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] all religious organizations fell into depression and split into pieces while the Religious Organization of Transcaucasia Muslims headed by [[akhund]] [[Allahshukur Pashazade]] elected the [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] in 1980 intensified its operation and tried to spread its influence to the entire Caucasus under the name of the Caucasus Muslims Department. The measures to implement these attempts were undertaken at the tenth session of the Caucasus Muslims held in Baku in 1998. The opening of CMD representations in Georgia and Dagestan was one of the significant steps in this field.

The chair of CMD ensures the consequent contacts with Islamic organizations and manages to establish close religious relations with neighbor Muslim countries. To date CMD fulfills the religious needs of the Islamic communities of Azerbaijan, oversees the proper fulfillment of the rituals (in accordance with [[Sharia]]), progresses in training religious workers through the [[Islamic University of Baku]], founded in 1991 and is responsible for all religious events occurring in the country. The faculty of theology of the State University of Baku has been training Islam and theology scientists since 1992.

Through the years of independence the worshipping of holies strengthened in Azerbaijan and the new holy places were set up along with old ones. Bakhailism created its own assembly and expanded yearly.

The relations of the state-religion are regulated by the State Committee for the Work with Religious Associations of Azerbaijan established by the decree of President Heydar Aliyev in 2001.

More recently, some Azerbaijani youths have been drawn increasingly to Islam.&lt;ref name="isn.ethz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=18042|title=Articles / Security Watch / ISN|author=ISN Editors|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some young women in Azerbaijan have decided to dress in [[Islamic]] attire despite the risks associated including being rebuked by university personnel for wearing the [[hijab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=10821|title=Spero NewsHeadscarves provoke controversy in Azerbaijan|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í==

{{main|Bahá'í in Azerbaijan}}

The Bahá'í Faith in Azerbaijan crosses a complex history of regional changes. Before 1850, followers of the predecessor religion [[Bábism]] were established in [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]].&lt;ref name="azer2"&gt;{{Citation| last = Balci | first = Bayram| last2 =  Jafarov | first2 = Azer| title = The Baha’is of the Caucasus: From Russian Tolerance to Soviet Repression {2/3} | newspaper = Caucaz.com | pages = | date =  2007-02-21| url =http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030112438/http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |archive-date=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the Bahá'í community, now centered in [[Baku]], numbered perhaps 2000 individuals and several [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]]&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Baha'i Faith History in Azerbaijan| work =| publisher =National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan| date =| url =http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml| doi =| accessdate =2008-12-22| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120219032306/http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml| archivedate =2012-02-19| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; had facilitated the favorable attention of local and regional,&lt;ref name="azer2"/&gt; and international&lt;ref name="leo"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stendardo | first = Luigi | title = Leo Tolstoy and the Bahá'í Faith | publisher = George Ronald Publisher Ltd | date = 1985-01-30 | location = London, UK | pages =  | url = http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=112 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-0-85398-215-9 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206145304/http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=112 | archivedate = 2008-12-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaders of thought as well as long standing leading figures in the religion.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book

==Christianity==
{{main|Christianity in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Xilaskar Kilsəsi.JPG|thumb|200px|Lutheran [[Church of the Saviour, Baku|Church of the Saviour]] in Baku.]]
The Christian religion began to be spread in Azerbaijan by means of the Caucasus Albania in the first years of the new era in times of Christ's apostles.&lt;ref name="azerbaijan.az"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Religion/traditionReligion_e.html|title=Azerbaijan|website=www.azerbaijan.az|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] is represented by [[Orthodoxy]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] as well as a number of minority communities in Azerbaijan.

[[Christian]]s, who are estimated to number between 280,000-450,000 (3.1%-4.8%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/global-christianity/map.php#/Azerbaijan,ALL|title=Global Christianity|date=1 December 2014|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh).

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{main|Russian Orthodox Church in Azerbaijan}}
Orthodoxy is currently represented in Azerbaijan by the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox]] churches. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]]es are grouped in the Eparchy of Baku and the Caspian region.

Azerbaijan also has eleven [[Molokan]] communities related to the old rituals of Orthodoxy. These communities do not have any church; their dogmas are fixed in a special book of rituals. They oppose the church hierarchy which has a special power.

Carl Gippius`s first work was the St Charles Church in Tallinn and second was Saint Gregory the Illuminator Church in Baku.He dedicated most of his life to construction of churches. In 1903 a library and school were built in the courtyard of the church.

{{main|Church of Caucasian Albania}}
[[File:Jotati Church.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Church of Saint Elisæus (Nij)|Albanian church of Saint Elisæus]] in [[Nij, Azerbaijan|Nij]] ]]
Approximately 6,000 of the 10,000 people of the [[Udi people|Udi]] ethnic community live in Azerbaijan including 4,400 people residing in [[Nij, Azerbaijan|Nij]] village, [[Qabala Rayon|Qabala district]].&lt;ref name=azaz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Religion/traditionReligion_02_e.html|title=RELIGIONS IN PRESENT AZERBAIJAN|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Udis who resided on the territory of the Caspian sea shore, later accepted Christianity and spread this religion in the [[Caucasus Albania]]. The [[church of Kish]] (the Kish village of [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]] district) is one of the major examples of this cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=azaz/&gt;

===Catholic Church===
{{main|Catholic Church in Azerbaijan}}

There is a tiny [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] community in Baku and surroundings, with less than a thousand members.

The Vatican Foreign Minister [[Giovanni Lajolo]] visited [[Baku]] May 19, 2006. During the visit to last till May 25, he met with President [[Ilham Aliyev]] and chairman of the Caucasus Clerical Office, [[Sheikh]] [[Allahshukur Pashazada]] to discuss ties between Azerbaijan and the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://azernews.net/eng/gizli/view.php?d=14932 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601083525/http://www.azernews.net/eng/gizli/view.php?d=14932 |archivedate=2006-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giovanni Lajolo made the following statements: "We are satisfied with the level of friendly communications between Azerbaijan and Vatican". "Azerbaijan really is a place of merge of religions and cultures. We highly estimate tolerance existing here. And we are very glad with intensive development of Azerbaijan. Vatican is interested in expansion of relations with Azerbaijan, and the purpose of my visit to Baku consists in carrying out of exchange by opinions on the further development of our ties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.az/news/politics/26438.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku's Catholic church was demolished in the Stalin era but a new one, started in September 2005, was opened in summer 2007.

==Zoroastrianism==

{{main|Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan|Hinduism in Azerbaijan}}
The history of [[Zoroastrianism]] in Azerbaijan goes back to the first millennium BC. Together with the other territories of the Persian Empire, Azerbaijan remained a predominantly Zoroastrian state until the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab invasion]] in the 7th century. The name Azerbaijan means the "Land of The Eternal Fire" in [[Middle Persian]], a name that is said to have a direct link with Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/07/211_5491.html The Korea Times Azerbaijan Cultural Week Hits South Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;
Today the religion, culture, and traditions of Zoroastrianism remains highly respected in Azerbaijan, and [[Novruz]] continues to be the main holiday in the country. Zoroastrianism has left a deep mark in the history of Azerbaijan. Traces of the religion are still visible in [[Ramana, Azerbaijan|Ramana]], [[Khinalyg]], and [[Yanar Dag]].

[[File:Ateshgah Fire Temple.jpg|thumb|Ateshgah Fire Temple in [[Azerbaijan]]]]
Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan has been tied not to survival of the ancient religion in the area, but a more recent arrival of the [[Parsi]] Zoroastrians coming from the [[British India]], such as from [[Sindh]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjabi]] city of [[Multan]] at the time of the discovery of oil in Baku and the need for expert labor in the 1880s. [[Fire Temple of Baku]] was constructed for their use at the site of an ancient fire temple utilizing the naturally burning gas and oil on the ground. The structure a 
[[chartaqi]] is a standard fire temple of the Zoroastrians for thousands of years.

There are three separate communities of Jews ([[Mountain Jews]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and [[Georgian Jews]]) in Azerbaijan, who total almost 16,000 combined. Of them, 11,000 are Mountain Jews, with concentrations of 6,000 in [[Baku]] and 4,000 in [[Quba]], 4,300 are Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom live in Baku and [[Sumqayit]], and 700 are Georgian Jews. There are three synagogues in Baku and a few in the provinces. Sheikh-ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazade has donated US$40,000 for construction of Jewish House in Baku in 2000.

Very little is known about pre-Christian and pre-Islam Azerbaijani mythology; sources are mostly [[Hellenic studies|Hellenic]] historians like [[Strabo]] and based on archeological evidence. Strabo names the gods of the sun, the sky, and above all, the moon.

{{main|Freedom of religion in Azerbaijan}}

{{main|Irreligion in Azerbaijan}}

The constitution of Azerbaijan provides for freedom of religion, and the law does not allow religious activities to be interfered with unless they endanger public order. Cases of [[anti-Semitism]] in Azerbaijan are rare.

The 2004 U.S. Department of State report on Human Rights in Azerbaijan noted some instances in which freedom of religion was violated, such as interference with the [[Juma Mosque]] due to the political activism of its Imam. All religious organizations are required to register with the government, and groups such as [[Baptists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and members of the [[Assemblies of God]] continue to be denied religious registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90164.htm|title=Azerbaijan|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official web site of Jehovah's Witnesses has documented a number of acts of religious intolerance being committed by the Azerbaijan government against members of Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/302013011|title=Highlights of the Past Year|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]], mosques in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region have been abandoned, and Armenian churches in Azerbaijan have likewise been inactive or damaged in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41670.htm|title=2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Azerbaijan|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the governmental authorities towards Islam is controversial. Men who grow beards more than normal are often viewed with suspicion by the authorities,  for fear of the propagation of [[Wahhabism]].&lt;ref name="isn.ethz.ch"/&gt;  Despite the government's denial of the matter, the Azerbaijani police drew criticism from lawyers for infringing the rights of observant Muslims.&lt;ref name="isn.ethz.ch"/&gt;

However the 2009 Religion Law requires the compulsory re-registration of all religious groups.&lt;ref name="forum18.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1578|title=Forum 18 Archive: AZERBAIJAN: Communities to be forced to begin re-registration again? - 8 June 2011|author=Forum 18 News Service|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of religious groups that have been granted re-registration are Muslim. Hundreds of others are still waiting to hear from the authorities.&lt;ref name="forum18.org"/&gt;

Rome has, for more than two millennia, been an important worldwide centre for religion, particularly the [[Roman Catholic]] strain of [[Christianity]]. The city is commonly regarded as the "home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]", owing to the ecclesiastical doctrine of the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]]. Today, there are also other religions common in Rome, including [[Islam]].

==Classical period==
{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome}}
The ''[[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]]'' (literally, the "Roman Religion") constituted the major religion of the city in [[Ancient Rome|antiquity]]. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were Jupiter, the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus]] and Remus, according to tradition. The goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] became an important part of the Roman Pantheon at an early stage of the Roman Monarchy.  The goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] joined Roman Pantheon during the Monarchy times as the central goddess uniting worship between Rome and several of its neighbors, thus creating the basis for a coalition. The goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was imported to Rome from the ancient city of Veii, after Veii fell to the Roman military, following a long period of wars between the two cities, during the time of the Roman Republic. Other gods and goddesses were honored in Rome and added to the Pantheon throughout the Monarchy and Republic periods.  See Livy, Books 1-5.

The Roman religion was largely concerned with interpreting divine messages (augeries) through natural occurrences (omens). However, Rome had no augerers of its own, and largely relied upon [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] augerers to interpret the divine omens.  For this reason, Rome was left without any augerers during its last war with Veii, and Etruscan city, and was forced to send envoys all the way to Greece, to consult the famous [[Delphi#Oracle|Oracle at Delphi]]. Livy, Book 5.

Several other religions and imported [[mystery cult]]s remained represented within its ever-expanding boundaries during the Roman Republic and Empire periods, including [[Judaism]], whose presence in the city dates back from the [[Roman Republic]] and was sometimes forcibly confined to the [[Roman Ghetto]], as well as [[Mithraism]] which was the official religion of the Roman Empire for about two centuries, until being superseded by [[Christianity]], following the death of Emperor Constantine in the 4th century. Christianity was made the [[official religion]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in 380 by Emperor [[Theodosius I]], allowing it to spread further and eventually wholly replace Mithraism in the Roman Empire.

==Christianity==
[[Image:Santa Maria Maggiore (Rome) frontview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the city's earliest basilicas.]]
Rome became the pre-eminent [[Christian]] city (vis-a-vis [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], and later [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem]]) based on the tradition that [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] were [[martyr]]ed in the city during the 1st century, coupled with the city's political importance. The [[Bishop of Rome]], later known as the [[Pope]], claimed primacy over all Bishops and therefore all Christians on the basis that he is the successor of [[Saint Peter]], upon whom [[Jesus]] built his Church; his prestige had been enhanced since 313 through donations by Roman emperors and patricians, including the [[Lateran Palace]] and patriarchal basilicas, as well as the obviously growing influence of the Church over the failing civil imperial authority. Papal authority has been exercised over the centuries with varying degrees of success, at times triggering divisions among Christians, until the present.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
With the increasing chaos and disorder leading to the collapse of the Roman Empire in 476, the popes assumed more and more civil authority first in Rome and in the surrounding territories. Rome became the center of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[capital city]] of the [[Papal States]]; consequently, a great number of churches, convents and other religious buildings were erected in the city, sometimes above the ruins of older pre-Christian sites of worship. [[Churches of Rome|Churches proliferated]] during the Renaissance, when the Rome's most notable churches were built (this includes [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] [[basilica]] on the [[Vatican Hill]] (the largest church in the world) and the city [[cathedral]] of [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St. John]] at the [[Lateran]]. The [[Papacy]] established its residence first in the [[Lateran Palace]], then in the [[Quirinal Palace]]. When Rome was annexed by force to the newly unified [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] In 1870, [[Pope Pius IX]] retired to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], proclaiming himself a prisoner of the [[House of Savoy|Savoy monarchy]] and leading to decades of conflict between the neonate state and the Catholic Church. This was resolved in 1929, when the [[Lateran Treaty]] were signed in Rome, establishing the right for the [[Holy See]] to govern the [[Vatican City]] as an independent, [[sovereign state]]. The [[patron saint]]s of Rome remain [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] (or, as they are collectively referred to in this context, "the most holy Saints Peter and Paul"), both celebrated on June 29.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Vatican City===
{{Main|Vatican City}}
[[Image:Sãopedro1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[St. Peter's Square]] and the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica]].]]
The city of Rome surrounds the Vatican City, the [[enclave]] of the [[Holy See]], which is a separate sovereign state. It hosts [[Saint Peter's Square]] with the [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/ |title=Vatican |website=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open space before the basilica was redesigned by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], from 1656 to 1667, under the direction of [[Pope Alexander VII]], as an appropriate forecourt, designed "so that the greatest number of people could see the Pope give his blessing, either from the middle of the façade of the church or from a window in the Vatican Palace" (Norwich, 1975, p.175). In Vatican City there are also the prestigious [[Vatican Library]], [[Vatican Museums]] with the [[Sistine Chapel]], the [[Raphael Rooms]] and other important works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Giotto]], and [[Botticelli]].

==Judaism==
[[File:Syn rome.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rome Synagogue]].]]
{{Expand section|date=August 2013}}

[[Judaism]] has been present in Rome since classical antiquity and Rome is the only city in Europe that has had a constant presence of Jews since the establishment of the Roman Empire.

==Islam==
In recent years, the [[Islam]]ic community has grown significantly, in great part due to [[immigration]] from [[North Africa]]n and [[Middle East]]ern countries into the city. As a result of this trend, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the largest [[Mosque of Rome|mosque]] in [[Europe]], which was designed by [[architect]] [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on June 21, 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4254">'''Ripheus''' (also '''Rifeo''' and '''Rupheo''') was a [[Troy|Trojan]] hero and the name of a figure from the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]]. A comrade of [[Aeneas]], he was a Trojan who was killed defending his city against the [[Greeks]]. "Ripheus also fell," Virgil writes, "uniquely the most just of all the Trojans, the most faithful preserver of equity; but the gods decided otherwise" (Virgil, ''Aeneid'' II, 426–8). Ripheus's righteousness was not rewarded by the gods.

==Ripheus in later works==

===Dante===
In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante]] placed Ripheus in Heaven, in the sixth sphere of [[Jupiter]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'', Canto XX:1–72&lt;/ref&gt; the realm of those who personified [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Cantos 18 through 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, he provides an interesting foil to Virgil himself---whom Dante places in the first circle of Hell, with the pagans and the unbaptized---even though Virgil is a major character in the ''Commedia'' and for much of it remains Dante's guide through Hell and Purgatory.  Although Ripheus would also technically be a pagan, he is in Heaven for the virtues he exhibited.

===Boccaccio===
In [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Il Filostrato]]'' (1333–1339), Ripheus is named as one of the Trojans taken prisoner by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Filostrato'', IV.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaucer===
''Il Filostrato'' served as the basis for [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''.  In it, Ripheo is mentioned as being unable to prevent [[Antenor (Greek mythology)|Antenor]] from being taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;''Troilus and Cressida'', Book IV.50–56&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Rupheo'', he appears once, in final rhyming position.&lt;ref&gt;''Troilus and Criseyde'', Book IV.53&lt;/ref&gt;

===João de Barros===
João de Barros, who later became one of the main Portuguese historians of the 16th century, while still a young man of the court of King [[Emanuel I of Portugal|Manuel]], wrote a [[romance fiction|chivalry romanche]] called ''A Chronica do Emperador Clarimundo'' (''The Chronicle of Emperor Clarimundo''), in which it is reported that [[Tróia Peninsula|Tróia, Portugal]] was founded by a Trojan called Ripheus (in 16th-century Portuguese ''Riphane''), who escaped the destruction of his city with the group of [[Aeneas]], from which it split, and moved across the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic until reaching the [[Setúbal Peninsula]]. There, Ripheus/Riphane's group engaged in a war with a party of Greeks led by [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] that established itself in what now is [[Lisbon]], on the opposite side of the [[Tagus river]]. This 'transplanted' Greek-Trojan war continued for some generations after the death of this Ripheus.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronica do Emperador Clarimundo'', pages [http://purl.pt/6277/3/l-1006-a_PDF/l-1006-a_PDF_01-B-R0150/l-1006-a_0017_369-398_t01-B-R0150.pdf 396]-[http://purl.pt/6277/3/l-1006-a_PDF/l-1006-a_PDF_01-B-R0150/l-1006-a_0018_399-425_t01-B-R0150.pdf 404] ('''16th-century Portuguese''')&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if this Ripheus/Riphane is the same as the one of Virgil, and the authors previously referred to, or just a similarly named Trojan countryman of the most famous Ripheus (the fact that de Barros makes no clear references to the known deeds of the Trojan war past of Ripheus in his book and that in the original myth Ripheus fell in the Greek conquest of the town seems to go against it, but possibly de Barros is basing himself in the Boccaccio tradition of Ripheus having been taken as prisoner by the Greeks having possibly escaped subsequently, and the fact that de Barros refers to Riphane as being morally impressive seem to make an identification of Riphane and Ripheus possible. It could be also debated that post-classical versions of myths making characters dead in the Trojan War survive after it is not unusual, [[Astyanax#Survival|being also told about Hector's son Astyanax to make him survive to found the ancient Gauls and Franks]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21874">The '''salamander letter''' is a document about the history of the [[Latter-day Saint movement]] that was created by the forger [[Mark Hofmann]] in the early 1980s.

The letter was one of hundreds of documents concerning the history of LDS movement that surfaced in the early 1980s. The salamander letter presented a view of Latter-day Saint founder [[Joseph Smith]]'s life that stood sharply at odds with the commonly accepted version of the early progression of the church Smith established.

Initially accepted by some document experts and collectors, and rejected by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the salamander letter generated much discussion and debate inside and outside the Latter-day Saint movement. [[Kenneth W. Rendell]] lent credence to it by stating that the ink, paper and postmark were all consistent with the period; he concluded that "there is no indication that the document is a forgery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2005|pp=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The document was later demonstrated to be a forgery created by Hofmann, who had been responsible for the "discovery" of many other notable documents.  Rendell then recast his conclusion, stating that while there was "the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rendell|1994|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The contents of the letter implied a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] aspect to Smith's life, a controversial subject debated amongst scholars of Latter-day Saint history. The salamander letter was supposedly written by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] to [[William Wines Phelps]], an early convert in the Latter-day Saint movement. Harris served for a short period of time as scribe for the translation of the [[golden plates]], and assisted in the financing of the first printing of the [[Book of Mormon]]. A statement by Harris appears in the front of the [[Book of Mormon]] concerning his involvement in its translation.

The letter presented a version of the recovery of the golden plates which contrasted with the "orthodox" version of events as related by Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saint movement, which would have, if true, confirmed some controversial aspects of Smith's life. Smith had been accused of "treasure digging" and use of a "[[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]]".

According to this letter, when Smith dug up the plates a "salamander" appeared, which transformed itself into a spirit that refused to give Smith the plates unless his brother [[Alvin Smith (Mormon)|Alvin Smith]] was also present. This would have been very difficult, as Alvin was dead at the time of the alleged appearance.  This reference may have been an attempt by Hofmann to associate the recovery of the gold plates to a rumor that Alvin's grave was dug up by Smith's family to use Alvin's remains in a magical ceremony.

Hofmann's use of a [[salamander]] drew upon legends about certain animals having supernatural powers. Hofmann may have been inspired by an early anti-Mormon work ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]''  (1834), which claimed that a toad-like animal was rumored to have appeared to Smith in conjunction with the recovery of the plates.

:Yours Respectfully
:Martin Harris

==Authenticity==
The letter was deemed authentic by experienced document examiners, a testimony to Hofmann's superior forgery techniques. The letter also seemed to support the opinions of [[Reed Durham]], [[D. Michael Quinn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others regarding "magical" aspects of Smith's religious experiences.  Hofmann's disenchantment with the LDS Church may have played a role in his selection of subject matter to forge.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The more sensational and controversial the subject, the higher its potential market value, but in addition, the content would act to cast suspicion on the Latter Day Saint origins.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Purchase and publicity==
[[File:1860 Utah $10 gold piece.jpeg|thumb|A Mormon gold piece]]
The letter was initially offered to [[Don Schmidt]] of the [[Church Historical Department]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) on January 3, 1984, by Lyn Jacobs, who wanted to trade it for a $10 Mormon gold piece. Jacobs told Schmidt that he got the letter from a collector in the east, referred by Mark Hofmann. Jacobs later changed his offer to a trade for a copy of a [[Book of Commandments]]. This offer was also rejected. Jacobs also suggested that Brent Ashworth might have an interest in it, although Hofmann had already showed a transcript of it to him and he had declared it to be fake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The contents of the letter also seemed too similar to Howe's ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'' to others in the church Historical Department. The letter was also offered to other interested parties, including [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], prominent critics of Mormonism. Although the letter seemingly bolstered the Tanners' claims against the church, they expressed doubts as to its authenticity. A deal with the LDS Church was never reached. Hofmann finally sold the letter to Steven F. Christensen on January 6, 1984 for $40,000. Christensen wanted to try to authenticate it and then donate it to the LDS Church.

In ''[[Church News]]'' on April 28, 1985, the LDS Church revealed the contents of the salamander letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turley|1992|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about this same time, the church also released a letter to its high school [[Seminary (LDS Church)|seminary]] program for youth, suggesting that seminary teachers not encourage debate about the salamander letter, but that they should tactfully answer genuine questions on the subject. [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|FARMS]] (a research group composed of LDS scholars, but which at the time had no formal connection to the LDS Church) published several articles which examined the Salamander Letter, such as "Why Might a Person in 1830 Connect an Angel With a Salamander?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|loc=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspicion and resolution==
Hofmann drew suspicion for discovering so many astounding documents that others had missed, including the so-called "[[Oath of a Freeman]]", which he was attempting to sell to the [[Library of Congress]].

By early 1984, Jerald Tanner concluded there was significant doubt as to the salamander letter's authenticity.  He even went as far as to publish an attack on the document, which surprised many scholars and students since this and other "discoveries" of important Mormon documents by Hofmann often appeared to bolster the Tanners' own arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schindler|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1984, Jerald Tanner questioned the authenticity of most if not all of Hofmann's "discoveries", based in large part on their unproven provenance. The Tanners did concur with Hofmann in contending that the LDS Church's apparent inability to discern the forged documents was evidence against church leadership being [[Revelation|divinely inspired]]. John Tvedtnes, an LDS scholar, responded with Joseph Smith's statement that "a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such," and that purchasing historical materials is a business activity rather than a prophetic undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tvedtnes|1994|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also asserted{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} that the LDS leaders do not claim [[infallibility]] and that the church's efforts to obtain and archive historically significant material extend to works even by [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] authors.

Hofmann was struggling under massive debt and falling behind on delivering on deals that he had made. In 1985, when he learned that the pedigree of the salamander letter was under widespread suspicion, he produced and a placed a number of bombs as a diversionary tactic. They were detonated with mercury switches, but without a safety switch. Two people were killed: Christensen at his office, the main target; and Kathleen Sheets at her home. That bomb was intended as a diversion, to draw off investigators. Hofmann himself was subsequently injured when a third bomb went off prematurely in his car. That bomb exploded in a way that most of the blast did not hit Hofmann. The police investigated these bombings, and during a search of Hofmann's home found a studio in the basement where he could create counterfeited documents as well as a semi-automatic carbine which had been converted to full automatic fire.  Many of the documents Hofmann sold or donated were proven to be forgeries by a new forensic technique developed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], chiefly to detect his forgeries. The [[Salt Lake City Police Department]] used Utah State special agent and forensic examiner George Throckmorton and Arizona document examiner William Flynn to examine a poem supposedly written by Harris and placed in his old [[Book of Common Prayer]] and determined it had actually been created by Hofmann.  Hofmann used the poem to authenticate the writing in the salamander letter.  Although this was enough proof by itself that the letter was a forgery, Throckmorton and Flynn bolstered their case by getting in touch with Frances Magee, the widow of a descendant of Robert Harris.  Magee's family had owned the book for many years, and Magee told investigators that she'd never seen the poem before.  She suspected someone had planted it there after she sold the book.  Hofmann ultimately pleaded guilty to his forgeries and murders, and was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lindsey|1988}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church leaders, especially [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] member [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], continued to field criticism for some time for "being duped" and being "unable to discern the evil intentions of a man like Hofmann". Hinckley later noted: "I accepted him to come into my office on a basis of trust .... I frankly admit that Hofmann tricked us. He also tricked experts from New York to Utah, however .... I am not ashamed to admit that we were victimized. It is not the first time the Church has found itself in such a position. Joseph Smith was victimized again and again. The Savior was victimized. I am sorry to say that sometimes it happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dew|1996|p=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting effects==

More than twenty years later, effects of the letter still lingered. The letter was referenced in research by both Mormons and critics of Mormonism alike.  Resulting publications that include conclusions based on the presumption that the letter was authentic are still available and may influence the opinions of those seeking information on "deep Mormon doctrine" or evidence to support a naturalistic or magical historical view of Mormonism or Joseph Smith. In addition, Hofmann produced and sold several other documents relating to significant events in Latter Day Saint history which were fake.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[Grant H. Palmer]], author of the book ''[[An Insider's View of Mormon Origins]]'' stated that his work was influenced in part by his original acceptance of the salamander letter as being valid and supportive of his view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Midgley|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer stated that the "salamander letter" caused him to explore Joseph Smith's "mystical mindset".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Palmer|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salamander letter also influenced the content of the film ''[[The God Makers II (Film)|The God Makers II]]'', an alleged exposé of Mormonism. The film suggests that Joseph Smith was required to dig up his brother Alvin's body and bring a part of it with him to the hill [[Cumorah]] in order to obtain the [[golden plates]] from which the [[Book of Mormon]] was said to be translated.  Jerald and Sandra Tanner refuted this suggestion, and determined that the only known source of such a requirement would have been the salamander letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|Tanner|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samavasarana.jpg|thumb|Samavasarana of Tirthankara]]
{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Samavasarana''' or '''Samosharana''' ("Refuge to All") is the divine preaching hall of the [[Tirthankara]]. The word ''samavasarana'' is derived from two words, ''sama'', meaning general and ''avasara'', meaning opportunity. It is a place where all have an opportunity to acquire wisdom.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=97}} The divine pavilion is built by heavenly beings (''[[Deva (Jainism)|devas]]'') after the ''tirthankara'' attain omniscience (''[[Kevala Jnana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/jainism/jains.html Jains&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of Samavasaranas has been popular in [[Jain art]].{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|p=184}}

== Hall ==
[[File:Lord Risbabhdev in Samosharan on Mount Kailash.jpg|thumb|right|Samosharana of Tirthankara [[Rishabha]] ([[Ajmer Jain temple]])]]
In samavasarana, the ''tirthankara'' sits on a throne without touching it (about two inches above it).{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=95}} Around the tirthankara sit the ''[[ganadhara]]s'' (chief disciples). Living beings sit in the following order:{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=96}}
*In the first hall, [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]]
*In the second hall, one class of [[Deva (Jainism)|deva]] ladies
*In the third hall, ''[[aryika]]s'' (nuns) and laywomen
*In the next three halls, three other classes of deva ladies
*In the next four halls, the four classes of devas (heavenly beings)
*Men, in the eleventh hall
*Animals, in the last hall

According to Jain texts, there would be four wide roads with four huge columns, [[Manasthamba]] (literally, pride pillar), one in each side.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=93}} The total size of the hall varies depending upon the height of the people in that era. The size of [[Rishabha]]deva's samavasarana was {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainworld.com/JWFrench/jainworld/jainbooks/tirthankar/apendex-14.htm|title=APPENDIX 14|work=jainworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
[[File:Tirthankara Samosharan.jpg|thumb|Samavasarana]]
In samavasarana, a tirthankara sits facing the east, but appears to be looking in all directions.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=96}} Tirthankara sits on a soft cushion while preaching the [[Jain philosophy]] in plain terms.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=98}} All [[human]]s and [[animal]]s can understand the discourse. Jain scriptures say that all creatures who listen would become [[Ahimsa in Jainism|less violent]] and [[Aparigraha|less greedy]].{{sfn|Pramansagar|2008|p = 39-43}} The speech of the tirthankara is distinctly heard by every one present.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=96}}

The relationship between '''Scientology and other religions''' is very complex. While [[Scientology]] claims that it is fully compatible with all existing major world religions and that it does not conflict with them or their religious practices, there are major differences in beliefs and practices between Scientology and most religions, especially the major [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions. Members are not allowed to engage in other similar mental therapies or procedures, religious or otherwise.&lt;ref name="Steve_Bruce"&gt;Steve Bruce: ''Cathedrals to cults: the evolving forms of the religious life''. In: Paul Heelas (Hrsg.): ''Religion, Modernity, and Postmodernity'', Blackwell, Oxford 1998, pp. 19-35, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some ministers from other churches have adopted some Scientology secular programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/02/18/Worldandnation/Scientology_awards_re.shtml Scientology awards reach out to black community] ROBERT FARLEY, St. Petersburg Times, February 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Matt |last= Sedensky |title= Unlikely allies |url= http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/aug/25/Unlikely-allies/ |work= [[Associated Press|AP]] |publisher= [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |date= 2007-08-25 |accessdate= 2007-08-30 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901004306/http://knoxnews.com/news/2007/aug/25/Unlikely-allies/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacob Neusner]], Scientology is a "synthesis of existing ideas and a reflection of particular cultural, social, and historical circumstances in which it was born and developed". The religion reflects Western and American values, such as "beliefs in democracy, individualism, and freedom", while borrowing little from religions based on the Bible. Similarities exist between Scientology and eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition=4 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
The Church of Scientology has capitalized on the religion's similarity to Buddhism to win followers in historically Buddhist-influenced countries like [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="taibud"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/scientology-in-taiwan/493493/|title=The Curious Rise of Scientology in Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Frank K. Flinn called Scientology technological Buddhism, however, it can be differentiated from Buddhist asceticism as its aim is not the eradication of pain through the removal of desire or detaching oneself from the world. Furthermore, it has nothing in common with Buddhist prayer offerings; it is not contemplative, but action-oriented and practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Dericquebourg |first=Regis |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Affinities between Scientology and Theosophy |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church of England==
The [[Church of England]] complained in March 2003 to the Advertising Standards Authority about the Church's advertising poster promoting Narconon—the drug rehabilitation program based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. The poster claimed "250,000 people salvaged from drugs." The Church of England Diocese of Birmingham challenged the claim. Upholding the complaint, the ASA considered that, "without clarification, readers were likely to interpret the claim '250,000 people salvaged from drugs' to mean that 250,000 people had stopped being dependent on street or prescription drugs because of Scientology. The Authority "accepted that more than 250,000 people had undertaken the Church's Drug Purification and Drug Rundown programs, which were designed to free people from the effects of taking drugs," but "the Authority understood that, within Scientology, the concept of 'drug use' referred to a variety of behaviors that ranged from heavy use of street drugs to occasional ingestion of alcohol or prescription medicines and exposure to chemical toxins."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=35676 Advertising Standards Authority record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041255/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=35676 |date=2007-09-28 }} of successful Church of England complaint about Narconon advertisement&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Diocese of Birmingham|Diocese of Birmingham]] objected to Scientology using space in the community centre allotted for religious use. The Diocese pointed out that Scientology does not have religious status in the UK: "Scientology has rightly been refused recognition as a religion by the UK Charity Commissioners" in the words of a Diocese spokesman.&lt;ref name="Diocese"&gt;{{cite web |first= James |last= Cartledge |title= Church anger at 'cult' space |url= http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/tm_method=full%26objectid=14177182%26siteid=50002-name_page.html |work= [[Birmingham Mail|Evening Mail]] |publisher= |date= 2004-04-24 |accessdate= 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diocese also stated that Scientology is "as much a religion as a dog is a vegetable."&lt;ref name="Diocese"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
[[Maximos (Aghiorgoussis)|Maximos Aghiorgoussis]], the [[bishop]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] in Pittsburgh, has stated that Scientology is not in fact a "church", but rather a [[gnosticism|gnostic]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] system of thought. He went on to say that there are at least six serious points of contention between the two groups, including:
*the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] nature of Scientology,
*Scientology's contention that the individual is a noncorporeal, semi-divine "[[thetan]]," which runs contrary to the Greek Orthodox view that the individual is both body and soul and, while created in the image of God, not a god himself,
*Scientology's belief that the universe is the "result of a game of the thetans", rather than the account of the [[Genesis creation narrative]],
*Scientology's belief that the thetan can be saved through the clearing of its [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], which differs from the [[salvation (Christianity)|Christian view of salvation]] being only through Christ, and
*Scientology's view that death is "of no consequence and significance because death is repeated innumerable times", which runs contrary to the Christian view of a single physical incarnation.

He also states that "Scientology teaches that psychic powers, (evil) spirits, and out-of-body events can be used in order for the thetans to rediscover their true powers. Because of this, there have been parallels drawn between Scientology and [[occultism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. He goes on to say that, in spite of Scientology's claims to enhance mental health, that many people have already been damaged by Dianetics. Calling upon what he describes as "unclean spirits", the inexperience of those who do [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] cause "hallucination, irrational behavior, severe disorientation, strange bodily sensations, physical and mental illness, unconsciousness, and suicide. Hubbard admitted most of the above hazards, 'although he maintained that they occurred only through misapplication of the technology of Scientology'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=67293442&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientld=39419&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD "The challenge of metaphysical experiences outside Orthodoxy and the Orthodox response"] at ProQuest&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2001, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] criticized Scientologists, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unificationism|Unificationists]], and [[Mormonism|Mormons]] as being dangerous "totalitarian sects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/english/archive/0105/ZE010503.htm#5134 "Russian Orthodox Targets 'Totalitarian Sects'"] at [[Zenit News Agency]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060708213901/http://zenit.org/english/archive/0105/ZE010503.htm#5134 Archive copy] at the [[Internet Archive Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran Church==
The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in Germany has criticized Scientology's activities and doctrines, along with those of several other religious movements. According to the U.S. State Department's 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, "The Lutheran Church also characterizes [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the Jehovah's Witnesses, the [[Church of Christ]], [[Christian Scientists]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and the [[Johannische Church]] as 'sects,' but in less negative terms than it does Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41683.htm "2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Germany"] at [[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic Church==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has not made official doctrinal pronouncements specifically related to Scientology, however Cardinal Marc Ouellet stated "Scientology is something else. For me, this community is not a Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bussières |first= Ian |title= Scientologie: "Ce n'est pas une Église" - Mgr Ouellet |work= [[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]] |publisher= [[Power Corporation of Canada]] |date= February 5, 2009 |url= http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/200902/04/01-824289-scientologie-ce-nest-pas-une-eglise-mgr-ouellet.php |accessdate= 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain beliefs that are widely associated with Scientology, such as [[reincarnation]], are specifically rejected by the Catholic Church as being incompatible with Catholic belief and practice. Scientology is also, according to a number of religious scholars, a form of [[gnosticism]], which would make it hard to reconcile with Roman Catholicism and other denominations that regard gnosticism as a [[Christian heresy|heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tirdad |last=Derakhshani |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/special_packages/sunday_review/12042623.htm |title=Spirituality through therapy |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2006-07-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New religious movement scholar Douglas E. Cowan compares the basic auditing session in Scientology to the Roman Catholic confessional. He writes, “the auditing session is about confession – the discovery, revelation, and absolution of critical life experiences.” He differentiates the two, however, the confession is mediated by the physicality of the screen and auditing is mediated by the e-meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Cowan |first=Douglas E. |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Clearly Material: Objects, Meaning, and the Ongoing Construction of New Religious Reality |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nation of Islam==
Scientology’s relationship with the [[Nation of Islam]] is related to its inclusivity of other denominations, according to scholar Donald A. Westbrook. This relationship developed since 2009, with 4000 members of the NOI receiving introductory training as auditors with the endorsement of NOI Leader Louis Farrakhan.&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first1=Donald A. |title=Handbook of Scientology |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Nation of Islam (NOI) announced in an official newspaper that an estimated 700 NOI members have become certified Hubbard Dianetics Auditors, with more NOI members soon to be trained in Scientology techniques.&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"&gt;reference: https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/06/07/black-supremacist-nation-islam-pushes-white-dominated-scientology&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrakhan is known to encourage his congregation to read Dianetics and receive training for auditing. Eliza Gray comments on a comparison and contrast of the two religions, asserting that “at the core of both religions is a never-ending pursuit of a better self. In the case of Scientology, that best self is ‘clear’ of residual traumas buried in the subconscious. In the Nation [of Islam], that self is free of hang-ups of white culture that black people have internalized to their detriment.” Farrakhan has taught his followers to seek truth wherever it is contained, despite the inherent contradiction of following Hubbard’s teaching while he poses resistance to the “whites.” He declares to his followers that L. Ron Hubbard has made “white people better than they are,” describing Hubbard’s Dianetics as a way for “whites to expunge themselves from ‘devilish’ qualities.”&lt;ref&gt;reference: https://newrepublic.com/article/108205/scientology-joins-forces-with-nation-of-islam&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrakhan supports Hubbard’s spiritual technology, including auditing, which he claims is a “vital tool” for the awakening of his people. Leah Nelson writes that Farrakhan “has been telling his followers to embrace Scientology in order to move closer to perfection in preparation for the end times.”&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"/&gt; Farrakhan has commented on the complementary and supplementary role that Scientology has on NOI. He does not necessarily view Dianetics training as conversion into Scientology, rather, he views Hubbard’s technologies as tools for “black empowerment and betterment which contribute to his particular theological vision for Muslims in America,” as Donald A. Westbrook writes.&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

Speculating on the curious embracement by Farrakhan of Scientology doctrine, Chip Berlet of the Southern Poverty Law Center, hypothesizes: “The possibility exists that Farrakhan sees his followers as not ‘clear’ enough to make contact with the ‘Mothership.&lt;ref&gt;reference: "Clearing the Planet: The Adoption of the Teachings of L. Ron Hubbard by Louis Farrakhan, and its Significance for the Eschatology of the Nation of Islam” by Jacob Michael King, Claremont Graduate University, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Williams asserts that just like NOI, Scientology is a “very rationalized or modern religion.” Jacob Michael King states that both religions are “engaged in reframing traditional spiritual ideas, and both employ scientific language in an attempt to “modernize” elements seen as outdated.” Dianetic Auditing runs parallel with NOI’s determination of the knowledge of self. “While self-knowledge in the NOI offers the believer an identity as part of a collective, auditing through ‘locating areas of spiritual distress… and improving their condition’ purports to free the individual to determine herself and to better author her own destiny,” states Jacob King.&lt;ref&gt;reference: Willms, Gerald. “Scientology: ‘Modern Religion’ or ‘Religion of Modernity’?” In Scientology, ed. James R. Lewis (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), Nook Edition, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Chicago, Inglewood, Hollywood and Clearwater are the loci of NOI Dianetics training. The Church of Scientology Community Center in Inglewood also functions as a Sunday meeting place for NOI members. Scientologists have also worked with NOI-lead initiatives to reduce crime rites in the Los Angeles inner cites, using the Scientology-sponosored program [[The Way to Happiness]].&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

==Hubbard's definition of religion==
In 1970, Hubbard offered an old-fashioned view of religion that included some broad ideas: “In a few words, religion can be defined as belief in spiritual beings. More broadly, religion can be defined as a system of beliefs and practices by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of human life. The quality of being religious implies two things: first, a belief that evil, pain, bewilderment and injustice are fundamental facts of existence; second, a set of practices and related sanctified beliefs that express a conviction that man can ultimately be saved from those facts.”&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Religions and Religious History in the Works of L. Ron Hubbard |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |year=2016 |last=Frenschkowski |first=Marco|doi=10.5840/asrr20166620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious compatibility==
Scientology's claim of religious compatibility to entry-level Scientologists is soon modified by the additional teaching that the various levels of spiritual process which can be reached through Scientology are more advanced than those attainable in other religions. The major [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions and Scientology share the claim of [[Universality (philosophy)|Universality]] of their belief system which precludes compatibility in the view of most scholars.&lt;ref name="Steve_Bruce" /&gt; Critics point out that, within Scientology, "spiritual abilities" tends to be synonymous with "mystical powers" rather than with "inner peace." Hubbard himself cautioned against the unwise or improper use of powers in his book ''History of Man''.

In its application for tax-exempt status in the United States, the Church of Scientology International states:

{{cquote|Although there is no policy or Scriptural mandate expressly requiring Scientologists to renounce other religious beliefs or membership in other churches, as a practical matter Scientologists are expected to and do become fully devoted to Scientology to the exclusion of other faiths. As Scientologists, they are required to look only to Scientology Scriptures for the answers to the fundamental questions of their existence and to seek enlightenment only from Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Response to Final Series of IRS Questions Prior to Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) As a Church, October 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard discussed Buddhism in an early 1952 lecture in London, speaking about Buddhist reincarnation stories, about the Christian God and other religious topics. While theologian Marco Frenschkowski claims that Hubbard may have been experimenting with ways Scientology is similar to Buddhism, some scholars such as [[Frank A. Flinn]] and Stephen A. Kent interpret the Scientology founder's "reverence for Buddhism as a rather awkward response to external pressure." Hubbard clarified that Scientology is not a neo-Buddhist group.&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt; Scientology and Buddhism differ in that in Scientology there is no concept of Nirvana. According to religious scholar Aldo Natale Terrin, in Buddhism, adherents aim to the suppression of the mind which is in direct opposition to the Scinetologist idea of "transparency to himself".&lt;ref name="Terrin 2014"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Terrin |first=Aldo Natale |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Scientology and Its Contiguity with Gnostic Religion and Eastern Religions |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard sometimes identified himself with [[Maitreya]] (Metteya in [[Pali]]), a [[prophecy|prophesied]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of the future. This identification is made most strongly in his 1955–1956 poem ''[[Hymn of Asia]]'',&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt; which begins with the line "Am I Metteyya?" and emphasizes certain traits of Hubbard that the editors of the publication said matched traits predicted by the "Metteya Legend," such as Metteya appearing in the West, having golden hair or red hair (Hubbard was red-haired), and appearing in a time of world peril, with the earliest of the predicted dates for his return being 2,500 years after [[Gautama Buddha]], or roughly 1950. According to the sociologist [[Stephen A. Kent]], however, the traits which the editors say are predicted by the "Metteya Legend" either are not actually present in the Buddhist texts or in some cases are contradicted by the texts: instead of coming at a time of world peril, for instance, the predictions about Maitreya say he will be born to royalty whose domain is "mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded and well fed," and rather than having hair "like flames," Kent says that the texts predict curly black hair for the Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kent |first=Stephen A. |authorlink=Stephen A. Kent |year=1996 |title=Scientology's Relationship With Eastern Religious Traditions |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=21 |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology's%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |accessdate=2007-03-31 |doi=10.1080/13537909608580753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revealed beliefs in Scientology at higher levels become increasingly contradictory with the world's major religions. The concept of past lives in Scientology is at odds with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Beliefs concerning the origins and age of the Earth, the root of evil, and the nature of man make it impossible to uphold the beliefs of most other religions while also being a Scientologist. Hubbard claimed that Islam was the result of an extraterrestrial memory implant, called the Emanator, of which the [[Kaaba]] is supposedly an artifact. Mainstream religions, in his view, had failed to realize their objectives: "It is all very well to idealize poverty and associate wisdom with begging bowls, or virtue with low estate. However, those who have done this (Buddhists, Christians, Communists, and other fanatics) have dead ended or are dead ending."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, HCO PL of January 21, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of the [[Fishman Affidavit]] pertaining to Operating Thetan level VIII put forward that Hubbard said that [[Jesus]] was a [[pederast]]. The Church of Scientology has consistently held this section of the Fishman Affidavit to be a [[forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karin Spaink]]. The Fishman Affidavit: introduction. Retrieved 2008-02-29. [http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/fishman/index2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Richard Holloway writes that the underlying principle in Scientology is the ancient Hindu doctrine of reincarnation or samsara, but without nirvana. Scientologists believe in the immortality of souls that travel from one body to another in a span of a trillion years, without final salvation or damnation. “There is only the eternal return of life after life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first1=Richard |title=A Little History of Religion |publisher=Yale University Press |date=September 20, 2016 |isbn=978-0300208832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Aldo Natale Terrin describes the similarity of Scientology and Gnostic thought, comparing the convergent concepts of the “Thetan” (spiritual) of Scientology and the “Demiurge” or half-god of Gnostic religion. Both the thetan and demiurge struggle against the [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]], there are stages of ascent (as in the [[Operating Thetan]] stages) just as the equivalent “ascent” of the demiurge or soul. Terrin also mentions the parallelism of Gnostic thought, Buddhism and Scientology, where the idea of “mindfulness” in Buddhism is similar to the Gnostic thought of “awareness.” Scientology’s version of mindfulness is the “transparency of the spirit.” Frank Flinn stresses that the similarities between Buddhism and Scientology include the following: (1) “Knowing for oneself,” or “personal experience” as criterion of truth; (2) “The scientific understanding of cause and effect” in matters of the Spirit (karma); (3) Buddhism’s “pragmatic” approach without any other metaphysic vision; and (4) the emphasis on individual action. Hubbard’s clearest mention of his Gnostic worldview is in The Factors, a brief document and Hubbard’s 1953 lecture on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 |accessdate=2018-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard has made direct references to the comparison between Scientology and eastern religions: “But are we indebted to Asia?… All of us have the same potentials, but it happens that the information which has been collected over the years is available in Asia. It has been not preserved in the Western world. Therefore, we look to such things as the [[Vedas|Veda]].” Hubbard says in the Phoenix Lectures: “And what we have just talked about in terms of knowing the way to Knowingness, is very, very closely associated here with Buddha, or Lord Buddha, or Gautama Buddha, or the Blessed One, or the Enlightened one.”

In a study that compares Scientology with Eastern religions, scholar [[Roy Wallis]] wrote that there are a lot of parallelisms between Hindu yoga and Scientology. In Hindu yoga, the yoga system would lead to a knowledge where the rebirth bring about a “non conditioned mode of being” and the aim of Samkhya-yoga would consist in the dissociation of purusha (immortal spirit) from prakrti (matter). Now, the same would be the aim of Scientology in seeking to dissociate the Thetan – equivalent to purusha (immortal, free, divine) – in the attempt to liberate the self from the MEST (matter, prakrti).

L. Ron Hubbard taught that Scientology is the science of “knowing how to know,” corresponding to the perpetually “curious” disposition of the true Scientologist, without claiming access to revelation. This is similar to the idea of “how to invent the new reality and freedom,” in Gnostic thought, where knowledge is accompanied by imagination.&lt;ref name="Terrin 2014"/&gt;

Hubbard had a basic skepticism about religious claims, even about the existence of God. On July 1950, upon addressing a child’s queries about the existence of angels, he clearly showed that he was talking about something that didn’t exist. On March 1954, he talked about mysticism, spiritualism, and  “guardian angels and priests and all this sort of thing as the requirement  to inquire from nothingness for direction.” When referring to God he mentions “taking orders from an indefinite nothingness.” Dianetics does not mention God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frenschkowski |first1=Marco |title=Brill Handbook of Scientology |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |work=Brill Hanbbooks on Contemporary Religion |location=Boston |publisher=Brill |year=2016 |isbn=9789004328716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Mikael Rothstein, just as Jesus is the sole object of religious devotion and source of salvation, and the church is seen as an "extension" of Jesus' divinity, "the entire fabric of Scientology is best understood as an expansion of the individual, L. Ron Hubbard, including the buildings currently emerge as physical manifestations of Scientological ideals and virtues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michele Diane Miscavige''' (born January 18, 1961), known as '''Shelly''', is the wife of [[Church of Scientology]] leader [[David Miscavige]]. She has made no public appearances since August 2007,&lt;ref name="Wright-303"&gt;{{cite book|title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief|last=Wright|first=Lawrence|page=303|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=2013|isbn=978-0-307-70066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to speculation about her fate or whereabouts. 

Actress [[Leah Remini]], a former Scientologist and vocal critic of the organization, filed a [[missing person]] report regarding Mrs. Miscavige with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) in 2013. According to a story in ''The Los Angeles Times'' based on information from an anonymous LAPD source, the LAPD contacted Mrs. Miscavige and subsequently closed the case. The same article reports that Mrs. Miscavige's attorneys have disputed that she is missing, and characterize Remini's allegations as harassment or publicity-seeking.

==Career in Scientology==
Miscavige is a member of the [[Sea Org]], the organization responsible for the international management of the Church of Scientology and its affiliated entities. From the age of 12, she was a member of the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] (CMO), the internal Sea Org group responsible for personally servicing Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] aboard his flagship ''Apollo'' in the 1970s. She was described as "quiet, petite and younger than most of the other Messengers at the time ... and a bit overshadowed by the older girls."&lt;ref name="Wright-176" /&gt; Jim Dincalci, one of her shipmates, says that she was "a sweet, innocent thing thrown into chaos."&lt;ref name="Wright-176" /&gt; At the age of 21, in December 1982, she married a fellow CMO member, 22-year-old David Miscavige.&lt;ref name="Wright-176"&gt;Wright, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

She subsequently joined her husband's group as "COB Assistant," the official assistant to her husband, the Chairman of the Board (COB) of Scientology's [[Religious Technology Center]]. According to author [[Lawrence Wright]], she was closely involved in the Church's liaison with its most famous member, [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref name="Wright-248"&gt;Wright, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; When Cruise started a three-year relationship with [[Penélope Cruz]], Miscavige supervised Cruz's [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and helped her through the Church's [[Purification Rundown]] program.&lt;ref name="Wright-285"&gt;Wright, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Cruise-Cruz relationship, Miscavige was reported to have led a Church program to find a new girlfriend for Tom Cruise, which led to him marrying [[Katie Holmes]]. Around a hundred young Scientologist actresses were interviewed, though they were not told why.&lt;ref name="Wright-285" /&gt; An actress named [[Nazanin Boniadi]] was introduced to Cruise and dated him for a few months before he broke off the relationship in January 2005.&lt;ref name="Wright-286-87"&gt;Wright, pp. 286–87&lt;/ref&gt; The search resumed, with more actresses invited to audition for what they thought was a role in a forthcoming ''Mission: Impossible'' film, and eventually concluded with Katie Holmes meeting and in due course marrying Cruise.&lt;ref name="Wright-290-91"&gt;Wright, pp. 290-91&lt;/ref&gt; His attorney denies that any Scientology executive set him up with girlfriends.&lt;ref name="Wright-290"&gt;Wright, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Miscavige subsequently oversaw a project to use Scientology members and contractors to renovate Cruise's nine-bedroom mansion in [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Wright-300"&gt;Wright, pp. 300-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of disappearance==
Miscavige has not appeared in public since August 2007, leading to speculation that she is missing.&lt;ref name="compound"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Jim|title=Tour The Compound Where The Missing Wife of Scientology's Leader Might Be Living|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/is-the-missing-wife-of-scientologys-leader-hidden-in-this-spike-fenced-compound-2012-7?op=1|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=Business Insider|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="missing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lutz|first=Ashley|title=Scientology leader David Miscavige's wife has been missing since 2006|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/scientology-leader-david-miscaviges-wife-has-been-missing-since-2006-2012-7|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=Business Insider|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Miscavige's husband, church leader David Miscavige, left Scientology's international base. Upon her husband's return, Miscavige was said to have "visibly changed" her mood and to have "looked cowed". [[Mike Rinder]], then the church's chief spokesman, says that she asked him if her husband was still wearing his wedding ring. Shortly afterwards, in June 2006, she no longer made any appearances in public.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

She was absent from the November 2006 wedding of [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Katie Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/leah-remini-shares-the-truth-about-the-hardest-year-of-her-l#.idrPGWJo|title=Leah Remini Shares The Truth About The Hardest Year Of Her Life|work=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it emerged that actress [[Leah Remini]] had left the Church, after reportedly receiving "an unbelievable torrent of attack" for asking fellow Scientologists at the wedding why Miscavige was not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/13/us-leahremini-scientology-idUKBRE96B03120130713|title=Latest celebrity defection casts light on Scientology leadership|agency=Reuters|date=2013-07-13|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing-person reports have been filed with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] concerning Miscavige. At least two such reports have been filed; one is reported by [[Lawrence Wright]], though he does not state who submitted it,&lt;ref name="Wright302-3"&gt;Wright, pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; while another was filed in August 2013 by Remini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leah-remini-files-missing-person-602723|title=Leah Remini Files Missing Person Report for Scientology Leader David Miscavige's Wife|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2013-08-08|accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Detective Gus Villanueva, in response to the missing person report, said: "The LAPD has classified the report as unfounded, indicating that Shelly is not missing."&lt;ref name="eonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/447348/leah-remini-s-scientology-mystery-solved-missing-person-case-for-shelly-miscavige-now-closed-per-lapd |title=Leah Remini's Scientology Mystery Solved: Missing Person Case for Shelly Miscavige Now Closed, Per LAPD &amp;#124; E! Online UK |publisher=Eonline.com |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2013, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed they "made contact with" Miscavige following a missing-persons report filed by Remini, but would not confirm whether they met with her in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ0-VeWMr-A&amp;t=3783 |title=Joe Rogan Experience #908 - Leah Remini |publisher=Joe Rogan Experience |date=2017-01-30|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology will not comment on Miscavige's location.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tommy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Jx9KG0VeU|title=Where's Tommy Davis|publisher=[[Nine Network]]|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, responding to press accounts of speculation on Miscavige's whereabouts, two UK newspapers were informed by lawyers indicating they represented Miscavige "that she is not missing and devotes her time to the work of the Church of Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9441711/Mrs-Shelly-Miscavige.html |title=Mrs Shelly Miscavige |work=Telegraph |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-2179035/Clarifications--corrections.html |title=Clarifications &amp; corrections|work=Daily Mail |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former members of the Sea Org have said that they believe Miscavige is at the compound of the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]]&amp;nbsp;– a Scientology corporation&amp;nbsp;– near the mountain town of [[Running Springs]] in [[San Bernardino County, California]].&lt;ref name="compound" /&gt; According to Noriyuki Matsumaru, who worked for David Miscavige as a finance officer in the Religious Technology Center, her husband sent her a sweater and gloves for Christmas one year.&lt;ref name="Wright-303" /&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Michele's mother, Flo Barnett, was a long-time Scientologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologypart3.html |title=St. Petersburg Times: The man behind Scientology, page 3 |work=sptimes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703092228/http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologypart3.html |archivedate=2009-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 1985, 52-year-old Flo Barnett was found dead from three "somewhat superficial" rifle shots to the chest and a fatal shot to the head. The autopsy also reported that there were slash marks on her wrists that may have been a few days old.&lt;ref name=vvoice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-strange-death-of-flo-barnett-mother-in-law-to-scientology-leader-david-miscavige-6667918|title=The Strange Death of Flo Barnett, Mother-in-Law to Scientology Leader David Miscavige|author=Tony Ortega|work=Village Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death was ruled a suicide.&lt;ref name=vvoice /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28136">[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|thumb|350px|[[L. Ron Hubbard]] in 1950, around when he developed [[Scientology]]]]
[[Church of Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] included  [[space opera]] narratives in his writings, wherein [[thetan]]s (the name given to human [[soul]]s) were reincarnated periodically over [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillions]] of years, retaining memories of prior lives, to which Hubbard attributed complex narratives about life throughout the universe. The most controversial of these myths is the story of [[Xenu]], to whom Hubbard attributed responsibility for many of the world's problems. &lt;!-- need to rephrase Scientology teaches that individuals can free themselves of the traumas that have occurred to their thetans, and that by doing so, the thetan can gain the ability to transform reality. --&gt;

Some space opera doctrines of Scientology are only provided by the church to experienced members, who church leaders maintain are the only ones able to correctly understand them. Several former members of the church have exposed these secret documents, leading to lengthy court battles with the church, which failed to keep the secret. Critics of the church have noted that some of the narratives are scientifically impossible, and have thus assailed the church as untrustworthy for teaching them. The space opera teachings have also been satirized in popular culture. Scholars of religion have described the space opera narratives as a [[creation myth]] designed to encourage reverence of Hubbard as a supreme messenger. Several academics have drawn attention to the similarity of the space opera myths to themes of the 1950s [[Cold War]] culture in which they were constructed.

(Although this article regularly refers to Xenu, Hubbard in many of his lectures and writings actually uses the name Xemu).

[[L. Ron Hubbard]] created a form of therapy known as [[Dianetics]], which he promoted as a scientific, not religious, teaching. Until the early 1950s, he had a negative view of organized religions, but thereafter discussed spiritual topics.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=57–59}} In these teachings, he identified subconscious memories of past events, which he called "[[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]", as causes of human dissatisfaction.{{sfn|Bromley|2009|p=90}} By 1950, he had begun to ponder [[past lives]], believing that they could be recalled;{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=61}} he attempted to use these recollections to develop a comprehensive narrative of the universe.{{sfn|Bromley|2009|pp=90–91}} He founded the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1953, advancing his beliefs as religious doctrines. The church was distinct from Dianetics-based groups but incorporated some of their views.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=64–65}} Hubbard saw Dianetics as focused on the physical body but viewed Scientology as a way to address spiritual matters.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=66}}

In Hubbard's efforts to shift from a psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he introduced the concept of [[thetan]]s:{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=68–69}} a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of [[Ohio State University]] states that these teachings bear similarities to [[Gnosticism]], although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=69–71}}

In the 1950s, as Hubbard's followers recalled their past lives, he recorded many details of these recollections.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=71–72}} With this as his source, he constructed an intricate history of the universe, identified as "[[space opera]]".{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=72}} Although Hubbard believed that he had developed a comprehensive history, Urban cites the isolated and incomplete record of the statements,{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=74}} wherein Hubbard identified a thetan universe, separate from the material universe, created by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=75}} The material universe, in Hubbard's view, began when other universes created by thetans collided,{{sfn|Bromley|2009|p=91}} from which they entered the material universe in six invasion groups roughly 60 trillion years ago.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=75}} Hubbard also described a series of events, called the "incidents", that divorced the thetans from their self-knowledge,{{sfn|Bromley|2009|p=91}} but maintained that thetans could regain their former divinity,{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=81–82}} and referred to thetans that freed themselves from the material world as "operating thetans".{{sfn|Grünschloß|2004|p=427}}

== Narratives and civilizations ==
[[File:Imagination 195608.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of [[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]] August 1956 depicting a space opera story.]]
Hubbard located his first 'incident' four quadrillion years ago, in which a thetan encountered 'loud cracks and brightness' and then observed a [[cherub]] and chariot before experiencing total darkness. In Scientology, this is known as "Incident 1".{{sfn|Kent|1999}} Another important event in Scientology's chronology of the universe occurred on a space city known as Arslycus, the inhabitants of whom brought about an incident when capturing thetans.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=76}}

The most controversial portion of Scientology's space opera is the myth of [[Xenu]],{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=74}} known as "Incident 2",{{sfn|Kent|1999}} in which Hubbard described a group of 76 planets, orbiting stars visible from Earth, organized in a Galactic Confederacy c. 75 million years ago,{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=75–76}}{{sfn|Reitman|2011|p=99}} ruled by the [[dictator]] Xenu.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=103–104}}{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=380}} The confederacy having become overpopulated,{{sfn|Kent|1999}} Xenu sent several billion of his citizens onto [[DC 8]] planes to the planet Teegeeack (Earth),{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=103–104}} ostensibly for tax audition.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=381}} There, [[hydrogen bomb]]s were detonated inside [[volcano]]es, killing the exiles,{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=103–104}} whose thetans were brainwashed on [[Hawaii]] and the [[Canary Islands]],{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=103–104}}{{efn|name=psych}} introducing various myths, such as the myth of [[Jesus]], to conceal the thetans' origins.{{sfn|Kent|1999}} Eventually, officers of the Galactic Confederacy launched a rebellion against Xenu, which continued six years before capturing him{{sfn|Kent|1999}} and placing him in an electrified prison in the center of a mountain.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=103–104}} Hubbard taught that the thetans brainwashed by Xenu's forces remained on Earth, where the "body thetans", attached to human psyches, contribute to human problems; and that individuals could be freed from these brainwashed thetans and thus attain a type of [[salvation]].{{sfn|Reitman|2011|p=100}}

Hubbard also taught that, upon the deaths of humans, thetans continued to "implant stations", including locations on planets near Earth, where their memories were erased and new memories emplaced.{{sfn|Reitman|2011|p=49}} On grounds that some "implant stations" were better than others, Hubbard advised his followers to avoid the one on [[Venus]].{{sfn|Sappell|Welkos|1990}} After passing an implant station, he taught, the thetan returned to Earth, where it was incarnated.{{sfn|Sappell|Welkos|1990}} Hubbard taught the Christian concept of heaven was based on a physical location on another planet, which he claimed to have visited. He compared its appearance to [[Busch Gardens]] in [[Pasadena, California]], and noted it contained effigies of characters from the [[New Testament]]. Over time, he recalled, the location fell into disrepair. A town nearby contained an implant station, at which thetans were convinced to return there.{{sfn|Kent|1999}}

Another significant encounter in Hubbard's narrative occurred when a large group of planets formed the [[Marcab Confederacy]],{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=76}} described as in search of slaves,{{sfn|Grünschloß|2009|p=230}} and called a "decadent" society.{{sfn|Kent|1999}} The author related that this civilization caused a significant implant upon their encounter with thetans.{{sfn|Kent|1999}}

Hubbard discussed the history of human civilizations on Earth, and the lives of ancient sea monsters and fish people, as well.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=76}} He also said humans could recover memories of previous lives, such as the experiences of clams and [[Neanderthals]].{{sfn|Reitman|2011|p=49}} In his mythos, [[Atlantis]] was a completely electronic civilization, whose inhabitants possessed disintegration technology; in contrast, Earth was invaded by multiple groups around 1200 BCE, including the "fifth invader force from Martian Command" against the "fourth invasion force from Space Command" in battle.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=76}}

On premise that thetans are forced to believe various faulty ideas, the church teaches that their courses allow "theta beings" to be freed from these beliefs and regain their former abilities.{{sfn|Reitman|2011|p=40}} Committed Scientologists pursue courses and procedures offered by the church in the hope of gaining freedom and enlightenment,{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=366}} allegedly permitting travel around the solar system.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=78–79}} The author referred to the process of a thetan leaving its human body as "exteriorization",{{sfn|Urban|2012|p=106}} which he said allowed for space travel. Urban notes that this is similar to [[Aleister Crowley]]'s teachings of [[astral projection]], although he adds that Hubbard did not use that term.{{sfn|Urban|2012|p=107}}

== Space opera and Scientologists ==

[[File:Mike Rinder.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mike Rinder]], a former spokesman of the Church of Scientology, stated that extraterrestrial auditing is merely "a small percent" of Scientology's teachings.]]

A glossary on the Scientology website defined the term "space opera" as a description of actual events:{{sfn|Wolf|2005}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Space opera has space travel, spaceships, spacemen, intergalactic travel, wars, conflicts, other beings, civilizations and societies, and other planets and galaxies. It is not fiction and concerns actual incidents."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Scientology publication ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]'' contains some space opera,{{sfn|Grünschloß|2004|p=428}} describing past lives—including some on warlike planets—which were recalled through auditing.{{sfn|Rothstein|2003|p=263}} In the 1960s, Hubbard introduced a series of questions, known as "security checks", to verify members' loyalty.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=107–108}} [[Mikael Rothstein]], associate professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen, sees the Xenu myth as building off of, and the culmination of, these accounts.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=376}} The Xenu myth was released to Scientologists in the late 1960s, after teachings about thetans and their relationship to the physical body had been disseminated; its release provided the cause and origin of many of the group's teachings.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=378}} Rothstein describes "space opera" as "Hubbard's introduction of a new reality, and new foundation for everything".{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=377}}

Although Hubbard spoke openly about space opera in the 1950s,{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=74}} Scientology eventually became an esoteric faith: some teachings are withheld until followers reach a certain point in their spiritual development, and the mythological foundation of the courses are unknown to many members.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=366}} Over a decade of auditing and study—and donations of tens of thousands of dollars—are required for a member to reach the highest echelons of hidden knowledge.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=135–136}} Followers below a certain level ([[Operating Thetan#OT III: The Wall of Fire|OT III]]) of growth are denied access to the church's cosmological teachings, and they are given different explanations for the church's teachings.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=198}} German scholar Gerald Willms notes that in addition to the esoteric foundations, Scientology cites practical justifications for its rituals, so they can be pursued without knowledge of advanced teachings.{{sfn|Willms|2009|p=249}} The Church of Scientology has attempted to prevent the public release of their esoteric teachings, but, through the internet, their confidential aspects have been widely released.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=198}} The church considers public discussion of their space opera teachings offensive and has asked academics not to publish their details. Scientologists maintain that the true meaning of these texts is only accessible to those who have progressed through their courses, and that those who read them prematurely risk damage to their spiritual and physical conditions.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|pp=367–369}} Church leaders have sometimes outright refused to discuss the subject with journalists.{{sfn|''Mail &amp; Guardian'', November 22, 2009}} Rothstein observes that the church also has a strong financial motivation to keep members from accessing higher level courses, as devotees are required to make large payments to obtain them.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|pp=367–369}} [[Free Zone Scientologists]], however, are sometimes more open about space opera. Some Free Zone Scientologists believe that the Church of Scientology has been hijacked by undercover agents of the [[Marcab_Confederacy|Marcabian Confederacy]].{{sfn|Grünschloß|2009|p=231}}

During auditing, Scientology members sometimes recall details of life in space. Rothstein states that this is part of a "mythological paradigm" that members initially partake of through Scientology's scriptures.{{sfn|Rothstein|2003|p=264}} He notes, however, that some Scientologists do not believe that there are space opera myths in the group's teachings, and that others have left the group after learning about the higher-level doctrines.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=370}} Reitman relates that some members accept the space opera teachings by seeing them as similar to seemingly implausible stories of popular religions or simply remain quiet about their doubts.{{sfn|Reitman|2011|p=100}}

Rothstein states that space opera is a "part of the total fabric of Scientological thinking and narrative, but not of prime importance."{{sfn|Rothstein|2003|p=263}} He argues that these teachings are a "second order belief", in that they exist to support the group's core teachings about thetans.{{sfn|Rothstein|2003|p=265}} [[Mike Rinder]], a former spokesman of the Church of Scientology, stated that extraterrestrial auditing is merely "a small percent" of their canon.{{sfn|Reitman|2006}}

== Criticism and leaking ==

[[File:Karin Spaink.jpg|thumb|[[Karin Spaink]], a Dutch journalist who helped publicize confidential Scientology doctrines]]

Scientology's space opera teachings were publicized in accounts given by former church members, most notably during court cases. One such case was filed by a former Scientologist, [[Larry Wollersheim]], against the church in 1980. Five years later, Wollersheim offered confidential Scientology materials, including space opera teachings, to the court as evidence, a move that was vigorously protested by the church's attorneys. They were unable to prevent disclosure, however, and the documents were published by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in November 1985. This was the first time that some aspects of Scientology's space opera teachings were offered as public evidence about the church. In the mid-1990s, Wollersheim published some of the materials on a website, prompting the church to sue his organization, [[FACTNet]]. The Church attested that the space opera narratives were [[trade secrets]]; this claim was rejected by the court.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=183–184}}

In 1990, after being sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, [[Steven Fishman]], a former member turned critic, offered a large amount of the group's highly confidential teachings in court. The documents, contained in what is known as the [[Fishman Affidavit]], included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on [[alt.religion.scientology]] and a website of Dutch journalist [[Karin Spaink]]. The church filed suits against those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet.{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=186–188}}

Former Scientologists and members of the [[anti-cult movement]] often discuss Scientology's space opera teachings. They generally take a rationalistic approach to the narratives and see them as absurd,{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=371}} or even as drug-fueled delusions,{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=383}} using them as a source of humor.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=371}} The doctrines have been satirized in popular culture, most notably in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Trapped_in_the_Closet_(South_Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]".{{sfn|Feltmate|2011|p=347}} The anti-Scientology website [[Operation Clambake]] prominently uses space opera doctrines in their criticisms of the church, casting the implausibility of the stories as a clear reason to reject the group.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=383}} Anti-cult critics of Scientology argue that the content of these teachings demonstrates that Scientology misleads its followers;{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=371}} many aspects of the narratives, such as the age of the volcanoes that Xenu is said to have used, contradict scientific consensus.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=381}} The space opera teachings are, in fact, incompatible with scientific consensus on the [[age of the universe]]: around 14 billion years. Rothstein notes that scholars of religion usually do not pursue this line of analysis because all myths contain unscientific content;{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=371}} he notes that cultural conditioning determines whether religious narratives appear reasonable.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=383}}

== Analysis ==
Rothstein argues that in the construction of the space opera narratives, Hubbard drew from tropes common to his audience. The concept of a Galactic Confederation, Rothstein observes, was present in other UFO religions of the 1950s; 

*In contrast to the overpopulation and atomic bombs were often discussed therein.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|pp=379–380}} Urban cites UFO encounters and alien invasions as popular themes during the [[Cold War]];{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=73}}
*Rothstein draws parallels between Hubbard's teachings and the beliefs of UFO religions, citing similarities between thetans trapped in human bodies and the [[walk-in]] hypothesis of the [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar Command]].{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=375}} [[Andreas Grünschloß]] notes Scientology's space opera teachings place them in the tradition of the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis; he states the group's teachings about thetans bears similarities to "star seeds" found in UFO religions.{{sfn|Grünschloß|2004|p=427}} 

Grünschloß speculates the UFO-contact narratives may have played a role in the group's development of space opera,{{sfn|Rothstein|2003|p=264}} specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description of life in Xenu's time to statements by [[George Adamski]], a UFO contactee of the 1950s.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=375}} Rothstein notes the group's teachings about extraterrestrials varies greatly from most of the UFO movement,{{sfn|Rothstein|2003|p=264}} particularly in Hubbard's descriptions of demonic characters.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=375}}

Hubbard was a science fiction writer before starting Scientology, and some aspects of the church's space opera bear similarities to his previous writings.{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=76}} Noting similarities between Hubbard's fiction writing and creation of religious myths, Rothstein argues; "perhaps no division between such categories should be made".{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=374}} Kent posits some of his cosmology, such as the priests and psychiatrists loyal to Xenu, were modeled after events in Hubbard's life, such as his distaste for Christianity and clashes with the psychiatric establishment.{{sfn|Kent|1999}} Hubbard theorized science fiction writers sometimes recalled portions of events from past lives and incorporated it into their works,{{sfn|Urban|2011|p=76}} and Urban writes Hubbard's science fiction writings "contain more than a few seeds of Hubbard's religious movement, the Church of Scientology".{{sfn|Urban|2011|pp=35–36}}

Rothstein argues Scientology's space opera identify Xenu as the root of evil and Hubbard as the hero,{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=379}} for having uncovered the mysteries of the universe. Rothstein states the group's teachings about "salvation" may be a means to encourage reverence of Hubbard.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|pp=376–379}} In addition, Rothstein notes the space opera teachings also provide fundamental justifications for some practical aspects of Scientology, including the rejection of psychiatry and the formation of the [[Sea Org]].{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|pp=381–382}} He sees space opera as similar to most types of mythology, involving superhuman beings in the far distant past.{{sfn|Rothstein|2009|p=381}} Willms states the mythology of Scientology differs from many other religions because it focuses on material beings; but argues the Xenu myth is a religious narrative, although the Church of Scientology has never used this claim in their efforts to be recognized as a religion.{{sfn|Willms|2009|p=248}}

'''Violet Tweedale''', née Chambers (1862 – 10 December 1936&lt;ref&gt;Notice in [https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34374/page/1293 The London Gazette, 20 February 1937] (accessed 16 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] author, poet, and [[spiritualist]].&lt;ref name=gale&gt;Peter Zavon, [http://www.answers.com/topic/violet-tweedale Violet Tweedale], ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology'', Thomson Gale, 2000 (Answers.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Violet Tweedale was born in [[Edinburgh]], the eldest daughter of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1832)|Robert Chambers]], editor of ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|Chambers' Journal]]'', and the granddaughter of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], the publisher and founder of [[W &amp; R Chambers]]. In her teens she assisted her father in his work, and in 1889 moved to [[London]] where she had her first novel, ''And They Two'', published, and became involved in humanitarian "rescue work" in the [[East End]]. In 1891, she married Clarens Tweedale.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=everywoman&gt;''[//archive.org/stream/everywomansencyc02londuoft#page/1380/mode/1up Every woman's encyclopaedia, volume 2]'' p. 1380 (1910-12).&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, she moved in the best social circles, counting amongst her friends, poet [[Robert Browning]], artist [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic Leighton]], Anne Proctor (mother of [[Adelaide Proctor]]) and many others. She also had influential contacts abroad including, Marie, Countess of Caithness, Duchess of Medina Pomar (Papal States), who was close to prominent [[Theosophist]], [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref name=blavatsky&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://theosophy.katinkahesselink.net/canadian/Vol-23-1-C-Theosophist.htm|title=H. P. Blavatsky as seen by Violet Tweedale|journal=The Canadian Theosophist|volume=XXIII|number=1|date=March 15, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming to be [[psychic]] from a young age,&lt;ref&gt;Tweedale, ''Ghosts I have seen'', 1919, p. 9 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; she became involved in Spiritualism and Theosophy, and was a close associate of Helena Blavatsky.&lt;ref name=blavatsky/&gt; She worked with the mediums [[Charles Williams (medium)|Charles Williams]] and [[Cecil Husk]] (1847–1920), and was called as an expert witness when trance [[Mediumship|medium]], Meurig Morris, sued the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for [[libel]] in April 1932—although the case went against Morris, no fraud or dishonesty on the medium's part was proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1qqguX24fAC&amp;dq=isbn:0766128156&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKuP3ZrLPYAhWEwYMKHSNQCdsQ6AEIJzAA|title=Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|author=Lewis Spence|pages=612-3|isbn=0766128156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tweedale was also a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Order of the Golden Dawn]].

She was a prolific writer of [[short stories]], published as [[anthology|anthologies]], and novels, often with a romantic or supernatural theme. She wrote over 30 books on spiritual subjects, such as ''The Cosmic Christ'' (1930), and her own personal psychic experiences were documented in ''Ghosts I have Seen'' (1920).&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Apart from her literary output, she was a gifted amateur artist, [[embroidery|embroiderer]], and an accomplished pianist; she was also a skilled orator who spoke up for workers' rights.&lt;ref name=everywoman/&gt;&lt;ref name=northberwick&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.northberwick.org.uk/campbell_links.html|title=In 1905, Dorothy Campbell played for the British team that beat a U.S. squad led by the Curtis sisters, six matches to one.|author=[[Dorothy Campbell|Dorothy Campbell Hurd]]|journal=Famous North Berwick Golfers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweedale was an avid [[golf]]er and was known as the best woman golfer in her region.&lt;ref name=northberwick/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">'''Wayob''' is the plural form of ''way'' (or ''uay''), a Maya word with a basic meaning of 'sleep(ing)', but which in [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] is a term specifically denoting the Mesoamerican [[nagual]], that is, a person who can [[Shapeshifting|transform into an animal]] while asleep in order to do harm, or else the resulting animal transformation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Maya Cordemex, Barrera Vásquez et al. 1980: 916&lt;/ref&gt; Already in Classic Maya belief, ''way'' animals, identifiable by a special hieroglyph, had an important role to play.

== In Maya ethnography ==
In Yucatec ethnography, the animal transformation involved is usually a common domestic or domesticated animal, but may also be a ghost or apparition, for example 'a creature with wings of straw mats'.&lt;ref&gt;Redfield and Villa 1934: 178–180&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the 16th century, wild animals such as [[jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar]] and grey fox are mentioned as animal shapes of the sorcerer, together with the ''ah uaay xibalba'' or 'underworld transformer'.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1965: 166–171&lt;/ref&gt; Some sort of 'devil's pact' seems to be implied. The Yucatec ''way'' has its counterparts among other Maya groups. In [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]] ethnography, the ''way'' (here called ''wayihel'' or [[wikt:chon#Tzotzil|''chanul'']]&lt;ref&gt;Calvin 1997: 870&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitt-Rivers 1970: 186&lt;/ref&gt;) is more often an animal companion and refers not only to domestic animals, but also to igneous powers such as meteor and lightning. In [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal Cancuc]], the ''nagual'' animal companion is considered a 'caster of disease'.&lt;ref&gt;Villa Rojas 1947: 584&lt;/ref&gt;
Other names found are:
Lab, labil, wayixelal or vayijelal, way and wayxel or wayjel.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Multilingue Svanal Bats'i K'opetik Siglo xxi editores argentina, S.A. 2005 p 175&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Classic Period ==
[[File:CylinderVessel-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|Jaguar ''way'' with scarf]]
A Classic Maya hieroglyph is read as ''way'' (''wa-ya'') by Houston and Stuart. These authors assert that a glyph representing a stylised, frontal 'Ahau' ([[Ajaw]]) face half covered by a jaguar-pelt represents the ''way'', with syllabic ''wa'' and ''ya'' elements attached to the main sign clarifying its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Houston and Stuart 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''way'' animals are distinguished by (i) a shoulder cape or scarf tied in front; (ii) a splashing of jaguar spots or other jaguar characteristics; (iii) the attribute of an upturned 'jar of darkness'; and (iv) fire elements.&lt;ref&gt;See figures in Robicsek and Hales 1981: 28–34&lt;/ref&gt;
The Classic ''wayob'' include a far wider array of shapes than the 20th-century ones from Yucatán (insofar as the latter have been reported), with specific names assigned to each of them. They include not only many mammals (especially jaguars) and birds, but also apparitions and spooks: hybrids of deer and spider monkey, walking skeletons, a self-decapitating man, a young man within a fire, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Grube and Nahm 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The animal ''wayob'' are likely to be transformative shapes of human beings, the walking skeletons ([[Maya Death Gods]]) more particularly of the ''ah uaay xibalba'' transformers.

At times, the name of the ''way'' is followed by an 'emblem glyph' giving the name of a specific Maya kingdom (or perhaps its ruling family).&lt;ref&gt;Freidel et al. 1993: 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The skeletal ''way'' prominent on a [[Tonina]] stucco wall carries the severed head of a defeated opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel et al. 1993, pp.320–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Blake''' (28 November 1757&amp;nbsp;– 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form "what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D. ''Collected Works of Northrop Frye''. 2006, pp 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; His visual artistry led 21st-century critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jones, Jonathan| title= Blake's heaven |work=The Guardian |location=UK | url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,1169,1469584,00.html |date=25 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons/list.shtml/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021204214727/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons/list.shtml/|archivedate=4 December 2002|title=BBC – Great Britons – Top 100|work=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in [[Felpham]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Edward. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bilDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Literary+Pilgrim+in+England A Literary Pilgrim in England]''. 1917, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; he produced a diverse and symbolically rich ''[[Work of art|œuvre]]'', which embraced the imagination as "the body of God"&lt;ref&gt;[[W. B. Yeats|Yeats, W. B.]] ''The Collected Works of W. B. Yeats''. 2007, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; or "human existence itself".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mona. ''The Life of William Blake''. The Nonesuch Press, 1927. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; A committed Christian who was hostile to the [[Church of England]] (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William. ''Blake's "America, a Prophecy"; And, "Europe, a Prophecy"''. 1984, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist [[Thomas Paine]]; he was also influenced by thinkers such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Kazin, Alfred | year=1997 | title=An Introduction to William Blake | url=http://www.multimedialibrary.com/Articles/kazin/alfredblake.asp | accessdate=23 September 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926013159/http://www.multimedialibrary.com/Articles/kazin/alfredblake.asp | archivedate=26 September 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar [[William Rossetti]] characterised him as a "glorious luminary",&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William and Rossetti, William Michael. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fGYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=%22The+Poetical+Works+of+William+Blake:+Lyrical+and+Miscellaneous%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 The Poetical Works of William Blake: Lyrical and Miscellaneous]''. 1890, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors".&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William and Rossetti, William Michael. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fGYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=%22The+Poetical+Works+of+William+Blake:+Lyrical+and+Miscellaneous%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 The Poetical Works of William Blake: Lyrical and Miscellaneous]''. 1890, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:WilliamBlake'sHouse.jpg|thumb|upright|left|28 Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) in an illustration of 1912. Blake was born here and lived here until he was 25. The house was demolished in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/ |title=Blake &amp; London |publisher=The Blake Society |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick St.) in [[Soho]], London. He was the third of seven children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/116|title=William Blake|first=William|last=Blake|date=3 April 1999|website=William Blake|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bent&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt; two of whom died in infancy. Blake's father, James, was a [[hosier]].&lt;ref name=bent /&gt; He attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing, leaving at the age of ten, and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Blake (''née'' Wright).&lt;ref name="Raine"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Raine, Kathleen |title=World of Art: William Blake |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=1970 |isbn=0-500-20107-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Blakes were [[English Dissenters]],&lt;ref name="The Stranger From Paradise 2001"&gt;The Stranger From Paradise: A Biography of William Blake, Bentley (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; William was baptised on 11 December at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's Church]], Piccadilly, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0586082972|page=2|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake, and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life.

Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father, a practice that was preferred to actual drawing. Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.&lt;ref name="The Stranger From Paradise 2001"/&gt; When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in the Strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0586082972|page=3|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].

===Apprenticeship to Basire===
[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]

On 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of £52.10, for a term of seven years.&lt;ref name=bent /&gt; At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries – and then crossed it out.&lt;ref&gt;43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.

After two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that "...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour".&lt;ref&gt;44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd&lt;/ref&gt; This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the "living form") left clear traces in his style.&lt;ref name="The Life of William Blake"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0586082972|page=5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Basire knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, "upon which he fell with terrific Violence".&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; After Basire complained to the Dean, the schoolboys' privilege was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="The Life of William Blake"/&gt; Blake experienced visions in the Abbey, he saw Christ and his Apostles and a great procession of monks and priests and heard their chant.&lt;ref name="The Life of William Blake"/&gt;

===Royal Academy===
On 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the [[Strand, London|Strand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of "general truth" and "general beauty". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the "disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that "To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit".&lt;ref&gt;E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/Blake/blaketxt1/home.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610145317/http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/Blake/blaketxt1/home.html |archivedate=10 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by "E" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable oil painting, Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].

David Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather "against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice."&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, D. "Blake as a Painter" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.

Blake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gordon Riots===
Blake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.

===Marriage and early career===

Blake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, "Do you pity me?" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, "Then I love you." Blake married Catherine – who was five years his junior – on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.

Blake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.

Blake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.

From 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a series of 70 mosaics inspired by Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of Waterloo Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title =

===Relief etching===
In 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscripts]]. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).

This is a reversal of the usual method of etching&lt;!--same article as relief etching--&gt;, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as "[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in water colours and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi, J. ''Blake and the Idea of the Book''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993; Phillips, M. ''William Blake: The Creation of the Songs'', London: The British Library, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings===
Although Blake has become better known for his relief etching, his commercial work largely consisted of [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio engraving]], the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate, a complex and laborious process, with plates taking months or years to complete, but as Blake's contemporary, [[John Boydell]], realised, such engraving offered a "missing link with commerce", enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eaves, Morris. ''The Counter Arts Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of Blake''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1992. pp. 68–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work, such as for the [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations of the Book of Job]], completed just before his death. Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as "[[repoussage]]", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Sung, Mei-Ying. ''William Blake and the Art of Engraving''. London: Pickering and Chatto, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==
[[File:William Blake House in Felpham.JPG|thumb|right|The cottage in Felpham where Blake lived from 1800 until 1803]]
Blake's marriage to Catherine was close and devoted until his death. Blake taught Catherine to write, and she helped him colour his printed poems.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, G. E, ''Blake Records'', p 341&lt;/ref&gt; Gilchrist refers to "stormy times" in the early years of the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, ''Life of William Blake'', 1863, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a [[concubine]] into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgian Society]],&lt;ref&gt;Schuchard, MK, ''Why Mrs Blake Cried'', Century, 2006, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felpham===
In 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]", which became the words for the anthem "[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with "the meer drudgery of business" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that "Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies". (4:26, E98)

Blake's trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803, when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier, John Schofield.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Thomas. ''Life of William Blake''. 2003, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake was charged not only with assault, but with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the king.  Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed "Damn the king. The soldiers are all slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/williamblake1.html|title=The Gothic Life of William Blake: 1757-1827|website=www.lilith-ezine.com|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blake was cleared in the [[Chichester]] [[assize]]s of the charges.  According to a report in the Sussex county paper, "[T]he invented character of [the evidence] was ... so obvious that an acquittal resulted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucas, E.V.|authorlink=E.

===Return to London===
[[File:William Blake by John Flaxman c1804.jpg|thumb|right| Sketch of Blake from circa 1804 by [[John Flaxman]]]]

Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]'' (1804–20), his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a "brilliant analysis" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, "Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]

Also around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, "To Generalize is to be an Idiot".&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750–1850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366–367&lt;/ref&gt; A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.&lt;ref name="EngHet"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757–1827) &amp; LINNELL, JOHN (1792–1882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.

In later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to Thomas Butts, a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.

====Dante's ''Divine Comedy''====
[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12–28, The Minotaur XII]]
[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|"Head of William Blake" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]
The commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:

:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, David. "Blake as a Painter" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy|''Inferno'']]]]
Blake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.

Because the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, "Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All &amp; the Goddess Nature &amp; not the Holy Ghost." Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).

At the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake Records'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death====
[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|right|Monument near Blake's (formerly unmarked) grave at [[Bunhill Fields]] in London.

ITV.com&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Blake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, "Stay Kate! Keep just as you are – I will draw your portrait – for you have ever been an angel to me." Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389&lt;/ref&gt; At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house, present at his expiration, said, "I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel."&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1863, 405&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] gives the following account of Blake's death in a letter to [[Samuel Palmer]]:

{{quote|He died ... in a most glorious manner. He said He was going to that Country he had all His life wished to see &amp; expressed Himself Happy, hoping for [[Salvation]] through [[Jesus Christ]] – Just before he died His Countenance became fair. His eyes Brighten'd and he burst out Singing of the things he saw in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, ''Samuel Palmer'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Catherine paid for Blake's funeral with money lent to her by Linnell. Blake's body was buried in a plot shared with others, five days after his death – on the eve of his 45th wedding anniversary – at the [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]]'s burial ground in [[Bunhill Fields]], in what is today the [[London Borough of Islington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Maev|title=Burial ground of Bunyan, Defoe and Blake earns protected status|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/22/bunhill-fields-bunyan-defoe-blake|accessdate=21 January 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents' bodies were buried in the same graveyard. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine, [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]], [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], [[Frederick Tatham]] and John Linnell. Following Blake's death, Catherine moved into Tatham's house as a housekeeper. She believed she was regularly visited by Blake's spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings, but entertained no business transaction without first "consulting Mr. Blake".&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 390&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of her death, in October 1831, she was as calm and cheerful as her husband, and called out to him "as if he were only in the next room, to say she was coming to him, and it would not be long now".&lt;ref&gt;''Blake Records'', p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

On her death, Blake's manuscripts were inherited by [[Frederick Tatham]], who burned some he deemed heretical or politically radical. Tatham was an [[Edward Irving|Irvingite]], one of the many fundamentalist movements of the 19th century, and opposed to any work that smacked of blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; John Linnell erased sexual imagery from a number of Blake's drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Keith Schuchard, ''Why Mrs Blake Cried: Swedenborg, Blake and the Sexual Basis of Spiritual Vision'', pp. 1–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's grave is commemorated by two stones. The first was a stone that reads "Near by lie the remains of the poet-painter William Blake 1757–1827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 1762–1831". The memorial stone is situated approximately {{convert|20|m}} away from the actual grave, which was not marked until 12 August 2018.{{cn|date=August 2018}} For years since 1965, the exact location of William Blake's grave had been lost and forgotten. The area had been damaged in the [[Second World War]]; gravestones were removed and a garden was created. The memorial stone, indicating that the burial sites are "nearby", was listed as a [[listed building|Grade II listed structure]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1396493 |title=Monument to William and Catherine Sophia Blake, Central Broadwalk|date=21 February 2011||accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/11/how-amateur-sleuths-finally-tracked-down-burial-place-william-blake|title=How amateur sleuths finally tracked down the burial place of William Blake|work=The Guardian|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;A Portuguese couple, Carol &amp; Luis Garrido rediscovered the exact burial location after 14 years of investigatory work, and the Blake Society organised a permanent memorial slab, which was unveiled at a public ceremony at the site on 12 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/11/how-amateur-sleuths-finally-tracked-down-burial-place-william-blake|title=How amateur sleuths finally tracked down the burial place of William Blake|work=The Guardian|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/blake-s-final-stop-on-the-road-to-jerusalem-is-recognised-at-last-gdfvx2jm2|title=William Blake’s final stop on the road to Jerusalem is recognised at last|work=The Times|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Blake is recognised as a saint in the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]]. The [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]] was established in his honour in Australia in 1949. In 1957 a memorial to Blake and his wife was erected in Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tate UK | title= William Blake's London | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/william-blake/william-blakes-london/westminster-abbey |accessdate=26 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Blake's death, he had sold fewer than 30 copies of ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/549274/the-radical-sex-and-spiritual-life-of-william-blake/2|title=The Radical Sex and Spiritual Life of William Blake|date=2015-11-29|work=Flavorwire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Blake was not active in any well-established political party. His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing "[[free love]]" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent (and very short) study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as forerunners of modern [[anarchism]].&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].

==Development of Blake's views==
Because Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.

The earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the "Devil" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.

Psychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the "Bible of Hell" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem "Jerusalem", she writes: "The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a "sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found "mutual understanding" and "mutual forgiveness".&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

Although Blake's attacks on conventional religion were shocking in his own day, his rejection of religiosity was not a rejection of religion ''per se''. His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell#Proverbs of Hell|Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:
* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.
* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)

In ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
If he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,
He'd have done anything to please us:
Gone sneaking into Synagogues
And not us'd the Elders &amp; Priests like Dogs,
But humble as a Lamb or Ass,
Obey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].
God wants not Man to Humble himself (55–61, E519–20)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: "All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus." (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)

Blake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including "Urizen", "Enitharmon", "Bromion" and "Luvah". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,&lt;ref&gt;"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own."; Fry, Northrop. "Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake". 1947, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.

One of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgment]]'', Blake says that:

{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their Eternal Glory. (E564)}}

His words concerning religion in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following Errors.
:1. That Man has two real existing principles Viz: a Body &amp; a Soul.
:2. That Energy, called Evil, is alone from the Body, &amp; that Reason, called Good, is alone from the Soul.
:3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.
But the following Contraries to these are True
:1. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.
:2. Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.
:3. Energy is Eternal Delight. (Plate 4, E34)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Blake-Abel.jpg|thumb|right|''The Body of [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] Found by Adam and Eve'', c. 1825. Watercolour on wood.]]

Blake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the "discernment" of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul. Elsewhere, he describes Satan as the "state of error", and as beyond salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Damon |first=Samuel Foster |title=A Blake Dictionary (Revised Edition) |year=1988 |publisher=Brown University Press |page=358 |isbn=0-87451-436-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake opposed the [[Sophism|sophistry]] of [[theology|theological]] thought that excuses pain, admits evil and apologises for injustice. He abhorred self-denial,&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, Saree. ''William Blake and the Impossible History of the 1790s''. 2003, pp. 226–7.&lt;/ref&gt; which he associated with religious repression and particularly [[sexual repression]]:&lt;ref&gt;Altizer, Thomas J. J. ''The New Apocalypse: The Radical Christian Vision of William Blake''. 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
[[Prudence]] is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.
He who desires but acts not breeds [[wikt:pestilence|pestilence]]. (7.4–5, E35)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He saw the concept of "sin" as a trap to bind men's desires (the briars of ''Garden of Love''), and believed that restraint in obedience to a moral code imposed from the outside was against the spirit of life:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Abstinence sows sand all over
The ruddy limbs &amp; flaming hair
But Desire Gratified
Plants fruits &amp; beauty there. (E474)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He did not hold with the [[doctrine]] of God as Lord, an entity separate from and superior to mankind;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake|first=Gerald Eades Bentley |title=William Blake: The Critical Heritage |year=1975 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |location=London |page=30 |isbn=0-7100-8234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is shown clearly in his words about Jesus Christ: "He is the only God ... and so am I, and so are you." A telling phrase in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is "men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast".

===Enlightenment philosophy===
Blake had a complex relationship with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy. His championing of the imagination as the most important element of human existence ran contrary to Enlightenment ideals of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2004/mayjune/feature/william-blake-visions-and-verses|title=William Blake: Visions and Verses|author-last=Galvin|magazine=Humanities|author-first=Rachel|volume=25|number=3|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his visionary religious beliefs, he opposed the [[Isaac Newton#Effect on religious thought|Newtonian]] view of the universe. This mindset is reflected in an excerpt from Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]'':

[[File:Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[Newton (Blake)|Newton]]'' (1795) demonstrates his opposition to the "single-vision" of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|scientific materialism]]: Newton fixes his eye on a compass (recalling [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8:27, an important passage for [[John Milton|Milton]])&lt;ref&gt;Baker-Smith, Dominic. ''Between Dream and Nature: Essays on Utopia and Dystopia''. 1987, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; to write upon a scroll that seems to project from his own head.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Christopher B. ''Creational Theology and the History of Physical Science''. 1997, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I turn my eyes to the Schools &amp; Universities of Europe
And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire
Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton. black the cloth
In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel Works
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which
Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony &amp; peace. (15.14–20, E159)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blake believed the paintings of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], which depict the naturalistic fall of light upon objects, were products entirely of the "vegetative eye", and he saw Locke and Newton as "the true progenitors of Sir Joshua Reynolds' aesthetic".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Ackroyd |first= Peter|editor= |others= |title=Blake |url= |edition= |series= |year=1995 |publisher=Sinclair-Stevenson |location=London |isbn=1-85619-278-4 |oclc= |page=285 |chapter= |chapterurl= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular taste in the England of that time for such paintings was satisfied with [[mezzotint]]s, prints produced by a process that created an image from thousands of tiny dots upon the page. Blake saw an analogy between this and Newton's particle theory of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Quote|a Line or Lineament is not formed by Chance a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s] Strait or Crooked It is Itself &amp; Not Intermeasurable with or by any Thing Else Such is Job. (E784)}}

It has been supposed that, despite his opposition to Enlightenment principles, Blake arrived at a linear aesthetic that was in many ways more similar to the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics, with whom he is often classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blake's Human Form Divine|last=Mellor|first=Anne|publisher=University of California Press|year=1974|isbn=0520020650|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=119–120|quote="Blake imitated Flaxman's austere, simple mode of pure outline engraving.  Blake's engravings for Cumberland's _Thoughts on Outline_ clearly demonstrate Blake's competency in and preference for this purely linear engraving style."|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blake's relationship with Flaxman seems to have grown more distant after Blake's return from Felpham, and there are surviving letters between Flaxman and Hayley wherein Flaxman speaks ill of Blake's theories of art.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Bentley, The Stranger in Paradise, "Drunk on Intellectual Vision" pp500, Yale University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Blake further criticized Flaxman's styles and theories of art in his responses to criticism made against his print of Chaucer's Caunterbury Pilgrims in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman, David ed.

===19th-century "free love" movement===
Since his death, William Blake has been claimed by those of various movements who apply his complex and often elusive use of symbolism and allegory to the issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hayes, "William Blake's AndrogYnous EGO-Ideal," ''ELH'', 71(1), 141–165 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Blake is sometimes considered (along with [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her husband [[William Godwin]]) a forerunner of the 19th-century "[[free love]]" movement, a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery, and advocated the removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality, prostitution, and adultery, culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century. Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsjö who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century "free love" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was "legal prostitution" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women - H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).

Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton &amp; Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as "Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?" and "Earth's Answer" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem "[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]" he speaks of "the Marriage-Hearse" plagued by "the youthful Harlot's curse", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the "frozen marriage-bed". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Till she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound
In spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain
Of life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises "sacred natural love" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a "creeping skeleton".&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the "pale religious letchery" of advocates of traditional norms.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844–1929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,&lt;ref&gt;Berger pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; the former being the true measure of purity.&lt;ref&gt;Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; Irene Langridge notes that "in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'."&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human "fallenness". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have noted that Blake's views on "free love" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsjö notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying "Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Ankarsjö on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''&lt;/ref&gt; Ankarsjö also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsjö thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsjö, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.&lt;ref&gt;Ankarsjö, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Ankarsjö records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.&lt;ref&gt;David Worrall, "Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of "self-denial", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 112, 284&lt;/ref&gt; and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.

==Assessment==

===Creative mindset===
[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake "himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments".&lt;ref name="fearfulsymmetry"&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns "to bear the beams of love":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
When I from black and he from white cloud free,
And round the tent of God like lambs we joy:
Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear,
To lean in joy upon our fathers knee.
And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
And be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.

===Visions===
From a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist "saw God" when God "put his head to the window", causing Blake to break into screaming.&lt;ref name=bent78&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36–7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen "a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars."&lt;ref name=bent78 /&gt; According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber. &lt;ref&gt; A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion 'his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions', suggesting that, though 'he was beaten only once...it became a source of perpetual discontent'&lt;Ackroyd, Peter (1995). Blake. London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.&lt;ref name=bent78 /&gt;

[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819–1820. Having informed painter-astrologer [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] of his visions of apparitions, Blake was subsequently persuaded to paint one of them.&lt;ref name=langr&gt;Langridge, Irene. ''William Blake: A Study of His Life and Art Work''. 1904, pp. 48–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Varley's anecdote of Blake and his vision of the flea's ghost became well-known.&lt;ref name=langr /&gt;]]

Blake claimed to experience visions throughout his life. They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R. Bentley, Dorset-Street |location=London |isbn= |page=506 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vm8ao7Qks8C&amp;pg=PA506&amp;lpg=PA506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake wrote:

{{quote|I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part. Thirteen years ago I lost a brother, and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit, and see him in my remembrance, in the region of my imagination. I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.}}

In a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote:

{{quote|[The town of] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard, &amp; their forms more distinctly seen; &amp; my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses. My Wife &amp; Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies &amp; Chambers filled with books &amp; pictures of old, which I wrote &amp; painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; &amp; those works are the delight &amp; Study of Archangels. (E710)}}

In a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:

{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, &amp; that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams &amp; prophecy &amp; speak Parables unobserv'd &amp; at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}

In ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:

{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up &amp; then &amp; not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation &amp; that to me it is hindrance &amp; not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me. What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it &amp; not with it. (E565-6)}}

Despite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/549274/the-radical-sex-and-spiritual-life-of-william-blake/2|title=The Radical Sex and Spiritual Life of William Blake|date=2015-11-29|work=Flavorwire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, "There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was "a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few", who "led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=9781603036962 |page=81 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that "the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence".

==Cultural influence==
{{Main article|William Blake in popular culture}}
[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]
Blake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the twentieth century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid twentieth-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley, Jr.

While Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work "[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.

Many such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: "Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes."&lt;ref&gt;Jung and William Blake.

Blake had an enormous influence on the [[Beat Generation|beat poets]] of the 1950s and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], frequently being cited by such seminal figures as beat poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], songwriters [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jim Morrison]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161104144618/http://zoamorphosis.com/2011/03/how-much-did-jim-morrison-know-about-william-blake/ zoamorphosis.com, ''How much did Jim Morrison know about William Blake''] Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Van Morrison]],&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/22/classics.williamblake ''Into the Mystic,'' ''Visions of paradise to words of wisdom... an homage to the written work of William Blake.''] ''The Guardian'', October 2000, Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Palmer,[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/20/arts/the-pop-life-105142.html "The Pop Life"] ''NY Times'', March 1985, Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and English writer [[Aldous Huxley]]. Much of the central [[conceit]] of [[Philip Pullman]]'s fantasy trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' is rooted in the world of Blake's ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Canadian music composer [[Kathleen Yearwood]] is one of many contemporary musicians that have set Blake's poems to music. After World War II, Blake's role in popular culture came to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music, film, and the [[graphic novel]], leading Edward Larrissy to assert that "Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Larrissy. ''Blake and Modern Literature''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2006. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
