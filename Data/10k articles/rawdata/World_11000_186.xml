[[File:380 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|250px|[[Plate reconstruction]] during the late [[Devonian]], showing the location of Armorica (Am) within the proposed Hun superterrane]]
[[File:Geologic map Armorican Massif EN.svg|thumb|Geological map of the Armorican Massif, the main outcrop of the Armorican terrane|250px]]
The '''Armorican terrane''', '''Armorican terrane assemblage''', or simply '''Armorica''', was a [[Continental fragment|microcontinent]] or group of continental fragments that [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] towards the end of the [[Silurian]] and collided with [[Euramerica|Laurussia]] towards the end of the [[Carboniferous]] during the [[Variscan orogeny]]. The name is taken from [[Armorica]], the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] name for a large part of northwestern [[France]] that includes [[Brittany]], as this matches closely to the present location of the rock units that form the main part of this terrane.

==Extent==
The main exposures of the Armorican terrane are found throughout Brittany, the [[Channel Islands]], parts of [[Upper Normandy]], forming the [[Armorican Massif]].&lt;ref name="Stampfli"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stampfli|first1=G.M.|last2=von Raumer|first2=J.F.|last3=Borel|first3=J.D.|editor=Martínez Catalán, J.R. |editor2=Hatcher, R.D.

==History==
All of the fragments that make up the Armorican terrane are thought to have originally formed part of the northern margin of Gondwana. Rifting initiated in the [[Cambrian]] to [[Ordovician]] although the terrane was still close enough to Gondwana to be affected by the [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] during the late Ordovician.&lt;ref name="Franke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Franke|first=W.|editor=Franke W. |editor2=Haak V. |editor3=Oncken O. |editor4=Tanner D.|title=Orogenic Processes: Quantification and Modelling in the Variscan Belt|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/abstract/179/1/35|series=Special Publications|volume=179|year=2000|publisher=Geological Society|location=London|pages=35–61|chapter=The mid-European segment of the Variscides: tectonostratigraphic units, terrane boundaries and plate tectonic evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complete separation from Gondwana, across the developing [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleotethys Ocean]], is thought to have occurred towards the end of the Silurian.&lt;ref name="Cocks"/&gt; At this time Armorica was separated from Laurussia by the [[Rheic Ocean]].

The Variscan orogeny marks the final closure of the Rheic Ocean as the various continental fragments, including Armorica, collided with Laurussia towards the end of the Carboniferous.&lt;ref name="Cocks"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">The '''Arogbo tribe''' of the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people live in southeastern [[Ondo State]], [[Nigeria]].

Historically, the Arogbo have had trading contacts with neighboring Ijaw tribes ([[Western Apoi tribe|Apoi]], [[Egbema tribe|Egbema]]) and the [[Ijebu]] and [[Ilaje]] Yoruba. Most Arogbo are bilingual, speaking dialects of both the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Ijoid languages|Ijaw languages]]. Historically, the Arogbo acted as middle men in the slave trade, selling captives from the interior to Europeans. The Arogbo migrated to their present location from the town of Gbaran in the central [[Niger Delta]]. Worship of the god [[Egbesu]] is particularly strong among the Arogbo.

The Arogbo are in present-day Ondo State. The founding ancestors of the Arogbo were part of the same migration from Ujo-Gbaran town. After a brief stop at Oproza, led by Perebeinmo they went on to Ukparomo (now occupied by the towns of Akpata, Opuba, Ajapa, and Ukpe). They stayed here for some time, about the length of the reign of two Agadagbas (military priest-rulers of the shrine of Egbesu). They then moved to the present site of Arogbo. From this place descendants spread out to found the Arogbo Ebe. It was from Arogbo that some ancestors migrated northwards up the old course of the Forcados river and settled near the site of Patani. Living nearby in the upland region were proto Edo or Efa people called Erowha. These ancestors later on intermarried with them and gave birth to the Uvwei and Effurun (Efferun or Efferu the ancestor of the Effurun or Ephron was a descendent of Gbaran) sections of Urhobo people.
During the time of the expansion of the Benin kingdom (1550), the Benin invaded Ukoruama (Lagos). The Arogbo sent soldiers to defend the Ijo living in that region. Their army camp became known as Idumu-Arogbo later shortened to Idumagbo. The Arogbo also successful halted the advance of the Benin army into the western delta and subsequently the whole of the Izon Ibe. The foundation of the Arogbo Ebe is  clearly pre-14th century AD. The ancestors of the Arogbo lived at Ujo-Gbaran between 700 – 1100 AD. Along with the ancestors of the Gbaramatu and [[Tuomo]] they moved to the Escravos region, while the Arogbo ancestors moved further west.&lt;ref&gt;Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005).

'''Automated flight following''' (AFF) is [[GPS Aircraft Tracking|GPS aircraft tracking]] that is mandated by a government agency (or other governing body) for its contractors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardianmobility.com/automated-flight-following/&lt;/ref&gt; The following criteria must be met:

* The device must transmit position reports every two minutes
* The position reports must be pushed into the third-party database (where they are automatically tracked by dispatchers&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aff.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;)

Common uses for AFF devices are contractors flying for [[USDA]] during fire season and contractors flying for utility companies.

'''CHU''' is the [[call sign]] of a [[shortwave radio|shortwave]] [[time signal]] [[radio]] station operated by the Institute for National Measurement Standards of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council of Canada]].

== History ==
Radio time signals allowed accurate and rapid distribution of time signals beyond the range of the telegraph or visual signals. This was of particular value in surveying remote areas, where time signals allowed accurate determination of longitude. In the summer of 1914, a survey party at Quinze Dam in the [[Ottawa River]] watershed attempted to receive time signals transmitted from [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]; however, signals were not resolvable and the time signal from [[Arlington County, Virginia]] was used instead.&lt;ref name=DASH78&gt;Malcolm M. Thomson, ''The Beginning of the Long Dash: A  History of Timekeeping in Canada'', University of Toronto Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0-8020-5383-1}},1 Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was started in 1923 by the [[Dominion Observatory]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], with a [[call sign]] of 9CC on an experimental basis until 1928. Regular daytime transmission began under the callsign of VE9OB in January 1929 on a wavelength of 40.8&amp;nbsp;metres (about 7.353&amp;nbsp;MHz). Continuous transmission at 90&amp;nbsp;metres began at the end of 1929, with other wavelengths being used experimentally.  Time signals were generated from the observatory's own pendulum clocks. The transmitter oscillators were condenser-tuned and so frequency stability was not high until quartz crystal control was implemented in 1933.  In 1938 the call was changed to CHU, operating on frequencies of 3.33, 7.335 and 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz, at a transmitter power of only 10&amp;nbsp;W. The 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz tone imposed on the carrier was derived from the quartz oscillator that determined transmit frequency, but the seconds pulses were still derived from the observatory pendulum clocks. The station automatically sent its call sign in Morse code once per hour, and pulses were coded to identify the time of day. Since the CHU power was not high enough to cover much of Canada, including survey parties working in the North, observatory time signals were also transmitted by a Department of Transport station with 2&amp;nbsp;kW power. In 1947 three new transmitters with 300&amp;nbsp;W power were installed for the three frequencies. In 1951, a Collins transmitter rated for 3&amp;nbsp;kW was put in service on 7.335&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=DASH78/&gt;

Since deciphering even a simple time code "by ear" was occasionally difficult under field conditions, voice announcements of time and station identification were added to CHU in 1952, using a [[speaking clock]] made by Atlier Brillie Freres of France. Fredrick Martin Meach of the Canadian embassy in Paris recorded the time announcements in English, which were stored on strips of photographic film and played back under control of the observatory clocks. In 1960 the speaking clock was replaced with one manufactured by [[Audichron]] corporation and rented by the Dominion Observatory; this unit had more intelligible voice quality and lower maintenance. New English voice announcements were recorded by Harry Mannis of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].  Bilingual announcements started in 1964, with French speech provided by Miville Couture of CBC Montreal.&lt;ref name=DASH78/&gt;

Until 1959 the carrier frequency, tone frequency and second pulses were derived from independent sources, and the carrier stability as that of any commercial short wave transmitter. A divider chain was put into service so that all of the CHU signals were derived from Western Electric standard crystal oscillators with pulses for seconds monitored by continuous comparison with the observatory clocks. By 1978 all parts of the CHU transmitted signal were derived from an NRC-designed [[Atomic clock|cesium beam frequency standard]].&lt;ref name=DASH78/&gt;

Also in 1959, the 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz transmitter was replaced with a new 20&amp;nbsp;kW unit. All site antennas were replaced with vertical antennas by 1971.

The station continued to be operated by the Observatory until 1970, when its operation was transferred to the Institute for National Measurement Standards at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]].

Effective January 1, 2009, CHU's 7&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency was changed to 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz, due to an allocations change and interference on 7.335&amp;nbsp;MHz.

== Broadcast format ==
CHU's signal is used for continuous dissemination of official Canadian government [[time signal]]s.  The CHU time signal and radio frequencies are derived from [[atomic clock]]s. CHU's announcers are [[Harry Mannis]] in English and [[Simon Durivage]] in French.

CHU will [[QSL card|acknowledge]] listeners' reception reports with [[QSL card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/services/time/short_wave.html NRC short wave station broadcasts (CHU)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[National Research Council Time Signal|time signal]] from the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] is used by [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] radio services daily at noon ET on Radio-Canada's ''[[Première Chaîne]]'', and 1pm ET on ''[[CBC Radio One]]''.

== Transmission system ==
CHU transmits 3 [[kW]] signals on 3.33 and 14.67 [[MHz]], and a 10&amp;nbsp;kW signal on 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The signal is [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]], with the lower [[sideband]] suppressed ([[Types of radio emissions|emission type]] H3E). The same information is carried on all three frequencies simultaneously including announcements every minute, alternating between English and French.

The CHU transmitter is located near [[Barrhaven|Barrhaven, Ontario]], 15&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Ottawa's central business district.

The systems feeding the transmitters are duplicated for reliability, and have both battery and generator protection.  The generator can also supply the transmitters. The announcements are made using digitally recorded voices.  Individual vertical [[dipole antenna]]s are used for each frequency.

CHU has long been licensed as "fixed service" within the band allocations of the [[International Telecommunications Union]].

CHU's 10&amp;nbsp;kW signal has been transmitted on 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz since January 1, 2009.  Before then, the signal was transmitted on 7.335&amp;nbsp;MHz, harmonically related to their 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency. The frequency change was necessary due to an ITU HF global reallocation at the 2003 [[World Radiocommunication Conference|World Radio Conference]] (WRC-03), where the frequency region around 7.3&amp;nbsp;MHz was turned over to different users.

== Time signal format ==
{{Listen|filename=CHU minute english announcement.ogg|title=Typical broadcast with English voice announcement|description=A typical minute's broadcast, including the Bell 103 time code and ending with the English-language announcement of 01:26 UTC on 21 November 2010.}}
{{Listen|filename=CHU_french_voice_announcement.ogg|title=French voice announcement|description=A French-language voice announcement for 01:43 UTC on the same day.}}
The primary time signal is a series of 300 ms-long [[Media:1000Hz.ogg|1,000 Hz]] tones, transmitted once per second, on the second.  The following exceptions to the pattern provide additional information:
* The top of the minute is marked by a half-second-long beep.
* The top of the hour is marked with a one-second-long beep, followed by nine seconds of silence.
* The 29th second of a minute is always omitted (no beep).
* Between one and sixteen seconds past the minute (except at the top of the hour), CHU transmits the difference between [[UT1]] and [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) by using split tones.  For positive DUT1 values from +0.1 to +0.8&amp;nbsp;s, seconds 1 through 8 are split.  For negative DUT1 values from −0.1 to −0.8&amp;nbsp;s, seconds 9 through 16 are split.
* Between 31 and 39 seconds past the minute inclusive, the once-per-second tones are reduced to 10-millisecond "ticks" while a digital time code is transmitted.  The digital time code is formatted so that a [[Bell 103 modem|Bell 103]]-compatible 300-baud modem can decode it,&lt;ref name="code"&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/services/time/broadcast_codes.html
|title = CHU Broadcast Codes
|accessdate = 2017-03-10
|date = 2012-10-12
|publisher = National Research Council of Canada, Institute for National Measurement Standards
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CHU is the only time signal station that uses this format for its time code transmissions.
* For the last 10 seconds of each minute (seconds 50 to 59), the once-per-second tones are again cut to 10 milliseconds each, while CHU transmits a brief voice station identification, followed by voice announcements of the next minute in UTC, alternating between [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].  French announcements, using the voice of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]] news anchor [[Simon Durivage]], are transmitted first on the odd minutes, while English announcements, voiced by late [[CBC Radio]] announcer [[Harry Mannis]], come first on the even minutes.

The digital time code sends 10 characters at 300 bits per second using 8N2 [[asynchronous serial communication]].  This follows the Bell 103 standard, a 2,225&amp;nbsp;Hz tone to represent a mark (1 bit) and 2,025&amp;nbsp;Hz tone for a space (0 bit). Immediately after the 10 ms tick, a mark tone is sent until 133.3&amp;nbsp;ms, then 110 data bits, ending at precisely 500 ms. The final stop bit is extended by 10&amp;nbsp;ms of mark tone to ensure it is detected reliably, and the final 490 ms of the second are silent.&lt;ref name="code"/&gt;  The time of day (day of year through second) is transmitted twice during each second from 32 to 39.  During second 31, additional information (year, DUT1, daylight saving time, and leap second warning bits) is transmitted.

== Western Canada signal coverage ==

[[Image:CHU-BC-dbu.png|thumb|300px|right|Coverage of new CHU transmitter proposed for Western Canada&lt;ref name=westernCHUproposal/&gt;]]
CHU often cannot be received in [[Western Canada]] on any of its broadcast frequencies. Propagation conditions, low transmitter power coupled with the typical two ionospheric hops distances from Ottawa result in relatively weak time signals for Western Canada. Electrical interference can further aggravate reception difficulty in suburban areas in the West. CHU can be practically unusable in most of Western Canada, [[Nunavut]], and the [[Northwest Territories]], for significant stretches of time.&lt;ref name=westernCHUproposal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15909391/CHU |title=CHU Western Canada Coverage Gap Elimination Proposal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. stations [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]] and [[WWVH]] are the fallback in Western Canada. In the high arctic, however, both the U.S. shortwave time stations and CHU become essentially unusable or unreliable.

Canada has no [[longwave]] time signal transmitters. The American station [[WWVB]] is the only option for reliable time signals during [[geomagnetic storm]]s in the Western Arctic, based on WWVB's published pattern maps.  If WWVB is not available, those who need precision time transfer may be able to use [[GPS]] [[time transfer]] instead.

Among Ritz’s more high-profile contributions is an article published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in December 2015. The article, based on research led by Ritz and Tamsin Edwards from [[Open University|The Open University]], created models based on satellite data to examine the potential impact of [[Antarctic sea ice]] collapse on global sea levels. Using more comprehensive methods than those used in previous studies,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151118155128.htm|title=Sea level rise from Antarctic collapse may be slower than suggested|website=www.sciencedaily.com|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team found that the collapse of [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s would have serious consequences for sea level rise (up to a half-meter by 2100 in a high-emissions scenario),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2016/04/antarctic-melting-to-boost-sea-levels-by-2100|title=Antarctica seen raising global seas by 2100 - Yale Climate Connections|date=2016-04-07|website=Yale Climate Connections|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that the effects likely would not be as dramatic as other high-profile studies had predicted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetimesgazette.com/scientists-say-antarctic-melt-may-be-less-severe/9406/|title=Scientists say Antarctic melt may be less severe {{!}} Times Gazette|website=www.thetimesgazette.com|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2015/november/sea-level-rise-from-anatarctic-collapse.html|title=Bristol University {{!}} News {{!}} November: Sea-level rise from Antarctic collapse|last=Bristol|first=University of|website=www.bristol.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team found that the most likely outcome is a sea level rise 10&amp;nbsp;cm by 2100, assuming that greenhouse gases rise at a medium to high rate,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and that it will be extremely unlikely for a rise of greater than 30&amp;nbsp;cm to occur.

Ritz also plays a prominent role in international efforts to monitor Antarctic ice and understand climate change. She is Chair of the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]] Ice Sheet Mass Balance and Sea Level Expert Group;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/ismass/ismass-members|title=Ice Sheet Mass Balance and Sea Level Expert Group|last=SCAR|first=|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; member of the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|SCAR]] Antarctic Climate Change in the 21st Century Scientific Research Programme;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/antclim21|title=Antarctic Climate Change in the 21st Century|last=SCAR|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the International Advisory Board of Ice Sheet Modellers to the BRITICE-CHRONO team, which is studying marine-influenced ice sheet decay of the British-Irish ice sheet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britice-chrono.group.shef.ac.uk/people/|title=People {{!}} BRITICE-CHRONO|website=www.britice-chrono.group.shef.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conductors Without Borders''' ('''CWB'''), is an international development programme for [[Conducting|conductor]]s and [[choral]] leaders who lack access to professional education, mentorship or guidance. The programme shall create insightful leadership committed to the social values of choral singing.

The programme was founded in 2007, hosted and supported by the [[International Federation for Choral Music]] (IFCM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Higgins|first=Lee|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=kA7TfA_iPiMC&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Community Music: In Theory and In Practice |page=108 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012 |isbn= 9780199777839}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the patronage of the composer [[Alberto Grau]] in [[Venezuela]]. It engages conductors who want to assist with the training of choral conductors and the improvement of choral singing in developing countries and regions.

The '''Croatian Carmelite Province of Saint Joseph the Father''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska karmelska provincija svetoga oca Josipa }}) is a province of the [[Carmelite Order]] of the [[Catholic Church]] which is active in [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]]. 

The first Croatian Carmelite monastery was formed in [[Sombor]] in 1904 by members of a Hungarian Carmelite province. In 1959, the Carmelites came to [[Zagreb]] and the following year built a monastery in [[Remete]]. Other monasteries were also built, but it was not until 1990 that today's province was established. Other monasteries exist in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Krk]], [[Brezovica, Zagreb|Brezovica]], [[Kloštar Ivanić]], [[Đakovačka Breznica]] and [[Marija Bistrica]]. 

Outside Croatia, the Carmelites have two monasteries in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Sarajevo]] and near [[Tomislavgrad]], one in [[Nënshat]], [[Albania]], one in [[Medvode]], [[Slovenia]], and one in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]].

[[File:Flag of Mpumalanga Province.svg|thumb|right|300px|Flag of Mpumalanga]]
The provincial '''flag of [[Mpumalanga]]''' was adopted in 1996, making the province the first (and so far, only) of South Africa's nine provinces to make use of an official provincial flag. The other provinces currently use the province's coat of arms on a white background. The design also features in the province's coat of arms. 

The canton of the flag is dominated by a stylised red [[Gerbera jamesonii|Barberton daisy]], a plant which is indigenous to the province. The diagonal strip of blue and white separating the green and gold bars is meant to represent the escarpment of the province's topology.

'''''Glass Town''''' is a fictitious world created by siblings of the [[Brontë family]]--[[Charlotte Brontë]], [[Branwell Brontë]], [[Emily Brontë]], and [[Anne Brontë]]. It first appeared in December 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith Kenyon|first=Karen|title=The Brontë Family: Passionate Literary Geniuses|year=2002|publisher=Lerner|isbn=0-8225-0071-X|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Glass Town'' writings constitute the Brontë ''Juvenilia''.

== Further developments ==
Glass Town was initiated by Charlotte Bronte and her brother Branwëll. Emily and Anne Brontë participated in the further developments of this imaginary world.

However, from 1831 onwards, Emily and Anne 'seceded' from the ''Glass Town Confederacy'' to create a 'spin-off' called ''Gondal'', which included many of their poems. This occurred at the time when Charlotte left her siblings to go and study at Head Roe.

After 1834, Charlotte and Branwell concentrated on an evolution of the ''Glass Town Confederacy'' called ''Anglria''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">The '''Legion of Death''' ({{lang-sl|Legija Smrti}}) was a regimental-size [[Slovenia]]n anti-Communist militia of the [[Second World War]]. It consisted of three [[battalion]]s and was formed in August 1942 when the [[Blue Guard (Slovene)|Blue Guard]] [[Styria]]n battalion was incorporated into the [[Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia]], the anti-Communist militia of the [[Fascist]] [[Italians]] who occupied Slovenia at the time. It mainly fought against the Communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]].
The unit reached a strength of 1,731 members in October 1942, but plans for further expansion were never realized. The unit was mainly led by former [[Yugoslav Royal Army]] officers. When the [[Capitulation of Italy|Italians capitulated]] in 1943, the unit was disbanded and its members absorbed into the [[Slovene Home Guard]] units.

{{see|List of currently reigning monarchs|List of current constituent monarchs|List of Current monarchies by continent}}
This is a list of current  [[Monarchy|monarchies]]. {{As of|2018}}, there are  43 [[sovereign state]]s in the world with a monarch as [[Head of state]]. They fall roughly into the following categories:
 
* '''[[Commonwealth realm]]s'''. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the monarch of sixteen Commonwealth realms ([[Antigua and Barbuda]]; the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]; the [[Commonwealth of the Bahamas]]; [[Barbados]]; [[Belize]]; [[Canada]]; [[Grenada]]; [[Jamaica]]; [[New Zealand]]; the [[Independent State of Papua New Guinea]]; the [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]; [[Saint Lucia]]; [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]; [[Solomon Islands]]; [[Tuvalu]]; and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]). They have evolved out of the [[British Empire]] into fully independent states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that retain the Queen as head of state, unlike other Commonwealth countries that are either dependencies, republics or have a different royal house. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role. 

* '''Other European constitutional monarchies'''.
**The [[Principality of Andorra]]; the [[Kingdom of Belgium]]; the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]; the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]; the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]; the [[Kingdom of Norway]]; the [[Kingdom of Spain]]; and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role.
**Andorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is, by definition, a [[diarchy]], with the Co-Princeship being shared by the [[President of France]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]]. This situation, based on historic precedence, has created a peculiar situation among monarchies, as a) both Co-Princes are not of Andorran descent, b) one is elected by common citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French Presidential Elections, c) the other, the bishop of Urgel, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the Pope.
* '''European constitutional/absolute monarchies'''. [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and [[Prince of Monaco|Monaco]] are constitutional monarchies in which the Prince retains many powers of an absolute monarch. For example, the [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|2003 Constitution referendum]] which gives the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] the power to veto any law that the [[Landtag]] (parliament) proposes and the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post. However, what makes him not an absolute monarch is that the people can call for a referendum to end the monarchy's reign. The [[Prince of Monaco]] has simpler powers but cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can elect the [[Minister of State of Monaco|minister of state]], [[Politics of Monaco|government council]] and judges. Both [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]] and [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Hans-Adam II]] have quite a bit of political power, but they also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.
* '''Muslim monarchies'''. These Muslim monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]]; the [[Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace]]; the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]]; the [[State of Kuwait]]; the [[Kingdom of Morocco]]; the [[Sultanate of Oman]]; the [[State of Qatar]]; the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]; and the [[United Arab Emirates]] generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts. The same goes for [[Malaysia]] where Islam is the official religion of the federation. &lt;ref&gt; http://tns.thenews.com.pk/malaysia-islamic-state/#.WRebi4ERWaM&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute monarchs remain in the [[Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace]]; the Sultanate of Oman; the State of Qatar; and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, while the Kingdom of Bahrain, the State of Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Malaysia, and the Kingdom of Morocco are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than European equivalents.
* '''East and Southeast Asian constitutional monarchies'''. The [[Kingdom of Bhutan]]; the [[Kingdom of Cambodia]]; Empire of [[Japan]]; and the Kingdom of [[Thailand]] have constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or ceremonial role. The Kingdom of Bhutan, Japan, and the Kingdom of Thailand are countries that were never colonized by European powers, but Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand have changed from traditional absolute monarchies into constitutional ones during the twentieth century, while the Kingdom of Bhutan changed in 2008. The Kingdom of Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the [[French Colonial Empire]], which was deposed after the [[Khmer Rouge]] came into power. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993.
* '''Other monarchies'''. Five monarchies do not fit into one of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] in [[Polynesia]]; [[Eswatini|Kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland)]] and the [[Kingdom of Lesotho]] in [[Africa]]; and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] and the [[Vatican City State]] in [[Europe]]. Of these, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Vatican City State are absolute monarchies. The Kingdom of Eswatini is also unique among these monarchies, often being considered a [[diarchy]]. The King, or [[Ngwenyama]], rules alongside his mother, the [[Ndlovukati]], as dual heads of state originally designed to be checks on political power. The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which more or less has become symbolic in recent years.  The [[Pope]] is the absolute monarch of the ''Vatican City State'' (different entity from the [[Holy See]]) by virtue of his position as head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than hereditary ruler and has not to be a citizen of the territory prior to his election by the cardinals.

==Lines of succession==
{{anchor|Oldest extant monarchies}}
Some of the extant sovereign monarchies have lines of succession that go back to the medieval period or antiquity:  
*[[Japan]], considered a [[constitutional monarchy]] under the [[Imperial House of Japan]], has a claim to being the world's oldest extant continuous hereditary monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=D.M.|title=Why is the Japanese monarchy under threat?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/06/economist-explains-0|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a traditional origin in [[Emperor Jimmu|660 BC]], and reliable historiographical evidence from at least the [[Emperor Kinmei|6th century]]. 
*The [[kings of Cambodia]] claim descent from [[Queen Soma]] (1st century), although the historiographical record is interrupted in the "[[Dark ages of Cambodia]]" (15th/16th centuries).
*The monarchs of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms [[Succession to the British throne|inherit the throne]] by virtue of the line of descent from the [[House of Stuart]] ([[Union of the Crowns]] 1603), combining the lines of succession of the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] going back to the 9th century. The succession to the English throne can be argued to originate with the [[House of Wessex]], established in the [[Cerdic|6th century]]; that to the Scottish throne with descent from [[List of kings of the Picts|Pictish kings]] which likewise enter the historical record around the 6th century.
*The monarchs of the [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|kingdom of Norway]] by virtue of descent from [[Harald I Fairhair]], who [[Unification of Norway|united the realm]] in 872. Harald as a member of the [[ House of Yngling]] is given a partly legendary line of succession from earlier petty kings in historiographical tradition.
*The [[kings of Spain]] via descent from the [[Catholic Monarchs]] (via the [[Habsburg Spain|House of Habsburg]]), ultimately combining the lines of succession of [[Sancho II of Castile and León|Castile and León]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], realms established in the  10th to 11th centuries in the course of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', via the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] claiming descent from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (which, originally ruled by the [[Thervingi]] kings, had become elective in the 6th century).

===Footnote===
{{note|1|1}} [[Belgium]] is the only existing [[popular monarchy]] – a system in which the monarch's title is linked to the people rather than a state. The title of Belgian kings is not ''King of Belgium'', but instead ''King of the Belgians''. Another unique feature of the Belgian system is that the new monarch does not automatically assume the throne at the death or abdication of his predecessor; he only becomes monarch upon taking a constitutional oath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8372">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Aruba'''. These are the mammal species in [[Aruba]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 0 are endangered, 2 are vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened.1 species has been classified as extinct.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

'''"Madrugada"''' ("Dawn") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Duarte Mendes]].

The song is a moderately up-tempo number, describing the joy felt in Portugal at the success of the [[Carnation Revolution]] of the year before, in which Mendes participated - which had been initiated by the playing of Portugal's previous Contest entry on the radio. Mendes describes the overthrow of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime as being like a "rebirth" and a "dawn" for his country, and sings that "there can't be enough songs like this".

The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following [[Finland]]'s [[Pihasoittajat]] with "[[Old Man Fiddle]]" and preceding [[Spain]]'s [[Sergio y Estíbaliz]] with "[[Tú volverás]]". At the close of voting, it had received 16 points ( a surprising 12 points from Turkey, placing 16th in a field of 19 - a rare feat of symmetry.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976 contest]] by [[Carlos do Carmo]] with "[[Uma flor de verde pinho]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year/participant-profile/?song=20481 Duarte Mendes - Madrugada].

The table reads "''{{lang|fr|Passants, cette terre est libre}}''" which translates to "Traveler, this land is free". Watercolour by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].]]
The '''Republic of Mainz''' was the first [[democracy|democratic]] state on the current [[Germany|German]] territory&lt;ref&gt;The shortlived republic is often ignored in identifying the "first German democracy", in favour of the [[Weimar Republic]]; e.g. "the failure of the first German democracy after the First World War (the Weimar Republic)..." (Peter J. Burnell, ''Democracy Assistance: international co-operation for democratization'' 2000:131), or Ch. 3. 'The First Attempt at Democracy, 1918-1933', in Michael Balfour, ''West Germany: a contemporary history'', 1982:60&lt;/ref&gt; and was centered in [[Mainz]]. A product of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], it lasted from March to July 1793.

== Context ==
During the [[War of the First Coalition]] against [[France]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] troops that had invaded [[France]] retreated after the [[Battle of Valmy]], allowing the French revolutionary army to counterattack. The troops of [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|General Custine]] entered the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in late September, and occupied Mainz on 21 October 1792. The ruler of Mainz, [[Prince-elector|Elector]]-[[Archbishop]] [[Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal]], had fled the city.

== Jacobin club ==
On the next day, 20 citizens of Mainz founded a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] club, the ''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft der Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit}}'' ({{lang-en|Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality}}). Together with their filial clubs founded later in [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], they promoted the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the French revolutionary ideals of ''{{lang|fr|liberté, égalité, fraternité}}'' in Germany, aiming for a German republic to be established following the French model. Most of the founding members of the Jacobin club were professors and students of the [[University of Mainz]], together with the university librarian, [[Georg Forster]], some merchants and Mainz state officials. For some time the ecclesiastic [[Friedrich Georg Pape]] was president of the club and editor of the ''{{lang|de|Mainzer Nationalzeitung}}'' ({{lang-en|Mainz National Newspaper}}).
[[File:Landtag Rheinland-Pfalz Mainz May 2004.JPG|thumb|left|The Deutschhaus in Mainz.]]

== Founding ==
By order of the [[National Convention|French National Convention]], elections in the French-occupied territories west of the [[Rhine]] were held on 24 February 1793.&lt;ref name="Landesarchiv"&gt;{{cite web |title=Der 18. März 1793.

The convention declared the represented territory (which extended to [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] in the west and to [[Landau]] in the south) to be free and democratic, and disclaimed any ties to the [[Holy Roman Empire|empire]]. The convention's president, [[Andreas Joseph Hofmann]], proclaimed the Rhenish-German Free State ({{lang-de|Rheinisch-Deutscher Freistaat}}) from the balcony of the Deutschhaus. On 23 March 1793, it was decided to send delegates (among them Georg Forster and [[Adam Lux]]) to [[Paris]] to seek the accession of the Free State to France. The French National Convention granted this request on 30 March.

== End ==
Soon after, Prussian troops retook all the French-occupied territory except for the heavily fortified city of Mainz itself. After a long [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|siege]] in which much of the city was destroyed, Prussian and Austrian troops conquered the city on 22 July 1793. The republic ended, and the Jacobins were persecuted until 1795, when Mainz came under French control again.

The '''Ópusztaszer National Heritage Park''' is an [[open-air museum]] of [[Hungarian history]] in [[Ópusztaszer]], [[Hungary]]. It was established in 1982 and is most famous for being the location of the [[Arrival of the Hungarians|Feszty Panorama]], a [[cyclorama]]  by  [[Árpád Feszty]] and his assistants, depicting the beginning of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] in 895. The painting was completed in 1894 for the 1000th anniversary of the event.&lt;ref name= "MagyarSzo p. 19"&gt;{{harvnb|MagyarSzo|2008|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itthon.hu"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2010 |url = http://itthon.hu/site/upload/mtrt/kiadvanyok/puszta/english/05.html|title = The Puszta and Lake Tisza|format = |publisher = Tourism portal of Hungary| accessdate = January 6, 2010 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ópusztaszer rotunda.jpg|thumb|180px|Rotunda in Ópusztaszer; the location of the Feszty Panorama]]
In the 1970s, a decision was made to build a heritage park in [[Csongrád County]]. Restoration of the ''[[Arrival of the Hungarians]]'' painting and the construction of a new [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] for the cyclorama began. Construction stopped in 1979 and parts of the canvas were again stored rolled up. In 1991, a Polish group of restorers won the contract for a new restoration.&lt;ref name="magyarmuzeum.org"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2010 |url = http://magyarmuzeum.org/index.php?projectid=4&amp;menuid=368#534|title =The Feszty Panorama Painting |format = |publisher = magyarmuzeum.org| accessdate = January 9, 2010 | last=Kerkay, Emese  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1995 it has been on display again, together with artificial terrain and hidden speakers playing sound effects. It is the main attraction of the heritage park of Ópusztaszer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">In the context of the [[Turkey–PKK conflict]], the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word '''itirafçı''' (confessor, informant, defector, {{IPA-tr|itirɑfˈt͡ʃə|}}) usually refers to any former member of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) who worked as an informant or collaborator for the [[Turkey|Turkish]] security forces against the PKK. Some merely provided intelligence, while others were persuaded or coerced into taking active roles in the conflict. ''İtirafçı''s played a significant role in the conflict in southeastern Turkey in the 1990s, as they were often used to do the extralegal work of security forces, particularly in the case of the unofficial [[Turkish Gendarmerie]] unit [[JİTEM]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurriyet Daily News]], 17 January 1997, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pkk-confessors-turn-into-state-hitmen.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=pkk-confessors-turn-into-state-hitmen-1997-01-17 PKK confessors turn into state hitmen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] (1999), [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/turkey/turkey993-05.htm VI.
