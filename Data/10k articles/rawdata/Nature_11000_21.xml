'''''A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution and Cooperation''''' is a 1999 book by [[Peter Singer]], in which the author argues that the view of human nature provided by evolution (e.g., [[evolutionary psychology]]) is compatible with and should be incorporated into the ideological framework of the [[Left-Right politics|Left]].

==Summary==
Singer believes that the Left will be better able to achieve its social and economic goals if it incorporates the more accurate view of human nature provided by evolutionary science: "To be blind to the facts about human nature is to risk disaster". For example, Singer argues that the Left's view of human nature as highly malleable, which he identifies with [[Marxism]] and the [[standard social science model]], is incorrect.

Singer argues that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is right. He concludes that [[game theory]] (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for [[co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]] that has also been selected for during [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Left Got Darwin Wrong|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-the-left-got-darwin-w|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=25 May 2012|author=Leigh Van Valen|date=June 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Philip Kitcher]] has criticised the book's handling of [[sociobiology]], saying that it contains "credulous retailing of sociobiological speculations" while noting that "much of this book is admirable in its clarity, directness, and grasp of central points".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kitcher | first1 = P. | title = Peter Singer, A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation | doi = 10.1086/339782 | journal = Ethics | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 861–863 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Almost like a Whale''''' by [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] is a modern introduction to [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' and closely follows its structure. It won the 1999 BP Natural World Book Prize.

An American version was published as '''''Darwin's Ghost: The Origin of Species Updated''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-375-50103-6}}).

The title refers to Darwin's observation that a [[bear]], swimming in a lake and catching [[insect]]s in its mouth, might conceivably [[Evolution|evolve]] over time into a creature "almost like a [[baleen whale|whale]]". This statement attracted much ridicule at the time.

'''Bond events''' are [[North Atlantic]] [[ice rafting]] events that are tentatively linked to climate fluctuations in the [[Holocene]]. Eight such events have been identified. Bond events were previously believed to exhibit a quasi c. 1,500-year cycle, but the primary period of variability is now put at c. 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Obrochta|first=Stephen P.|last2=Miyahara|first2=Hiroko|last3=Yokoyama|first3=Yusuke|last4=Crowley|first4=Thomas J.|date=2012-11-08|title=A re-examination of evidence for the North Atlantic “1500-year cycle” at Site 609|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379112003095|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=55|pages=23–33|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.08.008|bibcode=2012QSRv...55...23O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerard C. Bond]] of the [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]] at [[Columbia University]] was the lead author of the 1997 paper that postulated the theory of 1470-year climate cycles in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, mainly based on [[petrologic]] tracers of drift ice in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bond |first=G. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=Persistent Solar Influence on North Atlantic Climate During the Holocene |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5549 |pages=2130–2136 |doi=10.1126/science.1065680 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=11739949 |bibcode = 2001Sci...294.2130B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bond, G. | url = http://rivernet.ncsu.edu/courselocker/PaleoClimate/Bond%20et%20al.,%201997%20Millenial%20Scale%20Holocene%20Change.pdf | year = 1997 | title = A Pervasive Millennial-Scale Cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and Glacial Climates | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1257–1266 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1257 | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1257B | display-authors = etal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227192411/http://rivernet.ncsu.edu/courselocker/PaleoClimate/Bond%20et%20al.%2C%201997%20Millenial%20Scale%20Holocene%20Change.pdf | archivedate = 2008-02-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent work has shown that these tracers provide little support for 1,500-year intervals of climate change, and the reported c. 1,500 ± 500-year period was a statistical artifact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, following publication of the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svensson|first=A.|last2=Andersen|first2=K.

For reasons that are unclear, the only Holocene Bond event that has a clear temperature signal in the Greenland ice cores is the [[8.2 kiloyear event]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==List==
Most Bond events do not have a clear climate signal; some correspond to periods of cooling, but others are coincident with aridification in some regions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">In [[Statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]], '''marine bunkers''' and '''aviation bunkers'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/balancedefinitions/ Balances definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; as defined by the [[International Energy Agency]] are the energy consumption of ships and aircraft.

Marine and aviation bunkers are reported separately from international bunkers, which represent consumption of ships and aircraft on international routes.

International bunkers are subtracted from the energy supplies of a country to calculate its domestic consumption. It is as if international aviation and international shipping did not belong to any country. They are managed by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO).

== Critics ==
The [[European Federation for Transport and Environment]] has only limited confidence in IRAO and IMO's ability to reduce air and sea emissions due to international bunkers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.transportenvironment.org/newsroom/blog/planes-and-ships-cant-escape-paris-climate-commitments Planes and ships can't escape Paris climate commitments]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus to comply with the [[Paris Climate Agreement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">The '''Canadian Land Surface Scheme''' ('''CLASS''') is a [[Land-surface parameterisation model scheme|land surface parametrization scheme]] for use in [[Global climate model|large scale climate models]]. It is a state-of-the-art model, using [[Physics|physically based]] equations to simulate the [[energy balance (biology)|energy]] and [[Water balance|water]] balances of [[vegetation]], [[snow]] and [[soil]]. CLASS is being developed in a research project led by D. Verseghy at the [[Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service]].

{{Distinguish|Climbing (disambiguation){{!}}Climb}}
The '''climes''' (singular ''clime''; also ''clima'', plural ''climata'',  from Greek κλίμα ''klima'', plural κλίματα   ''klimata'', meaning "inclination" or "slope"&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Liddell and R. Scott, ''A Greek English Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;)  in classical [[Greco-Roman geography]] and [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomy]]  were the  divisions of the [[Ecumene|inhabited portion]] of the [[spherical Earth]] by [[geographic latitude]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Neugebauer, ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'', (New York: Springer Verlag, 1975), p. 725.  {{ISBN|0-387-06995-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Starting with [[Aristotle]] (''Meteorology'' 2.5,362a32), the Earth was divided into five zones, assuming two ''frigid'' climes (the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]]) around the poles, an uninhabitable ''torrid'' clime near the [[equator]], and two ''temperate'' climes between the frigid and the torrid ones.&lt;ref&gt;Abel K. (1974). "Zone". ''Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft''. Ed. A. F. von Pauly, G. Wissowa et al. Stuttgart. Suppl.-Bd. XIV: 989–1188.&lt;/ref&gt;
Different lists of climata were in use in [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman period|Roman]] time. Claudius [[Ptolemy]] was the first ancient scientist known to have devised the so-called system of seven climes (Almagest 2.12) which, due to his authority, became one of the canonical elements of late antique, medieval European and Arab geography. In [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]], the climes for 15 and 18 hours were used to calculate the changing length of daylight through the year.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Neugebauer, ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'', (New York: Springer Verlag, 1975), p. 731.  {{ISBN|0-387-06995-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of [[climate]] and the related term {{Linktext|clime}} are derived from the historical concept of ''climata''.
==Ptolemy==
[[Ptolemy]] gives a list of parallels, starting with the [[equator]], and proceeding north at intervals, chosen so that the longest day (summer [[solstice]]) increases in steps of a quarter of an hour from 12 hours at the equator to 18 hours at 58° N, and then, in larger steps, to 24 hours at the [[arctic circle]].

But for the purposes of his geographical tables, Ptolemy reduces this list to eleven parallels, dividing the area between the equator and 54°1' N into ten segments, at half-hour intervals reaching from 12 hours to 17 hours. Even later in his work, he reduces this to seven parallels, reaching from 16°27' N (13 hours) to 48°32' N (16 hours).

Ptolemy's system of seven climes was primarily adopted in Arabo-Persian astronomy, by authors  such as [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Idrisi]], and eventually by  [[al-Razi]], the author of the 16th-century ''haft iql&amp;#299;m'' ("seven climes"), while in Europe, Aristotle's system of five climes was more successful. This view dominated in medieval Europe, and existence and inhabitability of the Southern temperate zone, the [[Antipodes#Historical_significance|antipodes]], was a matter of dispute.

===Thirty-nine parallels===
To identify the parallels delineating his climes, Ptolemy gives a geographical location through which they pass. The following is a list of the 33 parallels between the equator and the polar circle (39 parallels between the equator and the pole:&lt;ref&gt;Otto Neugebauer, ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'', (New York: Springer Verlag, 1975), pp.43-5.  {{ISBN|0-387-06995-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
) of the full system of climes; the reduced system of seven climes is indicated by additional numbers in brackets (note that the latitudes are the ones given by Ptolemy, not the modern exact values):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">The '''continent-ocean boundary''' ('''COB''') or '''continent-ocean transition''' is the boundary between [[continental crust]] and [[oceanic crust]] on a [[passive margin]]. The identification of continent-ocean boundaries is important in the definition of plate boundaries at the time of break-up when trying to reconstruct the geometry and position of ancient continents e.g. in the reconstruction of [[Pangaea]].

==Techniques used in identification==
* Gravity data inversion - [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho]] depth can be derived by the inversion of satellite gravity data and thereby crustal thickness&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/10911/EGU2008-A-10911.pdf "Mapping Arctic Crustal Thickness and Ocean-Continent Transition using Gravity Inversion with a Lithosphere Thermal Correction"] Kusznir, N.J. Alvey, A., Lebedeva-Ivanova, N., Gee, D., Gaina, C. &amp; Torsvik, T.H. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Magnetic stripe data - Most areas of oceanic crust show characteristic stripes due to periodic [[Geomagnetic reversal|magnetic reversals]] during formation at a [[mid-oceanic ridge]]. The continental crust is by contrast typically magnetically quiet.
* Wide-angle [[seismic refraction]] and [[Reflection seismology|reflection]] data - These data give a precise location for the COB by determining the [[P-wave]] velocities along a profile. The two types of crust have distinct P-wave velocities.

==Economic importance==
As [[hydrocarbon exploration]] moves further offshore to look for the remaining potential on passive margins, understanding the location of the COB is critical to predicting possible hydrocarbon occurrence. This is both from the likely location of source and reservoir rocks and the need to model the thermal effects of break-up in [[basin modelling]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geodynamics.no/petromaks.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723121301/http://www.geodynamics.no/petromaks.htm |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crustal recycling''' is a [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] process by which surface material from the [[lithosphere]] is recycled into the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] by [[subduction erosion]] or [[Delamination (geology)|delamination]]. The subducting slabs carry volatile compounds and water into the mantle, as well as crustal material with an isotopic signature different from that of primitive mantle. Identification of this crustal signature in mantle-derived rocks (such as [[mid-ocean ridge]] basalts or [[kimberlite]]s) is proof of crustal recycling.'''

==Historical and theoretical context==

Between 1906 and 1936 seismological data were used by [[Richard Dixon Oldham|R.D. Oldham]], [[Andrija Mohorovičić|A. Mohorovičić]], [[Beno Gutenberg|B. Gutenberg]] and [[Inge Lehmann|I. Lehmann]] to show that the earth consisted of a solid crust and mantle, a fluid outer core and a solid innermost core.&lt;ref name="Lowrie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowrie|first=W.|title=Fundamentals of geophysics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2-NjUg4RtEC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=oldham+structure+of+the+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4qTOTtqqC5Pb8QOf5JDQDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=oldham%20structure%20of%20the%20earth&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2011|edition=2|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67596-3|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of seismology as a modern tool for imaging the Earth's deep interior occurred during the 1980s,&lt;ref name=Science1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = R.

D. | title = Zoned mantle convection | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 360 | issue = 1800 | pages = 2569 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2002.1081|bibcode = 2002RSPTA.360.2569A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ogawa1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = M. | title = Chemical stratification in a two-dimensional convecting mantle with magmatism and moving plates | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 108 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1029/2002JB002205|bibcode = 2003JGRB..108.2561O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Layered-mantle convection proponents hold that the mantle's convective activity is layered, separated by [[Close-packing|densest-packing]] phase transitions of minerals like [[olivine]], [[garnet]] and [[pyroxene]] to more dense crystal structures ([[spinel#The spinel structure|spinel]] and then [[silicate perovskite]] and [[post-perovskite]]). Slabs that are subducted may be negatively buoyant as a result of being cold from their time on the surface and inundation with water, but this negative buoyancy is not enough to move through the 660-km phase transition.

Whole-mantle (simple) convection proponents hold that the mantle's observed density differences (which are inferred to be products of mineral phase transitions) do not restrict convective motion, which moves through the upper and lower mantle as a single convective cell. Subducting slabs are able to move through the 660-km phase transition and collect near the bottom of the mantle in a 'slab graveyard', and may be the driving force for convection in the mantle locally&lt;ref name=grand&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Forte | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Mitrovica | first2 = J. X. | last3 = Moucha | first3 = R. | last4 = Simmons | first4 = N. A. | last5 = Grand | first5 = S.

==The fate of subducted material==
The ultimate fate of crustal material is key to understanding [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical cycling]], as well as persistent heterogeneities in the mantle, upwelling and myriad effects on magma composition, melting, plate tectonics, mantle dynamics and heat flow.&lt;ref name=lay&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lay | first1 = T. | title = The Fate of Descending Slabs | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume = 22 | pages = 33–61 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.000341|bibcode = 1994AREPS..22...33L }}&lt;/ref&gt; If slabs are stalled out at the 660-km boundary, as the layered-mantle hypothesis suggests, they cannot be incorporated into hot spot plumes, thought to originate at the core-mantle boundary. If slabs end up in a "slab graveyard" at the core-mantle boundary, they cannot be involved in flat slab subduction geometry. Mantle dynamics is likely a mix of the two end-member hypotheses, resulting in a partially layered mantle convection system.

Our current understanding of the structure of the deep Earth is informed mostly by inference from direct and indirect measurements of mantle properties using [[seismology]], [[petrology]], [[isotope geochemistry]] and [[seismic tomography]] techniques. Seismology in particular is heavily relied upon for information about the deep mantle near the core-mantle boundary.

==Evidence==
===Seismic tomography===
Although seismic tomography was producing low-quality images&lt;ref name=Science1 /&gt; of the Earth's mantle in the 1980s, images published in a 1997 editorial article in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' clearly showed a cool slab near the core-mantle boundary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kerr, Richard A.|title=Deep-Sinking Slabs Stir the Mantle|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/275/5300/613.full|date=January 31, 1997|pages=613–615|volume=275|issue=5300|journal=Science|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|doi=10.1126/science.275.5300.613|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did work completed in 2005 by Hutko et al., showing a seismic tomography image that may be cold, folded slab material at the core-mantle boundary.&lt;ref name=Hutko&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hutko | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lay | first2 = T. | last3 = Garnero | first3 = E. J. | last4 = Revenaugh | first4 = J. | title = Seismic detection of folded, subducted lithosphere at the core–mantle boundary | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7091 | pages = 333–336 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16710418 | doi = 10.1038/nature04757|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..333H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the phase transitions may still play a role in the behavior of slabs at depth. Schellart et al. showed that the 660-km phase transition may serve to deflect downgoing slabs.&lt;ref name=Schellart1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schellart | first1 = W. P. | title = Kinematics of subduction and subduction-induced flow in the upper mantle | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 109 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1029/2004JB002970|bibcode = 2004JGRB..109.7401S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the subduction zone was also key in whether the geometry of the slab could overcome the phase transition boundary.&lt;ref name=bercovicietal&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bercovici | first1 = D. | last2 = Schubert | first2 = G. | last3 = Tackley | first3 = P. J. | title = On the penetration of the 660 km phase change by mantle downflows | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 20 | issue = 23 | pages = 2599 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1029/93GL02691|bibcode = 1993GeoRL..20.2599B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineralogy may also play a role, as locally metastable olivine will form areas of positive buoyancy, even in a cold downgoing slab, and this could cause slabs to 'stall out' at the increased density of the 660-km phase transition.&lt;ref name=Marton1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marton | first1 = F.

Additional work completed by Spasojevic et al.&lt;ref name=Spasojevic1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spasojevic | first1 = S. | last2 = Gurnis | first2 = M. | last3 = Sutherland | first3 = R. | title = Mantle upwellings above slab graveyards linked to the global geoid lows | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 435 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/NGEO855|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..435S }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that local minima in the geoid could be accounted for by the processes that occur in and around slab graveyards, as indicated in their models.

===Stable isotopes===
Understanding that the differences between Earth's layers are not just [[rheology#Geophysics|rheological]], but chemical, is essential to understanding how we can track the movement of crustal material even after it has been subducted. After a rock has [[volcano|moved to the surface of the earth from beneath the crust]], that rock can be sampled for its [[stable isotope|stable isotopic composition]]. It can then be compared to known crustal and mantle isotopic compositions, as well as that of [[chondrite]]s, which are understood to represent original material from the formation of the solar system in a largely unaltered state.

One group of researchers was able to estimate that between 5 and 10% of the upper mantle is composed of recycled crustal material.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Eiler | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Sims | first3 = K. W. W. | last4 = Langmuir | first4 = C.

Kokfelt et al. completed an isotopic examination of the mantle plume under Iceland&lt;ref name=Kokfelt1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kokfelt | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Hoernle | first2 = K. A. J. | last3 = Hauff | first3 = F. | last4 = Fiebig | first4 = J. | last5 = Werner | first5 = R. | last6 = Garbe-Schönberg | first6 = D. | title = Combined Trace Element and Pb-Nd-Sr-O Isotope Evidence for Recycled Oceanic Crust (Upper and Lower) in the Iceland Mantle Plume | journal = Journal of Petrology | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 1705 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1093/petrology/egl025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that erupted mantle lavas incorporated lower crustal components, confirming crustal recycling at the local level.

A '''cryopump''' or a "cryogenic pump" is a [[vacuum pump]] that traps [[gas]]es and [[vapour]]s by condensing them on a cold surface, but are only effective on some gases. The effectiveness depends on the freezing and boiling points of the gas relative to the cryopump's temperature. They are sometimes used to block particular contaminants, for example in front of a [[diffusion pump]] to trap backstreaming oil, or in front of a [[McLeod gauge]] to keep out water. In this function, they are called a '''cryotrap''', '''waterpump''' or '''cold trap''', even though the physical mechanism is the same as for a cryopump.

'''Cryotrapping''' can also refer to a somewhat different effect, where molecules will increase their residence time on a cold surface without actually freezing ([[supercooling]]). There is a delay between the molecule impinging on the surface and rebounding from it.  Kinetic energy will have been lost as the molecules slow down. For example, [[hydrogen]] does not condense at 8 [[kelvin]]s, but it can be cryotrapped. This effectively traps molecules for an extended period and thereby removes them from the vacuum environment just like cryopumping.

==Operation==
Cryopumps are commonly cooled by compressed helium, though they may also use dry ice, [[liquid nitrogen]], or stand-alone versions may include a built-in [[cryocooler]]. Baffles are often attached to the cold head to expand the surface area available for condensation, but these also increase the radiative heat uptake of the cryopump. Over time, the surface eventually saturates with condensate and thus the pumping speed gradually drops to zero. It will hold the trapped gases as long as it remains cold, but it will not condense fresh gases from leaks or backstreaming until it is regenerated. Saturation happens very quickly in low vacuums, so cryopumps are usually only used in high or ultrahigh vacuum systems.

The cryopump provides fast, clean pumping of all gases in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] range. The cryopump operates on the principle that gases can be condensed and held at extremely low vapor pressures, achieving high speeds and throughputs. The cold head consists of a two-stage cold head cylinder (part of the vacuum vessel) and a drive unit displacer assembly. These together produce closed-cycle refrigeration at temperatures that range from 60 to 80K for the first-stage cold station to 10 to 20K for the second-stage cold station, typically.

Some cryopumps have multiple stages at various low temperatures, with the outer stages shielding the coldest inner stages. The outer stages condense high boiling point gases such as water and oil, thus saving the surface area and refrigeration capacity of the inner stages for lower boiling point gases such as nitrogen.

As cooling temperatures decrease when using dry ice, liquid nitrogen, then compressed helium, lower molecular-weight gases can be trapped.  Trapping nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen requires extremely low temperatures (~10K) and large surface area as described below. Even at this temperature, the lighter gases helium and hydrogen have very low trapping efficiency and are the predominant molecules in ultra-high vacuum systems.

Cryopumps are often combined with [[sorption pump]]s by coating the cold head with highly adsorbing materials such as [[activated charcoal]] or a [[zeolite]]. As the [[sorbent]] saturates, the effectiveness of a sorption pump decreases, but can be recharged by heating the zeolite material (preferably under conditions of low pressure) to [[outgassing|outgas]] it. The breakdown temperature of the zeolite material's porous structure may limit the maximum temperature that it may be heated to for regeneration.

Sorption pumps are a type of cryopump that is often used as roughing pumps to reduce pressures from the range of atmospheric to on the order of 0.1 [[pascal (unit)|Pa]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; Torr), while lower pressures are achieved using a finishing pump (see [[vacuum]]).

===Regeneration===
Regeneration of a cryopump is the process of evaporating the trapped gases. During a regeneration cycle, the cryopump is warmed to room temperature or higher, allowing trapped gases to change from a solid state to a gaseous state and thereby be released from the cryopump through a pressure relief valve into the atmosphere.

Most production equipment utilizing a cryopump have a means to isolate the cryopump from the vacuum chamber so regeneration takes place without exposing the vacuum system to released gasses such as water vapor. Water vapor is the hardest natural element to remove from vacuum chamber walls upon exposure to the atmosphere due to monolayer formation and hydrogen bonding. Adding heat to the dry nitrogen purge-gas will speed the warm-up and reduce the regeneration time.

When regeneration is complete, the cryopump will be roughed to 50μm (50 milliTorr or μmHg), isolated, and the rate-of-rise (ROR) will be monitored to test for complete regeneration. If the ROR exceeds 10μm/min the cryopump will require additional purge time.

The '''Cuban pine forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|tropical coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] on the [[Caribbean]] islands of [[Cuba]] and [[Isla de la Juventud]]. They cover an area of {{convert|6400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, occurring in separate sections in eastern Cuba and western Cuba and Isla de la Juventud.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0304 |name=Cuban pine forests|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Pine forests are found primarily in well-drained, nutrient-poor, acidic soils such as [[quartz]]iferous [[sand]]s, pseudo-spodosols in the west, and [[Laterite|lateritic]] soils. Pine trees and encino (''[[Quercus sagraeana]]'') obtain nutrients through an [[Mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] symbiosis with fungi, allowing them to attain tree size. The forests feature a dense xerophytic brushy story of mainly [[Rubiaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], and [[Melastomataceae]] along with a herbaceous story of a few [[epiphyte]]s, primarily from the genus ''[[Tillandsia]]'', and lianas. [[Secondary forest]]s formed by deforestation have a more open canopy with an understory dominated by ''[[Comocladia]] dentata''; grasses, lianas and epiphytes are poorly represented.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Western pine forests==
Western pine forests are found in the northern and southern plains surrounding the [[Sierra de los Órganos]] in [[Pinar del Río Province]] and on the northern half of [[Isla de la Juventud]]. Annual precipitation is less than {{convert|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with a dry season from November to April and a rainy season from May to October.  The temperature ranges from {{convert|21.5|to|28|C|F|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on}}, and is somewhat less at higher elevations. Pino macho ([[Caribbean pine|''Pinus caribaea'' var. ''caribaea'']]), which may reach heights of up to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and pino hembra (''[[Tropical pine|Pinus tropicalis]]'') dominate the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]. Other species such include peralejo (''[[Byrsonima crassifolia]]''), palma barrigona (''[[Colpothrinax wrightii]]''), icaco ([[Chrysobalanus icaco|''Chrysobalanus icaco'' var. ''hellocarpus'']]), encino (''[[Quercus sagraeana]]''), ''[[Calophyllum pinetorum]]'', ''[[Erythroxylum minutifolium]]'', ''[[Phania cajalbanica]]'', ''[[Vaccinium cubense]]'', ''[[Hyperbaena columbica]]'', ''[[Clusia rosea]]'', ''[[Copernicia]]'' species, yuraguano (''[[Coccothrinax yuraguana]]''), ''[[Aristida]]'' species and ''[[Andropogon]]'' species. Ferritic soils in Pinar del Río, such as in the Cajálbana plateau, are home to ''Pinus caribaea'' var. ''caribaea'' and an understory rich in endemic species. Mixed pine forests develop over oligotrophic quartzitic yellow soils in northern Pinar del Río province and Isla de la Juventud. They feature ''Pinus caribaea'' var. ''caribaea'', ''P. tropicalis'', and, possibly, ''Quercus sagraeana''. Dry, rocky pine forests found on the southern side of the Cajálbana plateau include pines, [[Cuban dry forests|thorny scrublands]], and ''[[Agave cajalbanensis]]'', an endemic succulent.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Eastern pine forests==
Small patches of pine forest occur around the [[Sierra Cristal]], Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa Mountains, and [[Sierra Maestra]]. These forests are found at higher elevations than western pine forests, up to {{convert|800|-|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}, making them cooler and wetter. Consequently, some of the vegetation resembles that of the [[Cuban moist forests|rainforests]], with an abundance of ferns. Pino de la Maestra (''[[Pinus maestrensis]]'') predominates in the Sierra Maestra, developing on landslide areas over granitic rock, while the Pino de Mayarí (''[[Cuban pine|Pinus cubensis]]'') predominates in the Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa. Some accompanying species in these forests are the griñapo (''[[Dracaena cubensis]]''), ''[[Eupatorium]]'' spp., ''[[Myrtus]]'' spp., ''[[Baccharis]]'' spp., ''[[Jacaranda arborea]]'' and ''[[Eugenia pinetorum]]''.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Fauna==
Endemic birds include the [[olive-capped warbler]] (''Dendroica pityophila''), [[Cuban kite]] (''Chondrohierax wilsonii''), [[Cuban trogon]] (''Priotelus temnurus''), [[Cuban amazon]], (''Amazona leucocephala'') and [[Cuban tody]] (''Todus multicolor'').&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; The [[Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis bairdii'') may remain in eastern pine forests, but is probably extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/greaterantillean_pine_forests.cfm |title=Greater Antillean Pine Forests |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WildWorld"&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion |id=nt0304 |name=Cuban pine forests|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Differential static light scatter''' ('''DSLS''') is a term coined to represent the change in total [[Light scattering|light scatter]] of a system over time or temperature in a static environment.

[[Static light scattering]] or SLS and its many types are well outlined in literature{{fact|date=October 2016}} and is the base principal for DSLS but varies specifically in that the difference (before and after) is the focus of this measurement. Typically the system will commence measurement at T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and over the course of time measure the change in light scatter. One of the more practical applications of DSLS is in the area of [[proteomic]] research and protein based chemistry. Solution conditions can be varied across samples of a specific protein in a screening scenario and the system can be kept at either a static temperature or be ramped up, or in some cases down. The change will be observed over time and the focus of the [[calculation]] is on the amount of change in signal from T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to T&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt; . This method of analysis provides researchers with data that helps them predict a protein or compound's stability in various conditions and further, in the case of proteomic structural work, can help identify the best protein candidates, and their optimal conditions to crystallize and thereby undergo [[x-ray crystallography]] for structural analysis.

There are other technologies or techniques using similar concepts such as DLS ([[dynamic light scattering]]) to obtain this information with the help of [[fluorophore]]s and the use of [[laser]]s for excitation however the primary focus in this arena is on particle sizing.{{fact|date=October 2016}} Also DLS has a greater focus in 'flow-based' instrumentation. Many proteins are discovered on an annual basis and in the field of drug discovery it is very important characterize the structure of a novel peptides as well as the best conditions to keep them in solution. Because of this staggering number of potential therapeutics churning out of this research sector today there is a strong need for instrumentation to best capture this data and to date there are a few solutions that are DSLS focused.  One such oriented instrument designed for high throughput scenarios utilizing standard HTS ([[high-throughput screening]]) SBS standard type plates (or automation friendly) is the StarGazer2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epiphyte3.com/Stargazer-2|title=Epiphyte3: Accelerating Protein Science|website=www.epiphyte3.com|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other solutions also available that have either wider focus to include particular sizing and [[Zeta potential]] but are limited but are limited by how many samples can be run at once, thus, non-HTS.{{fact|date=October 2016}} As DSLS in principal measures particles as they either aggregate (or grow larger) or, in theory, breakdown and grow smaller, this technology and method of measurement will pull in a number of great applications in the future in the food and beverage, or environmental sector as the technology is stretched into new applications beyond proteomics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3157">In [[Norse mythology]], the feminine '''Fjörgyn''' ([[Old Norse]] "earth"&lt;ref name=SIMEK86&gt;Simek (2007:86).&lt;/ref&gt;) is described as  the mother of the thunder god [[Thor]], son of [[Odin]], and the masculine '''Fjörgynn''' is described as the father of the goddess [[Frigg]], wife of Odin. Both names appear in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. A number of theories surround the names, and they have been the subject of scholarly discourse.

==Attestations==
Fjörgyn is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poem ''[[Hárbarðsljóð]]'' stanza 56 and ''[[Völuspá]]'' stanza 56. Fjörgynn is attested in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' books ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' chapter 9, and ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' chapter 19, and the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'' stanza 26. The name Fjörgyn also appears in [[Skald]]ic poetry at times as a synonym for "earth" or "land."&lt;ref name=LINDOW117&gt;Lindow (2001:117).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Divine pair===
[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorizes that Fjörgyn and Fjörgynn may have represented a divine pair of which little information has survived, along with figures such as the theorized [[Ullr]] and Ullin, [[Njörðr]] and [[Nerthus]], and the attested [[Freyr]] and [[Freyja]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1990:106, 111)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fjörgyn and Jörð===
Rudolf Simek states that Fjörgyn may simply be another name for [[Jörð]], whose name also means "earth," since she does not appear listed in the Prose Edda as a unique goddess, but that the fact that she does not appear elsewhere in Skaldic poetry "as would be expected of a purely literary alternative to Jörð" may be notable.&lt;ref name=SIMEK86/&gt;

===Proto-Indo-European basis===
Theories have been proposed that Fjörgyn may represent an extension of an earlier [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] thunder or rain god or goddess due to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European linguistic]] connections between Norse ''Fjörgyn'', the [[Hindu]] rain god [[Parjanya]], the Lithuanian god [[Perkūnas]], and the Slavic god [[Perun]].&lt;ref name=MALLORY129&gt;Mallory (1989:129).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GU50.JPG|thumb|right|GU-50 produced in 1977 at the Ulianovsk factory]]
The '''GU-50''' (Russian: '''ГУ-50''') is a power [[pentode]] [[vacuum tube]] intended for 50 watt operation as a linear [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifier on frequencies up to 120 [[MHz]].  It is in fact a Soviet-produced copy of the [[Telefunken]] '''LS-50''' power pentode, possibly reverse-engineered from German ([[Wehrmacht]]) military radios captured during [[World War II]], or based on documentation, machines and materials captured as a trophy.  It is one of the more unusual types of tube because of its non-standard 8-pin base and a metal "cap" (not connected to any of the tube internal elements) with a plastic "handle" on top of the envelope - which is meant to ease extracting the tube from its socket (especially when the tube is hot). One stock Russian-produced socket includes a rugged die-cast metal cage-like enclosure for the tube with spring-loaded locking lid. (The cap was made for fixation of the tube in the metal can, since tubes were designed for mobile operations). Another stock Russian-produced socket is stamped of light aluminium sheet metal, without a lid on top.

In the past the tube was very popular with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Eastern European]] [[amateur radio]] operators because it was commonly available (from military and government warehouses) and could produce fairly large amounts of output power using relatively simple designs. Also, it was popular in Soviet era DIY audio amplifiers for hi-fi and musical instruments. GU-50 tubes were used also in early TV sets as a horizontal sweep output stage, and in medical devices as RF generators. The tube was never used in mass production amplifiers for civil usage because of relatively expensive technology and materials used.

During the Soviet years the tube was produced by one of the major Soviet transmitting-tube manufacturers in the city of [[Ulianovsk]]. It was also made in Poland, in the Unitra factory. At this time it is unclear if current production of the tube exists; however, large quantities of New Old Stock (NOS) GU-50s appear to be available in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the type is far more readily found than the original LS-50.

GU-50 was not alone. There were other successors of LS-50 designed by Telefunken. Switzerland's BBC produced P50/1 and later modified version P50/2. They had the same base and pinout as the original LS-50. German Democratic Republic made a P50 that had the same bulb as Soviet ГУ-50.  Later RFT made a P50-1 version of their tube. Unlike Soviet TV designers that used stock military GU-50 for their first TV sets, Eastern German manufacturers offered P50-2 especially made for TV horizontal sweep duties. There were also versions with simplified bulbs made for civil usage, but internals were still too expensive to compete with civil tubes like rugged clones of RCA 6L6 and especially designed later sweep tubes like EL500. The Western German version was called FL152 (or, with 6.3 volts heater, EL152); Eastern German version was called SRS552N.

The tube, despite its European popularity, was not well known in U.S.A. and Canada until audiophiles rediscovered it after the collapse of Eastern political block and Soviet Union.

The Chinese version of this tube is called FU-50 and production still continues, probably by Shuguang, the major Chinese tube builder.

The tube was originally designed for mobile operations, so its filament draws only 0.705 A of current, while anode power dissipation allowed is up to 40w, quite big for such low filament power. It determines the need for high anode voltage, 800V typically. The screen grid is quite dense, so it's voltage when working in pentode mode is limited by 300V, otherwise power dissipated by the grid when anode voltage goes below screen grid voltage would damage it. That's why the tube can't be efficiently used in so called "Ultra - Linear" regime when anode and screen grid have the same voltage at idle. However, in triode mode anode voltage never goes below screen grid voltage, so 400-450V of B+ is acceptable.

The tube can work also in so called "Right handed triode" mode, or "High Mu" mode, when all 3 grids are connected together and used with positive bias. In such regime B+ voltage can be up to 1200V, and anode curves resemble pentode ones, with higher than in the "left handed" triode mode impedance.

Anode of the tube is made of a special nickel alloy, specially coated, so it can shortly dissipate more than 100W on anode without destruction. However, such regime causes too high temperature to be used continuously, but instead of destroying the tube like it can be expected in case of so-called "Audio Tubes" like 6L6 and successors, it causes absorption of gases making vacuum cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wavebourn.com/images/redplate.jpg|format=JPG|title=Image of red plate|website=Wavebourn.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geotail''' is a [[satellite]] observing the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]].  It was developed by Japan's [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] in association with the United States' [[NASA]], and was launched by a [[Delta II]] rocket on July 24, 1992.

From the Geotail website (listed below): "The Geotail satellite was launched on July 24, 1992, by a Delta II launch vehicle from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], Florida, United States. The primary purpose of this mission is to study the structure and dynamics of the tail region of the magnetosphere with a comprehensive set of scientific instruments. For this purpose, the orbit has been designed to cover the magnetotail over a wide range of distances: {{Earth radius|8}} to {{Earth radius|210}} from the earth. This orbit also allows us to study the boundary region of the magnetosphere as it skims the magnetopause at perigees. In the first two years the double lunar swing-by technique was used to keep apogees in the distant magnetotail. The apogee was lowered down to {{Earth radius|50}} in mid November 1994 and then to {{Earth radius|30}} in February 1995 in order to study substorm processes in the near-Earth tail region. The present orbit is {{Earth radius|9}} × {{Earth radius|30}} with inclination of -7° to the ecliptic plane."

Geotail instruments studied electric fields, magnetic fields, plasmas, energetic particles, and plasma waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stp.isas.jaxa.jp/geotail/instrument_list.html Instruments of the Geotail Spacecraft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903035811/http://www.stp.isas.jaxa.jp/geotail/instrument_list.html |date=2012-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the principal investigator of the Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI),  the experiment complement, was Professor [[Hiroshi Matsumoto (engineer)|Hiroshi Matsumoto]] of Kyoto University, with co-investigators from NASA, the University of Iowa, and STX Corporation.&lt;ref name=GeotailInstrument&gt;{{cite web|title=The Geotail Plasma Wave Instrument|url=http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/geotail/instrument.html|website=www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu|accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Geotail is an active mission {{as of|2018|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/missions/geotail/ NASA - Geotail]&lt;/ref&gt; Geotail, [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]], [[Polar (satellite)|Polar]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], and [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] were all part of the [[International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Science Initiative]] (ISTP) project.&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt;

'''''Gulliver's Travels''''', or '''''Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships''''' (which is the full title), is a prose [[satire]]&lt;ref name="DeMaria Jr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swift|first1=Jonathan|editor1-last=DeMaria|editor1-first=Robert J=Gulliver's Travels|date=2003|publisher=Penguin|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=I-Narrators&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swift|first1=Jonathan|editor1-last=Rawson|editor1-first=Claude|editor1-link=Swift's 'I' Narrators|title=Gulliver's Travels|date=2009|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|page=875}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and clergyman [[Jonathan Swift]], that is both a satire on [[human nature]] and the [[travel literature|"travellers' tales"]] literary subgenre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of [[English literature]]. He himself claimed that he wrote ''Gulliver's Travels'' "to vex the world rather than divert it".

The book became popular as soon as it was published. [[John Gay]] wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that "It is universally read, from the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[council]] to the nursery."&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels: Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts'', Palgrave Macmillan 1995 (p. 21). The quote has been misattributed to Alexander Pope, who wrote to Swift in praise of the book just a day earlier.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Robert McCrum]] released his selection list of 100 best novels of all time where ''Gulliver’s Travels'', a satirical masterpiece, is listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/17/the-100-best-novels-written-in-english-the-full-list|title=The 100 best novels written in English: the full list|accessdate=17 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput===
;4 May 1699&lt;ref&gt;e="Project Gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gulliver in Liliput, Bremen.jpg|thumb|Mural depicting Gulliver surrounded by citizens of Lilliput.]]
The travel begins with a short preamble in which [[Lemuel Gulliver]] gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not harm their subjects.

At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.

Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, "a considerable person at court", he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home.

===Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag===
;20 June 1702&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 3 June 1706&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg"/&gt;
[[File:gulliver.jpg|thumb|''Gulliver exhibited to the Brobdingnag Farmer'' (painting by [[Richard Redgrave]])]]
Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship ''Adventure'' is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and is left on a peninsula on the western coast of the [[North American]] continent.

The grass of that land is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who was about 72&amp;nbsp;ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating a man's step being {{convert|10|yd|m|0}}. He brings Gulliver home and the farmer's daughter [[Glumdalclitch]] cares for Gulliver. The [[Giant (mythology)|giant]]-sized farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant shows make Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the Queen of [[Brobdingnag]]'s service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the Queen of Brobdingnag commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his "travelling box".

Between small adventures such as fighting giant [[wasp]]s and being carried to the roof by a [[monkey]], he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The King is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by some sailors who return him to England.

===Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan===
{{See also|Floating cities and islands in fiction}}
;5 August 1706&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 16 April 1710&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Proyecto Gutenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laputa - Grandville.jpg|thumb|upright|Gulliver discovers Laputa, the flying island (illustration by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|J. J. Grandville]])]]
Setting out again, Gulliver's ship is attacked by [[Piracy|pirates]] and he is [[Marooning|marooned]] close to a desolate rocky island near India. He is rescued by the [[Floating island (fiction)|flying island]] of [[Laputa]], a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends. Rather than use armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.

Gulliver tours [[Balnibarbi]], the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy and on the [[Royal Society]] and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of [[Lagado]] in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on researching completely preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons (see [[Muckraker|muckraking]]). Gulliver is then taken to [[Maldonada (Gulliver's Travels)|Maldonada]], the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can take him on to Japan.

While waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a short side-trip to the island of [[Glubbdubdrib]] which is southwest of Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician's dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most obvious restatement of the "ancients versus moderns" theme in the book. The ghosts consist of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Pierre Gassendi]].

On the island of [[Luggnagg]], he encounters the ''[[struldbrug]]s'', people who are immortal. They do not have the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty.

After reaching [[Japan in Gulliver’s Travels|Japan]], Gulliver asks the Emperor "to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of [[Fumi-e|trampling upon the crucifix]]", which the Emperor does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of his days.

===Part IV: A Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms===
;7 September 1710&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 5 December 1715&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg"/&gt;
[[File:Gulliver u Hvajninimů - Grandville.jpg|thumb|Gulliver in discussion with Houyhnhnms (1856 illustration by [[J.J. Grandville]]).]]
Despite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a [[wikt:merchantman|merchantman]], as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew whom he believes to have turned the rest of the crew against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of hideous, deformed and savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]].

Gulliver becomes a member of a horse's household and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them. However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver's "Master," the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise, courteous, and generous person.

He returns to his home in England, but he is unable to reconcile himself to living among "Yahoos" and becomes a recluse, remaining in his house, largely avoiding his family and his wife, and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables.

==Composition and history==
It is uncertain exactly when Swift started writing ''Gulliver's Travels'' (much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], whilst Swift stayed there) but some sources{{which|date=August 2013}} suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, [[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] and others formed the [[Scriblerus Club]] with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the "travellers' tales" literary subgenre. It is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as ''Gulliver's Travels'' was a transparently anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish [[pamphlet]]s (the ''Drapier's Letters''). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher [[Benjamin Motte]], who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Probyn, ''Swift, Jonathan (1667–1745)'', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: [[Oxford]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of [[Lindalino]]), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8''s''. ''6''d.''&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Journal'' 28 Oct 1726, "This day is published".&lt;/ref&gt;

Motte published ''Gulliver's Travels'' anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput''), parodies (''Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish'd the Palace Fire...'') and "keys" (''Gulliver Decipher'd'' and ''Lemuel Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz'd'', the second by [[Edmund Curll]] who had similarly written a "key" to Swift's ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner's edition of 1735. Swift's friend [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a set of five ''Verses on Gulliver's Travels'', which Swift liked so much that he added them to the second edition of the book, though they are rarely included.

===Faulkner's 1735 edition===
In 1735 an Irish publisher, [[George Faulkner]], printed a set of Swift's works, Volume III of which was ''Gulliver's Travels''. As revealed in Faulkner's "Advertisement to the Reader", Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of Motte's work by "a friend of the author" (generally believed to be Swift's friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without Motte's amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner's edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this is regarded as the ''[[Editio Princeps]]'' of ''Gulliver's Travels'' with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, ''A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson'', which complained of Motte's alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that "I do hardly know mine own work" and repudiating all of Motte's changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.

===Lindalino===
The five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of [[Lindalino]] against the flying island of Laputa, was an obvious allegory to the affair of ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented [[Dublin]] and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of [[William Wood (ironmaster)|William Wood]]'s poor-quality copper currency. Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from did not include the passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the ''Collected Works''. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.

[[Isaac Asimov]] notes in ''The Annotated Gulliver'' that Lindalino is generally taken to be Dublin, being composed of double lins; hence, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|editor=Isaac Asimov|title=The Annotated Gulliver's Travels|date=1980|publisher=Clarkson N Potter Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-517-539497|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:James Gillray The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver.–Vide. Swift's Gulliver- Voyage to Brobdingnag The Metropolitan Museum of Art edit.jpg|thumb|upright|''The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver'' by [[James Gillray]] (1803), (satirising [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[George III of England|George III]]). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
''Gulliver's Travels'' has been the recipient of several designations: from [[Menippean satire]] to a children's story, from proto-science fiction to a forerunner of the modern novel.

Published seven years after [[Daniel Defoe]]'s wildly successful ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Gulliver's Travels'' may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In ''The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man'', [[Warren Montag]] argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.

Scholar Allan Bloom points out that Swift's critique of science (the experiments of Laputa) is the first such questioning by a modern liberal democrat of the effects and cost on a society which embraces and celebrates policies pursuing scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Bloom|title=Giants and Dwarfs: An Outline of Gulliver's Travels|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990|location=New York|pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible reason for the book's classic status is that it can be seen as many things to many different people. Broadly, the book has three themes:
* A satirical view of the state of European government, and of petty differences between religions
* An inquiry into whether men are inherently corrupt or whether they become corrupted
* A restatement of the older "ancients versus moderns" controversy previously addressed by Swift in ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''

In storytelling and construction the parts follow a pattern:
* The causes of Gulliver's misadventures become more malignant as time goes on—he is first shipwrecked, then abandoned, then attacked by strangers, then attacked by his own crew.
* Gulliver's attitude hardens as the book progresses—he is genuinely surprised by the viciousness and politicking of the Lilliputians but finds the behaviour of the Yahoos in the fourth part reflective of the behaviour of people.
* Each part is the reverse of the preceding part—Gulliver is big/small/wise/ignorant, the countries are complex/simple/scientific/natural, and the forms of government are worse/better/worse/better than England's.
* Gulliver's viewpoint between parts is mirrored by that of his [[antagonist]]s in the contrasting part—Gulliver sees the tiny Lilliputians as being vicious and unscrupulous, and then the king of Brobdingnag sees Europe in exactly the same light; Gulliver sees the Laputians as unreasonable, and his Houyhnhnm master sees humanity as equally so.
* No form of government is ideal—the simplistic Brobdingnagians enjoy public executions and have streets infested with beggars, the honest and upright Houyhnhnms who have no word for lying are happy to suppress the true nature of Gulliver as a Yahoo and are equally unconcerned about his reaction to being expelled.
* Specific individuals may be good even where the race is bad—Gulliver finds a friend in each of his travels and, despite Gulliver's rejection and horror toward all Yahoos, is treated very well by the Portuguese captain, Don Pedro, who returns him to England at the novel's end.

Of equal interest is the character of Gulliver himself—he progresses from a cheery optimist at the start of the first part to the pompous [[misanthrope]] of the book's conclusion and we may well have to filter our understanding of the work if we are to believe the final misanthrope wrote the whole work. In this sense ''Gulliver's Travels'' is a very modern and complex novel. There are subtle shifts throughout the book, such as when Gulliver begins to see all humans, not just those in Houyhnhnm-land, as Yahoos. However, a feminist perspective of ''Gulliver's Travels'' argues that it is [[misogyny]], and not misanthropy, that is shown in Gulliver.&lt;ref name="1667-1745"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31794911|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=1667-1745.|first=Swift, Jonathan,|others=Fox, Christopher, 1948-|isbn=9780312066659|location=Boston|oclc=31794911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout, Gulliver is presented as being gullible; he believes what he is told, never perceives deeper meanings, is an honest man, and expects others to be honest. This makes for fun and irony; what Gulliver says can be trusted to be accurate, and he does not always understand the meaning of what he perceives.

Also, although Gulliver is presented as a commonplace "[[everyman]]", lacking higher education, he possesses a remarkable natural gift for language. He quickly becomes fluent in the native tongue of any strange land in which he finds himself, a literary device that adds verisimilitude and humour to Swift's work.

Despite the depth and subtlety of the book, it is often classified as a children's story because of the popularity of the Lilliput section (frequently [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]]) as a book for children. One can still buy books entitled ''Gulliver's Travels'' which contain only parts of the Lilliput voyage.

=== Misogyny ===
A well-known underlying theme in ''Gulliver's Travels'' is misogyny. Swift uses satire to openly mock misogyny throughout the book, with one of the most cited examples of this coming from Gulliver's description of a Brobdingnagian woman:

"I must confess no Object ever disgusted me so much as the Sight of her monstrous Breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious Reader an Idea of its Bulk, Shape, and Colour.... This made me reflect upon the fair Skins of our ''English'' Ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own Size, and their Defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass...."

This open critique towards aspects of the female body is something that Swift often brings up in other works of his, particularly in poems such as ''The Lady's Dressing Room'' and ''A Beautiful Young Nymph Going To Bed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Katharine M.|date=1959|title="MY FEMALE FRIENDS": THE MISOGYNY OF JONATHAN SWIFT|jstor=40753638|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=1|issue=3|pages=366–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known criticism of Swift's use of misogyny by Felicity A. Nussbaum proposes the idea that “Gulliver himself is a gendered object of satire, and his antifeminist sentiments may be among those mocked.” Gulliver’s own masculinity is often mocked, seen in how he is made to be a coward among the Brobdingnag people, repressed by the people of Lilliput, and viewed as an inferior Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms.&lt;ref name="1667-1745"/&gt;&lt;!--gender characteristics generate from deeply meaningful personal ethic differences expressly associated with grammatical gender. Popular historical literature more likely create gender as known today, than criticize gender as known today; even if somehow the literature criticized gender as known when authoring. Also, characters rarely form models of behavior unless those characters exhibit difficulty to perfectly imitate but-rather models of behavior form from veritable what-ifs tested in the reader's reality--&gt;

Another criticism of Swift's use of misogyny delves into Gulliver's repeated use of the word 'nauseous,' and the way that Gulliver is fighting his emasculation by commenting on how he thinks the women of Brobdingnag are disgusting.

"Swift has Gulliver frequently invoke the sensory (as opposed to reflective) word "nauseous" to describe this and other magnified images in Brobdingnag not only to reveal the neurotic depths of Gulliver's misogyny, but also to show how male nausea can be used as a pathetic countermeasure against the perceived threat of female consumption. Swift has Gulliver associate these magnified acts of female consumption with the act of "throwing-up" — the opposite of and antidote to the act of gastronomic consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4625129|title=The Sexual Politics of Microscopy in Brobdingnag|last=Armintor|first=Deborah|date=2007|website=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This commentary of Deborah Needleman Armintor relies upon the way that the giant women do with Gulliver as they please, in much the same way as one might play with a toy, and get it to do everything one can think of.  Armintor's comparison focuses on the pocket microscopes that were popular in Swift's time.  She talks about how this instrument of science was transitioned to something toy-like and accessible, so it shifted into something that women favored, and thus men lose interest.  This is similar to the progression of Gulliver's time in Brobdingnag, from man of science to women's plaything.

=== Comic Misanthropy ===
[[Misanthropy]] is a theme that scholars have identified in ''Gulliver's Travels.''  Arthur Case, R.S. Crane, and Edward Stone discuss [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]]'s development of misanthropy and come to the consensus that this theme ought to be viewed as comical rather than cynical.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Case, Arthur E. “From ‘The Significance of ''Gulliver’s Travels''.’” ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P. Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 139–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Crane, R. S. “The Houyhnhnms, the Yahoos, and the History of Ideas.” ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Gulliver’s Travels: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Frank Brady, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1968, pp. 80–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Stone, Edward. “Swift and the Horses: Misanthropy or Comedy?” ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P. Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 180–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Gulliver's development of misanthropy, these three scholars point to the fourth voyage.  According to Case, Gulliver is at first averse to identifying with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], but, after he deems the [[Houyhnhnm]]s superior, he comes to believe that humans (including his fellow Europeans) are Yahoos due to their shortcomings.  Perceiving the Houyhnhnms as perfect, Gulliver thus begins to perceive himself and the rest of humanity as imperfect.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  According to Crane, when Gulliver develops his misanthropic mindset, he becomes ashamed of humans and views them more in line with animals.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  This new perception of Gulliver's, Stone claims, comes about because the Houyhnhnms' judgement pushes Gulliver to identify with the Yahoos.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Along similar lines, Crane holds that Gulliver's misanthropy is developed in part when he talks to the Houyhnhnms about mankind because the discussions lead him to reflect on his previously held notion of humanity.  Specifically, Gulliver’s master, who is a Houyhnhnm, provides questions and commentary that contribute to Gulliver’s reflectiveness and subsequent development of misanthropy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  However, Case points out that Gulliver's dwindling opinion of humans may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that he is no longer able to see the good qualities that humans are capable of possessing.  Gulliver’s new view of humanity, then, creates his repulsive attitude towards his fellow humans after leaving Houyhnhnmland.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  But in Stone's view, Gulliver’s actions and attitude upon his return can be interpreted as misanthropy that is exaggerated for comic effect rather than for a cynical effect.  Stone further suggests that Gulliver goes mentally mad and believes that this is what leads Gulliver to exaggerate the shortcomings of humankind.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Over time, though, Gulliver is able to get used to humanity again.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Another aspect that Crane attributes to Gulliver’s development of misanthropy is that when in Houyhnhnmland, it is the animal-like beings (the Houyhnhnms) who exhibit reason and the human-like beings (the Yahoos) who seem devoid of reason; Crane argues that it is this switch from Gulliver’s perceived norm that leads the way for him to question his view of humanity.  As a result, Gulliver begins to identify humans as a type of Yahoo.  To this point, Crane brings up the fact that a traditional definition of man – ''Homo est animal rationale'' (Humans are rational animals) – was prominent in academia around [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]’s time.  Furthermore, Crane argues that Swift had to study this type of logic (see [[Porphyrian tree|Porphyrian Tree]]) in college, so it is highly likely that he intentionally inverted this logic by placing the typically given example of irrational beings – horses – in the place of humans and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Stone points out that ''Gulliver's Travels'' takes a cue from the genre of the travel book, which was popular during Swift's time period.  From reading travel books, Swift’s contemporaries were accustomed to beast-like figures of foreign places; thus, Stone holds that the creation of the Yahoos was not out of the ordinary for the time period.  From this playing off of familiar genre expectations, Stone deduces that the parallels that Swift draws between the Yahoos and humans is meant to be humorous rather than cynical.  Even though Gulliver sees Yahoos and humans as if they are one and the same, Stone argues that Swift did not intend for readers to take on Gulliver’s view; Stone states that the Yahoos’ behaviors and characteristics that set them apart from humans further supports the notion that Gulliver's identification with Yahoos is not meant to be taken to heart.  Thus, Stone sees Gulliver’s perceived superiority of the Houyhnhnms and subsequent misanthropy as features that Swift used to employ the satirical and humorous elements characteristic of the Beast Fables of travel books that were popular with his contemporaries; as Swift did, these Beast Fables placed animals above humans in terms of morals and reason, but they were not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

===Character analysis===
'''Pedro de Mendez''' is the name of the Portuguese captain who rescues Gulliver in Book IV. When Gulliver is forced to leave the Island of the [[Houyhnhnms]], his plan is "to discover some small Island uninhabited" where he can live in solitude. Instead, he is picked up by Don Pedro's crew. Despite Gulliver's appearance—he is dressed in skins and speaks like a horse—Don Pedro treats him compassionately and returns him to Lisbon.

Though Don Pedro appears only briefly, he has become an important figure in the debate between so-called soft school and hard school readers of ''Gulliver's Travels''. Some critics contend that Gulliver is a target of Swift's satire and that Don Pedro represents an ideal of human kindness and generosity. Gulliver believes humans are similar to Yahoos in the sense that they make "no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply...vices" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's Travels|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|publisher=|year=1726|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|location=|pages=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Pedro provides a contrast to Gulliver's reasoning, proving humans are able to reason, be kind, and most of all: civilized. Gulliver sees the bleak fallenness at the center of human nature, and Don Pedro is merely a minor character who, in Gulliver's words, is "an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason."&lt;ref&gt;James Clifford, "Gulliver's Fourth Voyage: 'hard' and 'soft' Schools of Interpretation." ''Quick Springs of Sense: Studies in the Eighteenth Century''. Ed. Larry Champion. Athens: U of Georgia Press, 1974. 33–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influences==
[[File:Pruszkowski Gulliver and a giant.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gulliver and a giant'', a painting by [[Tadeusz Pruszkowski]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
From 1738 to 1746, [[Edward Cave]] published in occasional issues of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' semi-fictionalized accounts of contemporary debates in the two Houses of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] under the title of ''Debates in the Senate of Lilliput''. The names of the speakers in the debates, other individuals mentioned, politicians and monarchs present and past, and most other countries and cities of Europe ("Degulia") and America ("Columbia") were thinly disguised under a variety of Swiftian pseudonyms. The disguised names, and the pretence that the accounts were really translations of speeches by Lilliputian politicians, were a reaction to an Act of Parliament forbidding the publication of accounts of its debates. Cave employed several writers on this series: [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] (June 1738&amp;nbsp;– November 1740), [[Samuel Johnson]] (November 1740&amp;nbsp;– February 1743), and [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] (February 1743&amp;nbsp;– December 1746).

The astronomers of Laputa have discovered "two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars".&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels: Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts'', Palgrave Macmillan 1995 (p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt; This may have influenced [[Voltaire]], whose 1750 story ''[[Micromégas]]'' also refers to two moons of Mars. In 1877, [[Asaph Hall]] discovered the two real moons of Mars, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]; in 1973 craters on Deimos were named [[Swift (Deimian crater)|Swift]] and [[Voltaire (crater)|Voltaire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/DEIMOS/target |work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |publisher=[[Astrogeology Research Program]], USGS |title=Target: Deimos |accessdate=28 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2006 numerous features on Phobos were named after elements from ''Gulliver's Travels'', including Laputa [[Regio (astronomy)|Regio]], Lagado [[Planitia]], and several craters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/PHOBOS/target |work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |publisher=[[Astrogeology Research Program]], USGS |title=Target: Phobos |accessdate=28 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Lilliputian'' has entered many languages as an adjective meaning "small and delicate". There is even a brand of small cigar called Lilliput. There is a series of collectable model houses known as "Lilliput Lane". The smallest light bulb fitting (5mm diameter) in the [[Edison screw]] series is called the "Lilliput Edison screw". In Dutch and Czech, the words ''Lilliputter'' and ''liliput(á)n'' respectively are used for adults shorter than 1.30 meters. Conversely, ''Brobdingnagian'' appears in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a synonym for ''very large'' or ''gigantic''.

In like vein, the term ''yahoo'' is often encountered as a [[synonym]] for ''ruffian'' or ''thug''. In the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] it is considered a definition for "a rude, noisy, or violent person" and its origins attributed to Swift's ''Gulliver's Travels.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yahoo#yahoo|title=yahoo - definition of yahoo in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the discipline of [[computer architecture]], the terms [[endianness|''big-endian'' and ''little-endian'']] are used to describe two possible ways of laying out [[bytes]] in [[computer memory|memory]]. The terms derive from one of the satirical conflicts in the book, in which two religious sects of Lilliputians are divided between those who crack open their soft-boiled eggs from the little end, and those who use the big end, the "Big-endians".

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoevsky]] references ''Gulliver's Travels'' in his novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (1872): 'In an English satire of the last century, Gulliver, returning from the land of the Lilliputians where the people were only three or four inches high, had grown so accustomed to consider himself a giant among them, that as he walked along the Streets of London he could not help crying out to carriages and passers-by to be careful and get out of his way for fear he should crush them, imagining that they were little and he was still a giant....'

== Reception ==
The book was very popular upon release and was commonly discussed within social circles.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Gary, editor. “The Enthusiastic Reception of Gulliver's Travels.” Readings on Gulliver's Travels, Greenhaven Press, 2000, pp. 57–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reception widely varied, with the book receiving an initially enthusiastic reaction with readers praising its satire, and some reporting that the satire's cleverness sounded like a realistic account of a man's travels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gerace, Mary. “The Reputation of ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ in the Eighteenth Century.” ''University of Windsor'', 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]] commended Swift’s work for its “truth” regarding the narration and claims that “the statesman, the philosopher, and the critick, will admire his keenness of satire, energy of description, and vivacity of language,” noting that even children can enjoy the novel.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lund, Roger D. ''Johnathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels: A Routledge Study Guide''. Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As popularity increased, critics came to appreciate the deeper aspects of ''Gulliver’s Travels.'' It became known for its insightful take on morality, expanding its reputation beyond just humorous satire.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite its initial positive reception, the book faced backlash. One of the first critics of the book, referred to as Lord Bolingbroke, criticized Swift for his overt use of misanthropy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other negative responses to the novel also looked towards its portrayal of humanity, which was considered inaccurate. Swifts’s peers rejected the novel on claims that its themes of misanthropy were harmful and offensive. They criticized its satire for exceeding what was deemed acceptable and appropriate, including the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos’s similarities to humans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There was also controversy surrounding the political allegories. Readers enjoyed the political references, finding them humorous. However, members of the Whig party were offended, believing that Swift mocked their politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

British journalist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] described Swift’s novel as “blasphemous,” citing its critical view of mankind as ludicrous and overly harsh. He concludes his critique by remarking that he cannot understand the origins of Swift’s critiques on humanity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==In other works==

===Sequels and imitations===
* Many sequels followed the initial publishing of the ''Travels''. The earliest of these was the anonymously authored ''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTRAAAAMAAJ|title=Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput|date=1 January 1727|publisher=J. Roberts|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1727, which expands the account of Gulliver's stays in Lilliput and Blefuscu by adding several gossipy anecdotes about scandalous episodes at the Lilliputian court.
* Abbé [[Pierre Desfontaines]], the first French translator of Swift's story, wrote a sequel, ''Le Nouveau Gulliver ou Voyages de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Lemuel Gulliver'' (The New Gulliver, or the travels of John Gulliver, son of Captain Lemuel Gulliver), published in 1730.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6LRAAAAMAAJ|title=Le nouveau Gulliver: ou, Voyage de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Gulliver|first1=Desfontaines (Pierre-François Guyot, M.|last1=l'abbé)|first2=Jonathan|last2=Swift|date=1 January 1730|publisher=La veuve Clouzier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulliver's son has various fantastic, satirical adventures.
* [[Donald Grant Mitchell]] retold part one of the novel in the form of a short story for children, published in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'' magazine in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://archive.org/stream/stnicholasserial01dodg#page/296/mode/2up About Some Queer Little People],” by Donald Grant Mitchell, ''St. Nicholas'', Mar. 1874, 296–99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author [[Frigyes Karinthy]] wrote two science fiction novellas that continue the adventures of Gulliver: ''[[Voyage to Faremido]]'' (1916) is an early examination of artificial intelligence, with a pacifist theme,&lt;ref name="sftey"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bleiler | first1 = E. F. | first2 = Bleiler | last2 = Richard | title = Science-Fiction: The Early Years | publisher = Kent State University Press | date = 1990 | location = | pages = 400–401 | isbn = 9780873384162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Capillaria]]'' (1921) is a satire on the 'battle of the sexes'.&lt;ref name="sftey"/&gt;
* [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science fiction writer [[Volodymyr Ivanovych Savchenko|Vladimir Savchenko]] published ''Gulliver's Fifth Travel—The Travel of Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and Then a Captain of Several Ships to the Land of Tikitaks'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Пятое путешествие Гулливера – Путешествие Лемюэля Гулливера, сначала хирурга, а потом капитана нескольких кораблей, в страну тикитаков}}), a sequel to the original series in which Gulliver's role as a surgeon is more apparent. Tikitaks are people who inject the juice of a unique fruit to make their skin transparent, as they consider people with regular opaque skin secretive and ugly.
* {{nihongo|''[[Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon]]''|ガリバーの宇宙旅行|Garibā no Uchū Ryokō|Gulliver's Space Travels}} is a 1965 Japanese animated film, portraying an elder Gulliver taking part in a space travel, joined by a boy, a crow, a talking toy soldier and a dog. The film, although being a children's production generally fascinated by the idea of space travelling, portrays an alien world where robots have taken power. Thus it continues in Swift's vein of critical approach on themes in current society.
* [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced two adaptations of ''Gulliver's Travels'', one was an animated TV series called ''[[The Adventures of Gulliver]]'' from 1968 to 1969 and another was a 1979 animated television special titled ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1979 TV special)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.
* American physician John Paul Brady published in 1987 ''A Voyage to Inishneefa: A First-hand Account of the Fifth Voyage of Lemuel Gulliver'' (Santa Barbara: John Daniel), a parody of Irish history in Swift's manner.
* In 1998 the Argentine writer [[Edgar Brau]] published ''El último Viaje del capitán Lemuel Gulliver'' (The Last Voyage of Captain Lemuel Gulliver), a novel in which Swift's character goes on an imaginary fifth journey, this time into the River Plate. It satirises ways and customs of present-day society, including sports, television, politics, etc. To justify the parody, the narrative is set immediately after the last voyage written by Swift (precisely, 1722), and the literary style of the original work is kept throughout the whole story.

==Adaptations==
[[File:CC No 16 Gullivers Travels.jpg|thumb|upright|Comic book cover by Lilian Chesney]]

===Music===
* In 1728 the Baroque composer [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] composed a 5-movement suite for two violins based on Swift's book. Telemann's piece is commonly known as ''Gulliver's Travels,'' and depicts the Lilliputians and the Brobdingnagians particularly vividly through rhythms and tempos. The piece is part of Telemann's ''Der getreue Musik-meister'' (The Steadfast Music Teacher).
* The ambient band ''Soufferance'' based and themed their 2010 [[concept album]] on the book. Titled ''"Travels into Several Remote Nations of the Mind"'', the album featured a single, 65 minute song, bearing the title "The Thoughts and Memoirs of Mike Lachaire, First a Strange Individual, and then a Philosopher", referencing the full title of the original book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julien|first1=Alexandre|title=Soufferance Bandcamp page|url=https://soufferance.bandcamp.com/album/travels-into-several-remote-nations-of-the-mind|website=Bandcamp|publisher=Abridged Pause Publishing|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Polygondwanaland" 13th studio album by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard draws many connections among thematic interpretations thought the book and album.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">'''''The Indices of Deprivation 2010''''' (ID 2010) is a [[deprivation index]] at the small area level, created by the British [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] (DCLG) and released on 24 March 2011. It follows the [[Indices of deprivation 2007|ID2007]] and because much of the datasets are the same or similar between indices allows a comparison of "relative deprivation" of an area between the two indices.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/indices2010?view=Standard&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is known as the ID2010, most of the data actually dates from 2008.

==Key results==
*Over 5 million people lived in the most deprived areas in [[England]] in 2008 and 38 per cent of them were income deprived.
*[[Liverpool]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Manchester]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], the City of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] are the local authorities with the highest proportion of [[ONS coding system#Super Output Areas|lower layer Super Output Areas]] amongst the most deprived in England.
*Ninety-eight per cent of the most deprived lower layer Super Output Areas are in urban areas but there are also pockets of deprivation across rural areas
*Fifty-six per cent of local authorities contain at least one lower layer Super Output Areas amongst the 10 per cent most deprived in England
*Eighty-eight per cent of the lower layer Super Output Areas that are the most deprived in 2010 were also amongst the most deprived in 2007.

According to the research, the most deprived area in the country is in the village of [[Jaywick]] on the Essex coast.

'''Kocain Cave''' ({{lang-tr|Kocain Mağarası}}) is a [[List of caves in Turkey|cave]] in [[Antalya Province]], southwestern Turkey. It is a registered [[natural monument]].

The cave is situated in Killik location of [[Ahırtaş]] village at [[Döşemealtı]] district of Antalya Province. It was discovered in 1919, and was surveyed by scientists from [[Ankara University]] several times after 1946. First exploration in terms of [[speleology]] was carried out in cooperation with French speleologists in 1972. The cave is {{convert|633|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and has two large chambers on the main gallery, which has a clearance of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} at some places. The cave entrance is about {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The cave features monumental [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s. It is assumed that the cave was used for religious purposes during the [[early Christianity]] due to existence of readable [[Early Christian inscriptions|inscriptions]]. Above data is taken from the cave's information board visible at external link.

The cave was registered a [[List of natural monuments of Turkey|natural monument]] on August 16, 2013.&lt;ref name="os"/&gt; It covers an area of {{convert|60.806|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="osb"/&gt;

[[Fruit bats]], also known as megabats, are the 197 species of [[bat]]s that make up the [[suborder]] '''Megachiroptera''', found throughout the [[tropics]] of Africa, Asia, and Oceania, of which 186 are [[extant taxon|extant]]. The suborder is part of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Chiroptera]] (bats), and contains a single [[family (biology)|family]], Pteropodidae. The family is divided into between two to six [[subfamily|subfamilies]], with recent [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis suggesting a different classification structure of the known species than before. Bats have been traditionally thought to be a [[monophyletic]] group; according to this model, all living fruit bats and [[microbat]]s (Microchiroptera) are descendants of a [[common ancestor]] species that was already capable of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature | doi=10.1038/nature06549 |title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation |first1=Nancy B. |last1=Simmons |first2=Kevin L. |last2=Seymour |first3=Jörg |last3=Habersetzer |first4=Gregg F. |last4=Gunnell |volume=451 |year=2008 |pmid=18270539 |issue=7180 |bibcode=2008Natur.451..818S |pages=818–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are alternate hypotheses which conclude that bats are [[paraphyletic]]. The [[flying primate hypothesis]] was created in the 1980s stating that, based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] evidence, the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera, although genetic evidence supports the monophyly of bats. This model states that fruit bats and [[primate]]s share several anatomical features not seen in microbats, and are thus more closely related; for example, their brains show a number of advanced characteristics that link them to primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation|year=2008|journal=Nature|volume=451|issue=7180|doi=10.1038/nature06549|pmid=18270539|pages=818–821|last1=Simmons|first1=N. B.| last2=Seymour|first2=K. L.|last3=Habersetzer|first3=J.|last4=Gunnell|first4=G. F.|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62816/1/nature06549.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pettigrew|first=J. D.|last2=Maseko|first2=B. C.|last3=Manger|first3=P.R.|title=Primate-like retinotectal decussation in an echolocating megabat, Rousettus aegyptiacus |journal=Neuroscience|volume=153|issue=1|pages=226–31 |year=2008|pmid=18367343|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yinpterochiroptera]] is a proposed suborder of the Chiroptera based on molecular evidence consisting of the fruit bats and five other microbat families: [[Rhinopomatidae]], [[Rhinolophidae]], [[Hipposideridae]], [[Craseonycteridae]], and [[Megadermatidae]]. This model also challenges the view that Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera are monophyletic. The other suborder consisting of the other bat species would be the [[Yangochiroptera]].&lt;ref name=eick/&gt;&lt;ref name=parker/&gt;

[[Conservation status]]es listed for each species follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]]. Species considered valid are also based on the Red List of Threatened Species unless noted otherwise in a super-scripted note. The {{increase}} symbol indicates that the species's [[population trend]] is positive, the {{decrease}} symbol indicates that the species's population trend is negative, the {{steady}} symbol indicates that the species's population is stable, and the {{qmark|10}} symbol indicates that the species's population trend is unknown.  Population trends are based on the Red List of Threatened Species. The super-scripted "IUCN" tag is a link to that species's Red List of Threatened Species page. If a species has [[synonym (taxonomy)|taxonomic synonyms]], a list of these is provided in the "Scientific name" column, underneath the [[binomial name]] and [[author citation (zoology)|author]], based on the book ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]''. If a species has subspecies, a list of these is provided in the "Common name" column, underneath the [[common name]], also based upon ''Mammal Species of the World''.

==Classification==
There are between two and six recognized [[family (biology)|subfamilies]] of fruit bats according to various authors: [[Cynopterinae]], [[Epomophorinae]], [[Harpionycterinae]], [[Nyctimeninae]], [[Macroglossinae (Chiroptera)|Macroglossinae]], [[Rousettinae]], and [[Pteropodinae]]. However, the relationships among fruit bats are not resolved. According to [[phylogenetic]] analysis, the Macroglossinae and Pteropodinae are not [[monophyly|monophyletic]], and possibly also the Cynopterinae and the Epomophorinae.{{sfn|MSW3|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgAMbNSt8ikC&amp;pg=PA313 p. 313]}} A new [[clade]] consisting solely of African fruit bats is supported by phylogenetic analysis, which will consist of 12 genera currently placed in several different subfamilies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F.

[[File:Hopfendolde-mit-hopfengarten.jpg|thumb|[[Hallertau hops|Hallertau]] hop cone]]
This is a list of [[Plant variety (law)|varieties]] of [[Hops|hop]] (''[[Humulus lupulus]]'').

As there are male and female plants, the flowers (cones) of the female plant are fertilized by the pollen of the male flowers with the result that the female flowers form seeds. These seeds are eaten by birds and hence spread over vast distances. Hops, specifically their female plants, have been grown as a commercial crop for the brewing industry for many centuries in many countries. The first documented mention of a hop garden is in the will of [[Pepin the Short|Pepyn III]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The first breeding of different hop varieties took place at [[Wye College]] in [[Kent]], [[England]] by [[E. S. Salmon]] in 1919 when he bred the varieties "[[#Brewer's Gold|Brewer's Gold]]" and "[[#Bullion|Bullion]]". As of 2012, there are around 80 varieties in commercial use around the world, and considerably more in development/trials.

==American==

===Ahtanum brand YCR 1 cv===
Ahtanum brand YCR 1 cv is an aroma-type cultivar bred by Yakima Chief Ranches. It is used for its aromatic properties and moderate bittering. It has unique aromas that include citrus (grapefruit), earthy, and floral. The variety is named after the location where Charles Carpenter established the first hop farm in the Yakima Valley in 1869. Typical [[Alpha acid|alpha acids]] range from 5%–7%, and beta acids range from 5%–6%. Typical total oils (Mls. per 100 grams dried hops) 0.8 – 1.2.

===Amarillo brand VGXP01 cv===
{{Main|Amarillo hops}}
Popular American mid-range alpha acid variety with a unique and distinct aroma discovered growing "wild" (spontaneously)  in one of their hop yards and developed by Virgil Gamache Farms in the late 20th century.  Also known as VGXP01, and named in honor of Virgil Gamache the patriarch of the family.

===Apollo===
Characterized by its exceptionally high percentage of alpha acids (15.0 – 19.0%), excellent storage stability of alpha acids, low CoH (CoHumulone) value for an alpha variety, and resistance to hop [[powdery mildew]] strains found in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The new variety was cultivated as a result of a cross in 2000 at Golden Gate Roza Hop Ranches in [[Prosser, Washington]], and has been asexually reproduced there.

Alpha acids: 15 – 19% (ASBC Spectrophotometric method)

Beta acids: 5,5 – 8% (ASBC Spectrophotometric method)

Alpha/beta ratio: 3.0–3.5

Cohumulone (% of alpha-acids): 24–28%

Colupulone (%of beta-acids): 52%

Total oils (mls/100 g): 1.5–2.5

Humulene (% of total oils): 20–35%

=== Azacca===
Azacca has predominately citrus and tropical fruit notes, consisting of mango, papaya, orange, grapefruit, lemon, piney, spicy, pineapple, grassy, tropical fruit, citrus aromas. Named after the [[Haiti]]an [[loa|god]] of agriculture, [[Azaka-Tonnerre|Azacca]]. Alpha: 14–16%; Beta: 4.0–5.5%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adha.us/varietals/azacca-adha-483 Azacca® – ADHA 483]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bsgcraftbrewing.com/hops-american-hops-azacca|title=hops-american-hops-azacca - BSG CraftBrewing - Craft Brewing Supplies and Ingredients|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isthmus.com/food-drink/beer/blood-orange-imperial-ipa-from-tyranena/ |title=Blood Orange Imperial IPA from Tyranena |editor=Shepard, Robin |date=3 February 2016 |publisher=Isthmus |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety was noticed growing "wild" in the hop garden of George Stace Moore's house at [[Horsmonden]] in Kent, England in 1861. In 1875 it was commercialised by Richard Fuggle who lived in the village of [[Brenchley]] (not far from Horsmonden) and hence it was called Fuggle. The aroma is earthier and less sweet than Goldings. Substitutes: Willamette.

===Goldings===
{{redirect|Goldings|the singular|Golding (disambiguation)}}
The quintessential English hop, Goldings is a group of related clones that harvest at different times such as Cobbs, Amos’ Early Bird, Eastwell, Mathon, East Kent and historical clones such as  Bramling, Canterbury, Rodmersham and Petham.&lt;ref name=BHGoldings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhops.org.uk/goldings-class-aroma-tall/|title=Goldings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Whitbread Golding Variety (WGV, see below) is at best a relative of this group and Styrian Goldings is a European synonym for Fuggle. East Kent Goldings (EKG) have been sold as such since 1838&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhops.org.uk/east-kent-goldings/|title=East Kent Goldings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are the only hop to have a [[Protected Designation of Origin]] like [[Jersey Royal potatoes]]. To qualify for the designation they must be grown in a designated area of East Kent and conform to a standard chemical "fingerprint". The [[terroir]] of East Kent is particularly suited to hop growing, with brick clay over chalk and cold, salt-laden winds off the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kentgreenhopbeer.com/2015/09/09/hop-of-the-week-east-kent-goldings-aka-ekg/|title=Hop of the week: East Kent Goldings (aka EKG)|first=Ed  |last=Reply|date=9 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kent Goldings" come from elsewhere in Kent.

Goldings are used for bittering and late hopping,&lt;ref name=BHGoldings /&gt; particularly in combination with Fuggle. They are known for a smooth, sweet bitterness with spicy and earthy aromas.&lt;ref name=BHGoldings /&gt; Typically they have 4-9.5% alpha acids, 0.4-0.8% total oils and negligible farnesene.&lt;ref name=BHGoldings /&gt; The family is first reported in the 1750s as the Farnham Whitebine of Surrey which gave rise to the Canterbury Whitebine, one of which was selected by a Mr Golding in the 1790s. Goldings are tall, low yielding and susceptible to powdery mildew, downy mildew and [[Verticillium wilt|''Verticillium'' wilt]] – much of the research at Wye College has been driven by the need to improve these traits.

===Galaxy===
Australian high alpha dual purpose triploid cultivar with a marked and unique hop aroma, described as a combination of citrus and passionfruit. The initial aromas and flavors are quite intense, but these moderate as the beer matures. Bred in 1994 by Hop Products Australia by crossing a female tetraploid (J78) with a male derived from Perle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hops.com.au/products/australian_varieties/galaxy.html |title=Hop Products Australia &gt; Products &gt; Australian Varieties &gt; Galaxy |publisher=Hops.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha acids 11 - 16%. Typical total oils (ml per 100g) 3.0 - 5.0, which is the highest known.  Breeding code 94-203-008.

===Pride of Ringwood===
Used by Australian brewer Carlton and United Breweries to bitter all of its beers. The hop was created in 1953 at CUB's research facility in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood, using open pollination of Pride of Kent females. Little historical information has been released by CUB on their web site. It is unique in being the only hop developed by one brewery, and used predominantly by that brewery. CUB's flagship beer VB changed from a red ale to a lager in the mid 1950s, and PoR is likely to have been the hop used for production.  The hop has a strong aroma, and an earthy-citrus flavor, for late boil additions. Initial additions yield a clean bitterness. Green hopping is reported to produce good results. The hop does not have a long shelf life. However, the variety is highly resistant to diseases, and it has little inter-annual variation. Commercial harvests are now mostly Super Pride. Substitutes: Pacific Gem, Cluster, Northern Brewer.

===Summer ===
Low alpha Australian aroma variety. Provides distinctive light apricot and melon fruit notes. Breeding code 97-235-026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hops.com.au/products/australian_varieties/summer_saaz.html |title=Hop Products Australia &gt; Products &gt; Australian Varieties &gt; Summer |publisher=Hops.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of the largest wilderness areas in the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]] of the United States. It includes all that are larger than 50,000 acres (200&amp;nbsp;km²). Statistics are as retrieved in September 2009 from Wilderness.net.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=advSearch Wilderness.net search page]&lt;/ref&gt; Where instances of multiple states or agencies occur, they are listed in descending order of included acreage. The last column lists the entities that the wilderness is entirely (in most cases) part of, or partially included in (minority of cases, usually involving parts of the wilderness that are in otherwise unnamed BLM lands). They are also listed in descending order of included acreage. Agency abbreviations: BLM = [[Bureau of Land Management]]; FS = [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]; FWS = [[Fish and Wildlife Service]]; NPS = [[National Park Service]].

[[File:Road to mount cook new zealand.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Aoraki / Mount Cook]], located in New Zealand's [[South Island]], is the highest point in the country.]]

The following are lists of mountains in [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;These lists exclude mountains in the [[Ross Dependency]], an area of Antarctica claimed by and administered by New Zealand, though could include the similarly claimed and administered [[Balleny Islands]]. These claims are in abeyance, in accord with the Antarctic Treaty. If mountains in the Ross Dependency were included in this list, several notable peaks would appear in the upper part of this list, including [[Mount Erebus]] which, at 3795 m (12,451 ft), would outrank Aoraki / Mount Cook, and the [[Admiralty Mountains]] of [[Victoria Land]].&lt;/ref&gt; ordered by height. Names, heights, [[topographic prominence]] and [[topographic isolation|isolation]], and coordinates were extracted from the official [[Land Information New Zealand]] (LINZ) Topo50 topographic maps at the [http://www.topomap.co.nz interactive topographic map of New Zealand] site.

==Named summits over 2,900 m==
All summits over 2,900 m are within the [[Southern Alps]], a chain that forms the backbone of the [[South Island]], and all but one ([[Mount Aspiring]]) are within a 10-mile radius of [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]. Some of these summits are mere shoulders on the ridges of Aoraki and [[Mount Tasman]].

| [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]  &lt;ref&gt;The high peak of Aoraki was 3764 m high until 14 December 1991, when a massive rock/ice collapse broke off 10 meters. Subsequent erosion of the exposed ice cap reduced its height by a further 30 m as of November 2013.[http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago062651.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 100 highest mountains==
These are all the mountains over 2,400 m with a [[topographic prominence]] (drop) of at least 300&amp;nbsp;m (985&amp;nbsp;ft), closely matching those on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141006173824/http://alpineclub.org.nz/system/files/The%20Mountains%20of%20NZ%202013.pdf list of mountains of New Zealand] by the [[New Zealand Alpine Club]]. Five peaks overlooked on that list are indicated with an asterisk. Of these 100 mountains, all but two — [[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu (Tahurangi Peak)]] (19th highest) and [[Mount Taranaki|Mount Taranaki / Egmont]] (65th highest) — are in the [[South Island]]. [[Tapuae-o-Uenuku]], in the [[Kaikoura Ranges]], is the highest peak outside the [[Southern Alps]].

Her name is found in inscriptions found at [[Aignay-le-Duc]] and [[Mâlain]] of the [[Côte-d'Or]], France, where she is invoked along with the [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]] god Mars [[Cicolluis]] in a context which suggests that she might have been his consort.&lt;ref name="Celtnet"&gt;Evans, Dyfed Lloyd. "Litavis: A Gaulish Goddess (She Who Feeds)." ''Celtnet: Nemeton''. 26 May 2007 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_c/cicolluis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003149/http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_c/cicolluis.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a [[Latin]] dedicatory inscription from [[Narbonne]] (which was in the far south of Gaul), France, bears the words “MARTI CICOLLUI ET LITAVI” ("To Mars Cicolluis and Litavis").&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LISTSERV"/&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Letavia'' or ''Letauia'' may be derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *peltHa- "to spread out flat", via a zero-grade, suffixed formation, *PltHa-wiH, meaning "The Broad One".&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John, "Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia", ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 1159&lt;/ref&gt; The name may thus be comparable to the [[Vedic]] earth goddess “[[Prithvi|Prthvi]]” and the [[Greek language|Greek]] place name ''Plataia'', suggesting that Letavis is an earth goddess or divinisation of the landscape.

== Brittany ==
[[Brittany]] is standardly referred to as ''[[Llydaw]]'' in [[Modern Welsh]], echoing the use of the name ''Letavia'' for Brittany (or part of it) In Latin texts. The Chronicle of [[Robert of Torigni|Robert de Torigni]] states of the peninsular, ''quae antiquitus letauia sive armorica uocata est'' (“which was anciently called Letavia or [[Armorica]]”).&lt;ref name="Brittany/Llydaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Celtnet"/&gt; Likewise, the ''Life of [[Saint Goulven]]'' refers to ''partes letaniae quae pars est armoricae siue britanniae minoris'' ("the regions of Letania, which is a part of Armorica or Little Britain"). This latter passage displays the common confusion of the letter ''[[n]]'' with ''[[u]]'' or ''[[v]]'' in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Brittany/Llydaw"/&gt; "Letavia" may be derived from "Litavis", so the place-name would mean "Land of Litavis".

A '''mantle plume''' is a proposed mechanism of [[convection]] of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].  Because the plume head partly melts on reaching shallow depths, a plume is often invoked as the cause of volcanic [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s, such as [[Hawaii hotspot|Hawaii]] or [[Iceland hotspot|Iceland]], and [[Large igneous province|large igneous provinces]] such as the [[Deccan Traps|Deccan]] and [[Siberian traps]].  Some such volcanic regions lie far from [[plate boundary|tectonic plate boundaries]], while others represent unusually large-volume [[volcanism]] near plate boundaries or in [[large igneous province]]s.

The [[hypothesis]] of mantle plumes from depth is not universally accepted as explaining all such volcanism. It has required progressive hypothesis-elaboration leading to variant propositions such as mini-plumes and pulsing plumes. Another hypothesis for unusual volcanic regions is the "Plate model". This proposes shallower, passive leakage of [[magma]] from the mantle onto the Earth's surface where extension of the lithosphere permits it, attributing most volcanism to plate tectonic processes, with volcanoes far from plate boundaries resulting from intraplate extension.&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G. R. |authorlink=Gillian Foulger |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==
The theory was first proposed by [[J. Tuzo Wilson]] in 1963&lt;ref name="Wilson1963"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J. Tuzo|title=Hypothesis of earth's behaviour|journal=Nature|date=8 June 1963|volume=198|issue=4884|pages=925–929|doi=10.1038/198925a0|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v198/n4884/pdf/198925a0.pdf|url-access=subscription|accessdate=8 June 2017|bibcode=1963Natur.198..925T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed by [[W. Jason Morgan]] in 1971.  A mantle plume is posited to exist where hot rock nucleates at the [[core-mantle boundary]] and rises through the Earth's mantle becoming a [[diapir]] in the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref name="Larson-1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larson, R.L.|date=1991|title=Latest pulse of Earth: Evidence for a mid-Cretaceous superplume|journal=Geology|volume=19|issue=6|pages=547&amp;ndash;550|bibcode= 1991Geo....19..547L |doi= 10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019&lt;0547:LPOEEF&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another, and anchored at the core-mantle boundary, would provide a natural explanation for the time-progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hot spots, such as the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]].

Two largely independent convective processes are proposed:
* the broad convective flow associated with plate tectonics, driven primarily by the sinking of cold plates of [[lithosphere]] back into the mantle [[asthenosphere]]
* the mantle plume, driven by heat exchange across the core-mantle boundary carrying heat upward in a narrow, rising column, and postulated to be independent of plate motions.

The plume hypothesis was studied using laboratory experiments conducted in small fluid-filled tanks in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehead, Jr.|first1=John A.|last2=Luther|first2=Douglas S.|date=1975|title=Dynamics of laboratory diapir and plume models|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=80|issue=5|pages=705&amp;ndash;717|bibcode=1975JGR....80..705W|doi=10.1029/JB080i005p00705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal or compositional fluid-dynamical plumes produced in that way were presented as models for the much larger postulated mantle plumes. On the basis of these experiments, mantle plumes are now postulated to comprise two parts: a long thin conduit connecting the top of the plume to its base, and a bulbous head that expands in size as the plume rises. The entire structure is considered to resemble a mushroom. The bulbous head of thermal plumes forms because hot material moves upward through the conduit faster than the plume itself rises through its surroundings. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, experiments with thermal models showed that as the bulbous head expands it may entrain some of the adjacent mantle into the head.

The sizes and occurrence of mushroom mantle plumes can be predicted easily by transient instability theory developed by Tan and Thorpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tan |first= K. K. |last2=Thorpe |first2=R. B. |title= The onset of convection driven by buoyancy caused by various modes of transient heat conduction, Part I: Transient Rayleigh numbers |doi=10.1016/S0009-2509(98)00248-6 |journal= [[J. Chem.

Chem. Eng. Sci|volume=54|issue=2|pages=239&amp;ndash;244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory predicts mushroom shaped mantle plumes with heads of about 2000&amp;nbsp;km diameter that have a critical time{{clarify|date=July 2015}} of about 830 Myr for a core mantle [[heat flux]] of 20&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the cycle time{{clarify|date=July 2015}} is about 2 Gyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tan |first= K.

When a plume head encounters the base of the lithosphere, it is expected to flatten out against this barrier and to undergo widespread decompression melting to form large volumes of basalt magma. It may then erupt onto the surface. Numerical modelling predicts that melting and eruption will take place over several million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Farnetani |first= C. G. |last2=Richards |first2=M. A. |title= Numerical investigations of the mantle plume initiation model for flood basalt events |journal= [[J. Geophys. Res.]] |volume= 99 |pages= 13,813&amp;ndash;13,833 |date= 1994 |doi=10.1029/94jb00649 |bibcode=1994JGR....9913813F}}&lt;/ref&gt; These eruptions have been linked to [[flood basalt]]s, although many of those erupt over much shorter time scales (less than 1 million years). Examples include the [[Deccan traps]] in India, the [[Siberian traps]] of Asia, the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] basalts/dolerites in South Africa and Antarctica, the [[Paraná and Etendeka traps]] in South America and Africa (formerly a single province separated by opening of the South Atlantic Ocean), and the [[Columbia River basalts]] of North America. Flood basalts in the oceans are known as oceanic plateaus, and include the [[Ontong Java plateau]] of the western Pacific Ocean and the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] of the Indian Ocean.

The narrow vertical pipe, or conduit, postulated to connect the plume head to the core-mantle boundary, is viewed as providing a continuous supply of magma to a fixed location, often referred to as a "hotspot". As the overlying tectonic plate (lithosphere) moves over this hotspot, the eruption of magma from the fixed conduit onto the surface is expected to form a chain of volcanoes that parallels plate motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Skilbeck |first1=J. N. |last2=Whitehead |first2=J. A. |title=Formation of discrete islands in linear chains |doi=10.1038/272499a0 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=272 |issue=5653 |pages=499&amp;ndash;501 |date=1978|bibcode= 1978Natur.272..499S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hawaiian Islands]] chain in the Pacific Ocean is the type example. It has recently been discovered that the volcanic locus of this chain has not been fixed over time, and it thus joined the club of the many type examples that do not exhibit the key characteristic originally proposed.&lt;ref name="What the hell is Hawaii"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/HawaiiBend.html |title=Insight into Motion of the Hawaiian Hotspot from Paleomagnetism|last1=Sager|first1=William W.|author1-link=William Sager|work=www.MantlePlume.org |accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eruption of continental flood basalts is often associated with continental rifting and breakup. This has led to the hypothesis that mantle plumes contribute to continental rifting and the formation of ocean basins. In the context of the alternative "Plate model", continental breakup is a process integral to plate tectonics, and massive volcanism occurs as a natural consequence when it onsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates, plumes, and paradigms; ''Volume 388 of Special papers'' |first1=Gillian R. |last1=Foulger |authorlink=Gillian Foulger |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z74GC0rA5kC&amp;pg=PA195 |isbn=0-8137-2388-4 |publisher=[[Geological Society of America]] |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current mantle plume theory is that material and energy from Earth's interior are exchanged with the surface crust in two distinct modes: the predominant, steady state plate tectonic regime driven by upper mantle convection, and a punctuated, intermittently dominant, mantle overturn regime driven by plume convection.&lt;ref name="Larson-1991"/&gt; This second regime, while often discontinuous, is periodically significant in mountain building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stein, M. |author2=Hofmann, A.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1994|title=Mantle plumes and episodic continental growth|journal=Nature|volume=372|issue=6501|pages=63&amp;ndash;68|bibcode= 1994Natur.372...63S |doi= 10.1038/372063a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continental breakup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Storey, B.C.|date=1995|title=The role of mantle plumes in continental breakup: Case histories from Gondwana|journal=Nature|volume=377|issue=6547|pages=301&amp;ndash;308|bibcode= 1995Natur.377..301S |doi= 10.1038/377301a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean-ridge basalts. This geochemical signature arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted [[slab (geology)|slabs]] and continental sediments, in the mantle source. There are two competing interpretations for this. In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducting slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes. In the context of the Plate hypothesis, subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes.

The processing of oceanic crust, lithosphere, and sediment through a subduction zone decouples the water-soluble trace elements (e.g., K, Rb, Th) from the immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta), concentrating the immobile elements in the oceanic slab (the water-soluble elements are added to the crust in island arc volcanoes). [[Seismic tomography]] shows that [[subducted]] oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the [[transition zone (Earth)|mantle transition zone]] at 650&amp;nbsp;km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500&amp;nbsp;km depth.

The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000&amp;nbsp;km depth.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1972 203–213"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Morgan |first1= W. J. |title= Deep mantle convection plumes and plate motions |journal= Bull. Am. Assoc. Pet. Geol. |volume= 56 |pages= 203&amp;ndash;213 |date= 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is little material transport across the core-mantle boundary, heat transfer must occur by conduction, with adiabatic gradients above and below this boundary. The core-mantle boundary is a strong thermal (temperature) discontinuity. The temperature of the core is approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius higher than that of the overlying mantle. Plumes are postulated to rise as the base of the mantle becomes hotter and more buoyant.

Plumes are postulated to rise through the mantle and begin to partially melt on reaching shallow depths in the asthenosphere by [[igneous rock#Decompression|decompression melting]]. This would create large volumes of magma. The plume hypothesis postulates that this melt rises to the surface and erupts to form "hot spots".

==The lower mantle and the core==
[[File:Earth temperature.PNG|thumb|250px|Calculated Earth's temperature vs. depth. Dashed curve: Layered [[mantle convection]]; Solid curve: Whole mantle convection.&lt;ref name=Condie&gt;{{cite book |title=Plate tectonics and crustal evolution |first1=Kent C. |last1=Condie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrA6OQzsvgC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |isbn=0-7506-3386-7 |date=1997 |edition=4th |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent thermal contrast known to exist in the deep (1000&amp;nbsp;km) mantle is at the core-mantle boundary. Mantle plumes were originally postulated to rise from this layer because the "hot spots" that are assumed to be their surface expression were thought to be fixed relative to one another. This required that plumes were sourced from beneath the shallow asthenosphere that is thought to be flowing rapidly in response to motion of the overlying tectonic plates. There is no other known major thermal boundary layer in the deep Earth, and so the core-mantle boundary was the only candidate.

The base of the mantle is known as the [[core–mantle boundary|D″ layer]], a seismological subdivision of the Earth. It appears to be compositionally distinct from the overlying mantle, and may contain partial melt.

Two very large, broad, [[large low-shear-velocity provinces]], exist in the lower mantle under Africa and under the central Pacific. It is postulated that small plumes rise from their surface or their edges. Their low seismic velocities were thought to suggest that they are relatively hot, although it has recently been shown that their low wave velocities are due to high density caused by chemical heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brodholt |first1= John P. |last2= Helffrich |first2= George |last3= Trampert |first3= Jeannot |year= 2007 |title= Chemical versus thermal heterogeneity in the lower mantle: The most likely role of anelasticity |doi= 10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.054 |journal= Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume= 262 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 429–437 |bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.262..429B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Trampert |first1= J. |last4=Yuen |first4=D. |title= Probabilistic tomography maps chemical heterogeneities throughout the lower mantle |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 306 |pages= 853&amp;ndash;856 |date= 2004 |doi= 10.1126/science.1101996 |pmid= 15514153 |last3= Resovsky |first3= J. |last2= Deschamps |first2= F. |issue= 5697|bibcode= 2004Sci...306..853T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence for the theory==
Various lines of evidence have been cited in support of mantle plumes. There is some confusion regarding what constitutes support, as there has been a tendency to re-define the postulated characteristics of mantle plumes after observations have been made.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;

Some common and basic lines of evidence cited in support of the theory are linear volcanic chains, [[noble gas]]es, [[geophysics|geophysical]] anomalies, and [[geochemistry]].

===Linear volcanic chains===
The age-progressive distribution of the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]] has been explained as a result of a fixed, deep-mantle plume rising into the upper mantle, partly melting, and causing a volcanic chain to form as the plate moves overhead relative to the fixed plume source.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1972 203–213"/&gt; Other "hot spots" with time-progressive volcanic chains behind them include [[Réunion hotspot|Réunion]], the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]], the [[Louisville Ridge]], the [[Ninety East Ridge]] and [[Kerguelen hotspot|Kerguelen]], [[Tristan hotspot|Tristan]], and [[Yellowstone hotspot|Yellowstone]].

An intrinsic aspect of the plume hypothesis is that the "hot spots" and their volcanic trails have been fixed relative to one another throughout geological time. Whereas there is evidence that the chains listed above are time-progressive, it has, however, been shown that they are not fixed relative to one another. The most remarkable example of this is the Emperor chain, the older part of the Hawaii system, which was formed by migration of volcanic activity across a geo-stationary plate.&lt;ref name="What the hell is Hawaii"/&gt;

Many postulated "hot spots" are also lacking time-progressive volcanic trails, e.g., Iceland, the Galapagos, and the Azores. Mismatches between the predictions of the hypothesis and observations are commonly explained by auxiliary processes such as "mantle wind", "ridge capture", "ridge escape" and lateral flow of plume material.

===Noble gas and other isotopes===
{{Main|Helium-3}}
Helium-3 is a primordial isotope that formed in the [[Big Bang]]. Very little is produced, and little has been added to the Earth by other processes since then.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Anderson |first1= D. L. |author-link=Don L. Anderson |title= A model to explain the various paradoxes associated with mantle noble gas geochemistry |journal= [[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.]] |volume= 95 |pages= 9087&amp;ndash;9092 |date= 1998 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.16.9087 |pmid= 9689038 |issue= 16 |pmc= 21296|bibcode= 1998PNAS...95.9087A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helium-4]] includes a primordial component, but it is also produced by the natural radioactive decay of U and Th. Over time, He in the upper atmosphere is lost into space. Thus, the Earth has become progressively depleted in He, and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He is not replaced as &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is. As a result, the ratio &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He/&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He in the Earth has decreased over time.

Unusually high &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He/&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He have been observed in some, but not all, "hot spots". In mantle plume theory, this is explained by plumes tapping a deep, primordial reservoir in the lower mantle, where the original, high &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He/&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ratios have been preserved throughout geologic time.&lt;ref name="Kurz1999"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V66-3Y80F1B-M/2/2997cf989b5a397a51547d08cb1761f0|title=Dynamics of the Galapagos hotspot from helium isotope geochemistry |first1=Mark|last1=Kurz|date=1999|journal=[[Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta]]|accessdate=2011-04-06|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00314-2|bibcode=1999GeCoA..63.4139K|volume=63|pages=4139–4156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the Plate hypothesis, the high ratios are explained by preservation of old material in the shallow mantle. Ancient, high &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He/&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ratios would be particularly easily preserved in materials lacking U or Th, so &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He was not added over time. Olivine and dunite, both found in subducted crust, are materials of this sort.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;

Other elements, e.g. [[osmium]], have been suggested to be tracers of material arising from near to the Earth's core, in basalts at oceanic islands. However, so far conclusive proof for this is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Os-W.html |first1=Anders|last= Scherstén|title=Re-Os, Pt-Os and Hf-W isotopes and tracing the core in mantle melts |work=www.MantlePlume.org|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophysical anomalies===
[[File:Hotspot(geology)-1.svg|thumb|Diagram showing a cross section though the Earth's [[lithosphere]] (in yellow) with [[magma]] rising from the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] (in red). The crust may move relative to the plume, creating a ''track''.]]

The plume hypothesis has been tested by looking for the geophysical anomalies predicted to be associated with them. These include thermal, seismic, and elevation anomalies. Thermal anomalies are inherent in the term "hotspot". They can be measured in numerous different ways, including surface heat flow, petrology, and seismology. Thermal anomalies produce anomalies in the speeds of seismic waves, but unfortunately so do composition and partial melt. As a result, wave speeds cannot be used simply and directly to measure temperature, but more sophisticated approaches must be taken.

Seismic anomalies are identified by mapping variations in wave speed as seismic waves travel through Earth. A hot mantle plume is predicted to have lower seismic wave speeds compared with similar material at a lower temperature. Mantle material containing a trace of partial melt (e.g., as a result of it having a lower melting point), or being richer in Fe, also has a lower seismic wave speed and those effects are stronger than temperature. Thus, although unusually low wave speeds have been taken to indicate anomalously hot mantle beneath "hot spots", this interpretation is ambiguous.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt; The most commonly cited seismic wave-speed images that are used to look for variations in regions where plumes have been proposed come from seismic tomography. This method involves using a network of seismometers to construct three-dimensional images of the variation in seismic wave speed throughout the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ritsema |first1= J. |last2= van Heijst |first2= H. J. |last3= Woodhouse |first3= J. H. |title= Complex shear wave velocity structure imaged beneath Africa and Iceland |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 286 |pages= 1925&amp;ndash;1928 |date= 1999 |pmid= 10583949 |doi= 10.1126/science.286.5446.1925 |url= http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/Reprints/ritsema_etal_science1999.pdf |format= PDF |issue= 5446 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522022417/http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/Reprints/ritsema_etal_science1999.pdf |archivedate= 2011-05-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seismic waves]] generated by large earthquakes enable structure below the Earth's surface to be determined along the ray path. Seismic waves that have traveled a thousand or more kilometers (also called [[teleseism|teleseismic waves]]) can be used to image large regions of Earth's mantle. They also have limited resolution, however, and only structures at least several hundred kilometers in diameter can be detected.

Seismic tomography images have been cited as evidence for a number of mantle plumes in Earth's mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Montelli |first= R. |last2=Nolet |first2=G. |last3=Dahlen |first3=F. |last4= Masters |first4= G. |title= A catalogue of deep mantle plumes: new results from finite-frequency tomography |journal= [[Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems]] |volume= 7 |issue= 11 |pages= n/a |doi=10.1029/2006GC001248 |date= 2006|bibcode= 2006GGG.....711007M}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, vigorous on-going discussion regarding whether the structures imaged are reliably resolved, and whether they correspond to columns of hot, rising rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/BananaDoughnuts.html |title=Banana-doughnut tomography – can it reveal plumes (better than conventional ray theory)? |work=www.MantlePlumes.org |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mantle plume hypothesis predicts that domal topographic uplifts will develop when plume heads impinge on the base of the lithosphere. An uplift of this kind occurred when the north Atlantic Ocean opened about 54 million years ago. Some scientists have linked this to a mantle plume postulated to have caused the breakup of Eurasia and the opening of the north Atlantic, now suggested to underlie [[Iceland]]. Current research has shown that the time-history of the uplift is probably much shorter than predicted, however. It is thus not clear how strongly this observation supports the mantle plume hypothesis.

===Geochemistry===
Basalts found at oceanic islands are geochemically distinct from those found at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and volcanoes associated with [[subduction zones]] (island arc basalts). "[[Ocean island basalt]]" is also similar to basalts found throughout the oceans on both small and large seamounts (thought to be formed by eruptions on the sea floor that did not rise above the surface of the ocean). They are also compositionally similar to some basalts found in the interiors of the continents (e.g., the Snake River Plain).

In major elements, ocean island basalts are typically higher in [[iron]] (Fe) and [[titanium]] (Ti) than mid-ocean ridge basalts at similar [[magnesium]] (Mg) contents. In [[trace elements]], they are typically more enriched in the light [[rare-earth element]]s than mid-ocean ridge basalts. Compared to island arc basalts, ocean island basalts are lower in [[alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and higher in immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, [[niobium|Nb]], [[Tantalum|Ta]]).

These differences result from processes that occur during the subduction of [[oceanic crust]] and mantle [[lithosphere]]. Oceanic crust (and to a lesser extent, the underlying mantle) typically becomes hydrated to varying degrees on the seafloor, partly as the result of seafloor weathering, and partly in response to hydrothermal circulation near the mid-ocean-ridge crest where it was originally formed. As oceanic crust and underlying lithosphere subduct, water is released by dehydration reactions, along with water-soluble elements and trace elements. This enriched fluid rises to [[metasomatism|metasomatize]] the overlying mantle wedge and leads to the formation of island arc basalts. The subducting slab is depleted in these water-mobile elements (e.g., [[potassium|K]], [[rubidium|Rb]], [[thorium|Th]], [[lead|Pb]]) and thus relatively enriched in elements that are not water-mobile (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta) compared to both mid-ocean ridge and island arc basalts.

Ocean island basalts are also relatively enriched in immobile elements relative to the water-mobile elements. This, and other observations, have been interpreted as indicating that the distinct geochemical signature of ocean island basalts results from inclusion of a component of subducted slab material. This must have been recycled in the mantle, then re-melted and incorporated in the lavas erupted. In the context of the plume hypothesis, subducted slabs are postulated to have been subducted down as far as the core-mantle boundary, and transported back up to the surface in rising plumes. In the plate hypothesis, the slabs are postulated to have been recycled at shallower depths – in the upper few hundred kilometers that make up the [[upper mantle]]. However, the plate hypothesis is inconsistent with both the geochemistry of shallow asthenosphere melts (i.e., Mid-ocean ridge basalts) and with the isotopic compositions of ocean island basalts.

===Seismology===
In 2015, based on data from 273 large earthquakes, researchers compiled a model based on [[full waveform tomography]], requiring the equivalent of 3 million hours of supercomputer time.&lt;ref name=Hand/&gt; Due to computational limitations, high-frequency data still could not be used, and seismic data remained unavailable from much of the seafloor.&lt;ref name=Hand/&gt; Nonetheless, vertical plumes, 400 C hotter than the surrounding rock, were visualized under many hotspots, including the [[Pitcairn hotspot|Pitcairn]], [[Macdonald hotspot|Macdonald]], [[Samoa hotspot|Samoa]], [[Tahiti hotspot|Tahiti]], [[Marquesas hotspot|Marquesas]], [[Galápagos hotspot|Galapagos]], [[Cape Verde hotspot|Cape Verde]], and [[Canary hotspot|Canary]] hotspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7567/full/nature14876.html|title=Broad plumes rooted at the base of the Earth's mantle beneath major hotspots|author1=Scott W.

The unexpected size of the plumes leaves open the possibility that they may conduct the bulk of the Earth's 44 terawatts of internal heat flow from the core to the surface, and means that the lower mantle convects less than expected, if at all. It is possible that there is a compositional difference between plumes and the surrounding mantle that slows them down and broadens them.&lt;ref name=Hand&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mantle plumes seen rising from Earth's core|author=Eric Hand|date=2015-09-04|journal=Science|volume=349|issue=6252|pages=1032–1033|doi=10.1126/science.349.6252.1032|pmid=26339001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suggested mantle plume locations==

[[File:CourtHotspots.png|thumb|right|An example of plume locations suggested by one recent group.&lt;ref name="Courtillot 2003 295–308"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Courtillot |first1= V. |last2=Davaillie |first2=A. |last3=Besse |first3=J. |last4= Stock |first4= J. |title= Three distinct types of hotspots in the Earth's mantle |journal= Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume= 205 |pages= 295&amp;ndash;308 |date= 2003 |doi= 10.1016/S0012-821X(02)01048-8 |issue= 3&amp;ndash;4 |bibcode=2003E&amp;PSL.205..295C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure from Foulger (2010).&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;]]

Many different localities have been suggested to be underlain by mantle plumes, and scientists cannot agree on a definitive list. Some scientists suggest that several tens of plumes exist,&lt;ref name="Courtillot 2003 295–308"/&gt; whereas others suggest that there are none.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt; The theory was really inspired by the Hawaiian volcano system. Hawaii is a large volcanic edifice in the center of the Pacific Ocean, far from any plate boundaries. Its regular, time-progressive chain of islands and seamounts superficially fits the plume theory well. However, it is almost unique on Earth, as nothing as extreme exists anywhere else. The second strongest candidate for a plume location is often quoted to be Iceland, but according to opponents of the plume hypothesis its massive nature can be explained by plate tectonic forces along the mid-Atlantic spreading center.

Mantle plumes have been suggested as the source for [[flood basalt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Richards |first1= M.A. |last2= Duncan |first2= R.A. |last3= Courtillot |first3= V.E. |date=1989|title=Flood basalts, and hotspot tracks: Plume heads and tails|journal=Science|volume=246|pages=103&amp;ndash;107|bibcode= 1989Sci...246..103R |doi= 10.1126/science.246.4926.103|pmid=17837768|issue=4926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Griffiths |first1= R.W. |last2= Campbell |first2= I.H. |date=1990|title=Stirring and structure in mantle plumes|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=99|pages=66&amp;ndash;78|bibcode= 1990E&amp;PSL..99...66G |doi= 10.1016/0012-821X(90)90071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These extremely rapid, large scale eruptions of basaltic magmas have periodically formed continental flood basalt provinces on land and oceanic plateaus in the ocean basins, such as the [[Deccan Traps]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Duncan, R.A. |author2=Pyle, D.G. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1988|title=Rapid eruption of the Deccan flood basalts at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary|journal=Nature|volume=333|issue=6176|pages=841&amp;ndash;843|doi=10.1038/333841a0|bibcode= 1988Natur.333..841D}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Siberian Traps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Renne |first1= P.R. |last2= Basu |first2= A.R. |date=1991|title=Rapid eruption of the Siberian Traps flood basalts at the Permo-Triassic boundary|journal=Science|volume=253|issue= 5016 |pages=176&amp;ndash;179|bibcode= 1991Sci...253..176R |doi= 10.1126/science.253.5016.176 |pmid=17779134}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] flood basalts of [[Gondwana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Encarnacion |first1= J. |last2= Fleming |first2= T.H. |last3= Elliot |first3= D.H. |last4= Eales |first4= H.V. |date=1996|title=Synchronous emplacement of Ferrar and Karoo dolerites and the early breakup of Gondwana|journal=Geology|volume=24|issue= 6 |pages=535&amp;ndash;538|bibcode= 1996Geo....24..535E |doi= 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0535:SEOFAK&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest known continental flood basalt, the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province]] (CAMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=van Hinsbergen, D.

This is consistent with a system that tends toward equilibrium, as matter rises in a mantle plume, other material is drawn down into the mantle causing rifting.&lt;ref name=Renne-1995/&gt;

==Alternative hypotheses==
In parallel with the mantle plume model, two alternative explanations for the observed phenomena have been considered: the plate hypothesis and the impact hypothesis.

===The plate hypothesis===
The plate hypothesis suggests that "anomalous" volcanism results from lithospheric extension that permits melt to rise passively from the asthenosphere beneath. It is thus the conceptual inverse of the plume hypothesis, attributing volcanism to shallow, near-surface processes associated with plate tectonics, rather than active processes arising at the core-mantle boundary. The plate hypothesis argues that deep mantle plumes causing surface, time-progressive volcanism {{clarify |date=December 2015 |text=do not exist |post-text=(Is paper really a claim to exclusive universality?)}} {{Failed verification|date=June 2017}}.&lt;ref name=James2011/&gt;

Lithospheric extension is attributed to processes related to plate tectonics. These processes are well understood at mid-ocean ridges, where most of Earth's volcanism occurs. It is less commonly recognised that the plates themselves deform internally, and can permit volcanism in those regions where the deformation is extensional. Well-known examples are the Basin and Range Province in the western USA, the [[East African Rift]] valley, and the [[Rhine Graben]]. Under this hypothesis, variable volumes of magma are attributed to variations in chemical composition (large volumes of volcanism corresponding to more easily molten mantle material) rather than to temperature differences.

The plate hypothesis thus attributes all{{dubious |date=December 2015 |reason=Does it really claim exclusivity for all volcanism?}} of Earth's volcanism to a single process – plate tectonics – rather than to two independent processes (plumes and plate tectonics), but does not address issues of core&amp;ndash;mantle heat and/or material transfer.{{dubious |date=December 2015 |reason=Does it really not address heat and mantle transfer at other, non-plate, areas of volcanism?}}

Under the umbrella of the plate hypothesis, the following sub-processes, all of which can contribute to permitting surface volcanism, are recognised:&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;
*Continental break-up;
*Fertility at mid-ocean ridges;
*Enhanced volcanism at plate boundary junctions;
*Small-scale sublithospheric convection;
*Oceanic intraplate extension;
*Slab tearing and break-off;
*Shallow mantle convection;
*Abrupt lateral changes in stress at structural discontinuities;
*Continental intraplate extension;
*Catastrophic lithospheric thinning;
*Sublithospheric melt ponding and draining.

===The impact hypothesis===

In addition to these processes, [[impact event]]s such as ones that created the [[Addams (crater)|Addams crater]] on Venus and the [[Sudbury Igneous Complex]] in Canada are known to have caused melting and volcanism. In the impact hypothesis, it is proposed that some regions of hotspot volcanism can be triggered by certain large-body oceanic impacts which are able to penetrate the thinner [[oceanic lithosphere]], and [[flood basalt]] volcanism can be triggered by converging seismic energy focused at the [[antipodes|antipodal point]] opposite major impact sites.&lt;ref name="Hagstrum 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hagstrum |first1= Jonathan T. |title= Antipodal Hotspots and Bipolar Catastrophes: Were Oceanic Large-body Impacts the Cause? |journal= [[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] |volume= 236 |pages= 13&amp;ndash;27 |date= 2005 |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Antip_hot.pdf |doi= 10.1016/j.epsl.2005.02.020 |bibcode=2005E&amp;PSL.236...13H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impact-induced volcanism has not been adequately studied and comprises a separate causal category of terrestrial volcanism with implications for the study of hotspots and plate tectonics.

===Comparison of the hypotheses===
In 1997 it became possible using seismic tomography to image submerging tectonic slabs penetrating from the surface all the way to the core-mantle boundary.&lt;ref name="Kerr1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/275/5300/613.full |title=Deep-Sinking Slabs Stir the Mantle |publisher=AAAS |work=Science |date=31 January 1997 |accessdate=2013-06-13 |author=Kerr, Richard A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Hawaii hotspot]], long-period seismic body wave diffraction tomography provided evidence that a mantle plume is responsible, as had been proposed as early as 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Detection of mantle plumes in the lower mantle by diffraction tomography: Hawaii |author1=Ji, Ying |author2=ataf, Henri-Claude N |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=June 1998 |volume=159 |issue=3–4 |pages=99–115|bibcode= 1998E&amp;PSL.159...99J |doi= 10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yellowstone hotspot]], seismological evidence began to converge from 2011 in support of the plume model, as concluded by James et al., "we favor a lower mantle plume as the origin for the Yellowstone hotspot."&lt;ref name=James2011&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X11005188 |title=Slab fragmentation, edge flow and the origin of the Yellowstone hotspot track |author1=James, David E. |author2=Fouch, Matthew J. |author3=Carlson, Richard W. |author4=Roth, Jeffrey B. |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=May 2011 |volume=311 |issue=1–2 |pages=124–135 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2011.09.007|bibcode= 2011E&amp;PSL.311..124J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmandt2012"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0012821X12001483/1-s2.0-S0012821X12001483-main.pdf?_tid=de09085c-d464-11e2-9655-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1371154228_3cd7bbb3c14e45463c936c73b5a25f88 |title=Hot mantle upwelling across the 660 beneath Yellowstone |author1=Schmandt, Brandon |author2=Dueker, Kenneth |author3=Humphreys, Eugene |author4=Hansen, Steven |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=April 2012 |volume=331–332 |pages=224–236 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.03.025|bibcode= 2012E&amp;PSL.331..224S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data acquired through [[Earthscope]], a program collecting high-resolution seismic data throughout the [[contiguous United States]] has accelerated acceptance of a plume underlying Yellowstone.&lt;ref name="Kerr2013"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6138/1283.full |title=Geophysical Exploration Linking Deep Earth and Backyard Geology |author=Kerr, Richard A. |journal=Science |date=June 2013 |volume=340 |issue=6138 |pages=1283–1285 |doi=10.1126/science.340.6138.1283 |pmid=23766309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerr2013A"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6128/22.full |title=The Deep Earth Machine Is Coming Together |author=Kerr, Richard A. |journal=Science |date=April 2013 |volume=340 |issue=6128 |pages=22–24 |doi=10.1126/science.340.6128.22 |pmid=23559231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is strong evidence that at least two deep mantle plumes rise to the core-mantle boundary, confirmation that other hypotheses can be dismissed may require similar tomographic evidence for other hot spots.

'''Mathematical geophysics''' is concerned with developing mathematical methods for use in [[geophysics]]. As such, it has application in many fields in geophysics, particularly [[geodynamics]] and [[seismology]].

== Areas of mathematical geophysics ==

=== Geophysical fluid dynamics ===
[[Geophysical fluid dynamics]] develops the theory of [[fluid dynamics]] for the atmosphere, ocean and Earth's interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pedlosky|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications include geodynamics and the theory of the [[geodynamo]].

=== Geophysical inverse theory ===
Geophysical [[inverse theory]] is concerned with analyzing geophysical data to get model parameters.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarantola&gt;{{Harvnb|Tarantola|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with the question: What can be known about the Earth's interior from measurements on the surface? Generally there are limits on what can be known even in the ideal limit of exact data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1994|loc=chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of inverse theory is to determine the spatial distribution of some variable (for example, density or seismic wave velocity). The distribution determines the values of an observable at the surface (for example, gravitational acceleration for density). There must be a ''forward model'' predicting the surface observations given the distribution of this variable.

Applications include [[geomagnetism]], [[magnetotellurics]] and seismology.

=== Fractals and complexity ===
Many geophysical data sets have spectra that follow a [[power law]], meaning that the frequency of an observed magnitude varies as some power of the magnitude. An example is the distribution of [[earthquake]] magnitudes; small earthquakes are far more common than large earthquakes. This is often an indicator that the data sets have an underlying [[fractal]] geometry. Fractal sets have a number of common features, including structure at many scales, irregularity, and [[self-similarity]] (they can be split into parts that look much like the whole). The manner in which these sets can be divided determine the [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the set, which is generally different from the more familiar [[topological dimension]]. Fractal phenomena are associated with [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[self-organized criticality]] and [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turcotte|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data assimilation ===
[[Data assimilation]] combines numerical models of geophysical systems with observations that may be irregular in space and time. Many of the applications involve geophysical fluid dynamics. Fluid dynamic models are governed by a set of [[partial differential equations]]. For these equations to make good predictions, accurate initial conditions are needed. However, often the initial conditions are not very well known. Data assimilation methods allow the models to incorporate later observations to improve the initial conditions. Data assimilation plays an increasingly important role in [[weather forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|Zou|Zhu|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geophysical statistics ===
Some statistical problems come under the heading of mathematical geophysics, including [[model validation]] and quantifying uncertainty.

[[File:Charles Darwin aged 51.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Modern biology began in the nineteenth century with Charles Darwin's work on evolution by natural selection.]]
{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Natural selection''' is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in [[phenotype]]. It is a key mechanism of [[evolution]], the change in the [[Heredity|heritable]] [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] characteristic of a [[population&lt;!--key concept in Darwinian biology--&gt;]] over generations. [[Charles Darwin]] popularised the term "natural selection", contrasting it with [[selective breeding|artificial selection]], which is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.

[[Genetic diversity|Variation]] exists within all populations of [[organism]]s. This occurs partly because random [[mutation]]s arise in the [[genome]] of an individual organism, and [[offspring]] can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], other cells, other individuals, populations, [[species]], as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include [[sexual selection]] (now often included in natural selection) and [[fecundity selection]].

Natural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the [[Genetics|genetic]] 
(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become [[allele frequency|more common in a population]]. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular [[ecological niche]]s ([[microevolution]]) and may eventually result in [[speciation]]  (the emergence of new species, [[macroevolution]]). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.

Natural selection is a cornerstone of modern [[biology]]. The concept, published by Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in a [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|joint presentation of papers in 1858]], was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]''. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] with subsequent discoveries in [[classical genetics]] formed the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the mid-20th century. The addition of [[molecular genetics]] has led to [[evolutionary developmental biology]], which explains evolution at the molecular level. While [[genotype]]s can slowly change by random [[genetic drift]], natural selection remains the primary explanation for [[Adaptation|adaptive evolution]].

{{Main article|History of evolutionary thought}}

===Pre-Darwinian theories===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aristotle]] considered whether different forms could have appeared, only the useful ones surviving.]]

Several philosophers of the [[classical era]], including [[Empedocles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Empedocles|1898|loc=[https://history.hanover.edu/texts/presoc/emp.html#book2 ''On Nature'', Book II]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his intellectual successor, the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] poet [[Lucretius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucretius|1916|loc=[http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.5.v.html ''On the Nature of Things'', Book V]}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the idea that nature produces a huge variety of creatures, randomly, and that only those creatures that manage to provide for themselves and reproduce successfully persist. Empedocles' idea that organisms arose entirely by the incidental workings of causes such as heat and cold was criticised by [[Aristotle]] in Book II of ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aristotle|loc=[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html ''Physics'', Book II, Chapters 4 and 8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited natural [[teleology]] in its place, and believed that form was achieved for a purpose, citing the regularity of heredity in species as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSAGlzPLq7gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="henry"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henry |first=Devin |date=September 2006 |title=Aristotle on the Mechanism of Inheritance |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=devinhenry |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |location=Dordrecht, the Netherlands |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=425–455 |doi=10.1007/s10739-005-3058-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he accepted [[Aristotle's biology|in his biology]] that new types of animals, [[congenital disorder|monstrosities]] (τερας), can occur in very rare instances (''[[Generation of Animals]]'', Book IV).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ariew|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As quoted in Darwin's 1872 edition of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', Aristotle considered whether different forms (e.g., of teeth) might have appeared accidentally, but only the useful forms survived:
{{quote|So what hinders the different parts [of the body] from having this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example, grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident. And in like manner as to the other parts in which there appears to exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity, and whatsoever things were not thus constituted, perished, and still perish.|Aristotle|''Physics'', Book II, Chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=18 xiii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But Aristotle rejected this possibility in the next paragraph, making clear that he is talking about &lt;!--ontogeny --&gt; the development of animals as embryos with the phrase "either invariably or normally come about", not &lt;!--phylogeny --&gt;the origin of species:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view. For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or normally come about in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true. We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in the dog-days, but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for an end; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature.|Aristotle|''Physics'', Book II, Chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aristotle|loc=[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html ''Physics'', Book II, Chapter 8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Struggle for existence#Historical development|struggle for existence]] was later described by the [[Islam]]ic writer [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=25 April 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]|volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |jstor=984852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agutter|Wheatley|2008|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad AS Abdel|first=Haleem|year=2013|title=Pre-Darwinian Muslim Scholars' Views on Evolution|url=http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/uoc/PDF-FILES/(11)%20Dr.%20Sultan%20Shah_86_2.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions|volume=|pages=74–77|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical arguments were reintroduced in the 18th century by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maupertuis |first=Pierre Louis |authorlink=Pierre Louis Maupertuis |year=1746 |title=[[s:fr:Les Loix du mouvement et du repos déduites d'un principe metaphysique|''Les Loix du mouvement et du repos déduites d'un principe metaphysique'']] |trans-title=[[s:Translation:Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle#I.

Until the early 19th century, the [[History of creationism#Renaissance to Darwin|prevailing view]] in [[Western world|Western societies]] was that differences between individuals of a species were uninteresting departures from their [[Theory of Forms|Platonic ideals]] (or [[wikt:typus|typus]]) of [[Baraminology|created kinds]]. However, the theory of [[uniformitarianism]] in geology promoted the idea that simple, weak forces could act continuously over long periods of time to produce radical changes in the [[Earth]]'s landscape. The success of this theory raised awareness of the vast scale of [[Geologic time scale|geological time]] and made plausible the idea that tiny, virtually imperceptible changes in successive generations could produce consequences on the scale of differences between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |year=2003 |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |oclc=43091892 |pages=129–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 19th-century zoologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] suggested the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] as a mechanism for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, [[Lamarckism]], was an influence on the Soviet biologist [[Trofim Lysenko]]'s antagonism to mainstream genetic theory as late as the mid 20th century.&lt;ref name="Joravsky"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joravsky |first=David |date=January 1959 |title=Soviet Marxism and Biology before Lysenko |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=85–104 |doi=10.2307/2707968 |jstor=2707968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1835 and 1837, the zoologist [[Edward Blyth#On natural selection|Edward Blyth]] worked on the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=33&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's theory===
{{Main article|Inception of Darwin's theory|Development of Darwin's theory}}
{{see|Coloration evidence for natural selection}}

In 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for [[adaptation]] and speciation. He defined natural selection as the "principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=76 61]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce. As long as there is some variation between them and that variation is [[Heritability|heritable]], there will be an inevitable selection of individuals with the most advantageous variations. If the variations are heritable, then differential reproductive success leads to a progressive evolution of particular [[population]]s of a species, and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually become different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strickberger's Evolution |edition=4th |author1=Hall, Brian K. |author2=Hallgrímsson, Benedikt |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |date=2008 |pages=4–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrDD3cyA09kC&amp;pg=PA4 |isbn=978-0-7637-0066-9 |oclc=796450355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malthus 1826 vol 1 page 435 top Table England Population Growth 1780-1810.jpg|thumb|Part of [[Thomas Malthus]]'s table of [[population growth]] in England 1780–1810, from his ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population|Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', 6th edition, 1826]]

Darwin's ideas were inspired by the observations that he had made on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']] (1831–1836), and by the work of a political economist, &lt;!--the Reverend --&gt;[[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who, in ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798), noted that population (if unchecked) [[exponential growth|increases exponentially]], whereas the food supply grows only [[linear function|arithmetically]]; thus, inevitable limitations of resources would have demographic implications, leading to a "struggle for existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malthus|1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Darwin read Malthus in 1838 he was already primed by his work as a [[Natural history|naturalist]] to appreciate the "struggle for existence" in nature. It struck him that as population outgrew resources, "favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species."&lt;ref name=auto120&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin wrote:
{{quote|If during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation, and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species, at some age, season, or year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection.|source=Darwin summarising natural selection in the fourth chapter of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=144&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side 126–127]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once he had his theory, Darwin was meticulous about gathering and refining evidence before making his idea public. He was in the process of writing his "big book" to present his research when the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] independently conceived of the principle and described it in an essay he sent to Darwin to forward to [[Charles Lyell]]. Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] decided to present his essay together with unpublished writings that Darwin had sent to fellow naturalists, and ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]'' was read to the [[Linnean Society of London]] announcing co-discovery of the principle in July 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin published a detailed account of his evidence and conclusions in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859. In the 3rd edition of 1861 Darwin acknowledged that others—like [[William Charles Wells]] in 1813, and [[Patrick Matthew]] in 1831—had proposed similar ideas, but had neither developed them nor presented them in notable scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F381&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 xiii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LA2-NSRW-3-0536 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]] noted that [[Pigeon fancying|pigeon fanciers]] had created many kinds of pigeon, such as [[Tumbler pigeon|Tumblers]] (1, 12), [[Fantail pigeon|Fantails]] (13), and [[Pouter pigeon|Pouters]] (14) by [[selective breeding]].]]

Darwin thought of natural selection by analogy to how farmers select crops or livestock for breeding, which he called "[[artificial selection]]"; in his early manuscripts he referred to a "Nature" which would do the selection. At the time, other mechanisms of evolution such as evolution by genetic drift were not yet explicitly formulated, and Darwin believed that selection was likely only part of the story: "I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=21 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Charles Lyell in September 1860, Darwin regretted the use of the term "Natural Selection", preferring the term "Natural Preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2931 |title=Darwin, C.

For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural selection was in essence synonymous with evolution by natural selection. After the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'',&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism, partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its "unguided" and non-[[orthogenesis|progressive]] nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisley|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea's acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, [[Herbert Spencer]] introduced the phrase ''[[survival of the fittest]]'', which became a popular summary of the theory.&lt;ref name="sotf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5145#mark-5145.f3 |title=Darwin, C.

Natural selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but developed before the basic concepts of [[genetics]]. Although the [[Moravia]]n monk [[Gregor Mendel]], the father of modern genetics, was a contemporary of Darwin's, his work lay in obscurity, only being rediscovered in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/germplas/PISUM/ZGS4F.HTM |title=Mendel's Peas |last=Ambrose |first=Mike |publisher=Germplasm Resources Unit, [[John Innes Centre]]|location=Norwich, UK |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the early 20th century integration of evolution with [[Mendel's laws]] of inheritance, the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], scientists generally came to accept natural selection.&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian S.

==Terminology==

The term ''natural selection'' is most often defined to operate on heritable traits, because these directly participate in evolution. However, natural selection is "blind" in the sense that changes in phenotype can give a reproductive advantage regardless of whether or not the trait is heritable. Following Darwin's primary usage, the term is used to refer both to the evolutionary consequence of blind selection and to its mechanisms.&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomenclature1"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Endler|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes helpful to explicitly distinguish between selection's mechanisms and its effects; when this distinction is important, scientists define "(phenotypic) natural selection" specifically as "those mechanisms that contribute to the selection of individuals that reproduce", without regard to whether the basis of the selection is heritable.&lt;ref name="nomenclature2"&gt;{{harvnb|Haldane|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Russell |authorlink1=Russell Lande |last2=Arnold |first2=Stevan J. |date=November 1983 |title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1210–1226 |doi=10.2307/2408842 |jstor=2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that cause greater reproductive success of an organism are said to be ''selected for'', while those that reduce success are ''selected against''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sober|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Heritable variation, differential reproduction===
[[File:Lichte en zwarte versie berkenspanner crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|During the [[industrial revolution]], pollution killed many [[lichen]]s, leaving tree trunks dark. A [[industrial melanism|dark (melanic)]] [[Morph (zoology)|morph]] of the [[peppered moth]] largely replaced the formerly usual light morph (both shown here). Since the moths are subject to [[predation]] by birds hunting by sight, the colour change offers better [[camouflage]] against the changed background, suggesting natural selection at work.]]
{{main article|Genetic variation}}

Natural variation occurs among the individuals of any population of organisms. Some differences may improve an individual's chances of surviving and reproducing such that its lifetime reproductive rate is increased, which means that it leaves more offspring. If the traits that give these individuals a reproductive advantage are also [[heritable]], that is, passed from parent to offspring, then there will be differential reproduction, that is, a slightly higher proportion of fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation. Even if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population. In this way the [[natural environment]] of an organism "selects for" traits that confer a reproductive advantage, causing evolutionary change, as Darwin described.&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution and Natural Selection |url=http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/selection/selection.html |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 November 2016 |date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no intentional choice. Artificial selection is [[Teleology|purposive]] where natural selection is not, though [[teleology in biology|biologists often use teleological language]] to describe it.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=28 July 2016 |date=18 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[peppered moth]] exists in both light and dark colours in Great Britain, but during the [[industrial revolution]], many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by [[soot]], giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths a better chance of surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial [[Manchester]] were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on [[peppered moth evolution]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Peppered Moth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html |title=The Peppered Moth – An Update |last=Miller |first=Kenneth R. |authorlink=Kenneth R.

===Fitness===
{{Main article|Fitness (biology)}}

The concept of fitness is central to natural selection. In broad terms, individuals that are more "fit" have better potential for survival, as in the well-known phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]", but the precise meaning of the term is much more subtle. Modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing. If an organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes become more common in the adult population of the next generation. Though natural selection acts on individuals, the effects of chance mean that fitness can only really be defined "on average" for the individuals within a population. The fitness of a particular genotype corresponds to the average effect on all individuals with that genotype.&lt;ref name=Orr2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Orr |first1=H. Allen |title=Fitness and its role in evolutionary genetics |journal=Nat Rev Genet |date=August 2009 |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=531–539 |doi=10.1038/nrg2603 |pmc=2753274 |pmid=19546856 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753274/pdf |format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A distinction must be made between the concept of "survival of the fittest" and "improvement in fitness". "Survival of the fittest" does not give an "improvement in fitness", it only represents the removal of the less fit variants from a population. A mathematical example of "survival of the fittest" is given by Haldane in his "The Cost of Natural Selection" paper &lt;ref&gt;THE COST OF NATURAL SELECTION, J. B. S. HALDANE, Current Science, Vol. 63, No. 9/10 (10&amp;25 November 1992), pp. 612-625&lt;/ref&gt;. Haldane called this process "substitution" or more commonly in biology, this is called "fixation". This is correctly described by the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. On the other hand, "improvement in fitness" is not dependent on the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype, it is dependent on the absolute survival of the particular variant. The probability of a beneficial mutation occurring on some member of a population depends on the total number of replications of that variant. The mathematics of "improvement in fitness was described by Kleinman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleinman | first1 = A | year = 2014 | title = The basic science and mathematics of random mutation and natural selection | url = | journal = Statistics in Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 29| pages = 5074–5080 | doi=10.1002/sim.6307}}&lt;/ref&gt; An empirical example of "improvement in fitness" is given by the Kishony Mega-plate experiment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=5534434 | pmid=27609891 | doi=10.1126/science.aag0822 | volume=353 | title=Spatiotemporal microbial evolution on antibiotic landscapes | year=2016 | journal=Science | pages=1147–51 | last1 = Baym | first1 = M | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = TD | last3 = Kelsic | first3 = ED | last4 = Chait | first4 = R | last5 = Gross | first5 = R | last6 = Yelin | first6 = I | last7 = Kishony | first7 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment, "improvement in fitness" depends on the number of replications of the particular variant for a new variant to appear that is capable of growing in the next higher drug concentration region. Fixation or substitution is not required for this "improvement in fitness". On the other hand, "improvement in fitness" can occur in an environment where "survival of the fittest" is also acting. The classic Lenski "E. coli long-term evolution experiment" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/109/13/4950.long]&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of adaptation in a competitive environment, ("improvement in fitness" during "survival of the fittest"). The probability of a beneficial mutation occurring on some member of the lineage to give improved fitness is slowed by the competition. The variant which is a candidate for a beneficial mutation in this limited carrying capacity environment must first out-compete the "less fit" variants in order to accumulate the requisite number of replications for there to be a reasonable probability of that beneficial mutation occurring.

===Competition===
{{Main article|Competition (biology)}}

In biology, competition is an interaction between organisms in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another. This may be because both rely on a [[Limiting factor|limited]] supply of a resource such as food, water, or [[Territory (animal)|territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Begon|Townsend|Harper|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition may be [[intraspecific competition|within]] or [[interspecific competition|between species]], and may be direct or indirect.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sahney |first1=Sarda |last2=Benton |first2=Michael J. |authorlink2=Michael Benton |last3=Ferry |first3=Paul A. |date=23 August 2010 |title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html |journal=[[Biology Letters]]|volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=544–547 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 |pmc=2936204 |pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species less suited to compete should [[competitive exclusion principle|in theory either adapt or die out]], since competition plays a powerful role in natural selection, but according to the "room to roam" theory it may be less important than expansion among larger [[clade]]s.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jardine2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jardine |first1=Phillip E. |last2=Janis |first2=Christine M. |last3=Sahney |first3=Sarda |last4=Benton |first4=Michael J. |date=1 December 2012 |title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires |journal=[[Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology]] |volume=365–366 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition is modelled by [[r/K selection theory|''r/K'' selection theory]], which is based on [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]'s work on [[Insular biogeography|island biogeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|Wilson|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, selective pressures drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: ''r''- or ''K''-selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pianka |first=Eric R. |authorlink=Eric Pianka |date=November–December 1970 |title=On ''r''- and ''K''-Selection |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=104 |number=940 |pages=592–597 |doi=10.1086/282697 |jstor=2459020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, ''r'' and ''K'', can be illustrated in a [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic model]] of [[population dynamics]]:&lt;ref name=Verhulst&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verhulst |first=Pierre François |authorlink=Pierre François Verhulst |year=1838 |title=''Notice sur la loi que la population suit dans son accroissement'' |url=https://archive.org/details/correspondancem02belggoog |language=French |journal=Correspondance mathématique et physique |location=Brussels, Belgium |volume=10 |pages=113–121 |oclc=490225808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) \qquad \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Population growth#Population growth rate|growth rate]] of the population (''N''), and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of its local environmental setting. Typically, ''r''-selected species exploit empty [[Ecological niche|niches]], and produce many offspring, each with a relatively low [[probability]] of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, ''K''-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and [[Parental investment|invest]] more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Verhulst/&gt;

===Types of selection===
[[File:Genetic Distribution.svg|thumb|left|1: [[directional selection]]: a single extreme [[phenotype]] favoured.&lt;br&gt;2, [[stabilizing selection]]: intermediate favoured over extremes.&lt;br&gt;3: disruptive selection: extremes favoured over intermediate.&lt;br&gt;X-axis: [[phenotypic trait]]&lt;br&gt;Y-axis: number of organisms&lt;br&gt;Group A: original population&lt;br&gt;Group B: after selection]]

Natural selection can act on any heritable [[phenotypic trait]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zimmer|Emlen|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and selective pressure can be produced by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and [[Competition (biology)|competition]] with members of the same or other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2000|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArnqvistRowe2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnqvist |first1=Göran |last2=Rowe |first2=Locke |title=Sexual Conflict |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLfvwPqsHnMC&amp;pg=PA15 |year=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12218-2 |oclc=937342534 |pages=14–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Selection can be classified in several different ways, such as by its effect on a trait, on genetic diversity, by the life cycle stage where it acts, by the unit of selection, or by the resource being competed for.

Selection has different effects on traits. [[Stabilizing selection]] acts to hold a trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. [[Directional selection]] favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon [[disruptive selection]] also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait in more than one direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and [[univariate]] then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Alternatively, selection can be divided according to its effect on [[genetic diversity]]. [[Negative selection (natural selection)|Purifying or negative selection]] acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by [[Mutation#By inheritance|''de novo'' mutation]], which introduces new variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemey|Salemi|Vandamme|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Negative-Selection-1136 |title=Negative Selection |last=Loewe |first=Laurence |year=2008 |work=Nature Education |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=310450541}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[balancing selection]] acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, even in the absence of ''de novo'' mutation, by negative [[frequency-dependent selection]]. One mechanism for this is [[heterozygote advantage]], where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human [[ABO blood group]] locus has been explained in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Villanea |first1=Fernando A. |last2=Safi |first2=Kristin N. |last3=Busch |first3=Jeremiah W. |title=A General Model of Negative Frequency Dependent Selection Explains Global Patterns of Human ABO Polymorphism |journal=PLOS ONE |date=May 2015 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=e0125003 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125003 |pmid=25946124 |pmc=4422588|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1025003V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Life cycle of a sexually reproducing organism.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Different types of selection act at each [[Biological life cycle|life cycle stage]] of a sexually reproducing organism.&lt;ref name=Christiansen1984/&gt;]]

Another option is to classify selection by the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: [[Natural selection#Types of selection|viability (or survival) selection]], which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on [[gamete]] survival, and compatibility selection, acting on [[zygote]] formation.&lt;ref name=Christiansen1984&gt;{{harvnb|Christiansen|1984|pp=65–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection can also be classified by the level or [[unit of selection]]. Individual selection acts on the individual, in the sense that adaptations are "for" the benefit of the individual, and result from selection among individuals. [[Gene selection]] acts directly at the level of the gene. In [[kin selection]] and [[intragenomic conflict]], gene-level selection provides a more apt explanation of the underlying process. [[Group selection]], if it occurs, acts on groups of organisms, on the assumption that groups replicate and mutate in an analogous way to genes and individuals. There is an ongoing debate over the degree to which group selection occurs in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wade, Michael J. |display-authors=etal |title=Multilevel and kin selection in a connected world |journal=Nature |date=2010 |volume=463 |issue=7283 |pages=E8–E9 | doi=10.1038/nature08809 |pmid=20164866 |pmc=3151728|bibcode=2010Natur.463....8W |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151728/pdf |format=Accepted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, selection can be classified according to the [[Resource (biology)|resource]] being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes at the expense of viability. [[Ecological selection]] is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]]. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual selection as first articulated by Darwin (using the example of the [[Peafowl|peacock]]'s tail)&lt;ref name=DarwinSexualSelection/&gt; refers specifically to competition for mates,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be ''intrasexual'', between individuals of the same sex, that is male–male competition, or ''intersexual'', where one gender [[mate choice|chooses mates]], most often with males displaying and females choosing.&lt;ref name="Hosken2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosken |first1=David J. |last2=House |first2=Clarissa M. |title=Sexual Selection |journal=Current Biology |date=January 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210015198 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=R62–R65}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some species, mate choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family [[Syngnathidae]].&lt;ref name="Eens"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eens |first1=Marcel |last2=Pinxten |first2=Rianne |date=5 October 2000 |title=Sex-role reversal in vertebrates: behavioural and endocrinological accounts |journal=Behavioural Processes |location=Amsterdam, the Netherlands |volume=51 |issue=1–3 |pages=135–147 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00124-8 |pmid=11074317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barlow |first=George W. |date=March 2005 |title=How Do We Decide that a Species is Sex-Role Reversed? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=28–35 |doi=10.1086/431022 |pmid=15884733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection in action===

{{further information|Antimicrobial resistance}}

Natural selection is seen in action in the development of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] in [[microorganism]]s. Since the discovery of [[penicillin]] in 1928, [[antibiotics]] have been used to fight bacterial diseases. The widespread misuse of antibiotics has selected for microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, to the point that the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) has been described as a "superbug" because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harvey |first1=Fiona |last2=Carson |first2=Mary |last3=O'Kane |first3=Maggie |last4=Wasley |first4=Andrew |title=MRSA superbug found in supermarket pork raises alarm over farming risks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/mrsa-superbug-in-supermarket-pork-raises-alarm-farming-risks |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new [[strain (biology)|strains]] of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs.&lt;ref name=Schito_2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schito |first=Gian C. |date=March 2006 |title=The importance of the development of antibiotic resistance in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=12 |issue=Suppl s1 |pages=3–8 |pmid=16445718 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an [[evolutionary arms race]], in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with [[pesticide resistance]] in plants and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented example involves the spread of a gene in the butterfly ''[[Hypolimnas bolina]]'' suppressing male-killing activity by ''[[Wolbachia]]'' bacteria parasites on the island of [[Samoa]], where the spread of the gene is known to have occurred over a period of just five years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charlat |first1=Sylvain |last2=Hornett |first2=Emily A. |last3=Fullard |first3=James H. |last4=Davies |first4=Neil |last5=Roderick |first5=George K. |last6=Wedell |first6=Nina |last7=Hurst |first7=Gregory D.

==Evolution by means of natural selection==

{{Main article|Evolution|Darwinism}}

A prerequisite for natural selection to result in adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation is the presence of heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, [[genetic recombination]]s and alterations in the [[karyotype]] (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the [[chromosome]]s). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in [[noncoding DNA]] or resulted in a [[synonymous substitution]]. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects.&lt;ref name="NCFitnessEffects"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kryukov |first1=Gregory V. |last2=Schmidt |first2=Steffen |last3=Sunyaev |first3=Shamil |date=1 August 2005 |title=Small fitness effect of mutations in highly conserved non-coding regions |journal=[[Human Molecular Genetics]] |volume=14 |issue=15 |pages=2221–2229 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddi226 |pmid=15994173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCFitnessEffects2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bejerano |first1=Gill |last2=Pheasant |first2=Michael |last3=Makunin |first3=Igor |last4=Stephen |first4=Stuart |last5=Kent |first5=W.

Some mutations occur in [[evo-devo gene toolkit|"toolkit" or regulatory genes]]. Changes in these often have large effects on the phenotype of the individual because they regulate the function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in non-viable embryos. Some nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in [[Homeobox#Hox genes|HOX genes]] in humans, which can result in a [[cervical rib]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galis |first=Frietson |date=April 1999 |title=Why do almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae?

Established traits are not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one environmental context may be much less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] manifestation of the trait, also called [[evolutionary baggage]]. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as [[Exaptation|preadaptation]]. A famous example of a vestigial structure, the eye of the [[Spalax|blind mole-rat]], is believed to retain function in [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] perception.&lt;ref name="Sanyal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanyal |first1=Somes |last2=Jansen |first2=Harry G. |last3=de Grip |first3=Willem J. |last4=Nevo |first4=Eviatar |authorlink4=Eviatar Nevo |last5=de Jong |first5=Welfried W. |display-authors=4 |date=July 1990 |title=The Eye of the Blind Mole Rat, ''Spalax ehrenbergi''.

===Speciation===
{{Main article|Speciation}}
Speciation requires a degree of [[reproductive isolation]]—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic to the concept of a [[species]] that [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in [[allopatric]] speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. [[E. B. Poulton]] realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the [[Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model]], further elaborated by [[H. Allen Orr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Orr | first1=H. A. |authorlink=H. Allen Orr| title=Dobzhansky, Bateson, and the Genetics of Speciation | journal=Genetics | volume=144 | issue=4 | pages=1331–5 | year=1996 | pmc=1207686 | pmid=8978022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sergey Gavrilets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Gavrilets |first=S. |title=Fitness Landscapes and the Origin of Species |year=2004 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691119830}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]], however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.&lt;ref name="Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation | author=Schuler, Hannes; Hood, Glen R.; Egan, Scott P.; Feder, Jeffrey L. | journal=Reviews in Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine | year=2016 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=60–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic basis==

===Genotype and phenotype===
{{main article|Genotype–phenotype distinction}}

Natural selection acts on an organism's phenotype, or physical characteristics. Phenotype is determined by an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and the environment in which the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an [[allele]]. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the [[ABO]] [[blood type]] [[antigen]]s in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://omim.org/entry/110300 |title=ABO Glycosyltransferase; ABO |author1=McKusick, Victor A. |author2=Gross, Matthew B. |date=18 November 2014 |work=Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man |publisher=National Library of Medicine |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traits are governed by only a single gene, but most traits are influenced by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes can produce a continuum of possible phenotypic values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Falconer|Mackay|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directionality of selection===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Race and intelligence]] --&gt;
{{main article|Directional selection}}

When some component of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection can be divided into three classes, on the basis of its effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|2004|loc=See especially chapters 5 and 6 for a quantitative treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is [[fixation (population genetics)|fixed]] and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rieseberg, L.H. |author2=Widmer, A. |author3=Arntz, A.M. |author4=Burke, J.M. |date=2002 |title=Directional selection is the primary cause of phenotypic diversification |journal=PNAS |volume=99 |issue=19 |pages=12242–12245 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/19/12242.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.192360899 |pmid=12221290 |pmc=129429|bibcode=2002PNAS...9912242R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection [[Conserved sequence|conserves]] functional genetic features, such as [[protein biosynthesis|protein-coding genes]] or [[regulatory sequence]]s, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Charlesworth B, Lande R, Slatkin M |date=1982 |title=A neo-Darwinian commentary on macroevolution |journal=Evolution |volume=36 |issue=3 |doi=10.2307/2408095 |pmid=28568049 |pages=474–498|jstor=2408095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of balancing selection do not result in fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in [[diploid]] species (with pairs of chromosomes) when [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for [[sickle-cell anaemia]]. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through [[disruptive selection|disruptive or diversifying selection]], which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and can result in a [[Multimodal distribution|bimodal distribution]] of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of [[game theory]] have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=William D. |authorlink=W.

===Selection, genetic variation, and drift===
{{Main article|Genetic variation|Genetic drift}}

A portion of all genetic variation is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or significant difference in fitness. [[Motoo Kimura]]'s [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] by [[genetic drift]] proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=Kimura&gt;{{cite book |author=Kimura, Motoo |authorlink=Motoo Kimura |date=1983 |title=The neutral theory of molecular evolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-23109-1 |oclc=8776549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutral events can radically reduce genetic variation through [[population bottleneck]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Robinson |editor-first=Richard |encyclopedia=Genetics |title=Population Bottleneck |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/population-bottleneck-gen-03/ |year=2003 |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Macmillan Reference USA]] |volume=3 |isbn=978-0-02-865609-0 |oclc=3373856121}}&lt;/ref&gt; which among other things can cause the [[founder effect]] in initially small new populations.&lt;ref name=Campbell1996&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |year=1996 |title=Biology |edition=4th |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |isbn=978-0-8053-1940-8 |oclc=3138680061 |page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness.&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt; However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a [[mutation–selection balance]]. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on the rate at which new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lynch |first1=Michael |title=Evolution of the mutation rate |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=August 2010 |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=345–352 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.05.003 |pmid=20594608 |pmc=2910838|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910838/pdf |format=Accepted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic linkage]] occurs when the [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of two alleles are in close proximity on a chromosome. During the formation of gametes, recombination reshuffles the alleles. The chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles is inversely related to the distance between them. [[Selective sweep]]s occur when an allele becomes more common in a population as a result of positive selection. As the prevalence of one allele increases, closely linked alleles can also become more common by "[[genetic hitchhiking]]", whether they are neutral or even slightly deleterious. A strong selective sweep results in a region of the genome where the positively selected [[haplotype]] (the allele and its neighbours) are in essence the only ones that exist in the population. Selective sweeps can be detected by measuring [[linkage disequilibrium]], or whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population. Since a selective sweep also results in selection of neighbouring alleles, the presence of a block of strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate a 'recent' selective sweep near the centre of the block.&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithHaigh&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=John Maynard|last2=Haigh|first2=John |date=1974 |title=The hitch-hiking effect of a favourable gene |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/genetics-research/article/the-hitch-hiking-effect-of-a-favourable-gene/918291A3B62BD50E1AE5C1F22165EF1B |journal=Genetics Research |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=23–35 |doi=10.1017/S0016672300014634 |pmid=4407212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Background selection]] is the opposite of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background selection is a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.&lt;ref name="Keightley &amp; Otto 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keightley |first1=Peter D. |authorlink1=Peter Keightley |last2=Otto |first2=Sarah P. |authorlink2=Sarah Otto |date=7 September 2006 |title=Interference among deleterious mutations favours sex and recombination in finite populations |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=443 |issue=7107 |pages=89–92 |doi=10.1038/nature05049  |pmid=16957730|bibcode=2006Natur.443...89K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
{{main article|Universal Darwinism}}

Darwin's ideas, along with those of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Karl Marx]], had a profound influence on 19th century thought, including his radical claim that "elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner" evolved from the simplest forms of life by a few simple principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=507&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side 489]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired some of Darwin's most ardent supporters—and provoked the strongest opposition. Natural selection had the power, according to [[Stephen Jay Gould]], to "dethrone some of the deepest and most traditional comforts of Western thought", such as the belief that humans have a special place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=12 June 1997 |title=Darwinian Fundamentalism |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jun/12/darwinian-fundamentalism/ |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=44 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of the philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], "Darwin's dangerous idea" of evolution by natural selection is a "universal acid," which cannot be kept restricted to any vessel or container, as it soon leaks out, working its way into ever-wider surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the last decades, the concept of natural selection has spread from [[evolutionary biology]] to other disciplines, including [[evolutionary computation]], [[quantum Darwinism]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[evolutionary epistemology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[Lee Smolin#Cosmological natural selection|cosmological natural selection]]. This unlimited applicability has been called [[universal Darwinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=von Sydow, M. |date=2012 |url=http://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/content/list.php?cat=subject&amp;show=Biologie&amp;details=isbn-978-3-86395-006-4 |title=From Darwinian Metaphysics towards Understanding the Evolution of Evolutionary Mechanisms.

===Origin of life===
{{main article|Abiogenesis}}

How life originated from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent hypothesis is that life first appeared [[RNA world|in the form of short self-replicating RNA]] polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |authorlink1=Manfred Eigen |last2= Gardiner |first2=William |last3=Schuster |authorlink3= Peter Schuster |first3=Peter |last4= Winkler-Oswatitsch |first4=Ruthild |display-authors=3 |date= April 1981 |title= The Origin of Genetic Information |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location= Stuttgart |volume= 244 |issue=4 |pages= 88–92, 96, ''et passim'' |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0481-88|pmid=6164094|bibcode=1981SciAm.244d..88E }}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, life may have come into existence when [[RNA]] chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, [[Genetic variability|variation of type]], and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early [[Abiogenesis#RNA synthesis and replication|RNA replicator]] would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]]) and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Byerly |first2=Henry C. |last3=Hopf |first3=Frederick A. |last4=Michod |first4=Richard A. |last5=Vemulapalli |first5=G.

===Cell and molecular biology===

In 1881, the embryologist [[Wilhelm Roux]] published ''Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus'' (''The Struggle of Parts in the Organism'') in which he suggested that the development of an organism results from a Darwinian competition between the parts of the embryo, occurring at all levels, from molecules to organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, a modern version of this theory has been proposed by [[:fr:Jean-Jacques Kupiec|Jean-Jacques Kupiec]]. According to this cellular Darwinism, [[stochastic|random variation]] at the molecular level generates diversity in cell types whereas cell interactions impose a characteristic order on the developing embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scitopics.com/Cellular_Darwinism_stochastic_gene_expression_in_cell_differentiation_and_embryo_development.html |title=Cellular Darwinism (stochastic gene expression in cell differentiation and embryo development) |last=Kupiec |first=Jean-Jacques |authorlink=:fr:Jean-Jacques Kupiec |date=3 May 2010 |website=SciTopics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804050452/http://www.scitopics.com/Cellular_Darwinism_stochastic_gene_expression_in_cell_differentiation_and_embryo_development.html |archivedate=4 August 2010 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and psychological theory===

The social implications of the theory of evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. [[Friedrich Engels]], a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] and co-originator of the ideology of [[communism]], wrote in 1872 that "Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the ''animal kingdom''&lt;!--author's emphasis--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engels|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate [[Francis Galton]]'s interpretation of natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for [[colonialism]], [[eugenics]], and [[social Darwinism]]. For example, in 1940, [[Konrad Lorenz]], in writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for policies of the [[Nazi]] state. He wrote "...&amp;nbsp;selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility&amp;nbsp;... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenberg |first=Leon |authorlink=Leon Eisenberg |date=September 2005 |title=Which image for Lorenz? |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |type=Letter to the editor |volume=162 |issue=9 |page=1760 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1760 |pmid=16135651}} Eisenberg quoting translation of ''Durch Domestikation verursachte Störungen arteigenen Verhaltens'' (1940, p. 2) by [[Konrad Lorenz]].&lt;/ref&gt; Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture [[Sociocultural evolution|evolve]] by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, work among anthropologists and psychologists has led to the development of [[sociobiology]] and later of evolutionary psychology, a field that attempts to explain features of [[Psychology|human psychology]] in terms of adaptation to the ancestral environment. The most prominent example of evolutionary psychology, notably advanced in the early work of [[Noam Chomsky]] and later by [[Steven Pinker]], is the hypothesis that the human brain has adapted to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinker|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of human behaviour and social structures, from specific cultural norms such as [[Westermarck effect#Westermarck effect|incest avoidance]] to broader patterns such as [[gender role]]s, have been hypothesised to have similar origins as adaptations to the early environment in which modern humans evolved. By analogy to the action of natural selection on genes, the concept of [[meme]]s—"units of cultural transmission," or culture's equivalents of genes undergoing selection and recombination—has arisen, first described in this form by [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1976|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently expanded upon by philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] as explanations for complex cultural activities, including human [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information and systems theory===

In 1922, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] proposed that natural selection might be understood as a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lotka |first=Alfred J. |authorlink=Alfred J. Lotka |date=June 1922 |title=Contribution to the energetics of evolution |journal=PNAS |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=147–151 |doi=10.1073/pnas.8.6.147 |pmc=1085052 |pmid=16576642|bibcode=1922PNAS....8..147L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lotka |first=Alfred J. |date=June 1922 |title=Natural selection as a physical principle |journal=PNAS |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=151–154 |doi=10.1073/pnas.8.6.151 |pmc=1085053 |pmid=16576643|bibcode=1922PNAS....8..151L }}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept later developed by [[Howard T. Odum]] as the [[maximum power principle]] in [[thermodynamics]], whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Odum, H.T. |date=1995 |title=Self-Organization and Maximum Empower |editor=Hall, C.A.S. |work=Maximum Power: The Ideas and Applications of H.T. Odum |publisher=Colorado University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of natural selection have inspired a variety of computational techniques, such as "soft" [[artificial life]], that simulate selective processes and can be highly efficient in 'adapting' entities to an environment defined by a specified [[fitness function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kauffman|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a class of [[heuristic]] [[Mathematical optimization|optimisation]] [[algorithm]]s known as [[genetic algorithm]]s, pioneered by [[John Henry Holland]] in the 1970s and expanded upon by [[David E. Goldberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberg|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify optimal solutions by simulated reproduction and mutation of a population of solutions defined by an initial [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such algorithms are particularly useful when applied to problems whose [[energy landscape]] is very rough or has many local minima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Genetic Algorithms |url=http://www.pharmacologicalsciences.us/genetic-algorithms/scoring-functions.html |website=Pharmacological Sciences |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
{{main|Evolution in fiction}}

Darwinian evolution by natural selection is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Among major responses is [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s 1872 pessimistic ''[[Erewhon]]'' ("nowhere", written backwards). In 1893 [[H. G. Wells]] imagined "[[The Man of the Year Million]]", transformed by natural selection into a being with a huge head and eyes, and shrunken body.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. | |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''No Man Friday''''' (also known in the United States as '''''First on Mars''''') is a British [[science fiction]] novel by [[Rex Gordon]] (Stanley Bennett Hough)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/gordon_rex Rex Gordon in the SF Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; published  in 1956. The reference in the original title is to ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and the story can be described as a science fiction [[robinsonade]] set on Mars. The similarity is made explicit by the first edition cover.

== Plot summary ==

A British rocket, developed at minimal cost and kept secret from officialdom, lifts off from the [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera rocket range]] on a mission to Mars. During the voyage, an accident in the [[airlock]] kills the entire crew except for engineer Gordon Holder, the novel's narrator, who was returning from an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] and still in his [[space suit]].

The rocket reaches Mars but crash-lands. There, Holder learns how to produce [[oxygen]] and [[water]], also discovering more about Martian species and nourishment. Eventually, he starts cooperating with the titanic inhabitants of the planet to survive. After fifteen years, an American mission lands, thinking themselves the first to reach Mars. Holder contacts the Americans, and then tries to return to the dominant Martian beings, but is prevented from reaching them. He returns to Earth with the Americans.

== Martian creatures ==
In his book, Rex Gordon describes Mars as a planet inhabited by different kinds of life forms.

; Minerals : Highly energetic flower-shaped mineral formations that grow in Martian valleys. Humidity disintegrates them.
; Plants : Photosynthetic organisms growing throughout the Martian surface. They bloom and produce hard fruits.
; "Ants" : Social insect-like bugs that pollinate the plants' flowers.
; "Humans" : Humanoid creatures are not the [[dominant species]] on Mars. These animals eat the plants' fruits, live in groups and have limited intelligence.
; Dominant beings : Gigantic nocturnal living beings that eat Martian humanoids. They use their body lights for communication. The book also suggests they have the capacity to distort [[spacetime]].

'''Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia''' or '''PEMSEA''' is a regional partnership programme implemented by the United Nations Development Programme ([[UNDP]]) and executed by the United Nations Office for Project Services ([[UNOPS]]). The project, started in 1994, was originally known as Prevention and Management of Marine Pollution in the East Asian Seas (SDS-SEA).

PEMSEA is currently being hosted by the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources and holds its office in the DENR compound in Quezon City, Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denr.gov.ph/news-and-features/latest-news/905-pemsea-formalizes-international-headquarters-in-philippines.html |title=PEMSEA Formalizes International Headquarters in Philippines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 August 2012 |work= |publisher=DENR |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In December 1993, several [[Integrated Coastal Management]] (ICM) pilot sites were established, including Xiamen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.pemsea.org/site/xiamen |title=Xiamen |publisher=PEMSEA |accessdate=5 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406192131/http://beta.pemsea.org/site/xiamen |archivedate= 6 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;(PR China) and Batangas Bay &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.pemsea.org/site/batangas |title=Batangas |publisher=PEMSEA |accessdate=5 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406192315/http://beta.pemsea.org/site/batangas |archivedate= 6 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Philippines), which helped start efforts in addressing marine pollution problems in the Straits of Malacca and Straits of Singapore; and increasing capacity development in the regions of Cambolia, China, DPR Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. A second phase of the Project, implemented between 1999 and 2007, was supported by the [[Global Environmental Facility]] (GEF), focused on building partnerships between stakeholders. The project was renamed to PEMSEA to reflect the new thrust of the programme.

In 2003, participating governments and stakeholders of the organization issued Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA) to promote a common vision in the area of sustainable development in the region. In 2007, PEMSEA committed itself to implementing the SDS-SEA as a part of Phase I project (2007-2017). The latest phase's aim is to make PEMSEA a self-sustaining regional operating mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.pemsea.org/about-pemsea/history|title=PEMSEA:History|publisher=PEMSEA |accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEMSEA's areas of work include coastal and ocean governance, natural and man-made hazard prevention and management, habitat protection, restoration and management, water use and supply management, pollution and waste reduction management, as well as food security and livelihood management.

One of the important tasks that PEMSEA assumes is turning the knowledge about regional coastal into action that can improve the status quo. PEMSEA capitalizes on its broad intergovernmental, financial and intellectual resources to come up with the best solutions problems of sustainable coastal management.

==East Asian Seas Congress==
Every three years, PEMSEA hosts the East Asian Seas Congress that consists of a Ministerial Forum, an International Conference and other events. The conference focuses on tracking progress of SDS-SEA, encourages knowledge exchange and raises important issues regarding coastal management in the region. It also tries to engage private sector in helping develop sustainable financial and business solutions to coastal management problems. The first East Asian Seas Congress was held in December 2003 in Putrajaya, Malaysia. It was organized following the recommendations of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ([[WSSD]]) with the goal to improve situation related to coasts and oceans. The following two congresses were held in Haikou City, Hainan Province, PR China in the year 2006 and in Philippines in the year 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/99567/economy/rp-to-host-3rd-east-asian-seas-congress |title=RP to Host 3rd East Asian Seas Congress |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 June 2008 |work= |publisher=GMA News Online |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 congress was held with the theme “Building a Blue Economy: Strategy, Opportunities, and Partnerships in the Seas of East Asia” in July 2012 in Changwon City, the Republic of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/11/117_72764.html|title=Changwon to host Environmental Congress in 2012|publisher=The Korea Times|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pemsea.org/about-pemsea/operating-mechanism/the-east-asian-seas-congress |title=The East Asian Seas Congress |publisher=PEMSEA |accessdate=5 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730135619/http://pemsea.org/about-pemsea/operating-mechanism/the-east-asian-seas-congress |archivedate=30 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and regional agreements and declarations==
The programme was instrumental to the adoption of several national and regional agreements, including:

* Putrajaya Declaration: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, PR China, DPR Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, RO Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam adopted the Putrajaya Declaration of Regional Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Seas of East Asia on 12 December 2003. The declaration formally adopted the SDS-SEA as a regional strategy for the sustainable development of the seas of the region.
* Haikou Partnership Agreement: Signed by the original signatories of the Putrajaya Declaration (with the exception of Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia) and Japan, the agreement established the coordinating and operating mechanisms of the implementation of the SDS-SEA.
* Manila Bay Declaration: Signed in 2001, the declaration is a commitment between the national government and concerned local government units in the Philippines for the implementation of the Manila Bay Coastal Strategy, providing an environmental management framework for Manila Bay and its watersheds.
* Bohai Sea Declaration: Governors of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong and Tianjin, together with the Administrator of China's State Oceanic Administration signed the Bohai Declaration on Environmental Protection, formally adopting principles, objectives, policy measures and actions to reduce waste and marine pollution across the administrative boundaries of the adjacent coastal municipalities and provinces.
* Executive Order 533 (Philippines): EO533 declared Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) as the national strategy for sustainable development of the country's marine and coastal resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2006/06/06/executive-order-no-533-s-2006/|title=Executive Order No. 533, s. 2006|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Permian''' is a [[period (geology)|geologic period]] and [[System (stratigraphy)|system]] which spans 47 million years from the end of the [[Carboniferous]] Period {{Period end|Carboniferous}} million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|Mya]]), to the beginning of the [[Triassic]] period  251.902 Mya. It is the last period of the [[Paleozoic]] era; the following [[Triassic]] period belongs to the [[Mesozoic]] era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir [[Roderick Murchison]], who named it after the city of [[Perm]].

The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early [[amniote]]s into the ancestral groups of the [[mammal]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[Lepidosauria|lepidosaurs]], and [[archosaur]]s. The world at the time was dominated by two continents known as [[Pangaea]] and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], surrounded by a global ocean called [[Panthalassa]]. The [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse]] left behind vast regions of [[desert]] within the continental interior.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12| bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amniote]]s, who could better cope with these drier conditions, rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors.

The Permian (along with the Paleozoic) ended with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, in which nearly 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/p/permian-triassic_extinction_event.htm |title={title} |access-date=2018-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414073613/http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/p/permian-triassic_extinction_event.htm |archive-date=2015-04-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would take well into the Triassic for life to recover from this catastrophe.&lt;ref name="kgs.ku.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/fossils/massExtinct.html|title=GeoKansas--Geotopics--Mass Extinctions|work=ku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery from the Permian–Triassic extinction event was protracted; on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759 | last1=Sahney|first1=S. |last2= Benton|first2=M.

==Discovery==
The term "Permian" was introduced into [[geology]] in 1841 by [[Roderick Murchison|Sir R. I. Murchison]], president of the [[Geological Society of London]], who identified typical strata in extensive Russian explorations undertaken with [[Édouard de Verneuil]].&lt;ref&gt;Benton, M.J. et al., [http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Benton/reprints/2010Murchison.pdf Murchison’s first sighting of the Permian, at Vyazniki in 1841], Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, accessed 2012-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murchison, Roderick Impey (1841) [https://books.google.com/books?id=1U8wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA417#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "First sketch of some of the principal results of a second geological survey of Russia,"] ''Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science'', series 3, '''19''' : 417-422.

==Oceans==
[[Sea level]]s in the Permian remained generally low, and near-shore environments were reduced as almost all major [[landmass]]es collected into a single continent&amp;nbsp;– [[Pangaea]]. This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species at the end of the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms.

==Paleogeography==
[[File:280 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|230px|left|Geography of the Permian world]]
During the Permian, all the [[Earth]]'s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the [[equator]] and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ("[[Panthalassa]]", the "universal sea"), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmeria]] continent [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] and drifted north to [[Laurasia]], causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the [[Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that would dominate much of the [[Mesozoic]] era. Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("[[continental climate]]") and [[monsoon]] conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored [[gymnosperm]]s, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as [[fern]]s that disperse [[spore]]s in a wetter environment. The first modern trees ([[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s) appeared in the Permian.

Three general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits&amp;nbsp;– the [[Ural Mountains]] (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|Texas red beds.]] The [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the U.S. states of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]] is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world.

==Climate==
[[File:Selwyn Rock 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inman Valley, South Australia|Selwyn Rock, South Australia]], an exhumed [[Glacial striation|glacial pavement]] of Permian age]]
The [[climate]] in the Permian was quite varied. At the [[Permian#anchor 3|start of the Permian]], the Earth was still in an [[ice age]], which began in the [[Carboniferous]].  Glaciers receded around the [[mid-Permian]] period as the climate gradually warmed, drying the continent's interiors.&lt;ref name="palaeos.com"&gt;[http://palaeos.com/paleozoic/permian/permian.htm Palaeos: Life Through Deep Time &gt; The Permian Period] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629232721/http://palaeos.com/paleozoic/permian/permian.htm |date=2013-06-29 }} Accessed 1 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[late Permian]] period, the drying continued although the temperature cycled between warm and cool cycles.&lt;ref name="palaeos.com"/&gt;

==Life==
[[File:HercosestriaPair040111.jpg|thumb|''[[Hercosestria]] cribrosa'', a [[reef]]-forming productid brachiopod (Middle Permian, Glass Mountains, Texas).]]

===Marine biota===
Permian marine deposits are rich in [[fossil]] [[mollusk]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[brachiopod]]s.&lt;ref name="ucmp.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/permian.php|title=The Permian Period|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossilized shells of two kinds of [[invertebrate]]s are widely used to identify Permian strata and correlate them between sites: [[fusulinid]]s, a kind of shelled amoeba-like [[protist]] that is one of the [[foraminifera]]ns, and [[Ammonite|ammonoids]], shelled [[cephalopod]]s that are distant relatives of the modern [[nautilus]]. By the close of the Permian, [[trilobite]]s and a host of other marine groups became extinct.

===Terrestrial biota===
Terrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, [[fungi]], [[arthropod]]s, and various types of [[Permian tetrapods|tetrapods]]. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of [[Pangaea]]. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared.&lt;ref name="ucmp.berkeley.edu"/&gt;  The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover.  A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements.

The Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The swamp-loving [[lycopod]] trees of the Carboniferous, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]'', were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced [[seed ferns]] and early [[conifers]]. At the close of the Permian, lycopod and [[Equisetopsida|equisete]] [[swamp]]s reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only on a series of equatorial islands in the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] that later would become [[South China (continent)|South China]].&lt;ref&gt;Xu, R. &amp; Wang, X.-Q. (1982): Di zhi shi qi Zhongguo ge zhu yao Diqu zhi wu jing guan (Reconstructions of Landscapes in Principal Regions of China). Ke xue chu ban she, Beijing. 55 pages, 25 plates.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the ''[[Glossopteris]] '' flora. Oxygen levels were probably high there. The [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s also appeared during this period.

====Insects====
From the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] period until well into the Permian, the most successful insects were primitive [[Blattoptera|relatives of cockroaches]]. Six fast legs, four well-developed folding wings, fairly good eyes, long, well-developed antennae (olfactory), an omnivorous digestive system, a receptacle for storing sperm, a [[chitin]]-based [[exoskeleton]] that could support and protect, as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts, gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals. About 90% of insects at the start of the Permian were cockroach-like insects ([[Blattoptera|"Blattopterans"]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman EC (1948) Insects of Hawaii, Vol. II. Univ. Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive forms of [[dragonflies]] ([[Odonata]]) were the dominant aerial predators and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata appeared in the Permian,&lt;ref&gt;Grzimek HC Bernhard (1975) ''Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia'' Vol 22 Insects. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riek EF Kukalova-Peck J (1984) "A new interpretation of dragonfly wing venation based on early Upper Carboniferous fossils from Argentina (Insecta: Odonatoida and basic character states in Pterygote wings.)" ''Can. J. Zool.'' 62; 1150-1160.&lt;/ref&gt; and all are effectively [[Aquatic insects|semi-aquatic insects]] (aquatic immature stages, and terrestrial adults), as are all modern odonates. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils,&lt;ref&gt;Wakeling JM Ellington CP (1997) Dragonfly flight III lift and power requirements" ''Journal of Experimental Biology'' 200; 583-600, on p589&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to the [[Devonian]], and are different in several respects from the wings of other insects.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda R (1970) Morphology and evolution of the insect thorax. Mem. Ent. Soc. Can. 76; 1-431.&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils suggest they may have possessed many modern attributes even by the late [[Carboniferous]], and it is possible that they captured small vertebrates, for at least [[Meganeuropsis|one species]] had a wing span of {{convert|71|cm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Riek EF Kukalova-Peck J (1984) A new interpretation of dragonfly wing venation based on early Upper Carboniferous fossils from Argentina (Insecta: Odonatoida and basic character states in Pterygote wings.) Can. J. Zool. 62; 1150-1160&lt;/ref&gt; Several other insect groups appeared or flourished during the Permian, including the [[Coleoptera]] (beetles) and [[Hemiptera]] (true bugs).

====Synapsid and amphibian fauna====
Early Permian terrestrial faunas were dominated by [[pelycosaur]]s, [[Diadectidae|diadectids]] and [[amphibian]]s,&lt;ref name="Huttenlocker, A. K. 2012. Pp. 90"&gt;Huttenlocker, A. K., and E.

Towards the very end of the Permian the first [[Archosauriformes|archosaurs]] appeared, a group that would give rise to the [[crurotarsans]] and the [[dinosaur]]s in the [[Triassic|following period]]. Also appearing at the end of the Permian were the first [[cynodont]]s, which would go on to evolve into [[mammal]]s during the Triassic. Another group of therapsids, the [[therocephalia]]ns (such as ''[[Lycosuchus]]''), arose in the Middle Permian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Huttenlocker A.

The Permian period saw the development of a fully terrestrial fauna and the appearance of the first [[megafauna|large]] [[herbivore]]s and [[carnivore]]s. It was the high tide of the [[anapsid]]s in the form of the massive [[Pareiasaur]]s and host of smaller, generally lizard-like groups. A group of small reptiles, the [[diapsids]], started to abound. These were the ancestors to most modern reptiles and the ruling dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs and crocodiles.

The [[synapsid]], early ancestors to mammals, also thrived at this time. Synapsids included some large members such as ''[[Dimetrodon]]''. The special adaptations of reptiles enabled them to flourish in the drier climate of the Permian and they grew to dominate the vertebrates.&lt;ref name="Huttenlocker, A. K. 2012. Pp. 90"/&gt;

Permian amphibians consisted of [[temnospondyli]], [[lepospondyli]] and [[Batrachosauria|batrachosaurs]].

==Permian–Triassic extinction event==
[[File:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|300px|right|The Permian–Triassic extinction event, labeled "End P" here, is the most significant extinction event in this plot for marine [[genus|genera]] which produce large numbers of [[fossils]].]]
{{Main|Permian–Triassic extinction event}}
The Permian ended with the most extensive [[extinction event]] recorded in [[paleontology]]: the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. 90% to 95% of marine species became [[Extinction|extinct]], as well as 70% of all land organisms. It is also the only known mass extinction of insects.&lt;ref name="kgs.ku.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/extinction/a/aa_permotrias.htm|title=The Great Permian-Triassic Extinction|author=Andrew Alden|work=About.com Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recovery from the Permian-Triassic extinction event was protracted; on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt; [[Trilobite]]s, which had thrived since [[Cambrian]] times, finally became extinct before the end of the Permian. [[Nautilus]]es, a species of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence.

There is evidence that magma, in the form of [[flood basalt]], poured onto the surface in what is now called the [[Siberian Traps]], for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name="palaeos.com"/&gt;

Another hypothesis involves ocean venting of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Portions of the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an [[Anoxic event|anoxic zone]], the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy [[ozone]] in the upper atmosphere allowing [[ultraviolet]] radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas.&lt;ref name=Kump&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrogen sulfide#Life adapted to hydrogen sulfide|There are species]] that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide.

Another hypothesis builds on the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until [[Methane clathrate|frozen methane reservoirs]] below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent [[greenhouse gas]]es) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|last2=Twitchett|first2=Richard J.|title=How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=7 July 2003|volume=18|issue=7|pages=358–365|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more speculative hypothesis is that intense radiation from a nearby [[supernova]] was responsible for the extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|title=Could a nearby supernova explosion have caused a mass extinction?|work= Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences|pmc=42852|pmid=11607506|volume=92|date=January 1995|pages=235–8|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.235|arxiv=hep-ph/9303206|bibcode=1995PNAS...92..235E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesised that huge [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]] ([[Wilkes Land crater]]) with a diameter of around 500 kilometers in Antarctica represents an impact event that may be related to the extinction.&lt;ref name="big bang"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica – Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Ohio State University Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=June 1, 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| archivedate=March 6, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crater is located at a depth of 1.6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica. The scientists speculate that this impact may have caused the Permian–Triassic extinction event, although its age is bracketed only between 100 million and 500 million years ago. They also speculate that it may have contributed in some way to the separation of Australia from the Antarctic landmass, which were both part of a supercontinent called [[Gondwana]]. Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian-Triassic layer do not approach those of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] layer. Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former, doubt is cast on the significance of a meteorite impact in creating the latter. Further doubt has been cast on this theory based on fossils in Greenland that show the extinction to have been gradual, lasting about eighty thousand years, with three distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Shen2011"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Calibrating the End-Permian Mass Extinction|author=Shen S.-Z.|year=2011|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1213454|bibcode = 2011Sci...334.1367S |display-authors=etal|pmid=22096103|volume=334|pages=1367–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientists argue that the Permian–Triassic extinction event was caused by a combination of some or all of the hypotheses above and other factors; the formation of [[Pangaea]] decreased the number of coastal habitats and may have contributed to the extinction of many [[clades]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The '''Pirani gauge''' is a robust [[thermal conductivity]] gauge used for the measurement of the [[Pressure measurement|pressures]] in vacuum systems.&lt;ref name="urlPhys. Rev. 37 (1931): A. Ellett and R. M. Zabel - The Pirani Gauge for..."&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.37.1102 |title=Phys. Rev. 37 (1931): A. Ellett and R. M. Zabel - The Pirani Gauge for the Measurement of Small Changes of Pressure |format= |accessdate= |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.1102 |volume=37 |journal=Physical Review |pages=1102–1111 | last1 = Ellett | first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented in 1906 by [[Marcello Pirani]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title= |journal=[[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]], Verh. |year=1906 |first=M |last=von Pirani |coauthors= |volume=8 |issue= |pages=24 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcello Stefano Pirani was a German physicist working for Siemens &amp; Halske which was involved in the vacuum lamp industry. In 1905 their product was tantalum lamps which required a high vacuum environment for the filaments. The gauges that Pirani was using in the production environment were some fifty McCloud gauges, each filled with 2kg of mercury in glass tubes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Modern Vacuum Technology|last=Borichevsky|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781974554461|location=|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pirani was aware of the gas thermal conductivity investigations of Kundt and Warburg&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kundt and Warburg|first=|date=1875|title=|url=|journal=Poppand Ann d Phys|volume=156|pages=177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1875) published thirty years earlier and the work of Smoluchowski&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smoluchowski|first=|date=1898|title=|url=|journal=Wiedem Ann d Phys|volume=64|pages=101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1898). In 1906 he described his "directly indicating vacuum gauge" that used a heated wire to measure vacuum by monitoring the heat transfer from the wire by the vacuum environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Structure==
The Pirani gauge consists of a metal sensor wire (usually [[gold]] plated [[tungsten]] or [[platinum]]) suspended in a tube which is connected to the system whose vacuum is to be measured. The connection is usually made either by a ground glass joint or a [[flange]]d metal connector, sealed with an [[o-ring]]. The sensor wire is connected to an electrical circuit from which, after calibration, a pressure reading may be taken.

==Mode of operation==
[[File:Blockbild-Pirani-Vakuumeter.png|thumb|500px|Block diagram of Pirani gauge]]
[[File:Nomogramm pirani-Vakuummeter.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Curves to convert air readings to other gases]]

In order to understand the technology, consider that in a gas filled system there are four ways that a heated wire transfers heat to its surroundings.

# Gas conduction at high pressure &lt;math&gt;E\propto dT/dr&lt;/math&gt; (r representing the distance from the heated wire)
# Gas transport as low pressure &lt;math&gt;E \propto P(T_1-T_0)/\surd T_0&lt;/math&gt;
# Thermal radiation &lt;math&gt;E \propto (T_1^4 - T_0^4)&lt;/math&gt;
# End losses through the support structures

A '''heated metal wire''' (sensor wire, or simply sensor) suspended in a gas will lose heat to the gas as its molecules collide with the wire and remove heat. If the gas pressure is reduced the number of molecules present will fall proportionately and the wire will lose heat more slowly. Measuring the heat loss is an indirect indication of pressure.

There are three possible schemes that can be done.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

# Keep the bridge voltage constant and measure the change in resistance as a function of pressure
# Keep the current constant and measure the change in resistance as a function of pressure
# Keep the temperature of the sensor wire constant and measure the voltage as a function of pressure

Note that keeping the temperature constant implies that the end losses(4.) and the thermal radiation loses (3.) are constant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The electrical resistance of a wire varies with its temperature, so the resistance indicates the temperature of wire. In many systems, the wire is maintained at a constant resistance ''R'' by controlling the voltage ''I'' through the wire. The resistance can be set using a bridge circuit.  The voltage required to achieve this balance is therefore a measure of the vacuum.

The gauge may be used for pressures between 0.5 [[Torr]] to 1×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. Below 5×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt; Torr, a Pirani gauge has only one significant digit of resolution. The thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the gas affects the readout from the meter, and therefore the apparatus may need calibrating before accurate readings are obtainable. For lower pressure measurement, the thermal conductivity of the gas becomes increasingly smaller and more difficult to measure accurately, and other instruments such as a [[Penning gauge]]  or [[Bayard Alpert gauge|Bayard-Alpert gauge]] are used instead.

==Pulsed Pirani gauge==
A special form of the Pirani gauge is the '''pulsed Pirani vacuum gauge''' where the sensor wire is not operated at a constant temperature, but is cyclically heated up to a certain temperature threshold by an increasing voltage ramp. When the threshold is reached, the heating voltage is switched off and the sensor cools down again. The required heat-up time is used as a measure of pressure.

For adequately low pressure the following relation for supplied heating power and sensor temperature ''T''(''t'') applies:&lt;ref name="H. Plöchinger, Patentschrift DE 10115715 A (30. März 2001)"&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last=Plöchinger |inventor-first=Heinz |country-code=DE |patent-number=10115715 |language=German |title=Sensor and Method for Detecting Measurement Variables and Physical Parameters |publication-date=2001-03-30 |issue-date=2002-10-17 |url= }}, also [http://www.thyracont.com/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=88&amp;lang=de description]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{el}} = C_1 \lambda_{\text{gas}}(T(t) - T_a) + C_2\lambda_{\text{fil}}(T(t) - T_a) + A_{\text{fil}} \epsilon \sigma(T(t)^4 - T^4_a) + c_{\text{fil}}m_{\text{fil}} \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_{\text{fil}}&lt;/math&gt; is the heating capacity of the sensor wire, &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{fil}}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the sensor wire and &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the pulsed gauge===
;Advantages
*Significantly better resolution in the range above 75 Torr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gepulstes Heißdraht-Vakuummeter mit Pirani-Sensor |journal=Vakuum in Forschung und Praxis |year=2004 |first=W. |last=Jitschin |first2=S. |last2=Ludwig |volume=16 |issue= |pages=23–29 |language=German |doi= 10.1002/vipr.200400015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The power consumption is drastically reduced compared to continuously operated Pirani gauges.
*The gauge's thermal influence on the real measurement is lowered considerably due to the low temperature threshold of 80&amp;nbsp;°C and the ramp heating in pulsed mode. 
*The pulsed mode can be efficiently implemented using modern microprocessors.

;Disadvantages
*Increased calibration effort
*Longer heat-up phase

==Alternative==
An alternative to the Pirani gauge is the [[Thermocouple#Thermocouple as vacuum gauge|thermocouple gauge]], which works on the same principle of detecting thermal conductivity of the gas by a change in temperature.  In the thermocouple gauge, the temperature is sensed by a [[thermocouple]] rather than by the change in resistance of the heated wire.

A '''power box''' (USA) or '''[https://www.powerandcables.com/product/feeder-pillars/ feeder pillar]''' (UK) is a cabinet for electrical equipment, mounted in the street and controlling the electrical supply to a number of houses in a [[neighborhood]]. A power box is simply a layman's term for a transformer, cutout enclosure, or other enclosure used in conjunction with underground electrical distribution. In the [[United States]], they are often painted [[olive drab]] (an olive-like green color), gray or "sand", a light tan color.

[[File:Salt pannes and pools high and low tide.gif|thumb|340px|'''Salt marsh''' during [[low tide]], mean low tide, [[high tide]] and very high tide ([[spring tide]]).]]
A '''salt marsh''' or '''saltmarsh''', also known as a coastal salt marsh or a [[tidal marsh]], is a coastal ecosystem in the upper [[coast]]al [[intertidal zone]] between land and open [[Seawater|saltwater]] or [[brackish water]] that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of [[halophyte|salt-tolerant]] plants such as [[herb]]s, [[Poaceae|grasses]], or low [[shrub]]s.&lt;ref name="adam"&gt;Adam, P (1990). Saltmarsh Ecology. Cambridge University Press. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woodroffe"&gt;Woodroffe, CD (2002). Coasts: form, process and evolution. Cambridge University Press. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt [[marsh]] in trapping and binding [[sediment]]s. Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic [[food web]] and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters. They also support terrestrial animals and provide [[coastal management|coastal protection]].&lt;ref name="woodroffe"/&gt;

==Basic information ==
[[File:HeathcoteRiverEstuarySaltmarsh.jpg|thumb|An [[Estuary|estuarine]] salt marsh along the [[Heathcote River]], [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]]]
[[File:Salt marsh.jpg|right|thumb|Salt marsh on [[Sapelo Island, Georgia|Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA]] ]]

Salt marshes occur on low-energy [[shore]]lines in [[Temperateness|temperate]] and [[Polar region|high-latitudes]]&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;Allen, JRL, Pye, K (1992). Saltmarshes: [[morphodynamics]], conservation, and engineering significance. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be stable, emerging, or submerging depending if the [[sedimentation]] is greater, equal to, or lower than relative sea level rise ([[subsidence]] rate plus sea level change), respectively. Commonly these shorelines consist of mud or sand flats (known also as [[tidal flats]] or abbreviated to [[mudflat]]s) which are nourished with [[sediment]] from inflowing rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;Chapman, V. J. (1974). Salt marshes and salt deserts of the world. Phyllis Claire Chapman, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; These typically include sheltered environments such as embankments, [[Estuary|estuaries]] and the leeward side of [[barrier island]]s and [[spit (landform)|spits]]. In the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics|sub-tropics]] they are replaced by [[mangrove]]s; an area that differs from a salt marsh in that instead of [[herbaceous plant]]s, they are dominated by salt-tolerant trees.&lt;ref name="adam"/&gt;

Most salt marshes have a low [[topography]] with low elevations but a vast wide area, making them hugely popular for human populations.&lt;ref name="bromberg"&gt;Bromberg-Gedan, K., Silliman, B. R., and Bertness, M. D. (2009). Centuries of human driven change in salt marsh ecosystems, ''Annual Review of Marine Science'', 1: 117-141.&lt;/ref&gt;
Salt marshes are located among different landforms based on their physical and geomorphological settings. Such marsh landforms include [[river delta|deltaic]] marshes, estuarine, back-barrier, open coast, embayments and [[ria|drowned-valley]] marshes. Deltaic marshes are associated with large [[river]]s where many occur in Southern [[Europe]] such as the [[Camargue]], [[France]] in the [[Rhone]] delta or the [[Ebro]] delta in [[Spain]]. They are also extensive within the rivers of the [[Mississippi Delta]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="woodroffe"/&gt; In [[New Zealand]], most salt marshes occur at the head of estuaries in areas where there is little wave action and high sedimentation.&lt;ref name="te ara"&gt;Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand (2005-2010). Plants of the Estuary. Retrieved 15 March 2010, from http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/estuaries/3&lt;/ref&gt; Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in [[Auckland]], the [[Manawatu-Wanganui Region|Manawatu]] Estuary, and the [[Avon Heathcote Estuary|Avon-Heathcote Estuary]] in [[Christchurch]]. Back-barrier marshes are sensitive to the reshaping of barriers in the landward side of which they have been formed.&lt;ref name="woodroffe"/&gt; They are common along much of the eastern coast of the [[United States]] and the [[Frisian Islands]]. Large, shallow coastal embayments can hold salt marshes with examples including [[Morecambe Bay]] and [[Portsmouth]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="woodroffe"/&gt;

Salt marshes are sometimes included in lagoons, and the difference is not very marked; the [[Venetian Lagoon]] in [[Italy]], for example, is made up of these sorts of animals and or living organisms belonging to this ecosystem. They have a big impact on the biodiversity of the area. Salt marsh ecology involves complex food webs which include primary producers (vascular plants, macroalgae, diatoms, epiphytes, and phytoplankton), primary consumers (zooplankton, macrozoa, molluscs, insects), and secondary consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Vernberg, F. J. 1993. Salt-Marsh Processes: A Review. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 12:2167–2195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The low physical energy and high grasses provide a refuge for animals. Many marine fish use salt marshes as nursery grounds for their young before they move to open waters. Birds may raise their young among the high grasses, because the marsh provides both sanctuary from predators and abundant food sources which include fish trapped in pools, insects, shellfish, and worms.&lt;ref name="Scott, D. B. 2014"&gt;Scott, D. B., J. Frail-Gauthier, and P. J. Mudie. 2014. Coastal wetlands of the world: geology, ecology, distribution and applications. Cambridge University PressNew York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worldwide occurrence ==
Saltmarshes across 99 countries (essentially worldwide) were mapped by Mcowen et al. 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcowen|first=Chris|last2=Weatherdon|first2=Lauren|last3=Bochove|first3=Jan-Willem|last4=Sullivan|first4=Emma|last5=Blyth|first5=Simon|last6=Zockler|first6=Christoph|last7=Stanwell-Smith|first7=Damon|last8=Kingston|first8=Naomi|last9=Martin|first9=Corinne|date=2017-03-21|title=A global map of saltmarshes|url=https://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=11764|journal=Biodiversity Data Journal|language=en|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e11764|doi=10.3897/bdj.5.e11764|pmid=28765720|pmc=5515097|issn=1314-2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 5,495,089 hectares of mapped saltmarsh across 43 countries and territories are represented in a Geographic Information Systems polygon shapefile. This estimate is at the relatively low end of previous estimates (2.2–40 Mha). The most extensive saltmarsh worldwide are found outside the tropics, notably including the low-lying, ice-free coasts, bays and estuaries of the North Atlantic which are well represented in their global polygon dataset.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Formation==
The formation begins as tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment [[accretion (coastal management)|accretion]], and subsequently the rate and duration of tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface.&lt;ref name="pethick"&gt;Pethick, J. (1984). An introduction to coastal geomorphology. Edward Arnold, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of [[propagules]] of [[pioneer species]] such as [[seed]]s or [[rhizome]] portions are combined with the development of suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation.&lt;ref name="boorman"/&gt; When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] rate reduces and [[suspended sediment]] settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide.&lt;ref name="chapman"/&gt; Mats of filamentous [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green algae]] can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact&lt;ref name="ginsburg"&gt;Ginsburg, R. N., and Lowenstam, H. A. (1958). The influence of marine bottom communities on the [[Deposition (geology)|depositional]] environment of sediments. ''The Journal of Geology'', 66: (3), 310-318.&lt;/ref&gt; which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments.&lt;ref name="aspden"&gt;Aspden, R. J., Vardy, S. and Paterson, D. M. (2004). Salt marsh microbial ecology: microbes, benthic mats and sediment movement. In Fagherazzi, S., Marani, M. and Blum, L. K. (Eds), ''The Ecogeomorphology of Tidal Marshes'' (pp. 115-136). American Geophysical Union, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Salicornia]] spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment.&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;Bird, E. (2008). Coastal geomorphology: an introduction. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, West Sussex, England.&lt;/ref&gt; Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of [[plant communities]] develops.&lt;ref name="pethick"/&gt;

==Tidal flooding and vegetation zonation==
[[File:Bride-Brook-Salt-Marsh-s.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coastal salt marsh in [[Connecticut]].]]
Coastal salt marshes can be distinguished from terrestrial habitats by the daily [[tide|tidal]] flow that occurs and continuously floods the area.&lt;ref name="adam"/&gt; It is an important process in delivering sediments, nutrients and plant water supply to the marsh.&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt; At higher elevations in the [[high marsh|upper marsh]] zone, there is much less tidal inflow, resulting in lower [[salinity]] levels.&lt;ref name="adam"/&gt; [[Soil salinity]] in the [[low marsh|lower marsh]] zone is fairly constant due to everyday annual tidal flow. However, in the upper marsh, variability in salinity is shown as a result of less frequent flooding and climate variations. Rainfall can reduce salinity and [[evapotranspiration]] can increase levels during dry periods.&lt;ref name="adam"/&gt; As a result, there are [[microhabitat]]s populated by different species of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] dependant on their physiological abilities. The flora of a salt marsh is differentiated into levels according to the plants' individual tolerance of salinity and water table levels. Vegetation found at the water must be able to survive high salt concentrations, periodical [[submersion (coastal management)|submersion]], and a certain amount of water movement, while plants further inland in the marsh can sometimes experience dry, low-nutrient conditions. It has been found that the upper marsh zones limit species through competition and the lack of habitat protection, while lower marsh zones are determined through the ability of plants to tolerate physiological stresses such as salinity, water submergence and low oxygen levels.&lt;ref name="bertness"&gt;Bertness, MD, Ewanchuk, PJ, Silliman, BR (2002). Anthropogenic modification of New England salt marsh landscapes. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''99(3):''' 1395-1398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;Rand, TA (2000). Seed Dispersal, Habitat Suitability and the Distribution of Halophytes across a Salt Marsh Tidal Gradient. ''Journal of Ecology'' '''88(4):''' 608-621.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Saltmarsh-Grass.JPG|thumb|High marsh in the [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] Salt Marsh Nature Center in [[Brooklyn]], New York]]
The [[New England]] salt marsh is subject to strong tidal influences and shows distinct patterns of zonation.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt; In low marsh areas with high tidal flooding, a monoculture of the smooth [[Spartina|cordgrass]], ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' dominate, then heading landwards, zones of the salt hay, ''[[Spartina patens]]'', black rush, ''[[Juncus gerardii]]'' and the shrub ''[[Iva frutescens]]'' are seen respectively.&lt;ref name="bertness"/&gt; These species all have different tolerances that make the different zones along the marsh best suited for each individual.

Plant species diversity is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most common salt marsh plants are [[glasswort]]s (''Salicornia'' spp.) and the cordgrass (''Spartina'' spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They are often the first plants to take hold in a [[mudflat]] and begin its [[ecological succession]] into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the main flow of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as [[limonium|sea lavenders]] (''Limonium'' spp.), [[plantago|plantains]] (''Plantago'' spp.), and varied [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] and [[Juncaceae|rushes]] grow once the mud has been vegetated by the [[pioneer species]].

Salt marshes are quite photosynthetically active and are extremely productive habitats. They serve as depositories for a large amount of organic matter and are full of decomposition, which feeds a broad food chain of organisms from bacteria to mammals. Many of the halophytic plants such as cordgrass are not grazed at all by higher animals but die off and decompose to become food for micro-organisms, which in turn become food for fish and birds.

==Sediment trapping, accretion, and the role of tidal creeks==
[[Image:BloodyMarsh2008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bloody Marsh]] in Georgia, USA]]

The factors and processes that influence the rate and spatial distribution of sediment accretion within the salt marsh are numerous. Sediment deposition can occur when marsh species provide a surface for the sediment to adhere to, followed by deposition onto the marsh surface when the sediment flakes off at low tide.&lt;ref name="pethick"/&gt; The amount of sediment adhering to salt marsh species is dependent on the type of marsh species, the proximity of the species to the sediment supply, the amount of plant biomass, and the elevation of the species.&lt;ref name="li"&gt;Li, H. and Yang, S. L. (2000). Trapping effect of tidal marsh vegetation on suspended sediment, Yangtze Delta. ''Journal of Coastal Research'', 25: (4), 915-924&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a study of the Eastern [[Chongming Island]] and [[Jiuduansha Island]] tidal marshes at the mouth of the [[Yangtze River]], China, the amount of sediment adhering to the species ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'', ''[[Phragmites australis]]'', and ''[[Scirpus]] mariqueter'' decreased with distance from the highest levels of suspended sediment concentrations (found at the marsh edge bordering tidal creeks or the mudflats); decreased with those species at the highest elevations, which experienced the lowest frequency and depth of tidal inundations; and increased with increasing plant biomass. ''Spartina alterniflora'', which had the most sediment adhering to it, may contribute &gt;10% of the total marsh surface sediment accretion by this process.&lt;ref name="li"/&gt;

Salt marsh species also facilitate sediment accretion by decreasing current velocities and encouraging sediment to settle out of suspension.&lt;ref name="pethick"/&gt; Current velocities can be reduced as the stems of tall marsh species induce hydraulic drag, with the effect of minimising re-suspension of sediment and encouraging deposition.&lt;ref name="shi"&gt;Shi, Z., Hamilton, L. J. and Wolanski, E. (2000). Near-bed currents and suspended sediment transport in saltmarsh canopies. ''Journal of Coastal Research'', 16: (3), 908-914.&lt;/ref&gt; Measured concentrations of suspended sediment in the water column have been shown to decrease from the open water or [[tidal creek]]s adjacent to the marsh edge, to the marsh interior,&lt;ref name="li"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reed"&gt;Reed, D.

Inundation and sediment deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by tidal creeks&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt; which are a common feature of salt marshes.&lt;ref name="chapman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pethick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;Wood, N. and Hine, A. C. (2007). Spatial trends in marsh sediment deposition within a microtidal creek system, Wacasassa Bay, Florida. ''Journal of Coastal Research'', 23: (4), 823-833.&lt;/ref&gt; Their typically dendritic and [[meander]]ing forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, as well as to drain water,&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt; and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than salt marsh bordering open ocean.&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt; Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular trace metals, and can thus tidal creeks can affect metal distributions and concentrations in salt marshes, in turn affecting the biota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Si|last2=Torres|first2=Raymond|date=2012-03-21|title=Effects of Geomorphology on the Distribution of Metal Abundance in Salt Marsh Sediment|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1018–1027|doi=10.1007/s12237-012-9494-y|issn=1559-2723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes do not however require tidal creeks to facilitate sediment flux over their surface&lt;ref name="shi"/&gt; although salt marshes with this morphology seem to be rarely studied.

The elevation of marsh species is important; those species at lower elevations experience longer and more frequent tidal floods and therefore have the opportunity for more sediment deposition to occur.&lt;ref name="li"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cahoon"&gt;Cahoon, D. R., White, D. A. and Lynch, J. C. (2011). Sediment infilling and wetland formation dynamics in an active crevasse splay of the Mississippi River delta. ''Geomorphology'', 131: 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Species at higher elevations can benefit from a greater chance of inundation at the highest tides when increased water depths and marsh surface flows can penetrate into the marsh interior.&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt;

==Human impacts==
[[File:Spartina alterniflora.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' (Saltmarsh Cordgrass). Native to the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]] of the United States. Considered a noxious weed in the [[Pacific Northwest]]]] 
The coast is a highly attractive natural feature to humans through its beauty, resources, and accessibility. As of 2002, over half of the world's population was estimated to being living within 60&amp;nbsp;km of the coastal shoreline,&lt;ref name="woodroffe"/&gt; making coastlines highly vulnerable to human impacts from daily activities that put pressure on these surrounding natural environments. In the past, salt marshes were perceived as coastal 'wastelands,' causing considerable loss and change of these [[ecosystem]]s through [[land reclamation]] for [[agriculture]], [[Urban Planning|urban development]], [[Salt evaporation pond|salt production]] and [[recreation]].&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hinde"&gt;Hinde, HP (1954). The Vertical Distribution of Salt Marsh Phanerogams in Relation to Tide Levels. ''Ecological Monographs'' '''24(2):''' 209-225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, SE, Lester, JN (1995). The Value of Salt Marsh as a Sea Defence. ''Marine Pollution Bulletin'' '''30(3):''' 180-189.&lt;/ref&gt; The indirect effects of human activities such as [[eutrophication|nitrogen loading]] also play a major role in the salt marsh area. Salt marshes can suffer from [[Salt marsh dieback|dieback]] in the high marsh and [[salt marsh die-off|die-off]] in the low marsh.

===Land reclamation===
Reclamation of land for agriculture by converting marshland to upland was historically a common practice.&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt; [[Levee|Dikes]] were often built to allow for this shift in land change and to provide flood protection further inland. In recent times intertidal flats have also been reclaimed.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;Long, S. P. and Mason, C. F. (1983). Saltmarsh ecology. Blackie &amp; Son Ltd, Glasgow.&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, [[livestock]] such as sheep and cattle grazed on the highly fertile salt marsh land.&lt;ref name="adam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andresen"&gt;Andresen, H, Bakker, JP, Brongers, M, Heydemann, B, Irmler, U (1990). Long-term changes to salt marsh communities by cattle grazing. ''Vegetatio'' '''89:''' 137-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Land reclamation for agriculture has resulted in many changes such as shifts in vegetation structure, sedimentation, salinity, water flow, [[biodiversity loss]] and high nutrient inputs. There have been many attempts made to eradicate these problems for example, in New Zealand, the cordgrass ''[[Spartina anglica]]'' was introduced from England into the [[Manawatu River]] mouth in 1913 to try and reclaim the estuary land for farming.&lt;ref name="te ara"/&gt; A shift in structure from bare tidal flat to pastureland resulted from increased sedimentation and the cordgrass extended out into other estuaries around New Zealand. Native plants and animals struggled to survive as non-natives out competed them. Efforts are now being made to remove these cordgrass species, as the damages are slowly being recognized.

In the [[River Blyth, Suffolk|Blyth estuary]] in [[Suffolk]] in eastern England, the mid-estuary reclamations (Angel and Bulcamp marshes) that were abandoned in the 1940s have been replaced by tidal flats with compacted soils from agricultural use overlain with a thin veneer of mud. Little vegetation colonisation has occurred in the last 60–75 years and has been attributed to a combination of surface elevations too low for pioneer species to develop, and poor drainage from the compacted agricultural soils acting as an aquaclude.&lt;ref name="french"&gt;French, J. R. and Burningham, H. (2003). Tidal marsh sedimentation versus sea-level rise: a southeast England estuarine perspective, ''Proceedings Coastal Sediments'', 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial soils of this nature need to adjust from fresh to saline interstitial water by a change in the chemistry and the structure of the soil, accompanied with fresh deposition of estuarine sediment, before salt marsh vegetation can establish.&lt;ref name="boorman"&gt;Boorman, L., Hazelden, J., and Boorman, M. (2002). New salt marshes for old – salt marsh creation and management. ''The Changing Coast'', EUROCAST/EUCC, EUROCOAST Littoral 2002: Porto, Portugal; 35-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation structure, species richness, and plant community composition of salt marshes naturally regenerated on reclaimed agricultural land can be compared to adjacent reference salt marshes to assess the success of marsh regeneration.&lt;ref name="angus"&gt;Angus, G. and Wolters, M. (2008). The natural regeneration of salt marsh on formerly reclaimed land. ''Applied Vegetation Science'', 11: 335-344.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upstream agriculture===
Cultivation of land upstream from the salt marsh can introduce increased silt inputs and raise the rate of primary sediment accretion on the tidal flats, so that pioneer species can spread further onto the flats and grow rapidly upwards out of the level of tidal inundation. As a result, marsh surfaces in this regime may have an extensive cliff at their seaward edge.&lt;ref name="ranwell"&gt;Ranwell, D. S. (1972). Ecology of salt marshes and sand dunes. Chapman and Hall Ltd, London.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Plum Island estuary, Massachusetts (U.S.A), stratigraphic cores revealed that during the 18th and 19th century the marsh prograded over subtidal and mudflat environments to increase in area from 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 9&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; after European settlers deforested the land uptream and increased the rate of sediment supply.&lt;ref name="kirwan"&gt;Kirwan, M. L., Murray, A. B., Donnelly, J. P. and Corbett, D. (2011). Rapid wetland expansion during European settlement and its implication for marsh survival under modern sediment delivery rates. ''Geological Society of America'', 39: (5), 507–510.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban development and nitrogen loading===
[[File:Chaetomorpha linum-salt marsh algae.jpg|thumb|''[[Chaetomorpha|Chaetomorpha linum]]'' is a common [[marine algae]] found in the salt marsh.]]
The conversion of marshland to upland for agriculture has in the past century been overshadowed by conversion for urban development. Coastal cities worldwide have encroached onto former salt marshes and in the U.S. the growth of cities looked to salt marshes for waste disposal sites. Estuarine pollution from organic, inorganic, and toxic substances from urban development or industrialisation is a worldwide problem&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; and the sediment in salt marshes may entrain this pollution with toxic effects on floral and faunal species.&lt;ref name="ranwell"/&gt; Urban development of salt marshes has slowed since about 1970 owing to growing awareness by environmental groups that they provide beneficial ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt; They are highly productive [[ecosystem]]s, and when net productivity is measured in g m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; they are equalled only by tropical rainforests.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Additionally, they can help reduce wave erosion on sea walls designed to protect low-lying areas of land from wave erosion.&lt;ref name="boorman"/&gt;

De-naturalisation of the landward boundaries of salt marshes from urban or industrial enchroachment can have negative effects. In the Avon-Heathcote estuary/Ihutai, New Zealand, species abundance and the physical properties of the surrounding margins were strongly linked, and the majority of salt marsh was found to be living along areas with natural margins in the Avon and Heathcote river outlets; conversely, artificial margins contained little marsh vegetation and restricted landward retreat.&lt;ref name="jupp"&gt;Jupp, K. (2007). Establishing a physical and biological basis for salt marsh restoration and management in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary. Christchurch, University of Canterbury.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining marshes surrounding these urban areas are also under immense pressure from the human population as human-induced nitrogen enrichment enters these habitats. Nitrogen loading through human-use indirectly affects salt marshes causing shifts in vegetation structure and the invasion of non-native species.&lt;ref name="bertness"/&gt;

Human impacts such as sewage, urban run-off, agricultural and industrial wastes are running into the marshes from nearby sources. Salt marshes are nitrogen limited&lt;ref name="bertness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="langis"&gt;Langis, R, Zalejko, M, Zedler, JB (1991). Nitrogen Assessments in a Constructed and a Natural Salt Marsh of San Diego Bay. ''Ecological Applications'' '''1(1):''' 40-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and with an increasing level of nutrients entering the system from anthropogenic effects, the plant species associated with salt marshes are being restructured through change in competition.&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt; For example, the New England salt marsh is experiencing a shift in vegetation structure where ''S. alterniflora'' is spreading from the lower marsh where it predominately resides up into the upper marsh zone.&lt;ref name="bertness"/&gt; Additionally, in the same marshes, the reed ''[[phragmites|Phragmites australis]]'' has been invading the area expanding to lower marshes and becoming a dominant species. ''P. australis'' is an aggressive halophyte that can invade disturbed areas in large numbers outcompeting native plants.&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;Chambers, RM, Meyerson, LA, Saltonstall, K (1999). Expansion of Phragmites australis into tidal wetlands of North America. ''Aquatic Botany'' '''64:''' 261-273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;Warren, RS, Fell, PE, Rozsa, R, Brawley, AH, Orsted, AC, Olson, ET, Swamy, V, Niering, WA (2002). Salt Marsh Restoration in Connecticut: 20 years of Science and Management. ''Restoration Ecology'' '''10(3):''' 497-513.&lt;/ref&gt; This loss in biodiversity is not only seen in flora assemblages but also in many animals such as insects and birds as their habitat and food resources are altered.

===Sea level rise===
Due to the [[Arctic sea ice decline|melting of Arctic sea ice]] and thermal expansion of the oceans, as a result of global warming, sea levels have begun to rise. As with all coastlines, this rise in water levels are predicted to negatively affect salt marshes, by flooding and eroding them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valiela |first1=Ivan |last2=Lloret |first2=Javier |last3=Bowyer |first3=Tynan |last4=Miner |first4=Simon |last5=Remsen |first5=David |last6=Elmstrom |first6=Elizabeth |last7=Cogswell |first7=Charlotte |last8=Robert Thieler |first8=E. |title=Transient coastal landscapes: Rising sea level threatens salt marshes |journal=Science of the Total Environment |date=November 2018 |volume=640-641 |pages=1148–1156 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.235 |pmid=30021280 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718318862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott, D. B. 2014"/&gt; The sea level rise causes more open water zones within the salt marsh. These zones cause erosion along their edges, further eroding the marsh into open water until the whole marsh disintegrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganju|first=Neil K.|last2=Defne|first2=Zafer|last3=Kirwan|first3=Matthew L.|last4=Fagherazzi|first4=Sergio|last5=D’Alpaos|first5=Andrea|last6=Carniello|first6=Luca|date=2017-01-23|title=Spatially integrative metrics reveal hidden vulnerability of microtidal salt marshes|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=8|pages=14156|doi=10.1038/ncomms14156|issn=2041-1723|pmc=5264011|pmid=28112167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While salt marshes are susceptible to threats concerning sea level rise, they are also an extremely dynamic coastal ecosystem. Salt marshes may in fact have the capability to keep pace with a rising sea level, by 2100, mean sea level could see increases between 0.6m to 1.1m.&lt;ref name=Best2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Best |first1=U.S.N. |last2=Van der Wegen |first2=M. |last3=Dijkstra |first3=J. |last4=Willemsen |first4=P.W.J.M. |last5=Borsje |first5=B.W. |last6=Roelvink |first6=D.J.A. |title=Do salt marshes survive sea level rise? Modelling wave action, morphodynamics and vegetation dynamics |journal=Elsevier |date=2018 |volume=109 |issue=2018 |page=152–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshes are susceptible to both erosion and accretion, which play a role in a what is called a bio-geomorphic feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouma |first1=T.J. |last2=Van Belzen |first2=J. |last3=Balke |first3=T. |last4=van Dalen |first4=J. |last5=Klaassen |first5=P. |last6=Hartog |first6=A.M. |last7=Callaghan |first7=D.P. |last8=Hu |first8=Z. |last9=Stive |first9=M.J.F. |last10=Temmerman |first10=S. |last11=Herman |first11=P.M.J. |title=Short-term mudflat dynamics drive long-term cyclic salt marsh dynamics |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |date=2016 |volume=61 |issue=2016 |page=2261–2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marsh vegetation captures sediment to stay in the system which in turn allows for the plants to grow better and thus the plants are better at trapping sediment and accumulate more organic matter. This positive feedback loop potentially allows for salt marsh bed level rates to keep pace with rising sea level rates.&lt;ref name=Best2018/&gt; However, this feedback is also dependent on other factors like productivity of the vegetation, sediment supply, land subsidence, biomass accumulation, and magnitude and frequency of storms.&lt;ref name=Best2018/&gt; In a study published by U.S.N. Best in 2018,&lt;ref name=Best2018/&gt; they found that bioaccumulation was the number one factor in a salt marsh’s ability to keep up with SLR rates. The salt marsh’s resilience depends upon its increase in bed level rate being greater than that of sea levels increasing rate, otherwise the marsh will be overtaken and drowned. 

Biomass accumulation can be measured in the form of above-ground organic biomass accumulation, and below-ground inorganic accumulation by means of sediment trapping and sediment settling from suspension.&lt;ref name=Li2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=R. |last2=Yu |first2=Q. |last3=Wang |first3=Y. |last4=Wang |first4=Z.B. |last5=Gao |first5=S. |last6=Flemming |first6=B. |title=The relationship between inundation duration and Spartina alterniflora growth along the Jiangsu coast, China |journal=Elsevier |date=2018 |volume=213 |issue=2018 |page=305–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marsh vegetation helps to increase sediment settling because it slows current velocities, disrupts turbulent eddies, and helps to dissipate wave energy. Marsh plant species are known for the tolerance of increased salt exposure due to the common inundation of marshlands. These types of plants are called halophytes. Halophytes are a crucial part of salt marsh biodiversity and their potential to adjust to elevated sea levels. With elevated sea levels, salt marsh vegetation would likely be more exposed to more frequent inundation rates and they must be adaptable or tolerant of the consequential increased salinity levels and anaerobic conditions. There is a common elevation (above the sea level) limit for these plants to survive, where anywhere below the optimal line would lead to anoxic soils due to constant submergence and too high above this line would mean harmful soil salinity levels due to the high rate of evapotranspiration as a result of decreased submergence.&lt;ref name=Li2018/&gt;
Along with the vertical accretion of sediment and biomass, the accommodation space for marsh land growth must also be considered. Accommodation space is the land available for additional sediments to accumulate and marsh vegetation to colonize laterally. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuerch |first1=M. |last2=Spencer |first2=T. |last3=Temmerman |first3=S. |last4=Kirwan |first4=M.L. |last5=Wolff |first5=C. |last6=Lincke |first6=D. |last7=McOwen |first7=C.J. |last8=Pickering |first8=M.D. |last9=Reef |first9=R. |last10=Vafeidis |first10=A.T. |last11=Hinkel |first11=J. |last12=Nicholla |first12=R.J. |last13=Brown |first13=S. |title=Future response of global coastal wetlands to sea-level rise |journal=Nature |date=2018 |volume=561 |page=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lateral accommodation space is often limited by anthropogenic structures such as coastal roads, sea walls, and other forms of development of coastal lands. A study by Lisa M. Schile, published in 2014, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schile |first1=L.M. |last2=Callaway |first2=J.C. |last3=Morris |first3=J.T. |last4=Stralberg |first4=D. |last5=Parker |first5=V.T. |last6=Kelly |first6=M. |title=Evaluating the Role of Vegetation, Sediment, and Upland Habitat in Marsh Resiliency |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=e88760}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that across a range of sea level rise rates, marshlands with high plant productivity were resistant against sea level rises but all reached a pinnacle point where accommodation space was necessary for continued survival. The presence of accommodation space allows for new mid/high habitat to form, and for marshes to escape complete inundation.

===Mosquito control===
Earlier in the 20th century, it was believed that draining salt marshes would help reduce [[mosquito]] populations. In many locations, particularly in the northeastern United States, residents and local and state agencies dug straight-lined [[ditches]] deep into the marsh flats. The end result, however, was a depletion of [[killifish]] habitat. The killifish is a mosquito [[Predation|predator]], so the loss of habitat actually led to higher mosquito populations, and adversely affected [[wading bird]]s that preyed on the killifish. These ditches can still be seen, despite some efforts to refill the ditches.&lt;ref&gt;Rhode Island Habitat Restoration, University of Rhode Island: http://www.edc.uri.edu/restoration/html/intro/salt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crab herbivory and bioturbation==
[[File:Tunnelling mud crab.jpg|thumb|left| The tunnelling mud crab ''[[Helice crassa]]'' of [[New Zealand]] fills a special [[Ecological niche|niche]] in the salt marsh [[ecosystem]].]]
Increased nitrogen uptake by marsh species into their leaves can prompt greater rates of length-specific leaf growth, and increase the [[herbivory]] rates of crabs. The burrowing crab ''[[Neohelice granulata]]'' frequents SW Atlantic salt marshes where high density populations can be found among populations of the marsh species ''[[Spartina densiflora]]'' and ''[[Sarcocornia]] perennis''. In [[Mar Chiquita|Mar Chiquita lagoon]], north of [[Mar del Plata]], [[Argentina]], ''Neohelice granulata'' herbivory increased as a likely response to the increased nutrient value of the leaves of fertilised ''Spartina densiflora'' plots, compared to non-fertilised plots. Regardless of whether the plots were fertilised or not, grazing by ''Neohelice granulata'' also reduced the length specific leaf growth rates of the leaves in summer, while increasing their length-specific [[senescence]] rates. This may have been assisted by the increased fungal effectiveness on the wounds left by the crabs.&lt;ref name="alberti"&gt;Alberti, J., Cebrian, J., Casariego, A. M., Canepuccia, A., Escapa, M. and Iribarne, O. (2011). Effects of nutrient enrichment and crab herbivory on a SW Atlantic salt marsh productivity. ''Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology'', 405: 99-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salt marshes of [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts (U.S.A), are experiencing creek bank die-offs of ''Spartina'' spp. (cordgrass) that has been attributed to herbivory by the crab ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]''. At 12 surveyed Cape Cod salt marsh sites, 10% - 90% of creek banks experienced die-off of cordgrass in association with a highly [[Denudation|denuded]] substrate and high density of crab burrows. Populations of ''Sesarma reticulatum'' are increasing, possibly as a result of the degradation of the coastal food web in the region.&lt;ref name="holdredge"&gt;Holdredge, C., Bertness, M. D. and Altieri, A. H. (2008). Role of crab herbivory in die-off of New England salt marshes. ''Conservation Biology'', 23: (3), 672-679.&lt;/ref&gt; The bare areas left by the intense grazing of cordgrass by ''Sesarma reticulatum'' at Cape Cod are suitable for occupation by another burrowing crab, ''[[Uca pugnax]]'', which are not known to consume live macrophytes. The intense [[bioturbation]] of salt marsh sediments from this crab's burrowing activity has been shown to dramatically reduce the success of ''Spartina alterniflora'' and ''[[Suaeda]] maritima'' seed germination and established seedling survival, either by burial or exposure of seeds, or uprooting or burial of established seedlings.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, S. M. and Tyrrell, M. C. (2012). Effects of mud fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax) on the recruitment of halophyte seedlings in salt marsh dieback areas of Cape Cod (Massachusetts, USA). ''Ecological Research'', 27: 233-237.&lt;/ref&gt; However, bioturbation by crabs may also have a positive effect. In New Zealand, the tunnelling mud crab ''[[Helice crassa]]'' has been given the stately name of an 'ecosystem engineer' for its ability to construct new habitats and alter the access of nutrients to other species. Their burrows provide an avenue for the transport of dissolved oxygen in the burrow water through the oxic sediment of the burrow walls and into the surrounding [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] sediment, which creates the perfect habitat for special nitrogen cycling bacteria. These nitrate reducing (denitrifying) bacteria quickly consume the dissolved oxygen entering into the burrow walls to create the oxic mud layer that is thinner than that at the mud surface. This allows a more direct diffusion path for the export of nitrogen (in the form of gaseous nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) into the flushing tidal water.&lt;ref name="vopel"&gt;Vopel, K. and Hancock, N. (2005). Marine ecosystems: more than just a crab hole. ''Water &amp; Atmosphere'', 13: (3), 18-19. Retrieved from: http://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/default/files/import/attachments/crab.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration and management==
[[File:Salicornia.jpg|thumb|200px|Glasswort (''[[Salicornia]] spp.'') a species [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[high marsh]] zone.]]
The perception of bay salt marshes as a coastal 'wasteland' has since changed, acknowledging that they are one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling [[tropical rainforest]]s. Salt marshes are ecologically important providing habitats for native migratory fish and acting as sheltered feeding and nursery grounds.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; They are now protected by legislation in many countries to look after these ecologically important habitats.&lt;ref name="broome"&gt;Broome, SW, Seneca, ED, Woodhouse, WW (1988). Tidal Marsh Restoration. ''Aquatic Botany'' '''32:''' 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded to a high level of protection by the [[Clean Water Act]] and the [[Habitats Directive]] respectively. With the impacts of this habitat and its importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes, through [[managed retreat]] or the reclamation of land has been established. However, many [[Asia]]n countries such as [[China]] are still to recognise the value of marshlands. With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed.&lt;ref name="bromberg"/&gt;

Bakker et al. (1997)&lt;ref name="bakker"&gt;Bakker, JP, Esselink, P, Van Der Wal, R, Dijkema, KS (1997). 'Options for restoration and management of coastal salt marshes in Europe,' in Urbanska, KM, Webb, NR, Edwards, PJ (eds), Restoration Ecology and Sustainable Development. Cambridge University Press, UK. p. 286-322.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests two options available for restoring salt marshes. The first is to abandon all human interference and leave the salt marsh to complete its natural development. These types of restoration projects are often unsuccessful as vegetation tends to struggle to revert to its original structure and the natural tidal cycles are shifted due to land changes. The second option suggested by Bakker et al. (1997)&lt;ref name="bakker"/&gt; is to restore the destroyed habitat into its natural state either at the original site or as a replacement at a different site. Under natural conditions, recovery can take 2–10 years or even longer depending on the nature and degree of the disturbance and the relative maturity of the marsh involved.&lt;ref name="broome"/&gt; Marshes in their pioneer stages of development will recover more rapidly than mature marshes&lt;ref name="broome"/&gt; as they are often first to colonize the land. It is important to note, that restoration can often be sped up through the replanting of native vegetation.
[[File:Phragmites australis Schilfrohr.jpg|thumb|Common reed (''[[Phragmites australis]]'') an invasive species in degraded marshes in the northeastern United States.]]
This last approach is often the most practiced and generally more successful than allowing the area to naturally recover on its own. The salt marshes in the state of Connecticut in the United States have long been an area lost to fill and dredging. As of 1969, the Tidal Wetland Act was introduced that ceased this practice,&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt; but despite the introduction of the act, the system was still degrading due to alterations in tidal flow. One area in Connecticut is the marshes on Barn Island. These marshes were diked then impounded with salt and brackish marsh during 1946-1966.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt; As a result, the marsh shifted to a freshwater state and became dominated by the invasive species ''P. australis'', ''[[Typha angustifolia]]'' and ''[[Typha latifolia|T. latifolia]]'' that have little ecological connection to the area.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt;

By 1980, a restoration programme was put in place that has now been running for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt; This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning tidal flow along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, declines in the invasive species have initiated, re-establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. Times in marsh recovery can depend on the development stage of the marsh; type and extent of the disturbance; geographical location; and the environmental and physiological stress factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna.

Although much effort has gone into restoring salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species.&lt;ref name="broome"/&gt; Once we have a better understanding of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts that can be used to preserve our valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.

While humans are situated along coastlines, there will always be the possibility of human-induced disturbances despite the number of restoration efforts we plan to implement. Dredging, pipelines for offshore petroleum resources, highway construction, accidental toxic spills or just plain carelessness are examples that will for some time now and into the future be the major influences of salt marsh degradation.&lt;ref name="broome"/&gt;

In addition to restoring and managing salt marsh systems based on scientific principles, the opportunity should be taken to educate public audiences of their importance biologically and their purpose as serving as a natural buffer for flood protection.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; Because salt marshes are often located next to urban areas, they are likely to receive more visitors than remote [[wetland]]s. By physically seeing the marsh, people are more likely to take notice and be more aware of the environment around them. An example of public involvement occurred at the [[Famosa Slough State Marine Conservation Area]] in [[San Diego]], where a "friends" group worked for over a decade in trying to prevent the area from being developed.&lt;ref name="callaway"&gt;Callaway, JC, Zedler, JB (2004). Restoration of urban salt marshes: Lessons from southern California. ''Urban Ecosystems'' '''7:''' 107-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the 5 hectare site was bought by the City and the group worked together to restore the area. The project involved removing invasive species and replanting with natives, along with public talks to other locals, frequent bird walks and clean-up events.&lt;ref name="callaway"/&gt;

==Research methods==
There is a diverse range and combination of methodologies employed to understand the hydrological dynamics in salt marshes and their ability to trap and accrete sediment. [[Sediment trap]]s are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment.&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "wood"/&gt; For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with [[marker horizon]] plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as [[feldspar]] that is buried at a known depth within [[wetland]] substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods.&lt;ref name="cahoon" /&gt; In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water.&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt; Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the [[turbidity]] of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two.&lt;ref name="li"/&gt; Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a [[stadia rod]] and transit,&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt; electronic [[theodolite]],&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt; Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System,&lt;ref name="li"/&gt; [[laser level]]&lt;ref name="cahoon"/&gt; or electronic distance meter ([[total station]]). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a [[pressure transducer]],&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cahoon"/&gt; or with a marked wooden stake,&lt;ref name="shi"/&gt; and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.&lt;ref name="shi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13407">'''Soil texture''' is a [[soil classification|classification]] instrument used both in the field and laboratory to determine soil classes based on their physical texture. Soil texture can be determined using qualitative methods such as texture by feel, and quantitative methods such as the hydrometer method.  Soil texture has agricultural applications such as determining crop suitability and to predict the response of the soil to environmental and management conditions such as [[drought]] or [[calcium]] (lime) requirements. Soil texture focuses on the particles that are less than two millimeters in diameter which include sand, silt, and clay.  The [[USDA soil taxonomy]] and [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources|WRB]] soil classification systems use 12 textural classes whereas the [[ADAS (company)|UK-ADAS]] system uses 11.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Soil Science Division Staff. 2017. Soil survey manual. C. Ditzler, K. Scheffe, and H.C. Monger (eds.). USDA Handbook 18. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;  These classifications are based on the percentages of sand, silt, and clay in the soil..

==Soil texture classification==

[[Image:SoilTextureTriangle.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Soil texture triangle, showing the 12 major textural classes, and particle size scales as defined by the USDA.]]

In the United States, twelve major soil texture classifications are defined by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The twelve classifications are sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silt, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and clay.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/nedc/training/soil/?cid=nrcs142p2_054262|title=Soil survey manual|last1=Soil Survey Division Staff|date=1993|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|pages=63–65|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soil textures are classified by the fractions of each soil separate (sand, silt, and clay) present in a soil.  Classifications are typically named for the primary constituent particle size or a combination of the most abundant particles sizes, e.g. "sandy clay" or "silty clay".  A fourth term, [[loam]], is used to describe equal properties of sand, silt, and clay in a soil sample, and lends to the naming of even more classifications, e.g. "clay loam" or "silt loam".

Determining soil texture is often aided with the use of a soil texture triangle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An example of a soil triangle is found on the right side of the page.  One side of the triangle represents percent sand, the second side represents percent clay, and the third side represents percent silt.  If you know the percentages of sand, clay, and silt in your soil sample, the triangle can be used to determine which of the twelve soil types you have.  To do this, find your percentage of sand along the bottom of the triangle.  Then follow the slanted line up to the left until you reach your percentage of clay.  Where that point is will tell you what soil type you have.  For example, if your soil is 70 percent sand and 10 percent clay then your soil is classified as a sandy loam.  The same method can be used starting on any side of the soil triangle.  If the texture by feel method was used to determine which type of soil you had, the triangle can also provide a rough estimate on the percentages of sand, silt, and clay in your soil.

Chemical and physical properties of a soil are related to texture. Particle size and distribution will affect a soil's capacity for holding water and nutrients. Fine textured soils generally have a higher capacity for water retention, whereas sandy soils contain large pore spaces that allow leaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Know Soil Know Life: Physical Properties of Soil and Soil Formation|last=Lindbo, Hayes, Adewunmi|publisher=Soil Science Society of America|year=2012|isbn=9780891189541|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soil separates ==

[[File:Particle size classifications used by different countries.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Particle size classifications used by different countries, diameters in μm]]

Soil separates are specific ranges of particle sizes. The smallest particles are ''clay'' particles and are classified as having diameters of less than 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm. Clay particles are plate-shaped instead of spherical, allowing for an increased specific surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Soil Science 8th Edition|last=Foth|first=Henry D.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1990|isbn=0-471-52279-1|location=Canada|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next smallest particles are ''silt'' particles and have diameters between 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm  (in [[USDA soil taxonomy]]). The largest particles are ''sand'' particles and are larger than 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.  Furthermore, large sand particles can be described as ''coarse'', intermediate as ''medium'', and the smaller as ''fine''.  Other countries have their own particle size classifications.

== Methods to Determine Soil Texture ==

===Texture by feel===
[[File:Texture by Feel.png|thumb|Texture by feel flow chart]]
Hand analysis is a simple and effective means to rapidly assess and classify a soil's physical condition. Correctly executed, the procedure allows for rapid and frequent assessment of soil characteristics with little or no equipment. It is thus an extremely useful tool for identifying spatial variation both within and between fields as well as identifying progressive changes and boundaries between soil map units (soil series). Texture by feel is a qualitative method, it does not provide exact values of sand, silt, and clay. Although qualitative, the texture by feel flowchart can be an accurate way for a scientist or interested individual to analyze the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndhealth.gov/wq/sw/z1_nps/pdf_files/soil_texture_feel_test.pdf|title=Determining Soil Texture by the "Feel Method"|last=Thien|first=Steven|date=|website=NDHealth.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The texture by feel method involves taking a small sample of soil and making a ribbon. A ribbon can be made by taking a ball of soil and pushing the soil between your thumb and forefinger, squeezing it upward into a ribbon. Allow the ribbon to emerge and extend over the forefinger, breaking from its own weight. Measuring the length of the ribbon can help determine the amount of clay in the sample. After making a ribbon, excessively wet a small pinch of soil in the palm of your hand and rub in with your forefinger to determine the amount of sand in the sample. Soils that have a high percentage of sand, such as sandy loam, or sandy clay, have a gritty texture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Soils that have a high percentage of silt, such as silty loam or silty clay, feel smooth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Soils that have a high percentage of clay, such as clay loam, have a sticky feel.  Although the texture by feel method takes practice, it is a useful way to determine soil texture, especially in the field.

=== Hydrometer Method ===
The hydrometer method of determining soil texture is a qualitative measurement providing estimates of the percent sand, clay, and silt in the soil.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bouyoucos, George. 1936. Directions for making mechanical analysis of soils by the hydrometer method. Soil Science. Vol 42 Issue 3: pp 225-230&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrometer method was developed in 1927&lt;ref&gt;Bouyoucos G. 1951. A recalibration of the hydrometer method for making mechanical analysis of soils. American Society of Agronomy.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still widely used today. This method requires a chemical compound, [[Sodium hexametaphosphate|sodium hexametaphsophate]], which acts as a dispersing agent to separate soil aggregates. The soil is mixed with the sodium hexametaphosphate solution on an orbital shaker overnight. The solution is transferred to one liter graduated cylinders and filled with water. The soil solution is mixed with a metal plunger to disperse the soil particles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The soil particles separate based on size and sink to the bottom. Sand particles are the largest (2.00 - 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm) and sink to the bottom of the cylinder first. Silt particles are the medium-sized (0.05 - 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm) and sink to the bottom of the cylinder after the sand. Clay particles are the smallest (&lt;0.002&amp;nbsp;mm) and separate out above the silt layer.  Measurements are taken using a [[Hydrometer|soil hydrometer.]] A soil hydrometer measures that relative density of liquids (density of a liquid to the density of water). The hydrometer is lowered into the cylinder containing the soil mixture at different times, forty-five seconds to measure sand content, one and a half hours to measure silt content and between six and twenty-four hours (depending on the protocol used) to measure clay. The number on the hydrometer that is visible (above the soil solution) is recorded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A blank (containing only water and the dispersing agent) is used to calibrate the hydrometer.

The values recorded from the readings are used to calculate the percent clay, silt and sand.  The blank is subtracted from each of the three readings. The calculations are as follows:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Percent silt = ( dried mass of soil - (sand hydrometer reading - blank reading) / (dried mass of soil) *100

Percent clay = (clay hydrometer reading - blank reading) / (dried mass of soil) *100

Percent sand = 100 - (percent clay + percent silt)

=== Additional Methods ===
There are several additional quantitative methods to determine soil texture.  Some examples of these methods are the pipette method, the particulate organic matter (POM) method, and the rapid method&lt;ref&gt;Kettler, T., Doran, J., Gilbert, T., 2001.  Simplified method for soil particle-size determination to accompany soil-quality analyses.  Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 65:849-853&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of classification==
The first classification, the International system, was first proposed by [[Albert Atterberg]] (1905), and was based on his studies in southern Sweden. Atterberg chose 20&amp;nbsp;μm for the upper limit of silt fraction because particles smaller than that size were not visible to the naked eye, the suspension could be coagulated by salts, [[Capillary action|capillary rise]] within 24 hours was most rapid in this fraction, and the pores between compacted particles were so small as to prevent the entry of root hairs.&lt;ref&gt;Atterberg A (1905) Die rationalle Klassifikation der Sande und Kiese. Chemiker Zeitung 29, 195-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Commission One of the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS) recommended its use at the first International Congress of Soil Science in Washington in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Davis ROE, Bennett HH (1927) "Grouping of soils on the basis of mechanical analysis." United States Department of Agriculture Departmental Circulation No. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia adopted this system and according to Marshall (1947) its equal logarithmic intervals are an attractive feature worth maintaining.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall TJ (1947) "Mechanical composition of soil in relation to field descriptions of texture." Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Bulletin No. 224, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA adopted its own system in 1938, and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] used the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] system in the FAO-UNESCO world soil map and recommended its use.

The '''Stark effect''' is the shifting and splitting of [[spectral line]]s of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external [[electric field]]. It is the electric-field analogue of the [[Zeeman effect]], where a spectral line is split into several components due to the presence of the [[magnetic field]]. Although initially coined for the static case, it is also used in the wider context to describe effect of time-dependent electric fields. In particular, the Stark effect is responsible for the [[Spectral_line#Pressure_broadening|pressure broadening]] (Stark broadening) of spectral lines by charged particles in [[Plasma_(physics)|plasma]]s. For majority of spectral lines, the Stark effect is either linear (proportional to the applied electric field) or quadratic with a high accuracy.

The Stark effect can be observed both for emission and absorption lines. The latter is sometimes called the '''inverse Stark effect''', but this term is no longer used in the modern literature.

Note that energy levels cannot cross due to the ionic core (and resulting quantum defect) breaking symmetries of dynamical motion.&lt;ref name=Courtney1995 /&gt;]]

==History==
The effect is named after the German physicist [[Johannes Stark]], who discovered it in 1913. It was independently discovered in the same year by the Italian physicist [[Antonino Lo Surdo]], and in Italy it is thus sometimes called the '''Stark–Lo Surdo effect'''. The discovery of this effect contributed importantly to the development of quantum theory and was rewarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for [[Johannes Stark]] in the year 1919.

Inspired by the magnetic [[Zeeman effect]], and especially by Lorentz's explanation of it, [[Woldemar Voigt]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Voigt, ''Ueber das Elektrische Analogon des Zeemaneffectes'' (On the electric analogue of the Zeeman effect), Annalen der Physik,  vol. '''309''',
pp. 197–208 (1901).&lt;/ref&gt; performed classical mechanical calculations of quasi-elastically bound electrons in an electric field. By using experimental indices of refraction he gave an estimate of the Stark splittings. This estimate was a few orders of magnitude too low. Not deterred by this prediction, Stark&lt;ref&gt;J. Stark, ''Beobachtungen über den Effekt des elektrischen Feldes auf Spektrallinien I. Quereffekt'' (Observations of the effect of the electric field on spectral lines I. Transverse effect), Annalen der Physik,  vol. '''43''', pp. 965–983 (1914). Published earlier (1913) in Sitzungsberichten der Kgl. Preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.&lt;/ref&gt; undertook measurements on excited states of the hydrogen atom and succeeded in observing splittings.

By the use of the Bohr–Sommerfeld ("old") quantum theory, [[Paul Sophus Epstein|Paul Epstein]]&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Epstein, ''Zur Theorie des Starkeffektes'', Annalen der Physik, vol. '''50''', pp. 489–520 (1916)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Schwarzschild]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Schwarzschild, Sitzungsberichten der Kgl. Preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. April 1916, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; were independently able to derive equations for the linear and quadratic Stark effect in [[hydrogen]]. Four years later, [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Hendrik Kramers]]&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Kramers, Roy. Danish Academy, ''Intensities of Spectral Lines. On the Application of the Quantum Theory to the Problem of Relative Intensities of the Components of the Fine Structure and of the Stark Effect of the Lines of the Hydrogen Spectrum'', p. 287 (1919);''Über den Einfluß eines elektrischen Feldes auf die Feinstruktur der Wasserstofflinien'' (On the influence of an electric field on the fine structure of hydrogen lines), Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. '''3''', pp. 199–223  (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; derived formulas for intensities of spectral transitions. Kramers also included the effect of [[fine structure]], which includes corrections for relativistic kinetic energy and coupling between electron spin and orbital motion. The first quantum mechanical treatment (in the framework of Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]]) was by Wolfgang Pauli.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli, ''Über dass Wasserstoffspektrum vom Standpunkt der neuen Quantenmechanik'' (On the hydrogen spectrum from the point of view of the new quantum mechanics). Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. '''36''' p. 336 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; Erwin Schrödinger discussed at length the Stark effect in his  third paper&lt;ref&gt;E. Schrödinger, ''Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem'', Annalen der Physik, vol. '''385''' Issue 13, 437–490 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; on quantum theory (in which he introduced his perturbation theory), once in the manner of the 1916 work of Epstein (but generalized from the old to the new quantum theory) and once by his (first-order) perturbation approach.
Finally, Epstein&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Epstein, ''The Stark Effect from the Point of View of Schroedinger's Quantum Theory'', Physical Review, vol '''28''', pp. 695–710 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; reconsidered the linear and quadratic Stark effect from the point of view of the new quantum theory. He derived equations for the line intensities which were a decided improvement over Kramers' results obtained by the old quantum theory.

While first-order perturbation effects for the Stark effect in hydrogen are in agreement for the Bohr–Sommerfeld  model and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] theory of the atom, higher-order effects are not.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths confirmed the correctness of the quantum theory over the Bohr model.

== Mechanism ==

===Overview===
An electric field pointing from left to right, for example, tends to pull nuclei to the right and electrons to the left. In another way of viewing it, if an electronic state has its electron disproportionately to the left, its energy is lowered, while if it has the electron disproportionately to the right, its energy is raised.

Other things being equal, the effect of the electric field is greater for outer [[electron shell]]s, because the electron is more distant from the nucleus, so it travels farther left and farther right.

The Stark effect can lead to splitting of [[degenerate energy level]]s. For example, in the [[Bohr model]], an electron has the same energy whether it is in the [[electron shell|2s]] state or any of the [[electron shell|2p]] states. However, in an electric field, there will be [[Orbital hybridisation|hybrid orbitals]] (also called [[quantum superposition]]s) of the 2s and 2p states where the electron tends to be to the left, which will acquire a lower energy, and other hybrid orbitals where the electron tends to be to the right, which will acquire a higher energy. Therefore, the formerly degenerate energy levels will split into slightly lower and slightly higher energy levels.

===Classical electrostatics===
The Stark effect originates from the interaction between a charge distribution (atom or molecule) and an external [[electric field]].  Before turning to quantum mechanics we describe the interaction
classically and consider a continuous charge distribution ρ('''r''').
If this charge distribution  is non-polarizable its interaction energy with an external [[Electrostatic#Electrostatic potential|electrostatic potential]] ''V''('''r''') is 
:&lt;math&gt; E_{\mathrm{int}} = \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) V(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}^3&lt;/math&gt;.
If the electric field is of macroscopic origin and the charge distribution is microscopic, it is reasonable to assume that the electric field is uniform over the charge distribution. That is, ''V'' is given by a two-term [[Taylor expansion]],
:&lt;math&gt;
V(\mathbf{r}) = V(\mathbf{0}) - \sum_{i=1}^3 r_i F_i &lt;/math&gt;, with the electric field: &lt;math&gt;F_i \equiv  -\left. \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial r_i} \right)\right|_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where we took the origin '''0''' somewhere within ρ.
Setting ''V''(0) as the zero energy, the interaction becomes
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{int}} = - \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i  \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) r_i d\mathbf{r} \equiv
- \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i  \mu_i = - \mathbf{F}\cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here we have introduced the [[dipole|dipole moment]]  '''μ''' of ρ as an integral over the charge distribution. In case ρ consists of ''N'' point charges ''q''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; this definition becomes a sum
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} \equiv \sum_{j=1}^N  q_j \mathbf{r}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

===Perturbation theory===
Electric-field perturbation applied to a classical hydrogen atom produces a distortion of the electron orbit in a direction perpendicular to the applied field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J. C.|year=1987|title=The strange polarization of the classical atom|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=55|issue=10|pages=906–909|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/55/10/10.1119/1.14951|bibcode = 1987AmJPh..55..906S |doi = 10.1119/1.14951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Anchor|perpendicular2016-01-29}}This effect can be shown without perturbation theory using the relation between the angular momentum and the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biedenharn|first=L.

This approach can also lead to an ''exactly solvable'' approximate model Hamiltonian for an atom in a strong oscillatory field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biedenharn|first=L.

Turning now to quantum mechanics an atom or a molecule can be thought of as a collection of point charges (electrons and nuclei), so that the second definition of the dipole applies. The interaction of atom or molecule with a uniform external field is described by the operator
:&lt;math&gt; V_{\mathrm{int}} = - \mathbf{F}\cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This operator is used as a perturbation in first- and second-order [[perturbation theory]] to account for the first- and second-order Stark effect.

====First order====
Let the unperturbed atom or molecule be in a ''g''-fold degenerate state with orthonormal zeroth-order state functions &lt;math&gt; \psi^0_1, \ldots, \psi^0_g &lt;/math&gt;. (Non-degeneracy is the special case ''g'' = 1). According to perturbation theory the first-order energies are the eigenvalues of the ''g'' x ''g''  matrix with general element 
:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{int}})_{kl} = \langle \psi^0_k |  V_{\mathrm{int}} | \psi^0_l \rangle =
-\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle \psi^0_k | \boldsymbol{\mu} | \psi^0_l \rangle,
\qquad k,l=1,\ldots, g.
&lt;/math&gt;
If ''g'' = 1 (as is often the case for electronic states of molecules)  the first-order energy becomes proportional to the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
E^{(1)} = -\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle \psi^0_1 | \boldsymbol{\mu} | \psi^0_1 \rangle =
-\mathbf{F}\cdot \langle  \boldsymbol{\mu} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because a dipole moment is a [[Polar and axial vectors|polar vector]], the diagonal elements of the perturbation  matrix '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; vanish for systems with an [[parity (physics)|inversion center]] (such as atoms). Molecules with an inversion center in a non-degenerate electronic state do not have a (permanent) dipole and hence do not show a linear Stark effect.

In order to obtain a non-zero matrix '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; for systems with an inversion center it is necessary that some of the unperturbed functions &lt;math&gt; \psi^0_i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite parity (obtain plus and minus under inversion), because only functions of opposite parity give non-vanishing matrix elements. Degenerate zeroth-order states of opposite parity occur for excited hydrogen-like (one-electron) atoms or Rydberg states. Neglecting [[fine structure|fine-structure]] effects, such a state with the principal quantum number ''n'' is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-fold degenerate and
:&lt;math&gt;
n^2 = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} (2 \ell + 1),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\ell &lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal (angular momentum) quantum number. For instance, the excited ''n'' = 4 state contains the following &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; states,
:&lt;math&gt;
16 = 1 + 3 + 5 +7 \;\; \Longrightarrow\;\;  n=4\;\hbox{contains}\; s\oplus p\oplus d\oplus f.
&lt;/math&gt;
The one-electron states with even &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are even under parity, while those with odd &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are odd under parity. Hence hydrogen-like atoms with ''n''&gt;1 show first-order Stark effect.

The first-order Stark effect occurs in rotational transitions of [[Rotational spectroscopy#Classification of molecules based on rotational behavior|symmetric top molecules]] (but not for linear and asymmetric molecules). In first approximation a molecule may be seen as a rigid rotor. A symmetric top [[rigid rotor]] has the unperturbed eigenstates
:&lt;math&gt;
|JKM \rangle = (D^J_{MK})^* \quad\mathrm{with}\quad M,K= -J,-J+1,\dots,J
&lt;/math&gt;
with 2(2''J''+1)-fold degenerate energy for |K| &gt; 0 and (2''J''+1)-fold degenerate energy for K=0.
Here ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''MK''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of the [[Wigner D-matrix]]. The first-order perturbation matrix  on basis of the unperturbed rigid rotor function is non-zero and can be diagonalized. This gives shifts and splittings
in  the rotational spectrum. Quantitative analysis of these Stark shift yields the permanent [[electric dipole moment]] of the symmetric top molecule.

====Second order====
As stated, the quadratic Stark effect is described by second-order perturbation theory.
The zeroth-order [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenproblem]]
:&lt;math&gt;
H^{(0)} \psi^0_k = E^{(0)}_k \psi^0_k, \quad k=0,1, \ldots, \quad E^{(0)}_0 &lt; E^{(0)}_1 \le E^{(0)}_2, \dots 
&lt;/math&gt;
is assumed to be solved. The perturbation theory gives
:&lt;math&gt;
E^{(2)}_k = \sum_{k^\prime \neq k} \frac{\langle \psi^0_k | V_\mathrm{int} | \psi^0_{k^\prime} \rangle \langle \psi^0_{k^\prime} | V_\mathrm{int} | \psi^0_k \rangle}{E^{(0)}_k - E^{(0)}_{k^\prime}} \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^3 \alpha_{ij} F_i F_j
&lt;/math&gt;
with the components of the [[polarizability|polarizability tensor]] α defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{ij} = -2\sum_{k^\prime \neq k} \frac{\langle \psi^0_k | \mu_i | \psi^0_{k^\prime} \rangle \langle \psi^0_{k^\prime} | \mu_j | \psi^0_k \rangle}{E^{(0)}_k - E^{(0)}_{k^\prime}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The energy ''E''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; gives the quadratic Stark effect.

Neglecting the [[hyperfine structure]] (which is often justified — unless extremely weak electric fields are considered), the polarizability tensor of atoms is isotropic,
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{ij} \equiv \alpha_0 \delta_{ij} \Longrightarrow E^{(2)} = -\frac{1}{2} \alpha_0 F^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
For some molecules this expression is a reasonable approximation, too.

It is important to note that for the ground state &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is ''always'' positive, i.e., the quadratic Stark shift is always negative.

====Problems====
The perturbative treatment of the Stark effect has some problems. In the presence of an electric field, states of atoms and molecules that were previously bound ([[square-integrable]]), become formally (non-square-integrable) [[resonance]]s of finite width.
These resonances may decay in finite time via field ionization. For low lying states and not too strong fields the decay times are so long, however, that for all practical purposes the system can be regarded as bound. For highly excited states and/or very strong fields ionization may have to be accounted for. (See also the article on the [[Rydberg atom]]).

== Quantum-confined Stark effect ==
{{main article|Quantum-confined Stark effect}}
In a semiconductor heterostructure, where a small bandgap material is sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound [[excitons]]. This is because the [[electron]] and [[Electron hole|hole]] which form the exciton are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller bandgap material, so the exciton is not merely pulled apart by the field. The quantum-confined Stark effect is widely used for semiconductor-based optical modulators, particularly for [[optical fiber]] communications.

The '''Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA)''' study was a [[National Science Foundation]]-funded research project designed to quantify the heat transfer processes that occur between the [[ocean]] and the [[atmosphere]] over the course of a year in the [[Arctic Ocean]], where the [[sun]] is above the [[horizon]] from [[spring (season)|spring]] through [[summer]] and below the horizon the rest of the time. The study was designed to provide data for use in [[global climate model]]s, which scientists use to study [[global climate change]].&lt;ref name ="Perovich"&gt;

==Background==
Ice reflects sunlight more readily than open water. Snow-covered sea ice reflects about 80% of the incident sunlight. Seasonal changes in the Arctic result in clear skies and radiational cooling from snow-covered sea ice in the constantly dark arctic winter. In spring, with the return of sunlight, melt pools begin to form and increase the rate of heat absorption from the sun. In the summer, during constant daylight, clouds form which reflect light to the sky, but impede heat flow from the ocean. In order to quantify these effects over a large portion of earth's area—the Arctic Ocean—required a large-scale scientific data-gathering and analysis effort over the span of a year.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt; Consequently, the [[National Science Foundation]], together with other sponsors,&lt;ref&gt;Primary sponsorship came from the NSF Arctic System Science Program, under grants from the Office of Polar Programs (Division of Ocean Sciences and Division of Atmospheric Sciences), with additional support from the Office of Naval Research and the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center.&lt;/ref&gt; funded a study to better quantify these processes.&lt;ref name="Uttal"&gt;

==Ice Station SHEBA==
[[File:Ice Station SHEBA-CRREL.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ice station SHEBA base, ''[[CCGS Des Groseilliers|Canadian Coast Guard Ship Des Groseilliers]]'' (right) with ''[[CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent]]''.]]
The scientific party traveled aboard the [[CCGS Des Groseilliers|Canadian Coast Guard Ship Des Groseilliers]] to the Arctic Ocean. It arrived at a location on 2 October 1997 where the plan was to allow the ship to become frozen in the [[pack ice]] and be the base for scientific observations. Those observations included measurements of the oceanic and atmospheric processes from the water beneath the ice, near the ship, to the top of the atmosphere. Measurements included:  
* Radiative fluxes: longwave and shortwave
* Heat flux: turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat
* Cloud height, thickness and other properties
* Processes of energy exchange in the boundary layers of the atmosphere and ocean
* Snow depth and ice thickness
* Ocean salinity, temperature, and currents
The ship remained stationary with respect to the ice for one year, leaving on 11 October 1998. It became known as "Ice Station SHEBA."&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ice Station SHEBA" is a reference to the novel, ''[[Ice Station Zebra (novel)|Ice Station Zebra]],'' or [[Ice Station Zebra|film]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
[[File:Summer Arctic Melt Pond-SHEBA.JPG|thumb|right|300px|SHEBA researchers taking data in a melted area of the Arctic Ocean ice pack.]]
The scientists found clouds to be common at the ship's location throughout the year. In the midwinter, there was reportedly overcast 40% of the time and in the summer the sky was continually overcast. Air temperature was 0.6&amp;nbsp;°C lower than the regional climatological average temperature. With no sun in the winter, the net flow of heat (flux) was from the surface of the ocean to the sky, marked with large differences in flux with changes in cloud cover. In April the flux changed toward solar warming of the surface of the sea, which reached a maximum in July when sunlight was strongest and the ice developed melt ponds which were much darker than snow and could absorb sunlight more efficiently.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;

The scientists also measured the net change in mass of the ice and snow pack at 100 sites. They noted a wide variability of change over the region surrounding the ship. They determined that, with the waning sunlight of fall, the temperature in the ice dropped such that, by November, it was generating new growth at the bottom of the ice pack. From these observations, they identified five phases of change in heat budget:&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;
* Dry snow
* Melting snow
* Pond formation
* Pond evolution
* Fall freeze-up.

==Modeling==
The experimental results allowed meaningful modeling of the seasonal heat budget processes occurring through the Arctic Ocean sea ice and atmosphere. The scope of the model was the column from below the ice pack through the top of the atmosphere. The scientists realized that key to the model was correctly characterizing the changing reflectivity or [[albedo]] of the ice surface, owing to changes in snow pack and ice melting. Cloud cover was key to describing how much energy reached or escaped the ocean surface.&lt;ref name="Perovich"/&gt;

===Ocean processes===

The model incorporated the observation that solar radiation is the dominant heat source to the surface. It accounted for the change in open ocean from a 5% maximum in June and the changes in albedo. Approximately 8% of incoming solar radiation was absorbed into the ocean through the ice.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;

===Atmosphere processes===
The scientists were able to define parameters for near-surface turbulence that characterize the degree to which air movement can cool or warm the surface of the ice, seasonally. In summer, the surface becomes rougher and slows down air flow. The [[lidar]] cloud measurements and balloonsonde temperature and turbulence data allowed scientific characterization of the role of the atmosphere above the ice in promoting or inhibiting the warming or cooling of the ocean surface.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;

'''''The Gardeners Dictionary''''' was a widely cited reference series, written by [[Philip Miller]] (1691 – 1771), which tended to focus on plants cultivated in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tropicos.org/Publication/8134 Tropicos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/72202?tab=editions#tabs WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; Eight editions of the series were published in his lifetime. After his death, it was further developed by [[George Don]] as ''A general system of gardening and botany. Founded upon Miller's Gardener's dictionary, and arranged according to the natural system'' (1831–1838).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/16519#/summary Don, G.

[[File:The Phantom Empire 1940.ogv|thumb|''The Phantom Empire'', a 70-minute feature film edited from the serial]]
'''''The Phantom Empire''''' is a 1935 American [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[serial film]] directed by [[Otto Brower]] and [[B. Reeves Eason]] and starring [[Gene Autry]], [[Frankie Darro]], and [[Betsy King Ross]].&lt;ref name="magers-21"&gt;Magers 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This 12-chapter [[Mascot Pictures]] serial combined the western, [[Musical theatre|musical]], and [[science fiction]] genres. The first episode is 30 minutes, the rest about 20 minutes. The serial film is about a [[singing cowboy]] who stumbles upon an ancient subterranean civilization living beneath his own ranch that becomes corrupted by unscrupulous greedy speculators from the surface.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Phantom Empire |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026867/ |accessdate=c 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, a 70-minute feature film edited from the serial was released under the titles ''Radio Ranch'' or ''Men with Steel Faces''. This was Gene Autry's first starring role, playing himself as a singing cowboy.&lt;ref name="magers-22"&gt;Magers 2007, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Gene Autry ([[Gene Autry]]) is a singing cowboy who runs Radio Ranch, a [[dude ranch]] from which he makes a daily live radio broadcast at 2:00 pm. Gene has two kid sidekicks, Frankie Baxter ([[Frankie Darro]]) and Betsy Baxter ([[Betsy King Ross]]), who lead a club, the Junior Thunder Riders, in which the kids play at being armored knights of an unknown civilization, the mysterious Thunder Riders who make a sound like thunder when they ride. The kids, dressing up in capes and water-bucket helmets, play at riding "To the rescue!" (their motto).

A chance to become real heroes occurs when Betsy, Frankie, and Gene are kidnapped by the real Thunder Riders from the super-scientific underground empire of Murania, complete with towering buildings, robots, ray-guns, advanced television, elevator tubes that extend miles from the surface, and the icy, blonde, evil Queen Tika. On the surface, criminals led by Professor Beetson plan to invade Murania and seize its [[radium]] wealth, while in Murania, a group of revolutionaries plots to overthrow Queen Tika.

The inhabitants of Murania are the lost tribe of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], who went underground in the [[last glacial period]] 100,000 years ago, and now live in a fantastically advanced city 25,000 feet below the surface. They cannot now breathe the air at ground level and must wear oxygen masks. (Surface dwellers have no trouble breathing Muranian air.) The Thunder Guard emerges to the surface world from a cave with a huge rock door that swings up like a garage door. Both Muranians and Professor Beetson want to get rid of Autry, so he loses his radio contract and Radio Ranch is vacated.&lt;ref name="magers-23-24"&gt;Magers 2007, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Phantom Empire'' was released in theaters on February 23, 1935.&lt;ref name="cline-212"&gt;Cline 1997, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The serial was a "marked box office success."&lt;ref name="harmon-61-62"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
The 1979 television series ''[[Cliffhangers (TV series)|Cliffhangers]]'', which attempted to recreate the old movie serial feel by showing three serial chapters in each episode, included a serial titled "The Secret Empire", a pastiche of ''The Phantom Empire''.  Events in the underground empire were shown in color, but events on the surface were "in glorious black and white." Stock footage from the serial, as well as other serials, was used in the animated series ''[[Muppet Babies]]''.

[[Fred Olen Ray]], in 1988, filmed a movie called ''The Phantom Empire'' about treasure hunters braving a cavern system populated by troglodytes and other subterranean hazards to finally encounter an underground lost civilization. The movie makes reference to the serial and was itself in the end credits planned to have sequels that never were produced.

Alejandro Pérez Cervantes' short story collection, ''Murania'', is highly inspired on the aesthetic of Murania and the lost continent of Mu as depicted in the film. It received the 2006 [[Julio Torri]] national award for short fiction in Mexico.

The webseries ''[[The Sam Plenty Cavalcade of Action Show Plus Singing!]]'' was inspired by the serial.

The UK Channel 4 show 'Exploitica' lampooned the serial, adding comedic sound effects, thought bubbles and captions to each episode.

The film uses interviews with a German officer, collaborators, and resistance fighters from [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. They comment on the nature of and reasons for collaboration. The reasons include [[antisemitism]], [[anglophobia]], fear of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion, the desire for power, and simple caution.{{Citation needed lead|date=November 2018}}

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|1=Both part one and part two should have separate sub headings. The synopsis is too short for such a long film.|section=1|date=November 2018}}
Part one of the film, ''The Collapse,'' has an extended interview with [[Pierre Mendès France]]. He was jailed by the Vichy government on trumped-up charges of desertion after leaving France on the SS ''Le Masilia'', together with {{ill|Pierre Viénot|fr}}, [[Jean Zay]], and {{ill|Alex Wiltzer|fr}}, in an attempt to rejoin his military unit which had moved to Morocco. But Mendès France escaped from jail to join [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s forces operating out of England, and later served as prime minister of France for eight months from 1954 to 1955. [[File:Natan, Bernard, French movieproducer on trial 1936 circa.JPG|thumb|[[Bernard Natan]] on trial in France for fraud circa 1936; Screenshot from the documentary The Sorrow and the Pity (part 1).]]

Part two, ''The Choice'', revolves around [[Christian de la Mazière]], who is something of a counterpoint to Mendès France. Whereas Mendès France was a French Jewish political figure who joined the Resistance, de la Mazière, an aristocrat who embraced Fascism, was one of 7,000 French youth to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] wearing [[Nazi Germany|German]] uniforms.

The film shows the French people's response to occupation as heroic, pitiable, and monstrous—sometimes all at once. The postwar humiliation of the women who served (or were married to) German soldiers perhaps gives the strongest mix of all three. [[Maurice Chevalier]]'s "Sweepin' the Clouds Away" is the theme song of the film. He was a popular entertainer with the German occupation force.

==Production==
{{Expand section|1=I just added this section. Many sources already used go into these details. Feel free to help me expand it.|section=1|date=November 2018}} &lt;!-- Please refer to [[MOS:FILM]] Wikiproject Film style guide. Refer to section on production and section on documentaries. --&gt;
Initially commissioned by French government-owned television to create a two part made for TV documentary,&lt;ref name="Busi" /&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} the film was banned after Olphus submitted it to the studio that hired him.&lt;ref name="Jeffries-Guardian" /&gt;

==Release==
&lt;!-- While reading about the film and adding details to the article I've inadvertently nested things that belong under reception in response to what was already written here. This section needs to be reworked as well --&gt;The film "had its world premiere in Germany."&lt;ref name="Busi" /&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} This film was first shown on French television in 1981&lt;ref name="Jeffries-Guardian" /&gt; after being banned&lt;ref name="Liebenson" /&gt; from that medium for years. In 1969, after the director submitted the film to the studio that hired him, the network head "told a government committee that the film 'destroys myths that the people of France still need'."&lt;ref name="Jeffries-Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/23/1|title=A nation shamed: Why does France keep making films that glorify the Resistance and gloss over the truth about collaboration?|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|date=January 22, 2004|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Busi suggests that this was because of how uncomfortable it is to face the reality of collaborationism. Writing of French conservative establishment groups' reactions to the film, "They, too, preferred that little be said about their role, and in some ways this reluctance is more significant than that of the extremists, since they represent so large a segment of society and mainly dominate contemporary politics."&lt;ref name="Busi"/&gt;  It is frequently assumed that the reason was French reluctance to admit the facts of French history. While this may have been a factor, the principal mover in the decision was [[Simone Veil]], a Jewish inmate of Auschwitz who became a minister and the first president of the European Parliament, on the grounds that the film presented too one-sided a view.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Veil, ''Mémoires'', Paris, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=September 2018}}

==Reception==
&lt;!-- This needs to be reorded chronologically ending with the awards list. --&gt;The candid approach of the 1971 documentary ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' shone a spotlight on antisemitism in France and disputed the official Resistance ideals.&lt;ref name="Weitz"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weitz |first=Margaret Collins |title=Sisters in the Resistance – How Women Fought to Free France 1940–1945 |year=1995 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-19698-3 |ref=harv|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Greene |first=Naomi |title= Landscapes of Loss: The National Past in Postwar French Cinema |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-00475-4 |ref=harv|page=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine gave a positive review of the film, and wrote that Marcel Ophüls "tries to puncture the bourgeois myth—or protectively askew memory—that allows France generally to act as if hardly any Frenchmen collaborated with the Germans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910312,00.html |title=TIME magazine: Truth and Consequences |journal=Time |date=1972-03-27 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, after its release, communists, socialists, and "independent groups" treated the film favorably, however, the far right disapproved on account of the director's background.&lt;ref name="Busi" /&gt; Some{{who|date=November 2018}} denounced the film as unpatriotic.&lt;ref name="Jeffries-Guardian" /&gt; The film has also been criticized for being too selective and that the director was "too close to the events portrayed to provide an objective study of the period."&lt;ref name="Busi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/on-the-sorrow-and-the-pity/|title=On 'The Sorrow and the Pity'|last=Hoffman|first=Stanley|work=Commentary|access-date=November 3, 2018|year=1972}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Richard Trank, a documentarian of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], described it as "a film about morality that explores the role of ordinary people."&lt;ref name="Liebenson" /&gt; It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in 1971 for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/45714/Le-Chagrin-et-la-Pitie/details|title=Le Chagrin et la Pitie - Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|last=|first=|date=n.d.|work=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519054324/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/45714/Le-Chagrin-et-la-Pitie/details|archive-date=May 19, 2009|dead-url=yes|accessdate=November 12, 2008|quote=Win Special Award - 1972 New York Film Critics Circle Best Foreign Film - 1972 National Board of Review Nomination Best Documentary Feature - 1971 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&amp;displayType=1&amp;BSFromYear=44 |title=The Official Acadademy Awards® Database |access-date=November 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415143109/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&amp;displayType=1&amp;BSFromYear=44 |archive-date=2013-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrakis" /&gt; It won "the Grand Prize of the {{ill|Dinard Festival|fr|Festival du film britannique de Dinard}}".&lt;ref name="Busi"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busi|first=Frederick|date=Winter 1973|title=Marcel Ophuls and the Sorrow and the Pity|journal=The Massachusetts Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=177–186|jstor=25088330}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} It received "a special award by the National Society of Film Critics, which called it 'a film of extraordinary public interest and distinction.'"&lt;ref name="Liebenson" /&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">In [[physics]], '''ultradivided Matter''' is a family of [[State of matter|states of matter]] characterised by a heterogeneous mixture of two or more different materials, where the [[interaction energy]] between the suspended phase is larger than kT. The term 'ultradivided matter' encapsulates several types of substance including: [[Micelle|soap micelles]], [[emulsions]], and [[suspensions]] of [[solids]] such as [[colloids]].).&lt;ref name="Pierre"&gt;{{cite journal

An ultradivided state differs from a solution. In a steady-state solution, all interactions between a solution's constituent molecules are on the order of the thermal energy [[kT (energy)|kT]]. Thus any otherwise aggregative force between similar molecules in a solution is subordinate to [[thermal fluctuations]], and the solution does allow [[flocculation]] of one of the constituent components. Ultradivided matter, however, is characterised by large interfacial energies where the intermolecular interactions of one or more constituents of the substance are stronger than kT. This leads to different behaviour. An intuitive example of this can be seen in the tendency of a biphasic mixture of [[water]] (a polar liquid) and [[oil]] (a non-polar liquid) to spontaneously separate into two phases. This may seem to imply a change from a state with higher disorder or higher [[entropy]] (a suspension of oil droplets in water) to a lower-entropy arrangement (a neat separation into two regions of different material). Such a transition would seem to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which is impossible. The resolution to this apparent paradox is that the interface between oil and water necessitates an ordered alignment of oil and water molecules at the interface. Minimisation of the surface area between the two phases thus correlates with an increase of the entropy of the system. The highest entropy state thus has a minimum interfacial surface area between the two phases and thus a neat separation is created, into two regions of different material.

A '''waterspout''' is an intense columnar [[vortex]] (usually appearing as a [[funnel]]-shaped cloud) that occurs over a [[body of water]]. Some are connected to a [[cumulus congestus cloud]], some to a [[cumuliform cloud]] and some to a [[cumulonimbus cloud]].&lt;ref name=Glossary&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.geographic.org/climate/w.html#waterspout |title=Waterspout definition |work=A Comprehensive Glossary Of Weather |publisher=Geographic.org |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the common form, it is a non-[[supercell]] [[tornado]] over water.&lt;ref name=Glossary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcvb.com/video/the-weather-channel/what-is-a-waterspout/40714452 What Is a Waterspout?] ([[Weather Channel]] [[video]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/bayarea/article/Waterspout-comes-ashore-in-Galveston-8382923.php Waterspout comes ashore in Galveston] by Jessica Hamilton, [[Houston Chronicle]], July 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

While waterspouts form mostly in the tropics and [[subtropical]] areas,&lt;ref name=Glossary/&gt; other areas also report waterspouts, including [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Great Lakes]], [[Antarctica]]&lt;ref name="lake_michigan"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title= ''Several waterspouts filmed on Lake Michigan in US'' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19315824 | date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Stanley|title=Antarctic Diary|url=http://antarcticdiary.wordpress.com/part-4/|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on rare occasions, the [[Great Salt Lake]].&lt;ref name="A Great Salt Lake Waterspout"&gt;publisher=journals.ametsoc.org| url=journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493-119-12-2740.1|author=J Simpson |date =1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare, waterspouts have been observed in connection with [[lake-effect snow]] [[rainband|precipitation bands]].

Waterspouts have a five-part life cycle: formation of a dark spot on the water surface, spiral pattern on the water surface, formation of a spray ring, development of the visible [[condensation funnel]], and ultimately decay.

==Formation==
[[File:Giant Waterspout Filmed by RAF Search and Rescue Crew MOD 45152038.jpg|thumb|left|Waterspout filmed off Anglesey, Wales, on 12 November 2010 by an RAF Search and Rescue crew]]
Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. The cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a [[supercell]]. While some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm.  Weak tornadoes, known as [[landspout]]s, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="Choy"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one waterspout can occur in the same vicinity at the same time. As many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on [[Lake Michigan]].&lt;ref name="lake_michigan" /&gt;

==Types==

=== Non-tornadic ===
[[File:Three waterspouts Kijkduin.jpg|thumb|left|Non-tornadic waterspouts seen from the beach at Kijkduin near [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]] on 27 August 2006.]]
[[File:Punta Gorda waterspout.jpg|thumb|left|Tornadic waterspout on 15 July 2005 off the coast of [[Punta Gorda, Florida]], caused by a severe thunderstorm.]]
Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] are known as "non-tornadic" or "fair-weather waterspouts", and are by far the most common type.  Fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] towers.  Waterspouts of this type rapidly develop and dissipate, having life cycles shorter than 20&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="Choy"/&gt;  They usually rate no higher than EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], generally exhibiting winds of less than {{convert|30|m/s|mi/h km/h|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=threat-definitions-waterspouts|title=Threat Definitions for Waterspouts|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Central Region Headuqaters|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, Milwaukee/Sullivan, WI|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are most frequently seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates, with upwards of 400 per year observed in the [[Florida Keys]].&lt;ref name="NWS"/&gt; They typically move slowly, if at all, since the cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static, being formed by vertical [[convection|convective action]] instead of the subduction/adduction interaction between colliding [[weather front|fronts]].&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt;  Fair-weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to [[landspout]]s, and largely behave as such if they move ashore.&lt;ref name="NWS"/&gt;

===Tornadic===
"Tornadic waterspouts", also accurately referred to as "tornadoes over water", are formed from [[mesocyclone|mesocyclonic action]] in a manner essentially identical to land-based tornadoes in connection with [[severe thunderstorm]]s, but simply occurring over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/ghwo/waterspout_levels.html|title=Graphical Hazardous Weather Outlook: Waterspout Threat|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Melbourne, Florida]]|accessdate=21 June 2009|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Southern Region Headquarters |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051219191304/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/ghwo/waterspout_levels.html |archivedate = 19 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434(2000)015%3C0122%3ATJPCFT%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=The 12 July 1995 Pinellas County, Florida, Tornado/Waterspout|work=Weather and Forecasting, vol. 15, issue 1|date=February 2000|pages=122–134|author1=Waylon G.

==Deterioration==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}

Nothing has been written here yet about the longevity of any type landspout, about its deterioration or destruction and whether any techniques have been developed or are employed to cause the deterioration, destruction or deflection of waterspouts, especially where they can move onto the coast and maybe turn into tornadoes.

A ''winter waterspout'', also known as a ''snow devil'', an ''icespout'', an ''ice devil'', a ''snownado'', or a ''snowspout'', is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a [[snow squall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The term "winter waterspout" is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event.  Very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date, four of which were taken in [[Ontario]], Canada.  There are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout.  Very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce [[fog]] resembling [[steam]] above the water's surface.  Like the more efficient [[lake-effect snow]] events, winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/15Jan2009/overview.shtml|title=15 January 2009: Lake Champlain Sea Smoke, Steam Devils, and Waterspout: Chapters IV and V|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Burlington, Vermont]]|publisher=Eastern Region Headquarters|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the majority of waterspouts occur in the tropics, they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world, and are common across the western coast of Europe as well as the British Isles and several areas of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea. They are not restricted to saltwater; many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080723/montreal_waterspout_080723/20080723?hub=TopStories|title=Rare waterspout forms in Montreal during storm|author=Canadian Television News Staff|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterspouts are fairly common on the Great Lakes during late summer and early fall, with a record 66+ waterspouts reported over just a seven-day period in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/dec_04/waterspout.shtml|title=The Great Waterspout Outbreak of 2003|author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=4 December 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are more frequent within 100&amp;nbsp;kilometers (60&amp;nbsp;mi) from the coast than farther out at sea.  Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast, especially off southern Florida and the [[Florida Keys|Keys]] and can happen over seas, bays, and lakes worldwide.  Approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across Europe, with the Netherlands reporting the most at 60, followed by Spain and Italy at 25, and the United Kingdom at 15.  They are most common in late summer.  In the Northern Hemisphere, September has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation.

==Life cycle==
There are five stages to the waterspout life cycle.  Initially, a prominent circular, light-colored disk appears on the surface of the water, surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape. After the formation of these colored disks on the water, a pattern of light and dark-colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface.  Then, a dense [[wikt:annulus|annulus]] of sea spray, called a cascade, appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].  Eventually, the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud.  The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves.  Eventually, the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens, ending the waterspout's life cycle.&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/science/les/les.php|title=Waterspouts|author=Bruce B. Smith|date=22 February 2007|accessdate=21 June 2009|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Central Region Headquarters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine hazard==
Waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards. Stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft, aircraft and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1438173/Water-spout-hit-helicopter.html|title=Water Spout Hit Helicopter|author=Auslan Cramb|work=The Telegraph|date=7 August 2003|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports. The United States [[National Weather Service]] will often issue [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|special marine warnings]] when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or [[tornado warning]]s when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/mlb/ghwo/waterspout_rules.html|title=Graphical Hazardous Weather Outlook: Waterspout Threat|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast office, [[Melbourne, Florida]]|publisher=Southern Region Headquarters|date=25 January 2007|accessdate=21 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001031924/http://www.srh.weather.gov/mlb/ghwo/waterspout_rules.html |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare. However, there have been several notable examples. The [[Valletta, Malta tornado|Malta tornado]] in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout. It struck the [[Grand Harbour]] of Valletta, sinking four [[galley]]s, numerous boats, and claiming hundreds of lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abela|first1=Joe|title=Claude de la Sengle (1494 - 1557)|url=http://www.islalocalcouncil.com/promseng.htm#claude|publisher=Senglea Local Council|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1851 [[Sicily Tornadoes]] were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily, ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea.
A waterspout has been proposed as a possible reason for the inexplicable abandonment of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.

==Threat to marine animals==
{{see also|Rain of animals#Fish}}
Depending on how fast the winds from a waterspout are whipping, anything that is within about one yard of the surface of the water, including fish of different sizes, frogs, and even turtles, can be lifted into the air.&lt;ref name=Cosier&gt;{{cite web | url= http://scienceline.org/2006/09/physics-cosier-rainingfish/ | title= It’s Raining Fish: Unusual objects sometimes fall from the sky, courtesy of waterspouts. | author = Susan Cosier | date= 17 September 2006 | accessdate= 17 May 2015 | work = Scienceline (Physical Science) | publisher = NYU Journalism }}&lt;/ref&gt; A waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish out of the water and all the way up into the cloud. Even if the waterspout stops spinning, the fish in the cloud can be carried over land, buffeted up and down and around with the cloud’s winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere. Depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere, the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down. People as far as {{convert|100|mi|km}} inland have experienced raining fish.&lt;ref name=Cosier/&gt; Fish can also be sucked up from rivers, but [[raining fish]] is not a common weather phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Cosier/&gt;

{{about|the kind of garden maintained in wintertime}}

[[Image:Winter Garden.JPG|thumb|[[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden, Brookfield Place]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]]]
[[Image:Sheffield Winter Garden - DSC07485.JPG|thumb|[[Sheffield Winter Garden]], [[Sheffield]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]]]

A '''winter garden''' is a kind of garden maintained in [[winter]]time.

== History ==
The '''origin''' of the winter garden dates back to the 17th to 19th centuries where European nobility would construct large [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]] that would house tropical and subtropical plants and would act as an extension of their living space. Many of these would be attached to their main palaces. Earlier versions would be constructed of masonry with large windows and a glass roof, usually in the [[Classical architecture|Classical]] or [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Hix, John. The Glasshouse. Phaidon Press Limited. London. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  While in the 19th century many of these conservatories were made out of iron and curvilinear glass. Winter gardens were not just restricted to private residence, many were built for the greater public. The first large public winter garden was built in 1842–46 in Regent's Park in London and was used  for evening occasions, large flower shows and social gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlmaier, Georg. Houses of Glass: A Nineteenth-Century Building Type. The MIT Press. Cambridge MA. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Other winter gardens, such as [[the Crystal Palace]] by [[Sir Joseph Paxton]] in 1851, were soon built and used for a variety of purposes.

== Present ==
The '''modern''' winter garden is usually a [[garden]] planted either to produce food, or at least to remain visibly planted and slowly develop, throughout the [[winter]], or else a garden whose plants will serve as living decoration all winter. One basic premise, in temperate or colder regions, to the winter garden is that the plants may indeed become dormant when snow covers the ground, but will grow each time the sun heats at least part of the plant to above freezing (snow or not), especially in regions where snow cover and below-freezing temperatures are not constant for months at a time.

[[Vegetable]]s that are typically, or can be, used in a winter garden include:

* Several breeds of [[winter-hardy]] cabbage
* Specific winter-hardy breeds of broccoli
* [[Winter rye]] is grown where a summer garden will be, in order to protect the ground from weeds, and provide soil amendment when tilled directly into the soil the following spring
* [[beet]]s
* [[carrot]]s
* [[allium]]s—onions, chives, and their relatives are evergreen, though some may die back during the winter and recover in the spring.
* [[oregano]] (including [[marjoram]]) -- known to hardily survive the winter up to [[Hardiness zone|Zone 5]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4194">{{Paleogene}}
In the [[geologic timescale]] the '''Ypresian''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|iː|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|s|i|ən}}) is the oldest [[age (geology)|age]] or lowest [[stage (stratigraphy)|stratigraphic stage]] of the [[Eocene]]. It spans the time between {{ma|Ypresian|and}} {{Ma|Lutetian|Ma}}, is preceded by the [[Thanetian]] age (part of the [[Paleocene]]) and is followed by the Eocene [[Lutetian]] age.

The Ypresian is consistent with the lower Eocene.

==Events==
The Ypresian age begins during the throes of the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM). The [[Fur Formation]] in [[Denmark]] and  the [[Messel shales]] in [[Germany]] are from this age.

==Stratigraphic definition==
The Ypresian stage was introduced in scientific literature by [[Belgium|Belgian]] geologist [[André Hubert Dumont]] in 1850. The Ypresian is named after ''Ypres'', the [[French language|French]] name of the Belgian ([[Flanders|Flemish]]) city of [[Ieper]] ({{font|Ieper|font=Georgia}}). The definitions of the original stage were totally different from the modern ones.&lt;ref&gt;Steurbaut (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ypresian shares its name with the Belgian [[Ieper Group]] (French: ''Groupe d'Ypres''), which has an Ypresian age.

The base of the Ypresian stage is defined at a strong negative anomaly in [[Delta 13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] values at the [[PETM]]. The official reference profile ([[GSSP]]) for the base of the Ypresian is the Dababiya profile near the [[Egypt]]ian city of [[Luxor]].&lt;ref&gt;The GSSP was established by Dupuis ''et al.'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Its original [[type section]] was located in the vicinity of Ieper.

The top of the Ypresian (the base of the Lutetian) is identified by the first appearance of the [[foram]] [[genus]] ''Hantkenina'' in the fossil record.

The Ypresian stage overlaps the upper Neustrian and most of the Grauvian [[European Land Mammal Mega Zone]]s (it spans the [[Mammal Paleogene zones]] 7 through 10.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite web |last = Alroy |first = John | page = The Paleobiology Database | title = Mammal Paleogene zones |url = http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=processViewScale&amp;scale_no=125 | accessdate = 15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Wasatchian]] and lower and middle [[Bridgerian]] [[North American Land Mammal Ages]], the [[Casamayoran]] [[South American Land Mammal Age]] and the [[Bumbanian]] and most of the [[Arshantan]] [[Asian Land Mammal Ages]]. It is also coeval with the upper Wangerripian and lowest Johannian regional stages of [[Australia]] and the [[Bulitian]], [[Penutian]] and Ulatisian regional stages of [[California]].
