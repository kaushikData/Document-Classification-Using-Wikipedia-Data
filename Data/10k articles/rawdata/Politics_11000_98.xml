The '''2016 Defence White Paper''' is a [[white paper]] published by the Australian [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] outlining a strategic plan for the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) over the following decade. The paper describes the need for improvement in the capabilities of the ADF, and includes a commitment to [[Australian dollar|A$]]195 billion in spending on new equipment and resources, as well as plans for restructure and review of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the [[Australian Army]].&lt;ref name="ABC news report"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jennett|first1=Greg|title=Defence White Paper: Australia joins Asia's arms race with spending on weaponry and military forces to reach $195b|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-25/defence-white-paper-released-increased-spending/7198632|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first Defence White Paper was published in 1976 under the [[Whitlam government]], and new papers were published in 1987, 1994, 2000, 2003, 2009 and 2013.&lt;ref name="Previous White papers"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/seven-defence-white-papers-by-the-numbers-part-1/ |title=Seven Defence White Papers by the numbers (1) |last=Dobell |first=Graeme |website=The Strategist |publisher=Australian Strategic Policy Institute |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Department of Defence issued a [[press release]] on 4 April 2014 stating that it had been instructed to develop a new white paper.&lt;ref name="New White Paper press release"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Defence White Paper in 2015|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2014/apr/0404.htm|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
===Strategic objectives===
The paper outlines three "Strategic Defence Interests" as fundamentals for further planning:&lt;ref name="White Paper"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/docs/2016-defence-white-paper.pdf |title=2016 Defence White Paper |date=2016 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence |isbn=9780994168054 |pages=17–18 |access-date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A "secure, resilient Australia"{{snd}}the capability to "deter, deny and defeat" an attack on Australian territory by a foreign military power. A key part of this objective is Australia's [[ANZUS treaty|military alliance with the United States]].
#A "secure nearer region"{{snd}}including security partnerships with the governments and militaries of [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Timor Leste]], and other Pacific island nations.
#A "stable Indo-Pacific region and rules based global order"{{snd}}primarily, addressing rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, including the increased military power of the [[People's Republic of China]].

===Acquisitions===
The paper sets out a number of specific intended purchases of [[materiel]] and weaponry over the following 20 years, though some had been announced prior to the release of the paper. These include:&lt;ref name="White Paper2"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/docs/2016-defence-white-paper.pdf |title=2016 Defence White Paper |date=2016 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence |isbn=9780994168054 |pages=86–108 |access-date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2016 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar''' occurred in late 2016 when [[Myanmar]]'s [[Tatmadaw|armed forces]] and [[Myanmar Police Force|police]] started a major crackdown on [[Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]] in the country's northwestern region. The Burmese military have been accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide by various [[United Nations]] agencies, [[International Criminal Court]] officials, human rights groups, journalists, and governments including the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-mass-graves-latest-rohingya-slaughter-genocide-ap/ |title=AP finds mass graves, latest evidence of Rohingya genocide in Myanmar |date=1 February 2018 |access-date=10 April 2018 |publisher=CBS News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174445/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-mass-graves-latest-rohingya-slaughter-genocide-ap/# |archive-date=11 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingyas-20180313-story.html |title=U.N. genocide advisor: Myanmar waged 'scorched-earth campaign' against the Rohingya |date=13 March 2018 |access-date=10 April 2018 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174500/http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingyas-20180313-story.html# |archive-date=11 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/asia/myanmar-rohingya-un-violence-genocide-intl/index.html |title=UN official convinced of Myanmar Rohingya 'genocide' |last=Wilkinson |first=Bard |date=12 March 2018 |publisher=CNN |access-date=10 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174221/https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/asia/myanmar-rohingya-un-violence-genocide-intl/index.html# |archive-date=11 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=UN Security Council: End disgraceful inaction on Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis |date=11 December 2017 |publisher=Amnesty International |url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/un-security-council-end-disgraceful-inaction-on-myanmars-rohingya-crisis/ |access-date=10 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174225/https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/un-security-council-end-disgraceful-inaction-on-myanmars-rohingya-crisis/# |archive-date=11 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/tillerson-myanmar-ethnic-cleansing/index.html |title=Tillerson: Myanmar clearly 'ethnic cleansing' the Rohingya |last=Westcott |first=Ben |date=22 November 2017 |access-date=10 April 2018 |publisher=CNN |last2=Koran |first2=Laura |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410132738/https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/tillerson-myanmar-ethnic-cleansing/index.html# |archive-date=10 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/rohingya-crisis-icc-prosecutor-seeks-power-to-investigate-crimes-against-humanity|title='Hallmarks of genocide': ICC prosecutor seeks justice for Rohingya|accessdate=10 April 2018|publisher=Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410052257/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/rohingya-crisis-icc-prosecutor-seeks-power-to-investigate-crimes-against-humanity#|archive-date=10 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military crackdown on the Rohingya people has drawn criticism from the [[United Nations]] (which cited possible "crimes against humanity"), the human rights group [[Amnesty International]], the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the government of neighboring [[Bangladesh]], and the government of [[Malaysia]] (where many Rohingya refugees have fled). The Myanmar leader and [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] has particularly been criticized for her inaction and silence over the issue and for doing little to prevent military abuses. On 27 September 2018 members of the [[Canadian Parliament]] voted unanimously to dispossess Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi of her honorary Canadian citizenship for the atrocities against Rohingya Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1379086/world# |title=Canada strips Aung San Suu Kyi of honorary citizenship |access-date=30 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009030356/http://www.arabnews.com/node/1379086/world# |archive-date=9 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
The situation in Rakhine State is grim, in part due to a mix of long-term historical tensions between the Rakhine and Rohingya communities, socio-political conflict, socio-economic underdevelopment, and a long-standing marginalization of both Rakhine and Rohingya by the Government of Burma. The World Bank estimates Rakhine State has the highest poverty rate in Burma (78 percent) and is the poorest state in the country. The lack of investment by the central government has resulted in poor infrastructure and inferior social services, while lack of rule of law has led to inadequate security conditions.&lt;ref name="atrocities_report_2016_03_17_us_state_dept" /&gt;

Members of the Rohingya community in particular reportedly face abuses by the Government of Burma, including those involving torture, unlawful arrest and detention, restricted movement, restrictions on religious practice, and discrimination in employment and access to social services. In 2012, intercommunal conflict led to the death of nearly 200 Rohingya and the displacement of 140,000 people. Throughout 2013–2015 isolated incidents of violence against Rohingya individuals continued to take place.&lt;ref name="atrocities_report_2016_03_17_us_state_dept" /&gt;

The '''Band of the 10th of December''' was a secret [[Bonapartist]] society organized mainly from among [[lumpen proletariat]], opportunists, military leaders, etc. The society helped progress [[Napoleon III]]'s election as president of the Republic of [[France]] on December 10, 1848.

It is also known as "Society of December 10" and it is analyzed in great detail by [[Karl Marx]] in his essay [[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch05.htm|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon|accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ramgarh Local Battalion]] was established on 29 June 1795 at the city of [[Ramgarh Upazila|Ramgarh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BksqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ramgarh+Local+Battalion&amp;dq=Ramgarh+Local+Battalion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4l7KR1LvTAhVEQCYKHYifCzYQ6AEIUjAJ|title=South Asia Defence and Strategic Year Book|last=|first=|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Panchsheel|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=273|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 486 personnel, as the "Frontier Protection Force", under the command of the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJfcCPUr0OoC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Ramgarh+Local+Battalion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PT8uFyDw8W&amp;sig=rYaUl-hlxQMqPmmvLL7CWP-DRds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOvKCllIzSAhXFHxoKHaZGByQQ6AEIUjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ramgarh%20Local%20Battalion&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Bangladesh|last=Rahman|first=Syedur|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=|isbn=9780810874534|location=|pages=44|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the force was converted into a paramilitary unit with its own name (Ramgarh Local Battalion) and uniform. At that time its primary responsibility was to suppress insurgent activities around the Ramgarh area. 

==== Special Reserve Company ====
During 1799, the force established its first camp at [[Pilkhana, Bangladesh|Pilkhana]], where the headquarters remain to this day. The camp unit then was known as "Special Reserve Company".

==== Frontier Guards ====
The Ramgarh Local Battalion was renamed as the "Frontier Guards" and remained so for thirty years from 1861 to 1891. 

==== Bengal Military Police ====
From 1891 till 1920, the Frontier Guards were re-organized and re-equipped with modern weapons and renamed once again as the "Bengal Military Police".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Commanded by a [[Subedar]] (Senior Warrant Officer), the BMP had four companies located in [[Dhaka]], Dhumka and [[Gangtok]]. This force also participated in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQR6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;dq=Eastern+Frontier+Rifles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidj9zk6LvTAhXJKCYKHfaiAUIQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Eastern%20Frontier%20Rifles&amp;f=false|title=Indigenous Identity in South Asia: Making Claims in the Colonial Chittagong Hill Tracts|last=Chowdhury|first=Tamina M.|date=2016-11-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317202929|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Eastern Frontier Rifles ====
The BMP was reorganised yet once again and renamed as the "[[Eastern Frontier Rifles]]" in 1920. Its primary task was to protect the borders. It also took part in numerous military operations during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===East Pakistan Rifles===
After the [[partition of India]], "Eastern Frontier Rifles" was re-grouped and renamed as the "East Pakistan Rifles" in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqTIhTWuAXcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Eastern+Frontier+Rifles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidj9zk6LvTAhXJKCYKHfaiAUIQ6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Eastern%20Frontier%20Rifles&amp;f=false|title=The Bengal Borderland: Beyond State and Nation in South Asia|last=Schendel|first=Willem van|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Anthem Press|year=|isbn=9781843311454|location=|pages=108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the primary border protection force of the then East Pakistan. A number of Metropolitan Armed Police of Calcutta and some 1,000 ex-soldiers of West Pakistan merged into this force. Officers from the army were transferred to command and reorganise EPR. In 1958, it was also assigned the anti-smuggling duties on top of its primary role as the border guards. Major [[Tufail Mohammad]] was awarded the highest military award of Pakistan, '[[Nishan-e-Haider]]', for his action in the Laksmipur Operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/348152-Maj-Tufail-Shaheed-remembered-on-his-58th-death-a|title=Maj.

===Bangladesh Liberation War 1971===
During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971 nearly nine thousand of the members of the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR) turned against the [[Pakistan Army]], following the Declaration of Independence of Bangladesh on 26 March 1971 at Kalurghat Radio Station, Chittagong. Eight hundred and seventeen EPR personnel were subsequently reported as being killed in action. East Pakistan Rifles was the border security and anti-smuggling force stationed in what was to become independent Bangladesh. It was commanded by Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) at the company level. All EPR companies were based within 5 miles of the international boundary. There were two senior commissioned officers, seconded from the Pakistan Army in command of each Wing (battalion) of the EPR. In March 1971, there were 12 EPR Wings. The entire force according to CIA estimates had 10 thousand enlisted personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2017/03/09/east-pakistan-many-pro-pakistani-army-officers/|title=East Pakistan had many pro-Pakistani army officers {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|date=2017-03-09|work=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh Liberation war]] the EPR were the first Bengali military unit to defect from the Pakistan forces; moving to Sholashahar and the main military cantonment, while calling on all Bengali soldiers to join them. Reportedly West Pakistani officers serving with the EPR were executed by their Bengali colleagues. On 26 March, the Pakistan Army sent troops to suppress the EPR. The EPR ambushed them but the Pakistanis managed to encircle them. As a result, the EPR took heavy losses at Kumira. According to Captain Rafiq, "This ambush by the E.P.R. troops at Kumira was the first direct action against the enemy in the history of our liberation war."&lt;ref&gt;(Major Rafiq: A Tale of Millions, Page 56 and Aberar Shongram Shadhinotar Shongram, P:135, by: Lieutenant Colonel [[Abu Osman Chowdhury]]){{verify source|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January 1972, the East Pakistan Rifles was renamed the Bangladesh Rifles with the officers seconded from Bangladesh Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJfcCPUr0OoC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=1972+Bangladesh+Rifles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_4vSi6LvTAhXILSYKHeNkCXcQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1972%20Bangladesh%20Rifles&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Bangladesh|last=Rahman|first=Syedur|date=2010-04-27|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=|isbn=9780810874534|location=|pages=45|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh Rifles initially had 9 thousand personal in 1971 which by 1973 had increased to 20 thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm-bBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Bangladesh+Rifles+defense&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_j8eB77vTAhUHeCYKHUcHCG0Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bangladesh%20Rifles%20defense&amp;f=false|title=Bangladesh Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|last=USA|first=IBP|date=2012-03-03|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781438773896|location=|pages=161|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh Rifles and Indian [[Border Security Force]]s exchanged fired near the Comilla-Tripura border throughout the entire month of December 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/03/archives/india-and-bangladesh-trade-fire-in-border-dispute-negotiations.html|title=India and Bangladesh Trade Fire in Border Dispute|last=Times|first=Special To The New York|date=1979-12-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-24|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Bangladesh Rifles personal had grown to 69 thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFywfJunO1wC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Bangladesh+Rifles+defense&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_j8eB77vTAhUHeCYKHUcHCG0Q6AEIcTAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Bangladesh%20Rifles%20defense&amp;f=false|title=Bangladesh|last=Whyte|first=Mariam|last2=Yong|first2=Jui Lin|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=|isbn=9780761444756|location=|pages=38|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:BSF_and_BGB.JPG|thumb|BSF and BGB]]

===Bangladesh–India border clashes 2001===
The [[2001 Bangladesh–India border clashes|2001 Indian–Bangladeshi border conflict]] took place in the third week of April 2001 between companies of the Bangladesh Rifles and the Indian Border Security Force on the poorly marked international border between the two countries. This was the worst border conflict Bangladesh was involved in since Independence. The 16–19 April fighting took place around the village of Padua (known as Pyrdiwah in India), which adjoins the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]] and the Timbil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border have remained in dispute for the past 30 years. The trigger for the clash appears to have been an attempt by Indian forces to construct a footpath from an army outpost in Padua across a disputed territory some 300 metres wide to Indian Meghalaya.
On 15 April 2001, the BDR attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village.
Both sides later deescalated and returned to the original positions on the border. This incident left 16 Indian [[Border Security Force]] paramilitary men dead and 3 Border Guards Bangladesh men dead with 5 other BGB troops injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1284789.stm|title=Fresh Bangladesh border clash|date=19 April 2001|publisher=BBC|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These included the Director General of the BDR.

===Border Guards Bangladesh===
In the aftermath of the mutiny, the Bangladesh Rifles was reorganised with new recruits. The force is still commanded by senior officers seconded from the Bangladesh Army. The Bangladesh Rifles have gone through some fundamental changes since 2010. It was officially renamed as the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) on 23 January 2011 and reorganised with fresh recruits. The BGB has a current strength of 50,000&lt;ref name="kalerk"/&gt; organised into 61 battalions and largely located in numerous [[border outpost]]s (B.O.P.). Administration staff and most of the officer corps are trained by and seconded from the Bangladesh Army. However, there are around 100 officers promoted from within the force itself. The border guards also formed their own intelligence unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-102204|title=BDR to get new name, uniform, intelligence unit|date=2009-08-19|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Border Guard Bangladesh Act, 2010 increased the maximum punishment for mutiny from 7 years in jail to the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-155222|title=Firm fetters for border guards|date=2010-09-20|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh–Myanmar border skirmish 2015===
On 28 May 2014, during a routine patrol of the BGB in [[Bandarban District]], along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, [[Myanmar Border Police]] opened indiscriminate firing on the BGB patrol. The incident took the life of Border Guard Corporal Mizanur Rahman 43. The body of the slain soldier was then carried over the border by Myanmar Border Police. On 30 May upon request of the Myanmar Ambassador to Bangladesh a BGB team was waiting near border pillar no. 52 for identification of the dead body which was proposed by the Myanmar side. However, to the complete surprise of the BGB, Myanmar border forces suddenly started firing on the waiting BGB team without any provocation resulting in the BGB team returning fire. Both sides deescalated and agreed to a cease fire and on the following day Myanmar returned the dead body of BGB Corporal Mizanur Rahman. Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had protested strongly to the Burmese ambassador over the unprovoked eruption of gunfire by Burmese border troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/myanmar-returns-arms-ammo-of-slain-bgb-man-27159|title=Myanmar returns arms, ammo of slain BGB man|date=2014-06-05|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/myanmars-border-force-regrets-mizans-killing-27206|title=Myanmar's border force regrets Mizan's killing|date=2014-06-06|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future modernization programme==
BGB has adopted a long term modernization plan named "BGB Goal 2041" in 2017. The plan intends to make BGB a well-trained, well-equipped and technologically advanced force.

In short terms, BGB plans for structural and manpower expansion. A new region (equivalent to [[Division (military)|division]]) will be raised in [[Ramu]] of [[Cox's Bazar]]. Three new sectors (equivalent to [[brigade]]) will be raised at [[Ali Kadam Upazila|Ali Kadam]] of [[Bandarban]], [[Naogaon]] and [[Jessore]]. Eight new [[battalion]]s will be formed at [[Jhikargacha Upazila|Jhikargacha]] of [[Jessore]], [[Meherpur]], [[Khagrachari]], ''Boro Mowdok'' of [[Bandarban]], [[Gazipur]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Kulaura Upazila|Kulaura]] of [[Maulavibazar]]. Two riverine battalions will be raised in BGB at ''Nildumur'' of [[Shatkhira]] and [[Teknaf Upazila|Teknaf]] of [[Cox's Bazar]]. They are the first two units of BGB who will be able to operate in riverine borders and ''char''s ([[River island]]). The number of personnel will be increased from 50000 to 65000 soon. 124 ''Border Out Posts (BOP)'' and 70 heli-support BOPs  are being set up in the border areas of hilly districts along the border with Myanmar. 128 ''Border Sentri Posts (BSP)'' are being constructed between the distant BOPs. BGB members ae being equipped with [[bulletproof vest]]s and [[Combat helmet|ballistic helmet]].&lt;ref name="bgbday"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/prime-minister-sheikh-hasina-asks-border-guard-bangladesh-bgb-members-to-be-imbued-with-bonding-spirit-1507783| title=PM asks BGB members to be imbued with bonding spirit| publisher=The Daily Star| date=21 December 2017| accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Quick Response Force'' will be established for BGB. The force will work to supply modern arms and ammunition swiftly to border points in case of any emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://m.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/107551| title=BGB to introduce Quick Reaction Force| publisher=The Independent| date=4 August 2017| accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For smooth operation in the border areas, border roads are being constructed. In ''BGB day 2017'', prime minister said that the government has undertaken a plan to construct a total of 3,167&amp;nbsp;km ring road across the borders with India and Myanmar.&lt;ref name="bgbday"/&gt;

BGB intends to go three dimensional as per the plan. Bangladesh government has already approved the proposal for buying two [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-171E]] helicopters from Russia at a cost of Tk. 355.10 crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://m.theindependentbd.com/post/169673| title=Russian copters to turn BGB into 3-dimensional force | publisher=The Independent| date=9 October 2018| accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bangladesh Air Force]] pilots will fly the helicopters initially. A [[heliport]] with hanger is being set up at ''Baitul Izzat'' in [[Chittagong]]. Eventually, BGB plans to have four aviation wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://m.theindependentbd.com/post/55620| title=BGB wants aviation wing | publisher=The Independent| date=13 August 2016| accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To effectively monitor the border, BGB plans to add modern technology to the border management. The plan is to set up [[camera]]s, [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]] and [[Infrared detector|infrared sensors]] throughout the border. BGB plans to achieve 3I (Information, Identification, Intervention) capabilities in the border in long term. Having [[Radar]] and [[Satellite]] monitoring facilities in the border are also planned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Candelilla wax''' is a [[wax]] derived from the leaves of the small [[Candelilla]] shrub native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, ''Euphorbia cerifera'' and ''[[Euphorbia antisyphilitica]]'', from the family ''[[Euphorbiaceae]]''. It is yellowish-brown, hard, brittle, aromatic, and opaque to translucent.

== Composition and production==
With a [[melting point]] of 68.5–72.5 °C, candelilla wax consists of mainly [[hydrocarbon]]s (about 50%, chains with 29–33 carbons), [[ester]]s of higher molecular weight (20–29%), free acids (7–9%), and [[resin]]s (12–14%, mainly [[triterpenoid]] esters). The high hydrocarbon content distinguishes this wax from [[carnauba wax]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Uwe Wolfmeier,Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer,Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber "Waxes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is insoluble in water, but soluble in many organic [[solvent]]s such as [[acetone]], [[chloroform]], [[benzene]], and [[Turpentine]].

The wax is obtained by boiling the leaves and stems with dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and the resulting "cerote" is skimmed from the surface and further processed. In this way, about 900 tons are produced annually&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

== Uses ==
It is mostly used mixed with other waxes to harden them without raising their melting point.  As a [[food additive]], candelilla wax has the [[E number]] E&amp;nbsp;902 and is used as a [[glazing agent]]. It also finds use in [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] industry, as a component of [[lip balm]]s and lotion bars. One of its major uses is as a [[binder (material)|binder]] for [[chewing gum]]s.

Candelilla wax can be used as a substitute for [[carnauba wax]] and [[beeswax]]. It is also used for making [[varnish]].

'''Castle Park''' (sometimes referred to as '''Castle Green''') is a public open space in [[Bristol]], England, managed by [[Bristol City Council]]. It is bounded by the [[Floating Harbour]] and Castle Street to the south, Lower Castle Street to the east, and Broad Weir, Newgate and [[Wine Street, Bristol|Wine Street]] to the north. Its western boundary is less obviously defined and has been the subject of controversy, perhaps because the area around [[High Street, Bristol|High Street]] and [[St Mary le Port Church, Bristol|St Mary le Port Church]], though not part of the park and always intended for development, is often considered at the same time as the park.&lt;ref name="ffbparks"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fight for Bristol |first1=Gordon |last1=Priest |first2=Pamela |last2=Cobb |year=1980 |chapter=Open spaces |publisher=Bristol Civic Society and The Redcliffe Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Opened on 30 September 1978,&lt;ref name="ffbparks"/&gt; the park occupies the site of what was once Bristol's main shopping district. The area was largely destroyed by the [[Luftwaffe]] during the [[Bristol Blitz|Blitz]], and that which remained was subsequently demolished. In the years since the end of the Second World War, Castle Park has become home to a number of anti-fascist memorials.

The ruined tower of [[St Mary le Port Church, Bristol|St Mary-le-Port Church]] stands to the west of the park, surrounded by derelict financial office buildings. Adjoining the ruins of [[St Peter's Church, Castle Park, Bristol|St Peter's Church]] in the middle of the park is a sensory herb garden, and five silver birch trees as a memorial to the beaches of the [[D-Day landings]]. To the east is a grassy arena, and the partially excavated remains of [[Bristol Castle]] with a preserved vaulted chamber. There is also a bandstand and a children's play area.

Tree-lined St Peter's Square, to the north of St Peter's church, has been home to various events including German Christmas markets.&lt;ref name="germarket"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/German-Christmas-market-opens-Bristol/story-11312441-detail/story.html |title=German Christmas market opens in Bristol |work=This is Bristol |accessdate=12 November 2011 |date=20 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421121710/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/German-Christmas-market-opens-Bristol/story-11312441-detail/story.html |archivedate=21 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent summers a tethered balloon has been placed near the bandstand, offering ascents to sightseers.

Recent attempts to develop the area between the park's western edge and High Street have proved controversial; Bristol City Council are keen to replace derelict buildings with a [[mixed-use development]] to help reconnect the Old City to [[Broadmead]] and raise funds to improve the park; others would rather see the park extended to High Street.

==History==
[[File:Cat and Wheel tavern, Castle Green Bristol.jpg|thumb|upright|Cat and Wheel Tavern, corner of Castle Green and Peter Street, in about 1888]]
[[File:Castle Green Bristol.jpg|thumb|upright|Cock and Bottle Lane seen from Castle Green in the late 19th century]]
The town of Bristol was settled at some time in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period on the northern or [[Mercia]]n side of a crossing point of the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], at or near to the present [[Bristol Bridge]]. The town lay entirely between the Avon and the [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]], which at that time emerged into the Avon just downstream of Bristol Bridge.&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of Bristol |first=Bryan |last=Little |publisher=Redcliffe Press |year=1991 |page=6 |isbn=1-872971-40-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological excavations of the area in 1962-1963 suggest that the original settlement was centred to the east of St Peter's Church, with Mary-le-Port on its western limit. The building of Bristol Castle in the latter part of the 11th century resulted in the focus of the settlement being moved to the west, where it developed into a symmetrical plan centred on the crossroads of High Street, Wine Street, [[Broad Street, Bristol|Broad Street]] and [[Corn Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mary-le-Port Bristol Excavations 1962/3 |first1=Lorna |last1=Watts |first2=Philip |last2=Rahtz |publisher=City of Bristol Museums and Art Gallery |year=1985 |isbn=0-900199-26-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area around Mary-le-Port Street was thus the most ancient part of the mediaeval city. [[Bristol Castle]] was home to the Norman garrison, and was a massive structure whose keep was comparable to that of the Tower of London. The castle occupied the whole of the eastern end of today's Castle park, from just east of St Peter's Church to Lower Castle Street.&lt;ref name="dottyb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Dorothy |title=Bristol and how it grew |page=3 |year=1974 |publisher=Bristol Visual &amp; Environmental Group, with the help of a grant from the South West Arts Association |location=Bristol |isbn=0-9504648-2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1612 [[Robert Aldworth]], Mayor of Bristol, rebuilt [[St Peter's Hospital, Bristol|St Peter's Hospital]] on a site between St Peter's Church and the Floating Harbour. This 'beautiful house with its elaborate carving' became the Bristol Mint in 1695, and was considered to be Bristol's greatest architectural loss of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bristol as it Was 1939-1914 (5th Edition) |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1978 |publisher=Reece Winstone |page=16 |isbn=0-900814-54-3 |authorlink=Reece Winstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bristol's Earliest Photographs |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1978 |publisher=Reece Winstone |page=44 |isbn=0-900814-32-2 |authorlink=Reece Winstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century the castle was 'tending to ruin', and following his victory in the [[English Civil War]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chilcott's descriptive history of Bristol |first=John |last=Chilcott |publisher=J Chilcott |year=1826}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards [[Old Market, Bristol|Old Market]]. The demolition of Lawford's Gate at the eastern end of Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.&lt;ref name="charappr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/33832/old-market-character-appraisal-red-2.pdf/be5c0518-7d70-4604-9f34-9fbc49169c3e |title=Conservation area 16&amp;nbsp;– Old Market&amp;nbsp;– Character appraisal |publisher=Bristol City Council |date=July 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081134/https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/33832/old-market-character-appraisal-red-2.pdf/be5c0518-7d70-4604-9f34-9fbc49169c3e |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wine Street and Castle Street became the main shopping streets, where retailers such as [[Boots UK|Boots]], Jones's (later to become part of the [[Debenhams]] group), the [[The Co-operative brand|Co-op]] and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] traded. Baker Baker had large stores in Bridge Street, Wine Street and [[Mary le Port Street, Bristol|Mary le Port Street]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bristol &amp; Co |first=Helen |last=Reid |year=1987 |publisher=Redcliffe Press |isbn=0-948265-61-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  two of these were connected by a high bridge across Mary-le-Port Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bristol Blitzed |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1973 |publisher=Reece Winstone |page=30 |isbn=0-900814-43-8 |authorlink=Reece Winstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area also hosted a cinema (the News Theatre) and its narrow winding back-streets contained many independent shops, hotels, and pubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/tags/streetplan |title=brizzle born and bred's photostream/Tags/streetplan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629162442/http://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/tags/streetplan |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the corner of High Street and Wine Street stood the 'most loved fragment of Old Bristol': The [[The Dutch House, Bristol|Dutch House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bristol Blitzed |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1973 |publisher=Reece Winstone |page=26 |isbn=0-900814-43-8 |authorlink=Reece Winstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bombing of 24 November 1940===
{{See also|Bristol Blitz}}
On the afternoon of 24 November 1940, 148 aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] left airfields in Northern France heading for Bristol. The concentration point was to be the [[Bristol Harbour|City Docks]], and their objective was to destroy Bristol's industry and port facilities. 135 aircraft reached the target area, and dropped {{convert|156,250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of high explosives, {{convert|4,750|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of oil bombs and 12,500 incendiaries. As the raid progressed, the fires could be seen from {{convert|250|km|mi}} away. Wide areas of the city were struck, but the most concentrated damage occurred in the area between Broad Quay and [[Old Market, Bristol|Old Market]] where fierce fires burnt through the night. By the morning, 200 Bristolians were dead and 689 injured, four Luftwaffe crewmen were dead, one injured and four captured, two aircraft were lost, and a large part of the historic heart of Bristol was a smouldering ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fishponds.org.uk/luftbri1.html |title=The Luftwaffe over the Bristol area 1940-44, page 1 |work=Fishponds Local History Society |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051036/http://fishponds.org.uk/luftbri1.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction was not total, however.

===Replanning===
[[File:Castle Green and Broadmead redevelopment - geograph.org.uk - 541958.jpg|Redevelopment around Castle Green and Broadmead, viewed from the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]]|thumb]]
The idea that Bristol's main shopping area should be moved away from the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. They suggested that the pre-war shopping area should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and that the central shopping area should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal of the shopping area was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.&lt;ref name="has6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Replanning the blitzed city centre |first=Junichi |last=Hasegawa |chapter=6 Replanning the city centre: Bristol 1940-45 |publisher=Open University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-335-15633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objection to this plan came from the independent traders who did not wish to relocate because they felt that the proposed new shopping area was 'off the beaten track'.&lt;ref name="has6" /&gt; This objection was not unreasonable, as in its pre-war topography Bristol had a long shopping axis that started at Stapleton Road to the east, passed through [[Old Market, Bristol|Old Market]] into Castle Street, Wine Street, and [[St Nicholas Market|the City Markets]], and then via [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]] and [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] to Queens Road and [[Whiteladies Road]]. Moving the central shopping area would break this axis. There was also concern about the serious negative social and economic impacts of 'sterilising' such a large area in the centre of the city.&lt;ref name="has6" /&gt; However, when the Bristol Retail Traders Federation, representing the small traders, produced a poll showing that 13,000 people wished to retain the shopping centre on its current site whereas only 400 preferred to see it moved, the local Labour party dismissed the poll describing it as 'undemocratic' and comparing the Federation's methods to those of Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Replanning the blitzed city centre |first=Junichi |last=Hasegawa |chapter=7 City planning in the immediate aftermath of war: 1946 |publisher=Open University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-335-15633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1966, the shops had been rebuilt in 'barren' Broadmead (at the expense of demolishing an area of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed),&lt;ref name="ffbsetscene"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fight for Bristol |first1=Gordon |last1=Priest |first2=Pamela |last2=Cobb |year=1980 |chapter=Setting the Scene: Planning in Bristol since 1945 |publisher=Bristol Civic Society and The Redcliffe Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used for car parking.&lt;ref name="ffbparks" /&gt; The picturesque area around Narrow Wine Street and Castle Mill Street had been demolished to create modern Newgate, and Old Market, severed from Bristol's shopping axis by the new Temple Way Underpass and the destruction of Castle Street, was in serious decline.&lt;ref name="ffburbren"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fight for Bristol |first1=Gordon |last1=Priest |first2=Pamela |last2=Cobb |year=1980 |chapter=Urban renewal |publisher=Bristol Civic Society and The Redcliffe Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan for Castle Park was crystallising, however. The ruined St Peter's Church would be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park. The south-western corner nearest [[Bristol Bridge]] would contain a riverside hotel, and the north-western corner would be home to 'a block for cultural, professional and exhibition purposes'.&lt;ref name="ffbparks" /&gt;

In the event, the north-western corner was leased to the Bank of England and [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Insurance]] (whose offices now stand derelict), and the critical corner site where the Dutch House had stood was replaced by a link road to a short section of dual-carriageway linking High Street with Wine Street.&lt;ref name="ffbparks" /&gt; Plans for a civic centre were dropped as being too expensive.

Finally, in 1977, work began on an emasculated version of the new park. This was designed by Bristol City Council's parks department and, largely for financial reasons, it contained few of the features intended by earlier plans&lt;ref name="ffbparks" /&gt; but was much larger than that originally planned.  The last remaining vestiges of the mediaeval street plan, Dolphin Street and Peter Street, were buried.

===Mary-le-Port development===
[[File:St Mary le Port tower Bristol.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Tower of ruined St Mary le Port with derelict building in foreground |St Mary-le-Port church, surrounded by dereliction]]
In 2006, Bristol City Council announced its intention to redevelop the area to the west of Castle Park, known as the 'Mary-le-Port' site. These plans encompassed the by then derelict financial buildings, and the area to the west of St Peter's church, about 5% of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7758439.stm |title=Inquiry to look at park's future |work=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=1 March 2011 |date=1 December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206090350/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7758439.stm |archivedate=6 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be a {{convert|400,000|sqft|m2}} mixed-use development to 'regenerate this historic heart of Bristol'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deeleyfreed.co.uk |title=St Mary-le-Port, Bristol |accessdate=1 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514235036/http://www.deeleyfreed.co.uk/ |archivedate=14 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 'improve connections between Broadmead, the Old City and Redcliffe' and 'enhance the setting of St Mary-le-Port church'.&lt;ref name="reconsider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6156628.stm |title=Plans for city park reconsidered |work=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=1 March 2011 |date=16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council selected Deeley Freed as its preferred developer.
The scheme provoked opposition from park users who felt that any reduction in the area of the park was not acceptable. 'Surprised by the extent of feeling', Bristol City Council decided to revise the plans.&lt;ref name="reconsider" /&gt; Campaigners then applied to have 'Town Green' status applied to the park, but this was declined in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Town and Village Greens |url=http://www.bristolparksforum.org.uk/BristolTG.pdf |publisher=Bristol Parks Forum |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Mary-le-Port site was listed as being 'for sale' by Bristol City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/City-plot-sales-net-163-50m/article-2342360-detail/article.html |title=Bristol City Council plot sales could net £50million if it sells four sites in centre |work=Bristol Evening Post |accessdate=1 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626141600/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/City-plot-sales-net-163-50m/article-2342360-detail/article.html |archivedate=26 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castle Bridge===

== History ==
[[File:United World Federalists license-plate topper.jpg|thumb|A promotional license plate topper]]
Following World War II, the notion of [[World Federalism|world federalism]] took root in the formal legal creation and ratification of the [[United Nations]] and an entire further system of [[International organization|international organizations]]. Five world federalist organizations merged in 1947 to form the United World Federalists, Inc., later renamed World Federalists-USA. In 1975, the organization turned its focus to educational activities as the World Federalist Association (WFA), while members who wanted to continue political action efforts formed the Campaign for UN Reform (CUNR). The two groups merged as Citizens for Global Solutions (CGS) in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cnpsweb.org/project/citizens-for-global-solutions/|title=Citizens for Global Solutions {{!}} Center for Nonprofit Strategies|last=|first=|date=|website=cnpsweb.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil service examinations''' (also '''public tendering''') are examinations implemented in various countries for recruitment and admission to the [[civil service]]. They are intended as a method to achieve an effective, rational [[public administration]] on a [[merit system]] for recruiting prospective politicians and public sector employees.

The most ancient example of such exams were the [[imperial examination]]s of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]].

'''Deception technology''' is an emerging category of [[cyber security]] defense.  Deception technology products can detect, analyze, and defend against [[zero-day attack|zero-day]] and advanced attacks, often in real time.  They are automated, accurate,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Pingree quotes in article: {{cite web|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3113055/security/deception-technology-grows-and-evolves.html|title=Deception technology grows and evolves|work=CSO Online|author=Maria Korolov|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide insight into malicious activity within [[internal network]]s which may be unseen by other types of cyber defense. Deception technology enables a more proactive security posture by seeking to deceive the attackers, detect them and then defeat them, allowing the enterprise to return to normal operations.

Existing [[Defense in depth (computing)|defense-in-depth]] cyber technologies have struggled against the increasing wave of sophisticated and persistent human attackers.  These technologies seek primarily to defend a perimeter, but both [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Endpoint security|end-point security]] cannot defend a perimeter with 100% certainty. [[Cyber-attack]]ers can penetrate these networks and move unimpeded for months, stealing data and [[intellectual property]]. [[Heuristics]] may find an attacker within the network, but often generate so many alerts that critical alerts are missed. Since 2014 attacks have accelerated and there is evidence that cyber-attackers are penetrating traditional defenses at a rapidly increasing rate.

Deception technology considers the human attacker's point of view and methodology for exploiting and navigating networks to identify and [[Data theft|exfiltrate]] data. It integrates with existing technologies to provide new visibility into the internal networks, share high probability alerts and threat intelligence with the existing infrastructure.

==Technology: high level view==

Deception technology automates the creation of traps (decoys) and/or lures which are mixed among and within existing [[IT]] resources to provide a layer of protection to stop attackers that have penetrated the [[Computer network|network]]. Traps (decoys) are IT [[Asset (computer security)|assets]] that either use real licensed [[operating system]] software, or are emulations of these devices.

Traps (decoys) which use emulations can also imitate [[medical device]]s, [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/paymentweek/docs/pq2016_2020_final2|title=Payments Week Issue - go to page 42|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail point of sale systems, switches, routers and much more. Lures are generally real information technology resources (files of varying kinds) which are placed on actual IT assets.

Upon penetrating the network, attackers seek to establish a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and then use this to identify and exfiltrate data and intellectual property. They begin moving laterally through the internal [[VLAN]]s and almost immediately will "look at" one of the traps (decoys). Interacting with one of these "decoys" will trigger an alert.  These alerts are very high probability and almost always coincide to an ongoing attack.  The deception is designed to lure the attacker in – the attacker may consider this a worthy asset and continue by injecting [[malware]].  Deception technology generally allows for automated static and dynamic analysis of this injected malware and provides these reports through automation to the security operations personnel.  Deception technology may also identify, through indicators of compromise (IOC), suspect end-points that are part of the compromise cycle.  Automation also allows for an automated memory analysis of the suspect end-point, and then automatically isolating the suspect end-point.  Many partner integrations allow for a variety of implementation paths for existing enterprise and government customers.

==Specialized applications==

[[Internet of things|Internet of things (IoT)]] devices are not usually scanned by legacy defense in depth cyber defense and remain prime targets for attackers within the network.  Deception technology can identify attackers moving laterally into the network from within these devices.

Integrated [[turnkey]] devices that utilize [[embedded operating system]]s, but do not allow these operating systems to be scanned or closely protected by embedded end-point or intrusion detection software are also well protected by a deception technology deployment in the same network. Examples include [[SCADA|process control systems (SCADA)]] used in many manufacturing applications on a global basis. Deception technology has been associated with the discovery of [[Zombie Zero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtmarko/2014/07/10/trojan-hardware-spreads-apts/|title=How a Scanner Infected Corporate Systems and Stole Data: Beware Trojan Peripherals|first=Kurt|last=Marko|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[attack vector]] wherein deception technology identified an attacker utilizing malware embedded in [[barcode reader]]s which were manufactured overseas.

[[Medical device]]s are particular vulnerable to cyber attacks within the healthcare networks.  As [[FDA]]-certified devices they are closed systems and not accessible to standard cyber defense software. Deception technology can surround and protect these devices and identify attackers using these for backdoor placement and data exfiltration. Recent documented cyber attacks on medical devices include [[x-ray machine]]s, [[CT scan]]ners, [[MRI]] scanners, [[blood gas]] analyzers, [[Picture Archiving and Communication System|PACS]] systems and many more. Networks utilizing these devices can be protected by deception technology. This attack vector, called [[MEDJACK|medical device hijack or medjack]], is estimated to have penetrated many hospitals worldwide.{{failed verification|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgicalproductsmag.com/article/2016/07/dangerous-state-medical-cybersecurity|title=The Dangerous State of Medical Cybersecurity|date=13 July 2016|publisher=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized deception technology products are now capable of addressing the rise in [[ransomware]]. Select products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/trapx-launches-ransomware-deception-tool-cryptotrap|title=TrapX launches ransomware deception tool, CryptoTrap|date=25 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can deceive ransomware into engaging in an attack on a decoy resource, while isolating the infection points and alerting the cyber defense software team.

==History==

[[Honeypot (computing)|Honeypots]] were perhaps the first very simple form of deception.  A honeypot appeared simply as an unprotected information technology resource and presented itself in an attractive way to a prospective attacker already within the network.  The notion of honeypots deceiving attackers, perhaps delaying and identifying them, and then ultimately supporting efforts to shut down the attack was a good one.  Potential benefits aside, most early honeypots exhibit challenges with functionality, integrity and overall efficacy in meeting these goals. Key was the lack of automation that enabled broad scale of deployment. A deployment strategy would seek to cover the enterprise where up to tens of thousands of VLANS must be protected won't be economically efficient using manual processes and manual configuration.

The gap between legacy honeypots and modern deception technology has diminished over time and will continue to do so. Modern honeypots constitute the low end of the deception technology space today.

==Differentiation from competitive/cooperative technologies==
{{see also|Alarm fatigue}}
Traditional cyber defense technologies, such as firewalls and end-point security, generate many alerts. In a large enterprise the alert volume may reach, in some cases, millions of alerts per day. Security operations personnel cannot process most of the activity easily, yet it only takes one successful penetration to compromise an entire network.

Deception technology produces alerts that are the end product of a [[Binary number|binary]] process. Probability is essentially reduced to two values:  0% and 100%.  Any party that seeks to identify, [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]], enter, view any trap (decoy) or utilizes a lure is immediately identified by this behavior. Anyone touching these traps or lures should not be doing so.  This is an advantage over heuristics and probability-based approaches and the many thousands of extraneous alerts these techniques generate.

Best practice shows that deception technology is not a stand-alone strategy.  Deception technology is an additional compatible layer to the existing defense-in-depth cyber defense.  Partner integrations make it most useful and the goal is to add protection for the most advanced and sophisticated human attackers that will successfully penetrate the perimeter.

==Market size and adoption==
The technical innovation of deception technology been received by the market.  An [[industry analyst]] identified ten top technologies for information security in 2016, one of which were deception technology. 

An industry analyst predicted in August 2016 that the deception technology market is currently (in 2016) approximately $50 to $100 million globally, and further predicted $100 million to $200 million in revenue by 2018.  This same analyst earlier noted that, "by 2018 ... 10 percent of enterprises will use deception tools and tactics, and actively participate in deception operations against attackers". [[Gartner]] also noted deception technology as a "far underutilized technology that can provide serious advantages over attackers (cyber attackers)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/lawrence-pingree/2016/09/28/deception-related-technology-its-not-just-a-nice-to-have-its-a-new-strategy-of-defense/|title=Deception related technology - its not just a "nice to have", it's a new strategy of defense - Lawrence Pingree|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other important analysts have recently predicted a market size exceeding $1 billion by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3113444/security/deception-technology-grows-and-evolves.html|title=Deception technology grows and evolves|first=Maria|last=Korolov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is being fueled, in part, by continued, highly visible targeted attacks on large enterprise and government institutions globally.

Market Research Media estimates the cumulative deception technology market value at $12 billion (2017–2022), growing at about 19% CAGR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketanalysis.com/?p=398|title=Deception Cybersecurity Market Forecast 2017-2022|date=9 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic globalization''' is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two others being [[political globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]], as well as the general term of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|first=Salvatore|last=Babones|editor=George Ritzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economic globalization refers to the widespread international movement of goods, capital, services, technology and information. It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of [[cross-border]] movement of goods, services, technologies and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 19309"&gt;{{cite book|first=Rakesh Mohan |last=Joshi|title=International Business|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AL9cPgAACAAJ}}|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-19-568909-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[globalization]] is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and marketization, and by developments in science and technology.{{sfn|Gao|2000|p=4}}

Economic globalization primarily comprises the globalization of production, finance, markets, technology, organizational regimes, institutions, corporations, and labour.&lt;ref name="James et al., vols. 1-4 2007"&gt;James et al., vols. 1–4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has been expanding since the emergence of [[International trade|trans-national trade]], it has grown at an increased rate due to an increase in communication and technological advances under the framework of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and [[World Trade Organization]], which made countries gradually cut down trade barriers and open up their current accounts and capital accounts.{{sfn|Gao|2000|p=4}} This recent boom has been largely supported by [[Developed country|developed economies]] integrating with majority world through [[foreign direct investment]] and lowering costs of doing business, the reduction of [[trade barrier]]s, and in many cases cross border migration

While globalization has radically increased incomes and economic growth in developing countries and lowered consumer prices in developed countries, it also changes the power balance between developing and developed countries and affects the culture of each affected country. And the shifting location of goods production has caused many jobs to cross borders, requiring some workers in developed countries to change careers.&lt;ref name="James et al., vols. 1-4 2007"/&gt;

== Evolution of globalization  ==
{{Main|History of globalization}}

=== History ===

International [[commodity markets]], [[labor markets]], and [[capital markets]] make up the economy and define economic globalization.&lt;ref name=whatis/&gt;

Beginning as early as 6500 BCE, people in [[Syria]] were trading livestock, tools, and other items. In [[Sumer]], an early civilization in [[Mesopotamia]], a token system was one of the first forms of commodity money. Labor markets consist of workers, employers, wages, income, supply and demand. Labor markets have been around as long as commodity markets. The first labor markets provided workers to grow crops and tend livestock for later sale in local markets. Capital markets emerged in industries that require resources beyond those of an individual farmer.&lt;ref name=theeffects/&gt;

=== Technology ===
Globalization is about interconnecting people around the world beyond the physical barrier of geographical boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[Sumaira Aman 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

These advances in economic globalization were disrupted by [[World War I]]. Most of the global economic powers constructed [[Protectionism|protectionist]] economic policies and introduced trade barriers that slowed trade growth to the point of stagnation.{{sfn|CEPAL|2002|p=105}} This caused a slowing of worldwide trade and even led to other countries introducing immigration caps. Globalization did not fully resume until the 1970s, when governments began to emphasize the benefits of trade.{{sfn|Raynolds|Murray|Wilkinson|2007|p=3}} Today, follow-on advances in technology have led to the rapid expansion of global trade.{{sfn|Raynolds|Murray|Wilkinson|2007|p=15}}

Three suggested factors accelerated economic globalization: advancement of science and technology, market oriented economic reforms, and contributions by multinational corporations.{{sfn|Raynolds|Murray|Wilkinson|2007|p=3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Vladimir|title=The world transformed 1945 to the present|date=May 1, 2017|publisher=Michael H.hunt|pages=427–429|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1956 invention of [[shipping container|containerized shipping]], along with increases in ship sizes, were a major part of the reduction in shipping costs.&lt;ref name=racebottom/&gt;{{sfn|Gao|2000}}

=== Policy and government ===

The [[GATT]]/[[WTO]] framework led participating countries to reduce their [[tariff]] and [[non-tariff barrier]]s to trade. Governments shifted their economies from central planning to markets. These internal reforms allowed enterprises to adapt more quickly and exploit opportunities created by technology shifts.&lt;ref name=antisweat/&gt;

Multinational corporations reorganized production to take advantage of these opportunities. Labor-intensive production migrated to areas with lower labor costs, later followed by other functions as skill levels increased. Networks raised the level of wealth consumption and geographical mobility. This highly dynamic worldwide system and powerful ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Vladimir|title=The world transformed 1945 to the present|date=May 1, 2017|publisher=Michael H.hunt|pages=427–429|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 1986, the [[London Stock Exchange]] enacted newly [[Deregulation|deregulated]] rules that enabled global interconnection of [[Financial markets|markets]], with an expectation of huge increases in market activity. This event came to be known as the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]].

== Global actors ==

=== International governmental organizations ===

An [[intergovernmental organization]] or [[Intergovernmental organization|international governmental organization]] (IGO) refers to an entity created by treaty, involving two or more nations, to work in good faith, on issues of common interest. IGO’s strive for peace, security and deal with economic and social questions.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/opia/what-is-public-interest-law/public-international-law/intergovernmental-organizations-igos/|title=Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs) {{!}} Harvard Law School|last=School|first=Harvard Law|newspaper=Harvard Law School|access-date=2016-12-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001015/http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/opia/what-is-public-interest-law/public-international-law/intergovernmental-organizations-igos/|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include: [[United Nations|The United Nations]], [[World Bank|The World Bank]] and on a regional level [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|The North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] among others.

=== International non-governmental organizations (NGOs)===
:For more information, reference [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organization (NGO)]]
Despite its activity within one nation, NGOs work towards solutions that can benefit undeveloped countries that face the backlash of economic globalization. Classified as any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national or international level. NGOs perform various services and humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngo.org/ngoinfo/define.html|title=DEFINITION OF NGOS|website=www.ngo.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multinational corporations ===

One of the many changes they have brought to developing countries is increased [[automation]], which may damage less-automated local firms and require their workers to develop new skills in order to transition into the changing economy, leaving some behind. The necessary education infrastructure is often not present, requiring a redirection of the government’s focus from social services to education.&lt;ref name=theeffects&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/effects-economic-globalization-developing-countries-3906.html|title=The Effects of Economic Globalization on Developing Countries|last=Mohr|first=Angie|publisher=Demand Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations have outsourced in recent years. In [[business]], [[outsourcing]]  involves the [[contract]]ing out of a [[business process]] (e.g. payroll processing, claims processing) and operational, and/or non-core functions (e.g. manufacturing, [[facility management]], call center support) to another party (see also [[business process outsourcing]]).

ECLAC states that in order to create better economic relations globally, international lending agencies must work with developing countries to change how and where credit is concentrated as well as work towards accelerating financial development in developing countries.{{sfn|CEPAL|2002|p=102}} ECLAC further suggests that the United Nations expand its agenda to work more rigorously with international lending agencies and that they become more inclusive of all nations. Key factors in achieving universal competition is the spread of knowledge at the State level through education, training and technological advancements.{{sfn|CEPAL|2002|p=105}} Economist [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] suggested that programs to help developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ycsg.yale.edu/activities/files/Bhagwati5-13-04.pdf|title=Globalization with a Human Face|last=Bhagwati|first=Jagdish|year=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025552/http://www.ycsg.yale.edu/activities/files/Bhagwati5-13-04.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several movements, such as the [[fair trade]] movement and the [[anti-sweatshop movement]], claim to promote a more socially just global economy. The fair trade movement works towards improving trade, development and production for disadvantaged producers. The fair trade movement has reached 1.6 billion US dollars in annual sales.{{sfn|Raynolds|Murray|Wilkinson|2007|p=3}} The movement works to raise consumer awareness of exploitation of developing countries.  Fair trade works under the motto of "trade, not aid", to improve the quality of life for farmers and merchants by participating in direct sales, providing better prices and supporting the community.{{sfn|Raynolds|Murray|Wilkinson|2007|p=15}} Meanwhile, the anti-sweatshop movement is to protest the unfair treatment caused by some companies. Some global brands were found to do that before but they took some methods to support the labors soon after. The movement is taken to decrease the wrongdoing and gain the profits for labors.&lt;ref name=antisweat&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/clothes/nike041805.php|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Puts the Heat on Nike, Gap, and Levi's|last=unknown|first=unknown|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race to the bottom ====

{{Main article|Race to the bottom}}
Globalization is sometimes perceived as a cause of a phenomenon called the "race to the bottom" that implies that multinational companies are constantly attempting to maintain or increase their influence in countries that are already reliant on foreign investment alone. Multinationals tend to target export dependent countries. Due to a rise in competition, underdeveloped countries are undercutting their competitors through lowering their labor standards thus lowering the labor costs for the multinational companies investing into them. Companies will deliberately move into countries with the most relaxed laws and regulations for labor standards allowing them to do whatever they want. This results in factories with harsh labor conditions, low wages, and job insecurity.&lt;ref name=racebottom&gt;Olney, W. W. (2013). "A race to the bottom? Employment protection and foreign direct investment." ''Journal of International Economics'', 91(2), 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Irreversibility ==

According to prominent Chinese economist Gao Shangquan, economic globalization is an irreversible trend due to the fact that world markets are in great need of science and information technologies. With the growing demands of science and technology, Gao states that with world markets take on an "increasing cross-border division of labor".{{sfn|Gao|2000}}

However, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Robert Gilpin]] argues that nations' economic policies have mistakenly slowed their own growth by resisting globalization, showing that globalization is not irreversible.&lt;ref name="LittleSmith2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard |last1=Little|first2=Michael |last2=Smith|title=Perspectives on World Politics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=FgUrOkU-Tu4C|p=51}}|date=27 October 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-30052-7|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio L.

=== Economic growth and poverty reduction ===

Economic growth accelerated and poverty declined globally following the acceleration of globalization. {{quote|Per capita GDP growth in the post-1980 globalizers accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth is even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries did much worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial."&lt;ref name="International Monetary Fund"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dollar | first1=David| last2=Kraay | first2=Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Newest one growth rate.png|thumb|right|300px|Growth Rate of Real GDP per capita]]

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], growth benefits of economic globalization are widely shared.  While several globalizers have seen an increase in inequality, most notably China, this increase in inequality is a result of domestic liberalization, restrictions on internal migration, and agricultural policies, rather than a result of international trade.&lt;ref name="International Monetary Fund" /&gt;

Poverty has been reduced as evidenced by a 5.4 percent annual growth in income for the poorest fifth of the population of Malaysia.  Even in China, where inequality continues to be a problem, the poorest fifth of the population saw a 3.8 percent annual growth in income.  In several countries, those living below the dollar-per-day poverty threshold declined. In China, the rate declined from 20 to 15 percent and in Bangladesh the rate dropped from 43 to 36 percent.&lt;ref name="International Monetary Fund"/&gt;

Globalizers are narrowing the per capita income gap between the rich and the globalizing nations.  China, India, and Bangladesh, once among the poorest countries in the world, have greatly narrowed inequality due to their economic expansion.&lt;ref name="International Monetary Fund"/&gt;

=== Global supply chain ===
{{Main article|Global Value Chain}}
The global supply chain consists of complex interconnected networks that allow companies to produce handle and distribute various goods and services to the public worldwide.

Corporations manage their supply chain to take advantage of cheaper costs of production. A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from [[Vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] to [[customer]]. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of [[natural resource]]s, [[raw material]]s, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozlenkova|first=Irina V.|last2=Hult|first2=G.

==== Labor unions ====
{{Main article|Trade union}}
[[Labor unions in the United States|Labor unions]] were established during [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] as a solution to poor and unregulated  working conditions. Unregulated businesses allowed for low wages, job insecurity and poor working conditions. [[Trade union]]s responded by implementing a technique called [[collective bargaining]], where the workers could legally negotiate wages as well as working conditions. As a direct result, [[Labor rights|labors rights]] increased as [[policy]] and regulation were enforced. Alongside globalization, outsourcing developed which increased [[corporate capitalism|corporate power]]. As a solution, Labor Unions continue to fight for global labor rights standards through [[Transnational organization|trans-national organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beladi|first=Hamid|last2=Chao|first2=Chi-Chur|last3=Hollas|first3=Daniel|date=2013-06-01|title=Does globalization weaken labor unions in developing countries?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09638199.2011.578752|journal=The Journal of International Trade &amp; Economic Development|volume=22|issue=4|pages=562–71|doi=10.1080/09638199.2011.578752|issn=0963-8199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capital flight ===
{{Main article|Capital flight|Liquidity crisis}}

{{See also|Sudden stop (economics)|Tax exporting|Capital strike|Illicit financial flows}}

[[File:Argentina trade chart.svg|thumb|right|The [[Argentine economic crisis]] of 2001 caused in a currency devaluation and capital flight which resulted in a sharp drop in imports.]]

Capital flight occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country because of that country's recent increase in unfavorable financial conditions such as [[tax]]es, [[tariff]]s, [[labor costs]], [[government debt]] or [[capital controls]]. This is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the [[exchange rate]] of the affected country or a forced [[devaluation]] for countries living under [[fixed exchange rate]]s. Currency declines improve the [[terms of trade]], but reduce the monetary value of financial and other assets in the country. This leads to decreases in the [[purchasing power]] of the country's assets.

A 2008 paper published by [[Global Financial Integrity]] estimated capital flight to be leaving developing countries at the rate of "$850 billion to $1 trillion a year."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/executive%20-%20final%20version%201-5-09.pdf Illicit Financial Flows From Developing Countries: 2002–2006, Dev Kar and Devon Cartwright-Smith, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; But capital flight also affects developed countries. A 2009 article in ''[[The Times]]'' reported that hundreds of wealthy financiers and entrepreneurs had recently fled the [[United Kingdom]] in response to recent tax increases, relocating to low tax destinations such as [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]], the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6954613.ece Hundreds of bosses flee UK over 50% tax], The Times, 13 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 the scale of [[Greece|Greek]] capital flight in the wake of the first [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|"undecided" legislative election]] was estimated at €4 billion a week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9270884/Debt-crisis-Greek-euro-exit-looms-closer-as-banks-crumble.html Greek Euro exit looms closer as banks crumble]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital flight can cause [[liquidity crisis|liquidity crises]] in directly affected countries and can cause related difficulties in other countries involved in [[international commerce]] such as shipping and finance. Asset holders may be forced into distress sales. Borrowers typically face higher loan costs and [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] requirements, compared to periods of ample liquidity, and [[unsecured debt]] is nearly impossible to obtain. Typically, during a liquidity crisis, the [[interbank lending market]] stalls.

=== Inequality ===
{{Main article|Economic inequality|International inequality}}

While within-country income inequality has increased throughout the globalization period, globally inequality has lessened as developing countries have experienced much more rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1596/1813-9450-6259| title = Global Income Inequality by the Numbers: In History and Now – An Overview| series = Policy Research Working Papers| year = 2012| last1 = Milanovic | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic inequality varies between societies, historical periods, economic structures or economic systems, ongoing or past wars, between [[gender pay gap|genders]], and between differences in individuals' abilities to create [[wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Kopczuk, Saez, and Song find that "most of the increase in the variance of (log) annual earnings is due to increases in the variance of (log) permanent earnings with modest increases in the variance of transitory (log) earnings." Thus, in fact, the increase in earnings inequality is in lifetime income. Furthermore, they find that it remains difficult for men to move up the earnings distribution, while women fare better. {{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/qjec.2010.125.1.91 | title= Earnings Inequality and Mobility in the United States: Evidence from Social Security Data since 1937 * | journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics | date=2010 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=91–128 | first=Wojciech | last=Kopczuk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[income inequality metrics|various]] numerical [[index (economics)|indices]] for measuring economic inequality, the [[Gini coefficient]] is most often-cited.

Economic inequality affects [[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[equality of outcome]] and subsequent [[equality of opportunity]]. Although earlier studies considered economic inequality as necessary and beneficial,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/itv/articles/?id=1920 U.S. Income Inequality: It’s Not So Bad] By Thomas A.

[[International inequality]] is inequality between countries. Income differences between rich and poor countries are very large, although they are changing rapidly. Per capita incomes in China and India doubled in the prior twenty years, a feat that required 150 years in the US.{{sfn|UNDP|2013|loc=Introduction}} According to the [[United Nations]] Human Development Report for 2013, for countries at varying levels of the [[UN Human Development Index]] the [[GNP]] per capita grew between 2004 and 2013 from 24,806 to 33,391 or 35% (very high human development), 4,269 to 5,428 or 27% (medium) and 1,184 to 1,633 or 38% (low) PPP$, respectively (PPP$ = [[purchasing power parity]] measured in [[United States dollar]]s).{{sfn|UNDP|2013|p=25}}

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising welfare and hence, reduced inequality. According to [[Martin Wolf]], in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]]s in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Incensed about Inequality in 'Why Globalization Works'"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|first= Martin|last= Wolf|year= 2004|accessdate= 2013-04-06|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequentially, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Recent developments, such as [[just-in-time manufacturing]], have affected those working manufacturing jobs and agricultural work more than others. When larger companies or others who control the supply chain decide to reduce manufacturing, these people oftentimes find themselves out of a job with little or no assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/docs/2011/6/the-vital-role-of-women-in-agriculture-and-rural-development|title=The vital role of women in agriculture and rural development|newspaper=UN Women|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Health risks ====
Alongside globalization there is an increasing internationalization of health risks.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, Tikki, and G. Emmanuel Guindon. "Globalization and Risks to Health." EMBO

Reports.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations resort to outsourced employment in developing nations, which in turn forces low income foreigners at the bottom of the "food chain," as individuals drudge for pennies on the dollar under unregulated, unsanitary and implacable conditions. Women in agriculture, for example, are often asked to work long hours handling chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers without any protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are adverse health consequences from working long hours and individuals that burden themselves from working within vasts [[Global supply-chain finance|global supply chains.]]

Seth, Divya, and Nimali Singh published research evidence linking a wide range of health risks and overworking.

It is common for the work lifestyle to bring forth adverse health conditions or even death due to weak safety measure policies. After the tragic collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh where over 800 deaths occurred the country has since then made efforts in boosting up their safety policies to better accommodate workers.&lt;ref&gt;Herlinger, Chris.

==== Mistreatment ====
Corporations set their place of production usually in areas with little to no labor regulations, and as a result low labor cost occurs. With the low labor regulations, there are risks for mistreatment of some workers, especially women and children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Prieto-Carrón, Marina. "Is there Anyone Listening?: Women Workers in Factories in Central America, and Corporate Codes of Conduct." Development 47.3 (2004): 101–05. ProQuest. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor working conditions and [[Workplace harassment#Gender|sexual harassment]] are just some of the mistreatment faced by women in the textile supply chain. Marina Prieto-Carrón shows in her research in [[Central America]] that women in [[sweatshop]]s are not even supplied with toilet paper in the bathroom everyday. The reason it costs corporations more is because people can not work to their full potential in poor conditions, affecting the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Berik, G., and Y. Van Der Meulen Rodgers. "What's Macroeconomic Policy Got to Do with Gender Inequality? Evidence from Asia." Global Social Policy 12.2 (2012): 183–89. Web&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when [[corporation]]s decide to change manufacturing rates or locations in industries that employ more women, they are often left with no job nor assistance. This kind of sudden reduction or elimination in hours is seen in industries such as the [[textile industry]] and agriculture industry, both which employ a higher amount of women than men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One solution to mistreatment of women in the [[supply chain]] is more involvement from the corporation and trying to regulate the [[outsourcing]] of their product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A tax haven is a state, country or territory where certain [[tax]]es are levied at a low rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]].&lt;ref name="ssrn"&gt;Dharmapala, Dhammika und Hines Jr., James R.

=== Voices of developing countries ===

The [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC) has proposed an agenda to support conditions for developing countries to improve their standing in the global economy.{{sfn|CEPAL|2002|p=95}} However, the advantaged countries continue to control the economic agenda. Lechner and Boli state that the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] must give voice to developing countries.&lt;ref name="LechnerBoli2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Frank J. |last1=Lechner|first2=John |last2=Boli |title=The Globalization Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_ciVZyFns7UC |p=202}}|date=26 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley Sons |p=202|isbn=978-0-470-65563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural effects ===

Economic globalization may affect culture. Populations may mimic the international flow of capital and labor markets in the form of immigration and the merger of cultures. Foreign resources and economic measures may affect different native cultures and may cause assimilation of a native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Held |editor1-first=David |title=A Globalizing World?: Culture, Economics, Politics |edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge, in association with the Open University|location=London; New York|year=2004|isbn=0-203-39219-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these populations are exposed to the English language, computers, western music, and North American culture, changes are being noted in shrinking family size, immigration to larger cities, more casual dating practices, and gender roles are transformed.&lt;!-- how is this about economics? --&gt;

Yu Xintian noted two contrary trends in culture due to economic globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Xintian|last=Yu|title=Cultural Impact on International Relations. Chinese Philosophical Studies, XX|year=2002|publisher=The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|isbn=1-56518-176-X|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yu argued that culture and industry not only flow from the developed world to the rest, but trigger an effort to protect local cultures.   He notes that economic globalization began after World War II, whereas [[internationalization]] began over a century ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xintian|first=Yu|title=Cultural Impact on International Relations. Chinese Philosophical Studies, XX|year=2002|publisher=The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|isbn=1-56518-176-X|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Ritzer wrote about the [[McDonaldization]] of society and how fast food businesses spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world, attracting other places to adopt fast food culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=MacDonalization: the reader/ 3rd ed.|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oak, CA|isbn=978-1-4129-7582-7|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritzer describes other businesses such as [[The Body Shop]], a British cosmetics company, that have copied [[McDonald's]] business model for expansion and influence. In 2006, 233 of 280 or over 80% of new McDonald's opened outside the US. In 2007, Japan had 2,828 McDonald's locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=MacDonalization: the reader/ 3rd ed.|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oak, CA|isbn=978-1-4129-7582-7|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global media companies export information around the world. This creates a mostly one-way flow of information, and exposure to mostly western products and values. Companies like [[CNN]], [[Reuters]] and the [[BBC]] dominate the global airwaves with western points of view.  Other media news companies such as [[Qatar]]'s [[Al Jazeera]] network offer a different point of view, but reach and influence fewer people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nakayma|first=Thomas, K|title=The Handbook of Critical Intercultural communication|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8407-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration ===

"With an estimated 210 million people living outside their country of origin ([[International Labour Organization]] [ILO] 2010), international migration has touched the lives of almost everyone in both the sending and receiving countries of the [[Global South]] and the [[Global North]]".&lt;ref name="Beneria, Deere, and Kabeer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/13545701.2012.688998 | title=Gender and International Migration: Globalization, Development, and Governance | journal=Feminist Economics | date=2012 | volume=18 | issue=2 | pages=1–33 | first=Lourdes | last=Benería}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of advances made in technology, human beings as well as goods are able to move through different countries and regions with relative ease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15358">'''Economic reform in Iraq''' describes decisions by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] to dramatically change the [[economy of Iraq]] in the aftermath of the 2003 [[Iraq War|U.S.-led invasion]].

Prior to US occupation, Iraq had a [[centrally planned economy]]. Among other things, it prohibited foreign ownership of Iraqi businesses, ran most large industries as state-owned enterprises, and imposed large [[tariff]]s to keep out foreign goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/96bf686fe9704cd7c1256dba0036a96e Iraq's economy: Past, present, future]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] quickly began issuing many binding orders [[Privatisation|privatizing]] [[economy of Iraq|Iraq's economy]] and opening it up to [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]].

Economic reform was implemented alongside reform of [[government of Iraq|government institutions]], the [[Law in Iraq|Iraqi legal system]], and significant [[Investment in post-2003 Iraq|international investment]] to repair or replace damaged [[infrastructure of Iraq]].

While reform efforts have produced some successes, problems have arisen with the implementation of internationally funded Iraq reconstruction efforts. These include inadequate security, pervasive corruption, insufficient funding and poor coordination among international agencies and local communities.

==Planning==
[[Image:BaghdadStreet.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Business storefront signs in downtown [[Baghdad]], Iraq in April 2005.]]
[[Paul Bremer]], chief executive  the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] of Iraq, planned to restructure Iraq's state owned economy with [[free market]] thinking.
Bremer dropped the corporate tax rate from around 45% to a flat tax rate of 15% and allowed foreign corporations to repatriate all profits earned in Iraq. Opposition from senior Iraqi officials, together with the poor security situation, meant that Bremer's privatization plan was not implemented during his tenure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/05/world/struggle-for-iraq-northern-region-kurdish-region-northern-iraq-will-get-keep.html?scp=3&amp;sq=privatization&amp;st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: NORTHERN REGION; Kurdish Region in Northern Iraq Will Get to Keep Special Status | first=Steven R. | last=Weisman | date=2004-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his orders remain in place. In addition to approximately 200 other state owned businesses, privatization of the oil industry was scheduled to begin sometime in late 2005, though it is opposed by the [[Federation of Oil Unions in Iraq]].

==Oil==
{{main|Iraq hydrocarbon law}}
Order 39 laid out the framework for full privatization in Iraq, except for "primary extraction and initial processing" of oil, and permitted 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets.
The [[Iraq oil law]] is a proposed piece of legislation submitted to the [[Iraqi Council of Representatives]] in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-06-29 |title=Pepe Escobar on Iraq - The U.S. "Surge" in Iraq and the oil law. |url=http://www.therealnews.com/web/index.php?&amp;thisid=284&amp;thisview=item |publisher=The Real News |location=Sao Paulo, Brazil |accessdate=2007-06-29 |time=2:25 - 3:14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211233519/http://www.therealnews.com/web/index.php?&amp;thisid=284&amp;thisview=item |archivedate=2008-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi government has yet to reach an agreement on the law. In June 2008, the [[Iraqi Oil Ministry]] announced plans to go ahead with small one or two year [[no-bid contracts]] to [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Total S.A.|Total]] and [[BP]] — once partners in the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] — along with [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and smaller firms to service Iraq’s largest fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were canceled in September because negotiations had stalled for so long that the work could not be completed within the time frame, according to Iraqi oil minister [[Hussain al-Shahristani]]. Several United States senators had also criticized the deal, arguing it was hindering efforts to pass the hydrocarbon law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Bremer's transitional government featured figures close to the [[George W. Bush administration]], such as grain-trading industry lobbyist [[Dan Amstutz]], who was put in charge of agricultural policy in Iraq.

==Foreign Investment and trade==
CPA Order 39, entitled "Foreign Investment", provided that "A foreign investor shall be entitled to make foreign investments in Iraq on terms no less favorable than those applicable to an Iraqi investor," and that "[t]he amount of foreign participation in newly formed or existing business entities in Iraq shall not be limited...." Additionally, the foreign investor "shall be authorized to... transfer abroad without delay all funds associated with its foreign investment, including shares or profits and dividends...."

By this order, critics assert that the CPA drastically altered Iraq's economy, allowing virtually unlimited and unrestricted foreign investment and placing no limitations on the expatriation of profit. However, these policies accord with current international standards on [[foreign direct investment]] which most of the developed world adheres to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/35/2956455.pdf#search='restrictions%20on%20foreign%20ownership%20WTO'  oecd.org/~restrictions on foreign ownership WTO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/53/33776498.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017075449/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/53/33776498.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The order concluded, "Where an [[treaty|international agreement]] to which Iraq is a party provides for more favorable terms with respect to foreign investors undertaking investment activities in Iraq, the more favorable terms under the international agreement shall apply." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20031220_CPAORD_39_Foreign_Investment_.pdf# |title=iraqcoalition.org/regulations/~Foreign_Investment_.pdf |access-date=2010-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040701202817/http://iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20031220_CPAORD_39_Foreign_Investment_.pdf# |archive-date=2004-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics such as [[Naomi Klein]], this order was designed to create as favorable an environment for foreign investors as possible, thereby allowing American and multinational corporations to dominate Iraq's economy.&lt;ref name="shock"&gt;[[The Shock Doctrine]], [[Naomi Klien]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Significant criticism has suggested these policies are fundamentally anti-democratic, that such rules can only be legitimate if passed by an elected Iraqi government free of foreign occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=5916 WAR: TRADE BY OTHER MEANS: How the US is getting a free trade agreement minus the negotiations]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others argue that the rules merely bring Iraq's economic law into conformity with modern norms of [[international trade]], and that the previous government and its laws were not democratically legitimate since Saddam Hussein's government was not elected.

[[CPA Order 17]] granted all foreign contractors operating in Iraq [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] from "Iraqi [[legal process]]," effectively granting immunity from any kind of suit, civil or criminal, for actions the contractors engaged in within Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040627_CPAORD_17_Status_of_Coalition__Rev__with_Annex_A.pdf# |title=iraqcoalition.org/~Status_of_Coalition_Rev_with_Annex_A.pdf |access-date=2010-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040701202703/http://iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040627_CPAORD_17_Status_of_Coalition__Rev__with_Annex_A.pdf# |archive-date=2004-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPA Order 12, amended by Order 54, suspended all tariffs, thus removing the advantage that domestic Iraqi producers had over foreign producers.&lt;ref name="iraqcoalition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/CPAORD12.pdf|date=12 June 2003|title=Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 12: Trade Liberalization Policy|accessdate=2014-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924032048/http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/CPAORD12.pdf#|archive-date=2013-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040404_CPAORD54_Trade_Liberlization_Policy_2004_with_Annex_A.pdf# |title=iraqcoalition.org/~Trade_Liberlization_Policy_2004_with_Annex_A.pdf |access-date=2010-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202604/http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040404_CPAORD54_Trade_Liberlization_Policy_2004_with_Annex_A.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 5% "reconstruction levy" on all imported goods was later reimposed to help finance Iraqi-initiated reconstruction projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.export.gov/iraq/bus_climate/overview_cpa.html Iraq Investment and Reconstruction Task Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808214009/http://export.gov/iraq/bus_climate/overview_cpa.html |date=2012-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
CPA Order 49 provided a tax cut for corporations operating within Iraq. It reduced the rate from a maximum of 40% to a maximum of 15% on income. Corporations working with the CPA were exempted from owing any tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040220_CPAORD_49_Tax_Strategy_of_2004_with_Annex_and_Ex_Note.pdf# |title=iraqcoalition.org/~Tax_Strategy_of_2004_with_Annex_and_Ex_Note.pdf |access-date=2010-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165636/http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040220_CPAORD_49_Tax_Strategy_of_2004_with_Annex_and_Ex_Note.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign debt==
{{more footnotes|date=June 2017}}
One of the key economic challenges was Iraq's immense foreign debt, estimated at $125&amp;nbsp;billion.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Although some of this debt was derived from normal export contracts that Iraq had failed to pay for, some was a result of military and financial support during Iraq's war with Iran.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Jubilee Iraq campaign argued that much of these debts were [[odious debt|odious]] (illegitimate). However, as the concept of odious debt is not accepted, trying to deal with the debt on those terms would have embroiled Iraq in legal disputes for years. Iraq decided to deal with its debt more pragmatically and approached the [[Paris Club]] of official creditors.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Effects==
Since the peak of 1980, the nominal GDP of Iraq has steadily shrunk to merely $12.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2000. However removal of sanctions, after the overthrow of Saddam, had immediate effect.

In a December 2006 [[Newsweek International]] article, a study by [[Global Insight]] in [[London]] was reported to show ''"that Civil war or not, Iraq has an economy, and—mother of all surprises—it's doing remarkably well. Real estate is booming. Construction, retail and wholesale trade sectors are healthy, too, according to [the report]. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports 34,000 registered companies in Iraq, up from 8,000 three years ago. Sales of secondhand cars, televisions and mobile phones have all risen sharply. Estimates vary, but one from Global Insight puts GDP growth at 17 percent last year and projects 13 percent for 2006. The World Bank has it lower: at 4 percent this year. But, given all the attention paid to deteriorating security, the startling fact is that Iraq is growing at all."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16241340/site/newsweek/ | title=Blood and Money: In what might be called the mother of all surprises, Iraq's economy is growing strong, even booming in places | publisher=Newsweek International | author=Silvia Spring |date=2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the economic potential of Iraq, a niche market for [[Iraqi Dinar]] currency has emerged. [[Speculators]] are making investments in the [[Iraqi Dinar]] in hopes of receiving a return once [[Iraq]] stabilizes as a country. [[Jim Cramer]]'s October 20, 2009 endorsement of the [[Iraqi Dinar]] on [[CNBC]] has further piqued interest in the investment.&lt;ref name="Jim Cramer on the Iraqi Dinar"&gt;[http://www.dinarprofits.com/iraqi_dinar_information/jim_cramer_mad_money/ Jim Cramer on the Iraqi Dinar] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110710130206/http://www.dinarprofits.com/iraqi_dinar_information/jim_cramer_mad_money/ |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral debate==
Critics of the CPA argue that these policies were not only rather blatant attempts to shape Iraq's economy in the interests of American (and other) investors and against the interests of Iraqis themselves, but also that they were illegal under [[international law]] (specifically the [[The Hague|Hague]] Resolutions and the [[Geneva Conventions]]) because an occupying power is prohibited from rewriting the laws of the occupied country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/iraq.comment|title=Pillage is forbidden|last=Mate|first=Aaron|date=2003-11-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen''' (30 March 1818 – 11 March 1888) was a German [[mayor]] and [[cooperative]] pioneer. Several [[credit union]] systems and [[cooperative bank]]s have been named after Raiffeisen, who pioneered rural [[credit unions]].

== Life ==
Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen was born on 30 March 1818 at [[Hamm (Sieg)|Hamm/Sieg]] (Westerwald). He was the seventh out of nine children. His father Gottfried Friedrich Raiffeisen was a farmer and also mayor of Hamm for a while. One can go back to his family’s origin until the 16th century in the Swabian-Franconian area. The family of his mother, Amalie Christiane Susanna Maria, born Lantzendörffer, came from the “[[Siegerland]]”.&lt;ref name="Internationale Raiffeisen-Union"&gt;[http://www.iru.de/ "Internationale Raiffeisen-Union"] .Accessed: 18-04-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving school at the age of 14 he received three years of education from a local [[pastor]] before he entered the military at the age of 17. His career in the military led him to [[Cologne]], [[Coblenz]] and [[Sayn]]. An eye disease forced him to resign from the military service in 1843 and he went into public service. He was [[mayor]] of several towns: from 1845 he was mayor of [[Weyerbusch]]/[[Westerwald]]; from  1848 he was mayor of [[Flammersfeld]]/Westerwald; and finally he was mayor of Heddesdorf from 1852 until late 1865, when, at the age of 47, his worsening health cut his career short; he had caught [[typhus]] in 1863 during an epidemic during which his wife had died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raiffeisen.de/drv/friedrichraiffeisen/FW_Raiffeisen.pdf  ''Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen 1818-1888'', Deutscher Raiffeisenverband (in German), undated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009030318/http://www.raiffeisen.de/drv/friedrichraiffeisen/FW_Raiffeisen.pdf |date=2007-10-09 }}.Accessed: 06-15-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his small pension was not sufficient to meet the living of Raiffeisen’s family he initially started a small cigar factory and later on a wine business. In 1867, he married the widow Maria Panseroth. She outlived him by 12 years and their marriage remained childless. He died on 11 March 1888 in Neuwied-Heddesdorf, shortly before his 70th birthday.&lt;ref name="Internationale Raiffeisen-Union"/&gt;

In it Raiffeisen sets out how to establish [[credit unions]] and other [[co-operatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Raiffeisen | first1 = Friedrich Wilhelm (author) | last2 = Engelmann | first2 = Konrad (translator) | title = The credit unions (Die Darlehnskassen-Vereine) | publisher = The Raiffeisen Printing &amp; Publishing Company | location = Neuwied on the Rhine, Germany | year = 1970 | origyear = 1866 | oclc = 223123405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Raiffeisen conceived of the idea of [[cooperative]] self-help during his tenure as the young mayor of Flammersfeld. He was inspired by observing the suffering of the farmers who were often in the grip of [[loanshark]]s. He founded the first cooperative lending bank, in effect the first rural [[credit union]] in 1864.

Motivated by the misery of the poor part of the population he founded during the starvation winter of 1846/47 the “Verein für Selbstbeschaffung von Brod und Früchten” (Association for Self-procurement of Bread and Fruits). He bought flour with the help of private donations. Bread was baked in a self-built bakery and distributed on credit to the poorest amongst the population. The bread society as well as the aid society founded in 1849 in Flammersfeld and the benevolent society created in 1854 in Heddesdorf were pre-cooperative societies based on the principle of benevolent assistance.

In order to secure the liquidity equalization between the small credit banks, in 1872 Raiffeisen created the first rural central bank at [[Neuwied]], the “Rheinische Landwirtschaftliche Genossenschaftsbank” (Rhenish Agricultural Cooperative Bank). In 1881, Raiffeisen created a printing house in Neuwied which still exists today, carries his name and was merged in 1975 with the German cooperative publishing house “Deutscher Genossenschafts-Verlag”.&lt;ref name="Internationale Raiffeisen-Union"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Raiffeisen stated that there is a connection between poverty and dependency. In order to fight poverty one should fight dependency first. Based on this idea he came up with the three 'S' formula: [[self-help]], [[self-governance]] and [[self-responsibility]]. Originally in [[German language|German]]: ''Selbsthilfe'', ''Selbstverwaltung'' and ''Selbstverantwortung''. When put into practice the necessary independence from [[charitable organization|charity]], [[politics]] and [[loanshark]]s could be established.&lt;ref name="Raiffeisen"&gt;Raiffeisen levensroman van een groot pionier, Rabobank Nederland Coöperatie &amp; Bestuur AB, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen''' ('''FLOSY''') was an [[Arab nationalist]] military organization operating in the [[Federation of South Arabia]] (now Southern [[Yemen]]) in the 1960s. As the [[United Kingdom|British]] tried to exit its [[Federation of South Arabia]] colony Abdullah al Asnag created FLOSY. FLOSY attempted to seize power when the British left from another military group operating in South Arabia, the [[Marxist]] [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front (NLF)]].

==Background==
Abdullah al Asnag was a labour leader in the [[Aden Trade Union Congress]] (ATUC), a union operating in and around the British protectorate: the [[Colony of Aden|port of Aden]].&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 126"&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1994|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s, [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[President of Egypt|president]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s [[Pan-Arabism]] had spread to the region and threatened Britain's and the traditional Emirs of the region's control. In response the British were able to convince the feuding Emirs to merge into the [[Federation of South Arabia]]. The Aden Trade Union Congress had a large influence in the new Federation's assembly and to prevent it seizing control of the Federation in 1962 the [[Colony of Aden]] joined the Federation so that Aden's pro-British assembly members could counter the ATUC's influence.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 126"/&gt; The day after Aden joined the Federation, [[Muhammad al-Badr]] of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Yemenese monarchy]] was overthrown and civil war ensued between forces backed by Egypt like the [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front (NLF)]] and monarchist forces backed by the British. This conflict spread throughout the region becoming the [[Aden Emergency]] and officially began on 10 December 1963, when a [[state of emergency]] was declared in the [[State of Aden]].&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"/&gt; The NLF campaign for power spread to the ''Federation of South Arabia'' in 1964. In 1964 a new government headed by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|United Kingdom general election]]. They attempted to grant independence to the ''Federation of South Arabia'' by giving Abdullah al Asnag control of the country. This proposal was vetoed by the American [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] who didn't want Britain to withdraw while the Americans were escalating the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1994|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
In 1965 the British suspended the ''Federation of South Arabian'' government and imposed direct colonial rule. Realizing that the British weren't going to give him control Asnag fled the country and joined the NLF. However elements of the NLF become more radical Marxist and they split from the Egyptians.&lt;ref name= "Dean p. 1211"&gt;{{harvnb|Dean|2004|p=1211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asnag formed his own military organization, FLOSY, in order to counter the NLF.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"/&gt; The NLF quickly denounced Asnag and FLOSY as Imperialist forces under control of Nassar and in addition to attacking the British also engaged FLOSY in combat.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"/&gt; By February 1967 the British could no longer control or protect its bases in Aden and announced it was leaving the country, against American wishes.&lt;ref name="Kitchen p. 127"/&gt; Nasser threw its weight behind FLOSY and arrested the head of the NLF who was living at the time in Egypt. Officially FLOSY and the NLF refused to talk to the leaving British forces as they didn't want to be seen as agents of British Imperialism.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 128"&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1994|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the last governor of Aden, [[Humphrey Trevelyan, Baron Trevelyan|Sir Humphrey Trevelyan]], left the country with no immediately apparent successor. As a point of respect, he had the government house repainted for whoever emerged victorious.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 128"/&gt; However unofficial secret talks were held between the British and the NLF who conspired to defeat FLOSY so that the Nassar-supported FLOSY would be defeated.&lt;ref name= "Mawby p. 173"&gt;{{harvnb|Mawby|2005|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction==
On November 30, 1967 ''Federation of South Arabia'' ceased to exist with the creation of the [[South Yemen|People's Republic of South Yemen]]. In 1967, Nasser was defeated in the [[Six-Day War]] and was forced to pull troops out of Yemen. This left FLOSY without any military support from its Egyptian allies. With the loss of Egyptian support, the NLF allied with Yemen's Federal army, allowing them to defeat FLOSY. On November 7, 1967 FLOSY took heavy losses attacking a [[Aden Protectorate Levies|federal army]] base in conjunction with the NLF. With that defeat, the military forces of FLOSY ceased to exist although some cadres and leaders remained outside the country.&lt;ref name= "Scott p. 171"&gt;{{harvnb|Kostiner|1984|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graham Peter Taylor''' (born 1958 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Yorkshire]], England), pen-name '''G. P. Taylor''', is the author of the best-selling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/people/A-writer39s-new-life-of.1789331.jp |title=A writer's new life of dreams and nightmares |author= |date=27 September 2006  |work= |publisher=''Yorkshire Post'' |accessdate=11 November 2009 |quote=Shadowmancer and Wormwood sold 475,000 copies alone, his third novel Tersias was a bestseller }}&lt;/ref&gt; novels ''[[Shadowmancer]]'', which has been translated into 48 languages,&lt;ref&gt;have been translated into forty-eight languages&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wormwood (G. P. Taylor)|Wormwood]]'' and ''[[Tersias]]''. Before taking up writing full-time, he was a police officer, motorcyclist and former rock band roadie turned [[Church of England|Anglican]] vicar in the village of [[Cloughton]], [[North Yorkshire]]. Taylor has three children and currently resides in [[Whitby, North Yorkshire]].

== Biography ==
Taylor grew up in Yorkshire, but moved to London in the 1970s where he worked in the music industry with such bands as [[The Stranglers]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Adam and the Ants]]. He became involved in the [[occult]], and lived a life that was, in his own words "into all sorts of weird and wonderful things and wasn’t leading a godly life". He then turned to [[Christianity]], and he later became a [[vicar]] with the [[Church of England]].

Taylor completed the manuscript of his first book, ''Shadowmancer'', which he self-published. Following its launch at Taylor's local bookshop, ''The Whitby Bookshop'', the title garnered a publishing deal with [[Faber and Faber]] in the UK and [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;Children's Writers' and Artists' Yearbook 2007, A&amp;C Black, p.139&lt;/ref&gt; for a further six novels, following which he resigned his position as parish priest.

His second novel, ''Wormwood'', was nominated for a [[Quill Award]]. His third novel, ''Tersias'' was published in the UK in 2005. In August 2006, Faber published a follow up to ''Shadowmancer'' entitled ''The Curse of Salamander Street''.

In October 2006, Taylor released ''[[The Tizzle Sisters &amp; Erik]]'' through [[Markosia]]. A mixture of prose and graphic novel that he deemed an 'illustronovella', Taylor was joined on the book by collaborators [[Tony Lee]], [[Dan Boultwood]], and ''[[Harry Potter]]'' artist [[Cliff Wright]].

He also contributed text to a book on the Yorkshire coast by photographer [[Mark Denton]].

Taylor announced his retirement from writing in October 2009 in order to care for his daughter, who suffers from [[Crohn's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Author-GP-Taylor-quits-to.5736919.jp |title=Author GP Taylor quits to care for sick daughter |author= |date=15 October 2009  |work= |publisher=''Yorkshire Post'' |accessdate=11 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he went on to publish three more books in the years that followed.

==''Mariah Mundi'' film==
In 2008 Taylor signed a deal with film production company Entertainment Motion Pictures (E-Motion) to make a film based on the series. In March 2012 it was announced that the film would star Michael Sheen, Lena Headey, Sam Neill, Ioan Gruffudd, and Aneurin Barnard as Mariah Mundi. The title was changed to [[The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box]] and the film opened in the United States in January 2014 to generally negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-adventurer-the-curse-of-the-midas-box Metacritic]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption''' ('''GOPAC'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المنظمة العالمية للبرلمانيين ضد الفساد; [[French language|French]]: ''Organisation mondiale des parlementaires contre la corruption''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "Organización Mundialde Parlamentarios Contra la Corrupción") is an [[International nongovernmental organization]] made up of parliamentarians from across the world, working together to combat corruption, strengthen good government, and uphold the rule of law. Based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], GOPAC has fifty-two national chapters in five continental associations. GOPAC supports its members through original research, global [[anti‑corruption]] capacity building, and international peer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOPAC Network|url=http://www.gopacnetwork.org/|publisher=Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GOPAC seeks to achieve ethical and accountable governance throughout the world, through effective anti-corruption mechanisms and co-operation between parliamentarians, government leaders, and civil society.

==History==
GOPAC was founded in October 2002 as a result of a Global Conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada which brought together approximately 170 parliamentarians and 400 observers who were part of the international leadership in the fight against political corruption and for good governance.

As it has grown, GOPAC has formed a web of partnerships with other international institutions, including the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], the [[World Bank]], and [[Transparency International]].

==Organization==
GOPAC works internationally, and is present on every populated continent of the world.  It operates in four official languages: [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; [[English language|English]]; [[French language|French]]; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Membership===
Individual membership in GOPAC is open to current and former democratically-elected legislators.

There are also National Chapters in fifty-two countries, grouped into six continental regions: Africa; Latin America; North America; Oceania; South Asia; and Southeast Asia.

Individual legislators may be members of GOPAC even if there is no national chapter in their countries.  Similarly, national chapters can be members of GOPAC even if their continent has not formed a continental association.

===Global Task Forces===
GOPAC has five thematic Global Task Forces (GTFs): Anti-Money Laundering; Parliamentary Ethics and Conduct; Parliamentary Oversight; Participation of Society, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption; and its Women in Parliament Network.

===Global Conference===
Every two years, GOPAC convenes a Global Conference to act as an international focus for parliamentarians from across the world to set the international agenda, and to collaborate in fighting political corruption. The 2013 Global Conference was held in Manila, Philippines.

'''''Haig v. Agee''''', 453 U.S. 280 (1981), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that upheld the right of the executive branch to revoke a citizen's passport for reasons of national security and the foreign policy interests of the U.S. under the [[Passport Act of 1926]].

The case involved Congressional delegation of authority over control of passports and the right to international travel.  [[Philip Agee]] was an ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) officer living overseas who in 1974 declared a "campaign to fight the U.S. CIA wherever it is operating" and revealed the identities of several CIA officers resulting in violence against them. The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] revoked Agee's passport in 1979. Agee sued, alleging the secretary had no such authority, had denied him procedural due process rights, his substantive due process "liberty" right to travel under the Fifth Amendment, and had violated his First Amendment right to criticize government policies.  

The district court found the Secretary lacked the power to revoke the passport and the court of appeals affirmed that decision. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that  the broad discretion accorded the executive branch in matters of national security and foreign policy requires that the [[s:Passport Act of 1926|Passport Act of 1926]] (currently [[codification (law)|codified]] at {{USC|22|211a}} et seq.) should be interpreted as granting the power to revoke a passport when necessary for national security.

==Facts of the case==
Philip Agee, an American citizen, was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency from 1957 to 1968, holding key positions in the division of the Agency responsible for covert intelligence gathering in foreign countries. In 1974, Agee announced in London that he was launching a "campaign to fight the United States CIA wherever it is operating" and intended "to expose CIA officers and agents and to take the measures necessary to drive them out of the countries where they are operating."{{cn|date=December 2013}} Agee and his collaborators repeatedly and publicly identified individuals and organizations in foreign countries as undercover CIA agents, employees, or sources. They divulged classified information, violated Agee's express contract not to make any public statements about Agency matters without prior clearance by the Agency, and prejudiced the ability of the United States to obtain intelligence. They were followed by episodes of violence against the persons and organizations identified.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In December 1979, Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] revoked Agee's passport and delivered an explanatory notice to Agee in West Germany, where he was living. It advised Agee that his  activities abroad were causing or were likely to cause serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States and that he had a right to an administrative hearing. It offered to hold such a hearing in West Germany on 5 days' notice.

Agee at once filed suit against the Secretary. He alleged that the regulation invoked by the Secretary, 22 CFR 51.70 (b)(4)(1980), was not authorized by Congress and was invalid; that the regulation was impermissibly overbroad; that revocation prior to a hearing violated his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process; and that the revocation violated a Fifth Amendment liberty interest in a right to travel and a First Amendment right to criticize Government policies. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and he moved for summary judgment on the question of the authority to promulgate the regulation and on the constitutional claims. For purposes of that motion, Agee conceded that his activities were causing or were likely to cause serious damage to the national security or foreign policy of the United States. The District Court held that the regulation exceeded the statutory powers of the Secretary under the [[Passport Act]] of 1926, 22 U.S.C. 211a, granted summary judgment for Agee, and ordered the Secretary to restore his passport.&lt;ref&gt;''Agee v. Vance'', 483 F. Supp. 729 (DC 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court.&lt;ref&gt;''Agee v. Muskie'', 203 U.S. App. D.C. 46, 629 F.2d 80 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; It held that the Secretary was required to show that Congress had authorized the regulation either by an express delegation or by implied approval of a "substantial and consistent" administrative practice, citing ''[[Zemel v. Rusk]]'' (1965). The court found no express statutory authority for the revocation. The Court of Appeals took note of the Secretary's reliance on "a series of statutes, regulations, proclamations, orders and advisory opinions dating back to 1856," but declined to consider those authorities, reasoning that "the criterion for establishing congressional assent by inaction is the actual imposition of sanctions and not the mere assertion of power." The Court of Appeals held that it was not sufficient that "Agee's conduct may be considered by some to border on treason," since "[w]e are bound by the law as we find it." The court also regarded it as material that most of the Secretary's authorities dealt with powers of the Executive Branch "during time of war or national emergency" or with respect to persons "engaged in criminal conduct."  

The Court granted certiorari in the case, then called ''Muskie v. Agee'', and stayed the judgment of the Court of Appeals until its disposition of the case.

==Majority opinion==
The Court began by examining the language of the statute, concluding that although the Passport Act did not in so many words confer upon the Secretary a power to revoke or to deny passport applications, it was beyond dispute that the Secretary had the power to deny a passport for reasons not specified in the statutes.  A consistent administrative construction of the 1926 Act must be followed by the courts "`unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.'"  Matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security were rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention particularly in light of the "broad rule-making authority granted in the 1926 Act," citing ''Zemel''.

It then surveyed passport law and administrative policy and practice from 1835 to 1966, concluding that the history of passport controls since the earliest days of the Republic showed congressional recognition of Executive authority to withhold passports on the basis of substantial reasons of national security and foreign policy. It compared Congressional action and inaction concerning the broad rule-making authority granted in earlier Acts, concluding that there was "weighty" evidence of congressional approval of the Secretary's interpretation that it had been delegated the power to restrict passports on the basis of national security.  The Court rejected Agee's argument that the only way the Executive could establish implicit congressional approval is by proof of longstanding and consistent enforcement of the claimed power.  It distinguished ''Kent'' noting that although there had been few situations involving substantial likelihood of serious damage to the national security or foreign policy of the United States as a result of a passport holder's activities abroad, that in the cases which had arisen, the Secretary had consistently exercised his power to withhold passports.  And it rejected Agee's contention that the statements of Executive policy are entitled to diminished weight because many of them concern the powers of the Executive in wartime.

It held incorrect the notion that "illegal conduct" and problems of allegiance were, "so far as relevant here, ... the only [grounds] which it could fairly be argued were adopted by Congress in light of prior administrative practice," ''Kent'' at 127-128, was not correct because ''Kent'' also recognized that the legitimacy of the objective of safeguarding our national security was "obvious and unarguable." id at 509 and that the protection accorded beliefs standing alone is very different from the protection accorded conduct.  Thus, it held that the policy announced in the challenged regulations is "sufficiently substantial and consistent" to compel the conclusion that Congress has approved it.

Regarding Agee's Constitutional attacks, the Court held that they, too, were without merit.  The revocation of his passport did not impermissibly burdens his freedom to travel because the freedom to travel abroad with a "letter of introduction" in the form of a passport issued by the sovereign is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations; as such, it is subject to reasonable governmental regulation.  The action was not intended to penalize his exercise of free speech and deter his criticism of Government policies and practices because assuming, arguendo, that First Amendment protections reach beyond our national boundaries, revocation of Agee's passport rested in part on the content of his speech.  To the extent the revocation of his passport operates to inhibit Agee, "it is an inhibition of action," rather than of speech.  And that failure to accord him a prerevocation hearing did not violate his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process because when there is a substantial likelihood of "serious damage" to national security or foreign policy as a result of a passport holder's activities in foreign countries, the Government may take action to ensure that the holder may not exploit the sponsorship of his travels by the United States.

The Court found that the right to hold a passport is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations, and is subject to reasonable governmental regulation. Denial of Agee's passport was not protected under the First Amendment because unlike ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]'' and ''[[Aptheker v. Secretary of State]]'' involving denials of passports solely on the basis of political beliefs entitled to First Amendment protection, Agee's actions amounted to more than speech and that the national security interests here, as in ''Zemel v. Rusk'', were sufficiently important to justify revocation. Finally, the Court held that the Government was not required to hold a pre-revocation hearing, since where there was a substantial likelihood of "serious damage" to national security or foreign policy as the result of a passport holder's activities abroad, the Government may take action to ensure that the holder may not exploit the United States' sponsorship of his travels.  Further, a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a prompt post-revocation hearing were sufficient to satisfy the Constitution's due process guarantees.

==Concurrence==
Blackmun concurred, stating simply that he believed this case had cut back somewhat on the standards articulated in ''[[Zemel v. Rusk]]'' and ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]'' ''[[sub silentio|sub silencio]]'' and that it would have been better if the Court had forthrightly construed the law such that evidence of a longstanding Executive policy or construction in this area be probative of the issue of congressional authorization.

==Dissent==
Justice Brennan wrote a [[dissent]] that Justice Marshall joined. He found that the decision strayed from the [[precedent]] set by ''Zemel'' and ''Kent'' because neither ''Zemel'' nor ''Kent'' held that a longstanding Executive policy or construction was sufficient proof that Congress had implicitly authorized the Secretary's action.  Those cases held that an administrative practice must be demonstrated; ''Kent'' unequivocally stated that mere construction by the Executive - no matter how longstanding and consistent - was not sufficient.  Only when Congress had maintained its silence in the face of a consistent and substantial pattern of actual passport denials or revocations - where the parties will presumably object loudly, perhaps through legal action, to the Secretary's exercise of discretion - can this Court be sure that Congress is aware of the Secretary's actions and has implicitly approved that exercise of discretion. 

The decision also relied on the very Executive construction and policy deemed irrelevant in ''Kent''. The Court's reliance on material expressly abjured in ''Kent'' was understandable only when considering the paucity of recorded administrative practice - the only evidence upon which ''Kent'' and ''Zemel'' permit reliance - with respect to passport denials or revocations based on foreign policy or national security considerations relating to an individual. Only three occasions were cited over the past 33 years when the Secretary revoked passports for such reasons.

Finally, just as the Constitution protected both popular and unpopular speech, it likewise protected both popular and unpopular travelers. The decision applied not only to Philip Agee, whose activities could be perceived as harming the national security, but also to other citizens who may merely disagree with Government foreign policy and express their views.  The Justices feared that the majority decision handed too much lawmaking function over the government when the Constitution allocated it to the Congress.  The point that Kent and Zemel made, and the majority opinion should make, is that the Executive's authority to revoke passports touched an area fraught with important constitutional rights, and that the Court should therefore "construe narrowly all delegated powers that curtail or dilute them." ''Kent v. Dulles'' at 129  The presumption should be that Congress must expressly delegate authority to the Secretary to deny or revoke passports for foreign policy or national security reasons before he may exercise such authority and to overcome the presumption against an implied delegation, the Government must show "an administrative practice sufficiently substantial and consistent." ''Zemel v. Rusk'', at 12.

The '''Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007''' ({{USPL|110|53}}), is an [[Act of Congress]].  The Act implements some of the recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] including mandating 100% inspection of all air and sea cargo entering the United States, and a new method of redistributing [[anti-terrorism]] funding.

The bill also authorized the creation of [[Fusion Centers]].

==Legislative history==
The bill  passed the House on January 9, 2007 by a vote of 299-128-8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/09/house.agenda/index.html House passes 9/11 Security Bill], via CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="govtrack"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = H.R. 1: Improving America's Security Act of 2007
  | publisher = govtrack.us
   }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It later passed the Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent. The two chambers of Congress went to conference, and a conference report in which the bill was amended and renamed the Improving America's Security Act of 2007 passed the Senate 85-8-7 on July 26, 2007 and the House 371-40-22 the following day.&lt;ref name="govtrack"/&gt; It was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on August 3, 2007.&lt;ref name="govtrack"/&gt; It became Public Law 110-53.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The private sector preparedness requirements in the bill were based on the work commissioned by the Sloan Foundation to draft a framework for voluntary preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story?menuid=7&amp;articleid=1ccd71f5-a7b0-4eff-a9cc-6a53f86f4a4c ANSI-HSSP Plenary Addresses Title IX Requirements for Private Sector Preparedness.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}
'''Injury prevention''' is an effort to prevent or reduce the severity of [[bodily injury|bodily injuries]] caused by external mechanisms, such as [[accident]]s, before they occur.  Injury prevention is a component of [[safety]] and [[public health]], and its goal is to improve the health of the population by preventing [[injury|injuries]] and hence improving [[quality of life]]. Among [[layperson]]s, the term "accidental injury" is often used.  However, "accidental" implies the causes of injuries are [[random]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personalinjurylawyerbirmingham.org/accidental-injury |title=Is There Such Thing As Accidental Injury? |accessdate=22 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers use the term "unintentional injury" to refer to injuries that are [[volition (psychology)|nonvolitional]] but preventable.  Within the field of public health, efforts are also made to prevent or reduce "intentional injury." Data from the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Centers for Disease Control]], for example, show unintentional injuries are the leading cause of [[death]] from early childhood until middle adulthood.  During these years, unintentional injuries account for more deaths than the next nine leading [[cause of death|causes of death]] combined.

Injury prevention strategies cover a variety of approaches, many of which are classified as falling under the “3 E’s” of injury prevention:  [[education]], [[engineering]] modifications, and [[enforcement]]/enactment.  Some organizations, such as [[Safe Kids Worldwide]], have expanded the list to six E’s adding: evaluation, economic incentives and empowerment.

== Measuring effectiveness ==
Researching  is challenging, because the usual outcome of interest is deaths or injuries prevented, and it is nearly impossible to measure how many people ''did not'' get hurt who otherwise would have.  Education efforts can be measured by changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors, before and after the intervention, however tying these changes back into reductions in [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] is often problematic.

Examining trends in morbidity and mortality in the population is usually not difficult and may provide some indication of the effectiveness of injury prevention interventions.  However, this approach suffers from the potential of [[ecological fallacy]], where the data shows an association between an intervention and a change in the outcome, but there is actually no causal relationship.

==Common types==

=== Traffic and automobile safety ===
[[Road-traffic safety|Traffic safety]] and [[automobile safety]] are a major component of injury prevention because it is the leading cause of death for [[children]] and young adults into their mid 30s.  Injury prevention efforts began in the early 1960s when activist [[Ralph Nader]], exposed the automobiles as being more dangerous than necessary with his book Unsafe at Any Speed.  This led to engineering changes in the way cars are designed to allow for more crush space between the vehicle and the occupant.  The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) also contributes much to automobile safety.  The CDC Injury Prevention Champion, [[David Sleet]], illustrated the importance of lowering the legal blood alcohol content limit to 0.08 percent for drivers; requiring disposable lighters to be child resistant; and using evidence to demonstrate the dangers of airbags to young children riding in the front seat of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= CDC Injury Prevention Champion David Sleet Receives 2015 Elizabeth Fries Health Education Award |website= CDC Foundation |url= http://www.cdcfoundation.org/pr/2015/cdc-injury-prevention-champion-david-sleet-receives-2015-elizabeth-fries-health-education-aw |date= 24 April 2015 |accessdate= 6 September 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160905160928/http://www.cdcfoundation.org/pr/2015/cdc-injury-prevention-champion-david-sleet-receives-2015-elizabeth-fries-health-education-aw |archivedate= 5 September 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineering''': vehicle crash worthiness, seat belts, airbags, locking seat belts for child seats.

'''Education''':  promote seat belt use, discourage impaired driving, promote child safety seats.

'''Enforcement and enactment''':  passage and enforcement of primary seat belt laws, speed limits, impaired driving enforcement.

=== Pedestrian safety ===
[[Pedestrian safety]] is the focus of both [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] and [[psychological]] injury prevention research. Epidemiological studies typically focus on causes external to the individual such as traffic density, access to safe walking areas, socioeconomic status, injury rates, legislation for safety (e.g., traffic fines), or even the shape of vehicles which affects the severity of injuries resulting from a collision.  Epidemiological data show children aged 1–4 are at greatest risk for injury in [[driveway]] and [[sidewalk]]s.  Children aged 5–14 are at greatest risk while attempting to cross streets.

The body of psychological research on pedestrian safety is currently much smaller than that in the epidemiological field, but is rapidly growing.  Psychological pedestrian safety studies extend as far back as the mid-1980s when researchers began examining behavioral variables in children.  Behavioral variables of interest include selection of crossing gaps in traffic, attention to traffic, the number of near hits or actual hits, or the routes children chose when crossing multiple streets such as while walking to school.  Behavioral studies often collect such variables which imply risk of injury; e.g., children engaging in risky behaviors may be assumed to be at greater risk if actually crossing a street alone.  The most common technique used in behavioral pedestrian research is the pretend road, in which a child stands some distance from the curb and watches traffic on the real road.  The child then walks to the edge of the street when a crossing opportunity is chosen.  Research is gradually shifting to more ecologically valid virtual reality techniques.  Leading scientists in psychological pedestrian safety research are Dr. Benjamin Barton, Dr. [[David Schwebel]] and Dr. James Thomson.

==Issues==
Jim Green and Peter Karamoskos (a nuclear radiologist) say there is growing scientific confidence in the [[linear no-threshold model]] for ionising radiation, which is supported by the 2006 report of the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionising Radiation (BEIR) of the US National Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=kargreen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/56842.html |title=Do we know the Chernobyl death toll? |author=Peter Karamoskos and Jim Green |date=18 April 2011  |work=The Drum }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BEIR report comprehensively reviewed available data and concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of evidence from epidemiologic, animal and mechanistic studies tend to favour a simple proportionate relationship at low doses between radiation dose and cancer risk... The risk of cancer proceeds in a linear fashion at lower doses without a threshold and… the smallest dose has the potential to cause a small increase in risk to humans.&lt;ref name=kargreen/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Green and Karamoskos, the alternative view, that low-level radiation is harmless, is limited to a small number of scientists "whose voice is greatly amplified by the nuclear industry".  In Australia, for example, "uranium mining and exploration companies such as Toro Energy, [[Uranium One]] and [[Heathgate Resources]] have sponsored speaking tours by scientists who claim that low level radiation exposure is not only harmless but actually good for you".&lt;ref name=kargreen/&gt;

''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2337sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2337 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2337|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lake Hill Administrative Site Affordable Housing Act would direct the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] (USDA), upon receiving an offer from [[Summit County, Colorado]], in which the county agrees to be responsible for the costs specified below, to convey to the county all interest of the United States in the approximately 40 acres of [[National Forest System]] land in the county identified as the Lake Hill Administrative Site.&lt;ref name="2337sum"/&gt;  The bill would make Summit County responsible for the processing and transaction costs related to the direct sale of the Administrative Site.&lt;ref name="2337sum"/&gt;  The bill would require the proceeds received from such conveyance to be made available for capital improvement and maintenance of Forest Service facilities in Region 2 of the Forest Service.&lt;ref name="2337sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo2337&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2337 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44478|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 2337 would require the Secretary of Agriculture to sell 40 acres of Forest Service land near [[Frisco, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt; Based on information provided by the agency, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the legislation would have a negligible impact on the federal budget.&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt; Enacting the bill would increase offsetting receipts and associated direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, the CBO estimated that those changes would have no significant net impact on future budget deficits. Enacting H.R. 2337 would not affect revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt;

The bill would require the Secretary to sell the affected lands to Summit County, Colorado, for fair market value.&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt; Based on information provided by the Forest Service, CBO estimated that proceeds from the sale of those lands would increase offsetting receipts by about $5 million.&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt; Under the bill, the agency would be authorized to retain and spend those proceeds, without further appropriation, for capital improvement and maintenance of Forest Service facilities.&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt; The CBO expected that the agency would complete the sale and spend the proceeds within five years, and we estimate that enacting the bill would have no net impact on the federal budget over that period. In addition, the bill would require the county to pay for any administrative costs associated with the sale.&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt;

H.R. 2337 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded mandate#Unfunded Mandates Reform Act|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]].&lt;ref name="cbo2337"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Lake Hill Administrative Site Affordable Housing Act was introduced into the House on June 12, 2013 by [[Jared Polis|Rep. Jared Polis (D, CO-2)]].&lt;ref name=2337allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2337 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2337/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation]].  The bill was reported by the Committee alongside [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt196/CRPT-113hrpt196.pdf House Report 113-196 on H.R. 2337] on September 10, 2013.&lt;ref name="2337allactions"/&gt;  On October 25, 2013, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that H.R. 2337 would be on the House schedule for the week of October 28, 2013.&lt;ref name=weeklyschedOct28&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule - October 28, 2013 |url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/10-28-13%20Weekly.pdf |publisher=House Majority Leader's Office |accessdate=28 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101153110/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/10-28-13%20Weekly.pdf |archivedate= 1 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was considered under the suspension of the rules.&lt;ref name=nextweek25&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=A closer look at next week...

On July 25, 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law.&lt;ref name="2337allactions"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Arguing in favor of the bill, Rep. Polis said that "this bill is an important step towards helping the community use the Lake Hill property in a way that improves the quality of life in Summit County. H.R. 2337 is a win-win because it will add affordable housing opportunities while providing funding for U.S. Forest Service to improve administrative facilities."&lt;ref name="polisofficial"/&gt;

The following is a '''list of usurpers''' – illegitimate or controversial claimants to the throne in a monarchy. The word [[usurper]] is a derogatory term, and as such not easily definable, as the person seizing power normally will try to legitimise his position, while denigrating that of his predecessor.

|[[William I of England|William I]]
|[[Harold Godwinson]]
|1066–1087
| When [[Edward the Confessor]] died, Harold crowned himself Harold II; William then [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England with his own army]]. William's army was victorious at the [[Battle of Hastings]], during which Harold II was killed. William then crowned himself King of England.
|-
|[[Stephen of England|Stephen]]
|[[Henry I of England|Henry I]]
|1135–1154
|[[Henry I of England|Henry I]] named his daughter [[Matilda of England|Matilda]] his heir, and she was recognised as such by the barons of England. On Henry's death, Stephen took the crown before Matilda learned that her father was dead, leading to 20 years of civil war.
|-
|[[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]
|[[Richard II of England|Richard II]]
|1399–1413
|A period of crisis emerged in 1398-1399 under Richard II as he enacted revenge on leading nobles for a dispute ten years previously. He took action against the Lords Appellant, murdering a leader and banishing [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbrooke]]. On the death of Bolingbrooke's father, [[John of Gaunt]], the son wished to return to claim his inheritance as the Duke of Lancaster, which Richard II denied. Henry returned from his exile in France whilst Richard II was away in Ireland. With the support of prominent Northern noble families, Henry took the throne.
|-
|[[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]
|[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]
|1461–1470
1471–1483
| After the death of his father, [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in 1460, Edward took over leadership of the [[House of York|Yorkist faction]].  His father had been declared the king's heir by parliament, but Edward took the further step of proclaiming himself king in March 1461.  He subsequently defeated [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] forces at the [[Battle of Towton]], forcing [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] into exile in Scotland.  
|-
|[[Richard III of England|Richard III]]
|[[Edward V of England|Edward V]]
|1483–1485
| When his brother [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old [[Edward V of England|Edward V]]. Arrangements were made for Edward's coronation on 22 June 1483; but, before the young king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid, making their children officially illegitimate and thus barring them from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of Lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard the rightful king.
|-
|[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]
|[[Richard III of England|Richard III]]
|1485–1509
| Forces under Henry Tudor won the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], during which Richard III was killed. Henry then became Henry VII and married the daughter of Edward IV, which is claimed to have ended the [[War of the Roses]], though relatives of Richard made various attempts to remove him from power.
|-
|[[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]
|[[James II of England|James II]]
|1689–1702
|James II fled after the arrival of William and Mary along with their army. This became known as the [[Glorious Revolution]].

|[[Pepin the Short]]
|[[Childeric III]]
|751–768
|-The Merovingian Royal Family have a junior cadet branch surviving today in the neighbourhood of Whitby North Yorkshire. Two Merovingian Princes visited Whitby during the synod of Whitby in 664. Some members of the family living in the neighbourhood of Whitby are directly descended in the male line from Clovis the Frank and therefore under the Salic Law have a claim to the ancient thrones of the Frankish Kingdoms. This is the only branch of the family known to survive in the pure male line, after nearly all the Merovingians living in France were murdered by Pepin de Herstal, Charlemagne's great grandfather. Only one male member of the North Yorkshire branch of the family is known to have the traditional family birthmark in the shape of a fleur de lis.

'''''Havengore''''' is a former [[hydrography|hydrographic]] [[survey ship|survey launch]], originally launched in 1956 for service with the [[Port of London Authority]] (PLA). After her withdrawal from service and sale in 1995, she was re-registered as a [[passenger vessel]] for up to 40 passengers. Based on the [[River Thames]], ''Havengore'' has also served as a [[ceremony|ceremonial vessel]]. She is best known for her carrying the body of [[Sir Winston Churchill]] as part of his [[State Funeral]].

''Havengore'' was named after [[Havengore Island]], a low-lying marshy island off the coast of [[Essex]]. The derivation of the word Havengore is Old English, 'haefen' meaning an anchorage and 'gor' meaning muddy. The adjoining Havengore Creek marked the northern end of the [[Port of London Authority|PLA]]'s jurisdiction prior to 1964, when it was extended to include the whole of the [[Thames Estuary]]. By convention many [[Port of London Authority|PLA]] vessels are named after features of the [[River Thames]].

==History==

===Construction===
''Havengore'' was commissioned by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1954 to replace its former [[survey ship|survey vessel]] the ''Shorne Meade''. Built by Tough Brothers of [[Teddington]], she is of [[Boat building|double diagonal]] construction in [[teak]] over a framework of [[English oak]]. The [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] helped design and test her twin counter-rotating [[propeller]]s and underwater fittings, while [[Decca Radar]] oversaw trials of her [[Decca Navigator System|survey systems]]. She was launched in 1956.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/churchill,-1-c-sg1lwtvz8z |title=The Historic Vessel ''Havengore'' |publisher=[[Sotheby's]] |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neptune"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Browne, Sally |title=Port of London Authority's ''Havengore'': Saving Sir Winston Churchill's Funeral Launch |journal=[[American Neptune]] |volume=59 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956-1995: Port of London Authority===
''Havengore'' entered service with the [[Port of London Authority]] on 4 February 1956. As the PLA's [[hydrographic survey]] vessel, she was responsible for recording changes to the bed of the [[River Thames]] and [[Thames Estuary]]. She was the first [[research ship|survey vessel]] in the UK to install a computer to record [[hydrographic survey|survey data]], using [[punched tape]]; replacement [[Unix]] workstations were installed in 1989. After becoming the longest-serving PLA vessel, she performed her last hydrographic work in 1995, when she was withdrawn from service and sold.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neptune"/&gt;

===1995-2011: Private ownership===
After changing hands in 1995, ''Havengore'' was restored and refitted at the [[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] in Kent. Subsequently, she was used by the Havengore Education and Leadership Mission (HELM) to provide excursions for underprivileged children on the [[River Medway]]. Changing hands again in 2006, three further phases of [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] - including the reuse of parts from a [[0-4-0]] [[diesel locomotive]] - have ensured that she remains fully operational in compliance with [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency|MCA]] regulations, while respecting her [[Ship of Theseus|historic fabric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pla.co.uk/pdfs/pp/008.PLN.MAIN.001.pdf |title=Port of London News: January/February 2005 |publisher=[[Port of London Authority]] |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/in-the-media/churchill-in-the-news/577-churchills-ship-finds-new-home |title=Churchill's Ship Finds New Home |publisher=[[The Churchill Centre|The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Cabinet War Rooms]] |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/ships_register.php?action=ship&amp;id=1819 |title=''Havengore'' |publisher=[[National Historic Ships|National Register of Historic Vessels]] |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Havengore'' participated in the river [[procession|pageant]] held to mark the 200th anniversary of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and has taken part in services marking [[Armistice Day]] and [[Armed Forces Day]]. Moored at [[St Katharine Docks]], ''Havengore'' currently undertakes a mixed programme of public service and charitable events and is also available for corporate hospitality purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.havengore.com/heritage |title=Havengore - Home/Heritage |publisher=Havengore.com |accessdate=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4191 |title=Poppy wreath laid on the Thames during Armistice Day service |publisher=London SE1 Community Website |accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/dmcl/3559158037/ |title=Sikh ceremony at St Katharine's Dock |publisher=FlickRiver |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churchill funeral==
On 30 January 1965 ''Havengore'' carried [[Sir Winston Churchill]] on his last journey by water along the River Thames from [[Tower Millennium Pier|Tower Pier]] to [[Festival Pier]] during his [[State Funeral]]. On her journey along the Thames, ''Havengore'' was saluted by a [[flypast]] of 16 [[English Electric Lightning]] fighter jets, and dock cranes were bowed as she passed. This event was broadcast live to an estimated worldwide audience of 350 million viewers, one in ten of the then [[world population]]. Archive newsreel footage is available via the [[BBC]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/churchill/11026.shtml |title=The final journey of Winston Churchill (footage of ''Havengore'' plays from c.22 minutes in) |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Havengore'' carries a [[commemorative plaque]] presented by the International Churchill Society inscribed with the words of the BBC broadcaster that day, [[Richard Dimbleby]] [[CBE]]: 'And so ''Havengore'' sails into history ... not even the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' had borne so great a man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/churchill/11026.shtml |title=The State Funeral of Sir Winston Churchill |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen Elizabeth==

''Havengore'' participated in the river [[procession|pageant]] held to mark the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] in 1977.

On 17 May 2012 it was announced that the ''Havengore'' had been selected to carry members of the Royal Family as part of [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations in a flotilla of over a thousands vessels during [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant|the Thames pageant]] on 3 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The river of royalty: Queen uses Jubilee pageant to pay tribute to all her family |author=Rebecca English |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2145846 |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Royal Family who embarked on the ''Havengore'' for Thames pageant were [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]], [[Princess Beatrice of York|Princess Beatrice]], [[Princess Eugenie of York|Princess Eugenie]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Earl]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]], [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|The Duke]] and [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|Duchess of Gloucester]], and [[Prince Michael of Kent|Prince]] and [[Princess Michael of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court Circular June 3rd 2012 | url=http://www.facebook.com/notes/the-british-monarchy/court-circular-3-june-2012/ |accessdate= 5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The craft also participated in observances on the Thames marking Queen Elizabeth's surpassing of [[Queen Victoria]] as the longest-reigning British monarch on 9 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/09/queen-becomes-longest-reigning-monarch-in-british-history Business as usual as Queen steams into history books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orrin G. Hatch–Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act''', or '''Music Modernization Act''' or '''MMA''' ({{USBill|115|HR|1551}}, {{USPL|115|264}}) is United States legislation signed into law on October 11, 2018 aimed to modernize [[copyright]]-related issues for music and audio recordings due to new forms of technology like [[Streaming media|digital streaming]]. It is a consolidation of three separate bills introduced during the [[115th United States Congress]].

== Enjoined bills ==
The MMA is a combination of three bills previously introduced in Congress.&lt;ref name="verge passage"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17963804/music-modernization-act-mma-copyright-law-bill-labels-congress | title = The Music Modernization Act has been signed into law | first =Dani  |last =Deahl | date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title I: Music Modernization Act ===
The singular Act was first introduced into the House by Rep. [[Bob Goodlatte]] on December 17, 2017 ({{USBill|115|H.R.|4706}}), and later to the Senate by Sen. [[Orrin Hatch]] on January 24, 2018. Both versions of the bill looked to improve how music licensing and royalties would be paid in consideration of streaming media services. The bill established three major provisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/26/16931966/congress-music-modernization-act-licensing-royalties | title = Congress may actually fix music royalties | first=  Micah | last =Singleton | date = January 26, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It would set up a non-profit governing agency that would create a database related to the owners of the [[mechanical license]] of sound recordings - the copyright that covers the composition and lyrics of a song; the actual performance and recording of the song is typically held under a different license. The database would be completed with help of the major music publishers. The new agency would establish blanket royalty rates that would be used to pay the composers and songwriters when used by streaming services using this database, eliminating the difficulty previously faced by streaming services to properly identify the mechanical license holder. These royalties would be paid to the non-profit agency as a [[compulsory license]], not requiring the mechanical license holder's permission; the agency would then be responsible for distributing the royalties. Streaming services would still be able to negotiate other royalty rates directly with the mechanical license owner if they so chose.
# It assures that songwriters are paid a portion of mechanical license royalties for either physical or digital reproduction of a song with their lyrics, at a rate set by contract.
# It revamps the rate court process when disagreements over royalty rates arise. Prior, a single judge in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] was assigned to handle all cases; the bill would assign a random judge in this Court to oversee these cases.
In addition, elements of the "Fair Play Fair Pay Act", {{USBill|115|H.R.|1836}}, introduced on March 30, 2017 by Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]] were added to this Title. The Fair Play Fair Pay Act had been designed to harmonize how royalties were paid by terrestrial radio broadcasters and Internet streaming services. Under previous law, songwriters and composers would receive mechanical license royalties for radio play, but the performing artists would not be paid as the use of songs on the radio was considered "promotional". The Fair Play Fair Pay Act had included language that would allow recording artists to receive performance royalties. However, these parts of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act were not included in the combined Music Modernization Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/music-modernization-act-to-be-introduced-tuesday-1202748355/ | title = Music Modernization Act to Be Introduced Tuesday | first = Paula | last = Parisi | date = April 9, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title II: CLASSICS Act ===
{{main|CLASSICS Act}}
The Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society (CLASSICS) Act was originally introduced in the House as {{USBill|115|H.R.|3301}} in July 2017. In US Copyright Law, sound recordings made prior to February 15, 1972 were not covered under federal copyright law, leaving them up to the individual states to pass laws for recording protection. This had created a complex series of laws that made it difficult for copyright enforcement and royalty payments. The CLASSICS Act established that sound recording before 1972 are covered by copyright until February 15, 2067, with additional language to grandfather in older songs into the public domain at an earlier time. Recordings prior to 1923 will enter the public domain three years from passage (January 1, 2022, as all U.S. copyright terms end on December 31), and with recordings between 1923 and 1956 being phased into the public domain over the next few decades.

=== Title III: Allocation for Music Producers Act ===
The Allocation for Music Producers (AMP) Act bill was introduced by Rep. [[Joseph Crowley]] on February 6, 2017 as {{USBill|115|H.R.|881}}. The bill designates that [[SoundExchange]], the non-profit organization established by Congress to distribute royalties on sound recordings, to also distribute part of those royalties to "a producer, mixer, or sound engineer who was part of the creative process that created [the] sound recording".

==Passage==
The three bills were consolidated in the House by Goodlatte on April 10, 2018 as {{USBill|115|H.R.|5447}} , which passed the bill on April 25, 2018. Hatch introduced the combined bill in the Senate as {{USBill|115|S.|2823}} on May 10, 2018. During the Senate's review, the body voted to move the bill to an existing, unrelated bill, {{USBill|115|H.R.|1551}}, which the House agreed to. The Senate voted in favor of the bill on September 19, 2018, and was subsequently signed into law by President [[Donald Trump]] on October 11, 2018.&lt;ref name="verge passage"/&gt; Among those in attendance at the signing were musicians [[Kid Rock]], [[Mike Love]], [[Sam Moore]], [[John Rich]], [[Craig Morgan]] and [[Jeff Baxter]], and the Christian group [[MercyMe]]. While [[Kanye West]] had been reported to be attended the signing, he was not present though had a luncheon with President Trump later that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/trump-signs-music-modernization-act-736185/ | title = Trump Signs Landmark Music Bill Into Law | first = Amy | last = Wang | date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work =[[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/trump-signs-music-modernization-act-1202976848/ | title = Trump Signs Sweeping New Music Licensing Legislation | first = Ted | last = Johnson |date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate= October 11, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The bills in both House and Senate had bipartisan support, as well as strong support from numerous music industry groups representing musicians, producers, and publishers, as well as from digital streaming media services and related industry groups.&lt;ref name="variety support"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/music/news/senate-passes-music-modernization-act-1202947518/ | title = Senate Passes Music Modernization Act | date = September 18, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital streaming platforms [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]] had both come under prior separate legal actions for unpaid royalties for streaming music in part due to a lack of a central database for which to track down songwriters and composers, and had even set aside part of their working capital to deal with legal issues in order to offer full music catalogs, in contrast to [[Amazon.com]]'s music selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wixens-1-6-billion-spotify-lawsuit-what-you-need-to-know-202532/ | title = Wixen’s $1.6 Billion Spotify Lawsuit: What You Need to Know | first =Daniel | last =Kreps | date = January 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17117160/spotify-mechanical-license-copyright-wixen-explainer  | title = A $1.6 BILLION SPOTIFY LAWSUIT IS BASED ON A LAW MADE FOR PLAYER PIANOS | first = Sarah | last =Jeong | date = March 14, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17927852/music-modernization-act-streaming-monetization-meredith-rose-vergecast | title = How the Music Modernization Act will help artists get paid more from streaming | first = Nilay | last = Patel | date = October 2, 2018 | accessdate = October 21, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a last-minute conflict in the Senate, brought up by [[SESAC]] and [[SiriusXM]], relating to royalties for pre-1972 sound recordings, but a deal was made between SiriusXM, the [[National Music Publishers Association]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] which allowed the bill to be passed by the Senate by a unanimous vote, allowing the bill to quickly pass through Congress via "hotlining" before the end of the session.&lt;ref name="variety support"/&gt;

The '''National Health Insurance''' scheme (or '''NHI''') is a form of [[national health insurance]] established by the Government of the [[British Virgin Islands]] through the Ministry of Health, with a goal to provide access to and financial coverage for health care services to British Virgin Islands residents.&lt;ref name="What is NHI"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvissb.vg/nhi/what-is-nhi/|title=What is NHI?|publisher=British Virgin Islands Social Security Board|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It came into effect on 1 January 2016.&lt;ref name=1Jan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1451938826|title=It's A Celebration; We Listened - Skelton On NHI|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme is based on two fundamental principles:&lt;ref name="What is NHI" /&gt;
# payments are shared based on ability to pay, without worrying  about health risks such as age, occupation or pre-existing health conditions; and
# healthcare benefits are equally available to everyone.

The scheme is administered by the Social Security Board of the British Virgin Islands.  The Deputy Director with responsibility for the scheme is Mr Roy Barry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvissb.vg/nhi/nhi-team/|title=The National Health Insurance Team|publisher=BVI Social Security Board|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary legislation relating to the scheme was implemented by amendments to the Social Security Act (Cap 266),&lt;ref&gt;Social Security (Amendment) Act, 2014.  {{cite web|url=http://www.bvigazette.org/index.php?pageid=37&amp;menuid=44|title=Volume XLVIII (2014)|publisher=''[[Virgin Islands Official Gazette]]''|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsidiary implementing legislation is the Social Security (National Health Insurance) Regulations, 2015.

From a relatively early stage of the scheme's life, doubts were expressed about its long term sustainability.&lt;ref name=Doubts /&gt;  In the year 2017 it ran at a deficit of nearly US$650,000, with greater losses predicted in 2018.&lt;ref name=Losses /&gt;

==History==

{{As of|2013}} the British Virgin Islands Health Services Authority provided approximately US$6.6 million worth of services annually, but only receives about $1.8 million from patients.&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nhf.org.jm/cchfi/images/pdf/8th_CCHFI_presentations/Day_1/BVI_-_LESSONS_LEARNED_-_CBEAN_CONFERENCE_ON_HEALTH_FINANCING_1.pdf|title=Lessons Learned on the journey towards implementation|author=Roy Barry|publisher=British Virgin Islands Social Security Board|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shortfall is paid principally by the Ministry of Health&lt;ref name=Budget&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1415113657|title=Gov't Attempts To Justify Major Hike In Hospital Fees|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=4 November 2014|quote=The budget estimates total revenue generation of $10.5 million, close to $1 million above last year's total. However, total expenditure is budgeted at $34.4 million, which means that the unfunded amount of recurrent expenditure is $23.9 million.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the balance is either written off or allowed to roll over as uncollected debts by the BVIHSA.  Public health care is also effectively subsidised by pricing services at a level which is deliberately set below the actual cost of providing the care.&lt;ref name=Budget /&gt;  User fees are estimated to recover just 8% of the operating costs of primary and secondary health care services.&lt;ref name=PAHO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/documents/events/belize/British_Virgin_Island_healthsystemsprofile.pps|title=Health Systems and Services Profile for the British Virgin Islands|publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]]|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the net expenditure on health accounts for approximately 17% of total government expenditure.&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt;  Attempts to reduce the strain on Government by increasing the cost of services have proved to be politically controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/16m-expected-annually-from-fee-increase/|title=$16M expected annually from fee increase|publisher=BVI News|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the chronic shortfall, the Government proposed devising a National Health Insurance scheme to essentially pass most of this cost on to employed persons and the businesses that employed them.  The Ministry of Health developed the supporting operational framework and legislation, in consultation with the University of the West Indies Health Economics Unit.&lt;ref name=Lessons  /&gt;

The proposed scheme was first suggested in approximately 2006.&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt;  Whether by coincidence or design, this was approximately the same time as the Government embarked an ambitious rebuilding project in relation to the main Government hospital, [[Peebles Hospital]].  The new hospital has been a financial disaster for the Government.  It was originally budgeted at approximately US$10 million, and expected to take just under 2 years to construct.  In the event, the hospital cost well over US$100 million to construct, and took over a decade.  It also costs a further US$16 million to furnish to become operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/new-hospital-finally-completed-health-minister-appeals-for-donations/|title=New hospital finally completed; Health Minister appeals for donations|publisher=BVI News|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by 2012 public debt had quadrupled from pre-2007 levels to approximately US$113 million (approximately 10.3% of GDP).&lt;ref name="Public Debt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/bvi/national-debt-grows-by-73m-over-last-decade-public-sector-too-big-financial-secretary/|title=National debt grows by $73M over last decade; public sector too big – Financial Secretary|publisher=BVI News|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 84% of that public debt was attributable to the new public hospital project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caribbeanmedicalnews.com/2013/04/new-hospital-responsible-for-nearly-84-of-national-debt/|title=New hospital responsible for nearly 84% of national debt|publisher=Caribbean Medical News|date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; exacerbating budget stresses.

The NHI scheme was seen as a way of alleviating the cash-drain caused by underwriting public health expenditure.&lt;ref name=Reduce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1389610272&amp;ref=|title=Gov't To Pump $50M Into NHI|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=13 January 2014|quote=Minister for Education and Culture, Hon. [[Myron Walwyn]] recently stated that with the launch of NHI, Government will save $22M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial budgets provided for the scheme to raise approximately US$22 million,&lt;ref name=Reduce /&gt; leaving the Government still funding a balance of approximately US$8 million.  However, the proposal remains [[National Health Insurance (British Virgin Islands)#Controversy|controversial amongst the public]], not least because - in simple terms - it amounts to the equivalent of a 7.5% increase in taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Total tax revenues for the British Virgin Islands for 2014 were US$302 million ({{cite web|url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/sites/default/files/2015%20Budget%20Address.pdf|title=2015 Budget Address|publisher=Government of the Virgin Islands|page=8|accessdate=26 August 2015}}); the NHI levy is budgeted to raise US$22 million, or approximately 7.3% of annual Government revenues.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even with the expected revenue from the NHI scheme, the hospital will still be heavily underfunded, with an estimated budget shortfall of US$7 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/nhi-not-enough-hospital-in-financial-bind/|title=NHI not enough; hospital in financial bind|publisher=BVI News|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commencement==

Implementation of the scheme was repeatedly delayed.  Legislation was implemented to bring NHI into effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1396262302|title=Legislation For Implementation Of National Health Insurance Up For Debate Thursday|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the proposed date at the time was for NHI to have come into effect in October 2014, this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1397047741|title=NHI Could Come On Stream By October; Plans Shrouded In Secrecy - Says Opponents|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Revised dates have included January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginislandsnewsonline.com/en/news/controversial-nhi-scheme-to-begin-jan-2015-roy-barry|title=Controversial NHI scheme to begin Jan 2015 – Roy Barry|publisher=Virgin Islands News Online|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/nhi-likely-to-start-in-september-skelton-reveals/|title=NHI likely to start in September, Skelton reveals|publisher=BVI News|date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although during election campaigning the Minister for Health suggested this might be pushed back to January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/bring-on-nhi-when-taxes-are-low-skelton/|title=Bring on NHI when taxes are low – Skelton|publisher=BVI News|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is consistent with press assumptions that, because NHI will involve making deductions from payroll (which will be perceived similarly to a tax increase), implementation would likely to be postponed until after the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 2015|2015 general election]] (which occurred in June).

Eventually registration of persons commenced on 1 September 2015, and the scheme itself came into effect on 1 January 2016.&lt;ref name=Start&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/fully-prepared-nhi-registration-starts-september/|title=Fully Prepared -NHI registration starts September|publisher=BVI News|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it had previously been suggested that collections would start three months prior to any benefits being available, the Ministry for Health confirmed that benefits will be available immediately from the time of first payments.&lt;ref name=Start /&gt;

===Early experiences===

In September 2016 a local newsite ran an article referring to the National Health Insurance scheme as a "national disappointment".&lt;ref name=Disappointment&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=25544|title=The Exploitation Of NHI!|author=Javon Liburd|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the article did note that much of the disappointment arose from local health service providers increasing fees beyond coverage levels forcing consumers to pay increased out-of-pocket claims.

==Controversy==

The scheme has been controversial since its inception.  Upon its implementation one news site described it as having been subjected to a "barrage of criticisms from the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1440948647 |title=No Stopping NHI; Launch Set For Tuesday |publisher=BVI Platinum |date=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because [[List of political parties in the British Virgin Islands|all of the major political parties in the British Virgin Islands]] supported the scheme, there has been very little debate over the proposals and progress towards the scheme has continued despite changes in Government.  Nonetheless, the strong criticisms have been voiced in relation to the proposals, including the relatively expensive cost of the insurance compared to the private sector,&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1440594972|title=More Questions Than Answers|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relatively low lifetime cap (and that a person will continue having to pay contributions after they hit the lifetime cap),&lt;ref name=Questions /&gt; and questions regarding the validity of Government statistics which were used to justify the introduction of the scheme.&lt;ref name=High&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1440544416|title=BREAKING NEWS: Did Gov't Lie? Over 60% Currently Covered By Insurance; Huge Layoffs As NHI Nears|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doubts have also been expressed whether the limited staff and resources will be able to handle the estimated 200,000 claims each year.&lt;ref name=Tough&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/not-so-fast-nhi-faces-tough-questions/|title=Not so fast – NHI faces tough questions|publisher=BVI News|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after registration commenced, an online petition started urging the Government to abandon the proposed National Health Insurance scheme and reconsider the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/petition-starts-as-pressure-mounts-against-nhi/|title=Petition launched as pressure mounts against NHI|publisher=BVI News|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That petition was brushed aside, which led to threats of potential legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/legal-showdown-likely-over-nh/|title=Legal showdown likely over NHI|publisher=BVI News|date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on small businesses===

Concerns have also been expressed in the media and by politicians that the additional levy on salary (for both the employer and employee) would depress wages and limit job creation.  These concerns have been largely brushed aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1440369964|title=Bring Me The Statistics - Barry On NHI Impact On Small Businesses|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction on a further levy on employers may create a disincentive to employ additional persons and create downward pressure on wages, with one [[British Virgin Islands news websites|local news website]] warning of the risk of "huge layoffs".&lt;ref name=High /&gt;

===Reinsurance===

To date the scheme has no reinsurers, and has not tendered for any reinsurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1440112773|title=NHI: No Re-Insurers Secured; Scheme Offering Basic Package|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Private health insurance brokers in the Territory have questioned the viability of this.&lt;ref name=Tough /&gt;

===Financing===

The Government has come under periodic pressure, questioning whether the entire project is financially viable.  Only in 2015 did the Government make limited details of actuarial studies conducted in 2012 available to the public.&lt;ref name=Survive /&gt;  Opponents of the scheme have pointed to studies which purportedly show that the scheme could potentially run at a deficit of US$45 – 200 million by the fourth year of its operation, excluding costs associated with "lawsuits over confidentiality, malpractice and errors and omissions".  Including such costs the shortfall may increase to as much as US$400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1446724201 |title=NHI Could Dent Gov't Coffers Up To $400M; Dutch Model Suggested |publisher=BVI Platinum |author= |date=5 November 2015 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, annual Government revenues for the entire Territory in 2014 were US$302 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.vg/Portals/0/2014%20Budget%20Estimates.pdf|title=2014 Budget Estimates|publisher=Government of the Virgin Islands|accessdate=5 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041815/http://www.finance.gov.vg/Portals/0/2014%20Budget%20Estimates.pdf|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent actuarial studies indicated that the Government may have underestimated the costs by as much as 14%.&lt;ref name=Penalties /&gt;  Despite the fact that the official census records a population of just over 28,000 in the Territory, nearly 40,000 enrolled in the NHI scheme, which may reflect a large number of non-residents living in the nearby [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] who hold BVI citizenship also registering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/nhi-showed-the-real-population-governor/|title=NHI showed the real population – Governor|publisher=BVI News|date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A little over a year after the scheme was introduced, the Government was already expressing concerns about its sustainability.&lt;ref name=Doubts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/over-200000-claims-in-one-year-nhi-worried/|title=Over 200,000 claims in one year – NHI WORRIED|publisher=BVI News|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory requirements===

All insurers are required by British Virgin Islands law to maintain a regulatory licence to conduct insurance business, to have business plans and financial feasibility approved by the independent regulator, and to deposit capital in a secured account with respect to long term contingent liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvifsc.vg/en-gb/divisions/insurance.aspx|title=FSC: Insurance Division|publisher=[[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission]]|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHI scheme was not required to do any of these things.

===Withdrawal of benefits===
In November 2016 the director of the scheme, Roy Barry, announced that thousands of employees were to have their benefits withdrawn because their employers had not paid over the relevant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/as-promised-nhi-suspends-over-1000-employees/|title=As promised: NHI suspends over 1,000 employees|publisher=BVI News|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This action was taken notwithstanding that the employers in question had deducted the contributions from the employees' pay.  Newspaper reports subsequently pointed out that this action was illegal under the relevant statutory instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Silva |first=Ken |date=15 December 2016 |title=NHI collection strategy breaks law |newspaper=[[BVI Beacon]] |location= }}  '"The failure of an employer to pay contributions in respect of an employee ... shall in now way affect the benefits that an employee is entitled to under the NHI System," states NHI Regulations 31.'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
In February 2017 it was reported that the Social Security Board was being sued a Florida-based company, JIPA Network, in relation to an October 2015 agreement to provide access to thousands of preferred healthcare providers overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=26471 |title=SSB Sued Over NHI|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
===Contributions===
NHI will be funded by contributions made by all employed persons working in the British Virgin Islands, and deducted in the same manner as social security contributions.  Contributions will be based on a percentage rate applied to a maximum of twice the national insurable earnings&lt;ref&gt;Social Security (National Health Insurance) Regulations, 2015, regulation 23 and Schedule 3.&lt;/ref&gt; which was most recently set at US$38,610 per annum for 2014.  Accordingly, the ceiling for NHI deductions on earnings would be US$77,220 - any income earned above that figure would not be subject to deduction.  Income up to that level would be subject to the NHI deduction at the proposed initial rate is 7.5%.  That rate is to be split equally between employer and employee - so the employee has 3.75% deducted from their salary, and the employer pays a 3.75% levy on payroll.  The maximum monthly contribution for one individual would be US$482.63 per month based up on 2014 maximum insurable earnings.

However, unemployed spouses will have to contribute 7.5% based on ''their partners''' insurable earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security (National Health Insurance) Regulations, 2015, regulation 22(4) and Schedule 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, couples where only one partner works will be subject to effectively a double levy.  Accordingly, an employed person with a non-working spouse might be required to pay as much as US$965.26.

Children under 18 will be exempt (or up to 25 if in full-time education).

===Budget===
Initially financial modelling (conducted in 2012) projected that the total revenue generated annually by NHI was expected to be $74,308,000, and expenditure was expected to be approximately $70,788,000 annually in the initial stage.  The expected revenues were broken down into Government's direct contribution (approximately $39,273,000); premium contributions (approximately $28,825,000); and revenue from investment returns, co-payments and surcharges (approximately $6,210,000).&lt;ref name=Survive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bvinews.com/new/govt-presents-numbers-insists-nhi-can-survive/ |title=Gov’t presents numbers, insists NHI can survive |publisher=BVI News |author= |date=7 September 2015 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under some pressure from the public, the Government requested a fresh actuarial assessment in 2015.&lt;ref name=Survive /&gt;  When released the second actuarial study indicated that the expenditure could be as high as $81,000,000 (or 14% higher than projected), and that the Government's contribution would thereby increase to approximately $43,000,000.&lt;ref name=Penalties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1467850922|title=Over 800 Penalized For Registering Late With NHI|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revised consultants report in June 2016 indicated that costs were expected to be $80.5 million in the first year (2016) and rising to $92.5 million by 2020.  54 per cent of that cost is to be met directly by Government, and 46 per cent of the cost from mandatory contributions by workers.&lt;ref name=Consultants&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/govt-consultant-wary-of-nhi-risks-rising-costs/|title=Gov’t consultant wary of NHI risks, rising costs|publisher=BVI News|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same report also advised the Government to include a $16.7 million contingency on its accounts for the "numerous contingent events and risks" that the scheme is exposed to.&lt;ref name=Consultants /&gt;

In July 2016 it was reported that "over 800 people" were penalised for registering late on the scheme.&lt;ref name=Penalties /&gt;

===Deficits===
In June 2018 it was reported that the NHI scheme had run at a net loss of US$646,843 for the calendar year 2017.&lt;ref name=Losses&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/nhi-hopes-to-limit-health-coverage-of-select-beneficiaries/ |title=NHI hopes to limit health coverage of select beneficiaries |publisher=BVI News|date=12 June 2018|quote=The NHI’s total expenditure ($80,476,662) was more than its total income ($79,882,819) and this disparity resulted in a net loss of $646,843. Director Skelton projected “a bigger loss” for 2018. She said this is because a number of hurricane-affected businesses are still nonfunctional. Some 36,057 persons were registered with NHI at the end of 2017.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Losses were expected to be greater in 2018 because of the cumulative [[Effects of Hurricane Irma in the British Virgin Islands|effects of Hurricane Irma]].  The same report also indicated that 36,057 persons were registered with NHI at the end of 2017, despite the resident population of the British Virgin Islands being only approximately 27,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/bvis-population-drops-by-4000/|title=BVI’s population drops by 4,000 |publisher=BVI News|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was originally an [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner ethnic nationalist]] party that promoted [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] interests in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/national-party-np|title=National Party (NP)|first=|last=sahoboss|date=30 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in the early 1990s it became a South African [[Civic nationalism|civic nationalist]] party seeking to represent all South Africans. It first became the governing party of the country in 1924. It was in opposition during [[World War II]] but it returned to power and was again in the government from 4 June 1948 until 9 May 1994. 

Beginning in 1948 the party as the governing party of South Africa began implementing its policy of [[racial segregation]], known as [[apartheid]] (the Afrikaans term for "separateness"). Although white-minority rule and racial segregation based on [[white supremacy]] were already in existence in South Africa with non-whites not having voting rights and efforts made to encourage segregation, apartheid intensified the segregation with stern penalties for non-whites entering into areas designated for whites-only without having a pass to permit them to do so (known as the [[pass laws]]), interracial marriage and sexual relationships were illegal and punishable offences, and blacks faced significant restrictions on [[property rights]]. Upon South Africa being condemned in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] for its policies of apartheid the NP-led government had South Africa leave the Commonwealth, abandon its monarchy led by the British monarch and become a republic. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, the NP-led government faced internal unrest in South Africa and international pressure for accommodation of non-Whites in South Africa resulted in policies of granting concessions to the non-white population, while still retaining the apartheid system, such as the creation of [[Bantustan|Bantustans]] that were autonomous self-governing black homelands (criticized for several of them being broken up into unconnected pieces and that they were still dominated by the white minority South African government), removing legal prohibitions on interracial marriage, and legalizing non-white and multiracial political parties (however the outlawed though very popular [[African National Congress]] (ANC), was not legalized due to the government identifying it as a terrorist organization). Those identified as [[Coloureds]] and [[Indian South Africans]] were granted separate legislatures in 1983 alongside the main legislature that represented whites to provide them self-government while maintaining apartheid, but no such legislature was provided to the black population as their self-government was to be provided through the Bantustans. The NP-led government began changed laws affected by the apartheid system that had come under heavy domestic and international condemnation such as removing the pass laws, granting blacks full property rights that ended previous major restrictions on black ownership of land, and the right to form trade unions. Following escalating economic sanctions over apartheid, negotiations between the NP-led government led by [[P. W. Botha]] and the outlawed ANC led by then-imprisoned [[Nelson Mandela]] began in 1987 with Botha seeking to accommodate the ANC's demands and consider releasing Mandela and legalizing the ANC on the condition that it would renounce use of political violence to attain its aims.

In the [[South African general election, 1989|1989 South African general election]], the party under [[F. W. de Klerk]]'s leadership declared that it intended to negotiate with the black South African community for a political solution to accommodate black South Africans. This resulted in De Klerk declaring in February 1990 the decision to transition South Africa out of apartheid, and permitted the release of Mandela from prison and ending South Africa's ban on the ANC and other anti-apartheid movements, and began negotiations with the ANC for a post-apartheid political system. However there was significant opposition among hardliner supporters of apartheid that resulted in De Klerk's government responding to them by holding a [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992|national referendum on Apartheid]] in 1992 for the white population only allowed to vote in that asked them if they supported the government's policy to end apartheid and establish elections open to all South Africans, a large majority voted in favour of the government's policy. With support for ending apartheid secured among white South Africans, the party opened up its membership to all racial groups and rebranded itself as no longer being an ethnic nationalist party only representing Afrikaners, but would henceforth be a civic nationalist and conservative party representing all South Africans. In the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 elections]] it managed to expand its base to include many non-whites including significant support from Coloured and Indian South Africans. It participated in the Government of National Unity between 1994 and 1996. In an attempt to distance itself from its past, the party was renamed the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] in 1997. The attempt was largely unsuccessful and the new party decided to merge with the ANC.

==Founding and early history==
[[File:Flag of the South African National Party (1936–1993).svg|thumb|200px|Flag of the National Party from 1936 until 1993]]

The National Party was founded in [[Bloemfontein]] in 1914 by [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalists]] soon after the establishment of the [[Union of South Africa]]. Its founding was rooted in disagreements among [[South African Party]] politicians, particularly Prime Minister [[Louis Botha]] and his first Minister of Justice, [[J. B. M. Hertzog]]. After Hertzog began speaking out publicly against the Botha government's "one-stream" policy in 1912, Botha removed him from the cabinet. Hertzog and his followers in the Orange Free State province subsequently moved to establish the National Party to oppose the government by advocating a "two-stream" policy of equal rights for the English and Afrikaner communities. Afrikaner nationalists in the Transvaal and Cape provinces soon followed suit, so that three distinct provincial NP organisations were in existence in time for the [[South African general election, 1915|1915 general elections]].

The NP first came to power in coalition with the Labour Party in 1924, with Hertzog as [[List of Prime Ministers of South Africa|Prime Minister]]. In 1930 the Hertzog government worked to undermine the vote of [[Coloureds]] (South Africans of mixed white and non-white ancestry) by granting the right to vote to white women, thus doubling white political power. In 1934 Hertzog agreed to merge his National Party with the rival [[South African Party]] of [[Jan Smuts]] to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]]. A hardline faction of Afrikaner nationalists led by [[Daniel François Malan]] refused to accept the merger and maintained a [[rump party|rump]] National Party called the 'Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party' ([[Purified National Party]]). The Purified National Party used opposition to South African participation in [[World War II]] to stir up anti-British feelings amongst Afrikaners. This led to a reunification of the Purified Nationalists with the faction that had merged with the South African Party; together they formed the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] (Reunited National Party), which went on to defeat Smuts' United Party in 1948 in coalition with the much smaller [[Afrikaner Party]]. In 1951, the two amalgamated to once again become known simply as the National Party.

==Apartheid==
{{main|Apartheid}}
{{Apartheid}}
Upon taking power after the [[South African general election, 1948|1948 general election]], the NP began to implement a program of apartheid – the legal system of political, economic and social separation of the races intended to maintain and extend political and economic control of South Africa by the white minority.

In 1959 the [[Bantu Self-Government Act]] established so-called Homelands (sometime pejoratively called [[Bantustans]]) for ten different black tribes. The ultimate goal of the NP was to move all black South Africans into one of these homelands (although they might continue to work in South Africa as "guest workers"), leaving what was left of South Africa (about 87 percent of the land area) with what would then be a white majority, at least on paper. As the homelands were seen by the apartheid government as embryonic independent nations, all black South Africans were registered as citizens of the homelands, not of the nation as a whole, and were expected to exercise their political rights only in the homelands. Accordingly, the three token parliamentary seats that had been reserved for white representatives of black South Africans in the [[Cape Province]] were scrapped. The other three provinces – [[Transvaal Province]], the [[Orange Free State Province]], and [[Natal Province]] had never allowed any black representation.

[[Coloureds]] were removed from the Common Roll of Cape Province in 1953. Instead of voting for the same representatives as white South Africans, they could now only vote for four white representatives to speak for them. Later, in 1968, the Coloureds were disenfranchised altogether. In the place of the four parliamentary seats, a partially elected body was set up to advise the government in an amendment to the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act]]. This made the electorate entirely white, as [[Indian South Africans]] had never had any representation.

In a move unrecognised by the rest of the world, the former German colony of [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]), which South Africa had occupied in [[World War I]], was effectively incorporated into South Africa as a [[League of Nations mandate]], with seven members elected to represent its white citizens in the [[Parliament of South Africa]]. The white minority of South-West Africa, predominantly Germans and Afrikaners, considered its interests akin to those of the Afrikaners in South Africa and therefore supported the National Party in subsequent elections.

These reforms all bolstered the NP politically, as they removed black and Coloured influence – which was hostile to the NP – from the electoral process, and incorporated the pro-nationalist whites of South-West Africa. The NP increased its parliamentary majority in almost every election between 1948 and 1977.

Numerous segregation laws had been passed before the NP took power in 1948. Among the most significant were the 'Natives Land Act, No 27 of 1913', and the 'Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923'. The former made it illegal for blacks to purchase or lease land from whites except in reserves, which restricted black occupancy to less than eight percent of South Africa's land. The latter laid the foundations for [[residential segregation]] in urban areas. apartheid laws passed by the NP after 1948 included the 'Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act', the 'Immorality Act', the 'Population Registration Act', and the 'Group Areas Act', which prohibited non-white males from being in certain areas of the country (especially at night) unless they were employed there.

==From dominion to republic==
{{see also|History of South Africa (1815–1910)||History of South Africa (1910–1948)}}
The NP was a strong advocate of [[republicanism]]. Republics had existed in South Africa prior to the British invasion, and Afrikaner nationalists had been pursuing them ever since. The republican ideal was a new one to [[Cape Dutch]] descended Afrikaners but not to those of [[Boers|Boer]] descent: in the 1830s, the [[Great Trek]] had brought about the formation of three independent Boer republics – the ephemeral [[Natalia Republic]] (today KwaZulu-Natal), the [[South African Republic]] (later Transvaal) and the [[Orange Free State]] (called simply Free State today). Boers governed themselves within these republics and were not required to answer to the British. This liberty was short-lived however, as the United Kingdom extended its rule over all of southern Africa. Natalia was annexed in the 1840s, and the other two republics were taken over by the British in the [[Second Boer War]].

The republican ideal was not crushed, however. In 1914, the Afrikaners led the failed [[Maritz Rebellion]] against the government; in 1916 an NP congress called initially for a return to republicanism but then decided that it was too early; 1918 saw the founding of the [[Broederbond]] (Brother Bond), a cultural establishment with powerful Afrikaner nationalist and republican overtones. The Republican Bond was established in the 1930s, and other republican organisations such as the [[Purified National Party]], the [[Voortrekkers]], Noodhulpliga (First-Aid League) and the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings (Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations) also came into being. There was a popular outpouring of nationalist sentiment around the 1938 centenary of the Great Trek and the [[Battle of Blood River]]. It was seen to signify the perpetuation of white South African culture, and anti-British and pro-republican feelings grew stronger.

It was obvious in political circles that the [[Union of South Africa]] was headed inexorably towards republicanism. Although it remained a [[Dominion|British dominion]] even after unification in 1910, the country became all the more self-regulating; indeed, it already had complete autonomy on certain issues. It was agreed in 1910 that domestic matters would be looked after by the South African government but that the country's external affairs would still remain British-controlled.

Hertzog's trip to the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] was a definite (if failed) attempt to gain independence. In 1926, however, the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] was passed, affording every British dominion within the [[British Empire]] equal rank and bestowing upon them their own right of direction of foreign issues. This resulted the following year in the institution of South Africa's first-ever Department of Foreign Affairs. 1931 saw a backtrack as the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] resolved that British dominions could not have "total" control over their external concerns, but in 1934 the Status and Seals Acts were passed, granting the South African Parliament even greater power than the British government over the Union.

The extreme NP members of the 1930s were known collectively as the Republikeinse Bond. The following organisations, parties and events promoted the republican ideal in the 1930s:

===D. F. Malan===
[[File:DFMalanPortret.jpg|thumb|upright|D. F. Malan, leader of the NP from 1934 until 1953]]
{{main|Daniel François Malan}}
There was some confusion about the republican ideal during the war years. The [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]], with Hertzog its leader, pushed the issue into the background. After Hertzog left the party, however, it became republican. In 1942 and 1944 Daniel François Malan introduced a motion in the House of Assembly in favour of the establishment of a republic, but this was defeated.

When the NP came to power in 1948 (making it the first all-Afrikaner cabinet since 1910), there were two uppermost priorities that it was determined to fulfill:

* Find a solution to the racial problem.
* Lead South Africa to independence and republican status.

Between 1948 and 1961, Prime Ministers D. F. Malan, J. G. Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd all worked very hard for the latter, implementing a battery of policies and changes in a bid to increase the country's autonomy. Divided loyalty, they felt, was holding South Africa back. They wanted to break the country's ties with the United Kingdom and establish a republic, and many South Africans grew confident that a republic was possible.

Unfortunately for its republicans, however, the NP was not in a strong parliamentary position. Although it held a majority (only five) of seats, a large number of these were in rural constituencies, which had far fewer voters than urban constituencies. The United Party held a 100,000-vote lead. Consequently, the NP had to rely on the Afrikaner Party's support. It did not, therefore, have the groundswell of public support that it needed to win a referendum, and only when it had that majority on its side could a referendum be held on the republican matter. However, with a small seating majority and a total vote-tally minority, it was impossible for now for Malan and his ardently republican nats to bring about a republic constitutionally. In the interim, the NP would have to consolidate itself and not antagonise the British.

Many English-speakers did not want to break their ties with the United Kingdom. However, in 1949, at the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] in London (with Malan in attendance), India requested that, in spite of its newly attained republican status, it remain a member of the British Commonwealth. When this was granted the following year by the [[London Declaration]],&lt;ref&gt;The same was subsequently applied to Pakistan, Ceylon and Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt; it roused a great deal of debate in South Africa between the pro-republican NP and the anti-republican UP (under Strauss). What it meant was that, even if South Africa did become a republic, it did not automatically have to sever all of its ties with the UK and the British Commonwealth. This gained the movement further support from the English-speaking populace, which was less worried about being isolated; and the republican ideal looked closer than ever to being fulfilled.

Although he could not yet make South Africa a republic, Malan could prepare the country for this eventuality. In his term of office, from 1948 to 1954, Malan took a number of steps to break ties with the UK:

* The South African Citizenship Act was passed in 1949. Before, South Africans had not been citizens but rather subjects of the British Crown, regardless of whether they were permanent residents or had only recently migrated. The 1949 Act established South African citizenship. Before, British citizens needed a mere two years in the country to qualify as South Africans; now, however, a British immigrant was just like any other immigrant: they would have to register and remain in South Africa for five years to become a citizen of the country. It was believed that this could well have an influence on a republican referendum. The Act ensured that the British immigrant population would not reduce the Afrikaner majority.
* In 1950 the right of appeal to the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in London was revoked. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein was now South Africa's highest court.
* Malan was a crucial player in the move to get the word "British" taken away from "British Commonwealth". This change was taken as affirmation of the fact that all member countries were voluntary and equal members.
* In 1951 pro-republican Ernest George Jansen was assigned the post of Governor-General (Head of State). This endorsed the idea of Afrikaner leadership.
* The title of the just-crowned Queen was modified in 1953 from "Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas" to "Elizabeth II, Queen of South Africa". This was meant to indicate that the South African upper house had bequeathed the title upon her.

The 1953 ballot votes saw the NP fortify its position considerably, winning comfortably but still falling well short of the clear majority it sought: it had 94 seats in parliament to the UP's 57 and the Labour Party's five.

===J. G. Strijdom===
[[File:JG Strijdom.jpg|thumb|upright|J. G. Strijdom, leader of the NP from 1953 until 1958]]
{{main|J. G. Strijdom}}
Malan retired in 1954, at the age of eighty. The two succession contenders were J. G. Strijdom (Minister of Lands and Irrigation) and Havenga (Minister of Finance). Malan personally preferred the latter and, indeed, recommended him. Malan and Strijdom had clashed frequently over the years, particularly on the question of whether a republican South Africa should be inside or outside the Commonwealth.

Strijdom, however, had the support of Verwoerd and [[Ben Schoeman]], and he was eventually voted in as Prime Minister. Strijdom was a passionate and outspoken Afrikaner and republican, and he wholeheartedly supported apartheid. He was completely intolerant towards non-Afrikaners and liberal ideas, utterly determined to maintain white rule, with zero compromise. Known as the "Lion of the North", Strijdom made few changes to his cabinet and pursued with vigour the policy of apartheid. By 1956, he successfully placed the Coloureds on a separate voters' roll, thus further weakening ties with the Commonwealth and gaining support for the NP.

He also took several other steps to make South Africa less dependent on Britain:

* In 1955, the South African parliament became recognised as the highest authority.
* In 1957, following a motion from Arthur Barlow MP, the flag of the Union of South Africa became the country's only flag; the Union Jack, alongside which the Union Flag had flown since 1928, was flown no longer, to be hoisted only on special occasions.
* Likewise, "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" (The Call of South Africa) became South Africa's only national anthem and was also translated into English to appease the relevant population. [[God Save the Queen]] would only be sung on occasions relating to the UK or the Commonwealth.
* In 1957, the maritime base in Simonstown was reassigned from the command of the British Royal Navy to that of the South African government. The British had occupied Simonstown since 1806.
* In 1958, "OHMS" was replaced by "Official" on all official documents.
* C. R. Swart, another staunch Afrikaner republican, became the new Governor-General.

Anti-republican South Africans recognised the shift and distancing from Britain, and the UP grew increasingly anxious, doing all that it could to persuade Parliament to retain Commonwealth links. Strijdom, however, declared that South Africa's participation (or otherwise) in the Commonwealth would be determined only by its best interests.

===Hendrik Verwoerd===
{{main|Hendrik Verwoerd}}
The question of apartheid dominated the 1958 election and the NP took 55% of the vote, thus winning a clear majority for the first time. When Strijdom died that same year, there was a tripartite succession contest between Swart, Dönges and Verwoerd. The latter, devoted to the cause of a republican South Africa, was the new Prime Minister. Verwoerd, a former Minister of Native Affairs, played a leading role in the institution of the apartheid system. Under his leadership, the NP solidified its control over South African apartheid-era politics.

To gain support of the English-identified population of South Africa, Verwoerd appointed several English-speakers to his cabinet. He also cited the radical political movements elsewhere in the African continent as vindication of his belief that black and white nationalism could not work within the same system. Verwoerd also presented the NP as the party best equipped to deal with the widely perceived threat of communism.

By the end of his term (caused by his assassination), Verwoerd had solidified the NP's domination of South African politics. In the 1966 elections the party won 126 out of the 170 seats in Parliament.

By 1960, however, much of the South African electorate were calling for withdrawal from the Commonwealth and the establishment of South Africa as a republic. It was decided that a [[South African referendum, 1960|republican referendum]] was to be held in October. International circumstances made the referendum a growing necessity. In the aftermath of the [[World War II]], former British colonies in Africa and Asia were gaining independence and publicising the ills of apartheid. Commonwealth members were determined to isolate South Africa.

There were numerous internal factors that had paved the way for and may be viewed as influences on the result:

* Harold Macmillan's "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change]]" speech, in which he declared that independence for Black Africans was an inevitability;
* Many whites were unwilling to give up apartheid and realised that South Africa would have to go for it alone if it was to pursue its racial policies.
* The assertion that economic growth and a relaxation of racial tensions could be achieved only through a republic;
* The [[Sharpeville Massacre]];
* The attempted assassination of Verwoerd; and, most importantly,
* The 1960 census, which revealed that there were more Afrikaners in the country than English, thus almost guaranteeing the NP victory in a republican referendum.

The opposition accused Verwoerd of trying to break from the Commonwealth and the west, thus losing South Africa all of its trade preferences. The NP, however, launched a vigorously enthusiastic political campaign, with widely advertised public meetings. The opposition found it very difficult to fight for the preservation of British links.

There were numerous pro-republican arguments:

* It would link more closely the two European language groups.
* It would eliminate confusion about South Africa's constitutional position.
* The monarchy was essentially a British one, with no roots in South Africa.
* South Africans desired a home-grown Head of State.
* The Queen of South Africa, living abroad, inherited her title as the United Kingdom's monarch without the assistance or approval of South Africa.
* In a republic, the Head of State would not be another country's ruler but rather the elected representative of the nation, a unifying symbol.
* A republic symbolised a sovereign-free and independent state.
* South Africa would be able to approach its internal problems more realistically, since they would be strictly "South African" problems to be solved by South Africans rather than foreign intervention.
* It would clear the misconception amongst many blacks in South Africa that foreigners had the final say in their affairs.

There were also, of course, numerous arguments {{em|against}} the establishment of a republic:

* It could lead to a forced withdrawal from the Commonwealth.
* With the entire world in a state of political unrest, bordering on turmoil, it was dangerous to change South Africa's political status.
* It could lead to isolation from allies.
* A republic would solve none of South Africa's problems; it would only make them worse, especially the racial problem, to which the Commonwealth was increasingly opposed.
* The NP had supposedly not given one good reason for the change.
* The ruling party already had twelve years to bring about national unity but had only driven the two white sects further apart.
* A republic could be established by a majority of just one vote. This did not entail unity nor, indeed, democracy.
* Countries did not generally change their form of government unless the present form was inefficient or unstable due to internal strife or hardship. Nothing like this had happened in (white) South Africa, where so many were so content.

On 5 October 1960, 90.5% of the white electorate turned out to vote on the issue. 850,458 (52%) voted in favour of a republic, while 775,878 were against it. The Cape, Orange Free State and Transvaal were all in favour; Natal, a mainly English-speaking province, was not. It was a narrow victory for the republicans. However, a considerable number of Afrikaners did vote against the measure. The few blacks, Indians and Coloureds allowed to vote were decidedly against the measure.

English-speakers who voted for a republic had done so on condition that their cultural heritage be safeguarded. Many had associated a republic with the survival of the white South Africans. Macmillan's speech had illustrated that the British government was no longer prepared to stand by South Africa's racist policies. Nevertheless, the referendum was a significant victory for Afrikaner nationalism as British political and cultural influence waned in South Africa.

However, one question remained after the referendum: would South Africa become a republic outside the Commonwealth (the outcome favoured by the most Afrikaner nationalists)? Withdrawal from the Commonwealth would likely alienate English-speakers and damage relations with many other countries. Former British colonies such as India, Pakistan and Ghana were all republics within the Commonwealth, and Verwoerd announced that his would follow suit "if possible".

In January 1961, Verwoerd's government brought forth legislation to transform the Union of South Africa into the Republic of South Africa. The constitution was finished in April. It merged the authority of the British Crown and Governor-General into a new post, State President. The State President would have rather little political power, serving more as the ceremonial head of state. The political power was to lie with the Prime Minister (head of government). The Republic of South Africa would also have its own monetary system, employing Rands and cents.

In March 1961, Verwoerd visited the Imperial Conference in London to discuss South Africa becoming a republic within the Commonwealth, presenting the [[Republic of South Africa]]'s application for a renewal of its membership to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth had earlier declined to predict how republican status would affect South Africa's membership, it did not want to be seen to be meddling in its members' domestic affairs. However, many of the Conference's affiliates (prominent among them the Afro-Asia group and Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker) attacked South Africa's racial policies and rebuffed Verwoerd's application; they would go to any lengths to expel South Africa from the Commonwealth. In the UK, numerous anti-apartheid movements were also campaigning for South Africa's exclusion. Some member countries warned that, unless South Africa was expelled, they would themselves pull out of the organisation. Verwoerd discarded the censure, arguing that his Commonwealth cohorts had no right to question and criticise the domestic affairs of his country. On this issue, he even had the support of his parliamentary opposition.

Thus, on 15 March 1961, ostensibly to Britain an awkward decision and causing a split within the Commonwealth, but more likely to avoid further condemnation and embarrassment, Verwoerd withdrew his application and announced that South Africa would become a republic outside the Commonwealth. His decision was received with regret by the Prime Ministers of the UK, Australia and New Zealand, but was met with obvious approval from South Africa's critics. Verwoerd issued a statement the next day to the effect that the move would not affect South Africa's relationship with the United Kingdom. On his homecoming, he was met with a rapturous reception. Afrikaner nationalists were not at all deterred by the relinquishment of Commonwealth membership, for they regarded the Commonwealth as little more than the British Empire in disguise. They believed that South Africa and the United Kingdom had absolutely nothing in common, and even UP leader Sir De Villiers Graaff praised Verwoerd for his handling of the situation.

On 31 May 1961, South Africa became a republic. The date was a significant one in Afrikaner history, as it heralded the anniversary of a number of historical events, the 1902 Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the Anglo-Boer War; South Africa's becoming a union in 1910; and the first hoisting of the Union flag in 1928. The Afrikaner republican dream had finally come to reality.

The significance of Commonwealth withdrawal turned out to be less than had been expected. It was not necessary for South Africa to amend its trading preferences, and Prime Minister Macmillan reciprocated Verwoerd's assurance that withdrawal would not alter trade between South Africa and the UK.

South Africa had now its first independent constitution, although the only real constitutional change was that the State President, in charge for seven years, would assume the now-vacant position of the Queen as Head of State. C. R. Swart, the State President elect, took the first republican oath as State President of South Africa before Chief Justice Steyn (DRC).

Although white inhabitants were generally happy with the republic, united in their support of Verwoerd, the blacks defiantly rejected the move. Nelson Mandela and his National Action Council demonstrated from 29 to 31 May 1961. The republican issue would strongly intensify resistance to apartheid.

==Support==
The NP won a majority of parliamentary seats in all elections during the apartheid era. Its popular vote record was more mixed: While it won the popular vote with a comfortable margin in most general elections, the NP carried less than 50% of the electorate in 1948, 1953, 1961, and 1989. In 1977, the NP got its best-ever result in the elections with support of 64.8% of the white voters and 134 seats in parliament out of 165. After this the party's support declined as a proliferation of right wing parties siphoned off important segments of its traditional voter base.

Throughout its reign, the party's support came mainly from [[Afrikaners]], but other white people were courted by and increasingly voted for the NP after 1960. By the 1980s however, in reaction to the "verligte" reforms of P. W. Botha, the majority of Afrikaners drifted to the Conservative Party of [[Andries Treurnicht]], who called for a return to the traditional policies of the NP. In the 1974 general elections for example 91% of Afrikaners voted for the NP, however in the 1989 general elections only 46% of Afrikaners cast their ballot for the National party.

==Division and decline==
Following the assassination of Verwoerd, [[John Vorster]] took over as party leader and prime minister. From the 1960s onwards, the NP and the Afrikaner population in general was increasingly divided over the application of apartheid (the legal opposition being similarly divided over its response), leading to the emergence of the "verkramptes" and "verligtes". They were divided over such issues as immigration, language, racially-mixed sporting teams, and engagement with black African states. In 1969, members of the "verkrampte" faction including [[Albert Hertzog]] and [[Jaap Marais]], formed the [[Herstigte Nasionale Party]], which claimed to be the true upholder of pure Verwoerdian apartheid ideology and continues to exist today. While it never had much electoral success, it attracted sufficient numbers to erode support for the government at crucial points, although not to the extent that the Conservative Party would do. Meanwhile, the verligtes began to gain some traction inside the party in response to growing international opposition to apartheid. Perhaps a precursor to the split came around 1960 when Japie Basson, a moderate, was expelled for disagreements on racial questions and would form his own National Union Party, he would later join the United Party and Progressive Federal Party before rejoining the NP in the 1980s. Former Interior Minister Theo Gerdener formed the [[Democratic Party (South Africa, 1973)|Democratic Party]] in 1973 to attempt its own verligte solution to racial questions.

[[Image:National Party 1981 logo.svg|150px|thumb|Logo of the National Party introduced in 1981]]
Beginning in the early 1980s, under the leadership of [[P. W. Botha|Pieter Willem Botha]], Prime Minister since 1978, the NP began to reform its policies. Botha legalised interracial marriages and multiracial political parties and relaxed the [[Group Areas Act]]. Botha also amended the constitution to grant a measure of political representation to Coloureds and Indians by creating separate parliamentary chambers in which they had control of their "own affairs". The amendments also replaced the parliamentary system with a presidential one. The powers of the Prime Minister were essentially merged with those of the [[State President of South Africa|State President]], which was vested with sweeping executive powers. Although portraying the new system as a power-sharing agreement, Botha ensured that the real power remained in white hands, and in practice, in the hands of the NP. Whites had large majorities in the electoral college, which chose the State President, as well as on the President's Council, which settled disputes between the three chambers and decided which combination of them could consider any piece of legislation. However, Botha and the NP refused to budge on the central issue of granting meaningful political rights to black South Africans, who remained unrepresented even after the reforms. Most black political organisations remained banned, and prominent black leaders, including [[Nelson Mandela]], remained imprisoned.

While Botha's reforms did not even begin to meet the opposition's demands, they sufficiently alarmed a segment of his own party to engender a second split. In 1982, hardline NP members including [[Andries Treurnicht]] and [[Ferdinand Hartzenberg]] formed the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]], committed to reversing Botha's reforms, which by 1987 became the largest parliamentary opposition party. The party later merged into the [[Freedom Front]], which today represents Afrikaner nationalism. On the other hand, some reformist NP members also left the party, such as [[Dennis Worrall]] and [[Wynand Malan]], who formed the [[Independent Party (South Africa)|Independent Party]], which later merged into the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (a similar breakaway group existed for a time in the 1970s). The loss of NP support to both the DP and CP reflected the divisions among white voters over continued maintenance of apartheid.

[[File:Frederik de Klerk with Nelson Mandela - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 1992.jpg|thumb|left|F. W. de Klerk shaking hands with ANC leader Nelson Mandela at the World Economic Forum in 1992]]
In the midst of rising political instability, growing economic problems and diplomatic isolation, Botha resigned as NP leader, and subsequently as State President in 1989. He was replaced by [[F. W. de Klerk]] in this capacity. Although conservative by inclination, De Klerk had become the leader of an "enlightened" NP faction that realised the impracticality of maintaining apartheid forever. He decided that it would be better to negotiate while there was still time to reach a compromise, than to hold out until forced to negotiate on less favourable terms later. He persuaded the NP to enter into negotiations with representatives of the black community. Late in 1989, the NP won the most bitterly contested election in decades, pledging to negotiate an end to the very apartheid system that it had established. On 2 February 1990, the [[African National Congress]] was legalised, and Nelson Mandela was released after twenty-seven years of imprisonment. In the same year, the NP opened its membership to all racial groups and moves began to repeal the racial legislation that had been the foundations of apartheid. A [[1992 South African Referendum|referendum]] in 1992 gave De Klerk [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiary powers]] to negotiate with Mandela. Following the negotiations, a new interim constitution was drawn up, and non-racial democratic elections were held in 1994. These elections were won by the African National Congress. The NP remained in government, however, as a coalition partner to the ANC in the [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]] until 30 June 1996, when it withdrew to become the official opposition.

===Post-apartheid era===
The NP won 20.39% of the vote and 82 seats in the National Assembly in the first democratic elections in 1994. This support extended well beyond the white community and into other minority groups. For instance, two-thirds of [[Indian South Africans]] voted for the NP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The legacy of Indian migration to European colonies|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21727896-century-after-india-ended-system-indentured-labour-its-diaspora-building|accessdate=2 September 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the official opposition in most provinces and also won a majority in the Western Cape, winning much of the White and Coloured vote. Its Coloured support also earned it a strong second place in the Northern Cape. The party was wracked by internal wranglings whilst it participated in the Government of National Unity, and finally withdrew from the government to become the official opposition in 1996. Despite this, it remained uncertain about its future direction, and was continually outperformed in parliament by the much smaller [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), which provided a more forceful and principled opposition stance. In 1997, its voter base began to gradually shift to the DP. The NP renamed itself the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] towards the end of 1997, to distance itself from its past. 

However, the NNP would quickly disappear from the political scene, faring poorly in both the 1999 and 2004 elections. Going back and forth on whether to oppose or work with the ANC, the two finally formed an alliance in late 2001. After years of losing members and support to other parties, the NNP's collapse in its previous stronghold in the Western Cape in the 2004 election proved to be the final straw; its federal council voted to dissolve the party on 9 April 2005, following a decision the previous year to merge with the ANC.

==Re-establishment==
{{main|National Party South Africa}}
On 5 August 2008 a new party using the name of "National Party South Africa" was formed and registered with the [[Independent Electoral Commission (South Africa)|Independent Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref name=NP-ReturnOfTheNats&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Nats|url=http://www.nationalparty.co.za/0003.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201191607/http://www.nationalparty.co.za/0003.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 December 2008|work=National Party Press Releases|accessdate=25 April 2011|quote=The National Party (NP) regrouped and reregistered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) as a political party on all levels of government.

Smith is an outwardly diligent and skillful worker, but he secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother. Smith rebels by entering a forbidden relationship with fellow employee [[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]].

As literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is a classic novel in content, plot, and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[doublethink]]'', ''[[thoughtcrime]]'', ''[[Newspeak]]'', ''[[Room 101]]'', ''[[telescreen]]'', ''[[2 + 2 = 5]]'', and ''[[memory hole]]'', have entered into common usage since its publication in 1949. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' popularised the adjective ''[[Orwellian]]'', which connotes official deception, secret surveillance, brazenly misleading terminology and manipulation of recorded history by a [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] state. In 2005, the novel was chosen by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[[Lev Grossman|Grossman, Lev]]; Lacayo, Richard (6 October 2005).

==History and title==
[[File:Nineteen Eighty-Four manuscript.jpg|thumb|A 1947 draft manuscript of the first page of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', showing the editorial development.]]

Orwell "encapsulate[d] the thesis at the heart of his unforgiving novel" in 1944, the implications of dividing the world up into zones of influence, which had been conjured by the [[Tehran Conference]]. Three years later, he wrote most of it on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] from 1947 to 1948 despite being seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Roger Senhouse, 26 December 1948, reprinted in ''Collected Works:It Is What I Think, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, Chapter 18. "thesis": pp. 368–69&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December 1948, he sent the final manuscript to the publisher [[Secker and Warburg]], and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was published on 8 June 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowker|2003|pp=383, 399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984.htm|title=Charles' George Orwell Links|publisher=Netcharles.com|accessdate=4 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093026/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984.htm|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, it had been translated into 65 languages, more than any other novel in English until then.&lt;ref name=translations&gt;John Rodden. ''The Politics of Literary Reputation: The Making and Claiming of "St. George" Orwell''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the novel, its themes, the ''[[Newspeak]]'' language and the author's surname are often invoked against control and intrusion by the state, and the adjective ''[[wikt:Orwellian|Orwellian]]'' describes a totalitarian dystopia that is characterised by government control and subjugation of the people.

Orwell's invented language, Newspeak, satirises hypocrisy and evasion by the state: the [[Ministry of Love]] (Miniluv) oversees torture and brainwashing, the [[Ministry of Plenty]] (Miniplenty) oversees shortage and rationing, the [[Ministry of Peace]] (Minipax) oversees war and atrocity and the [[Ministry of Truth]] (Minitrue) oversees propaganda and historical revisionism.

''The Last Man in Europe'' was an early title for the novel, but in a letter dated 22 October 1948 to his publisher [[Fredric Warburg]], eight months before publication, Orwell wrote about hesitating between that title and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref&gt;CEJL, iv, no. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Warburg suggested choosing the main title to be the latter, a more commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Bernard. Introduction to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1978 novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', English author [[Anthony Burgess]] suggests that Orwell, disillusioned by the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945–91), intended to call the book ''1948''. The introduction to the [[Penguin Books]] Modern Classics edition of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' reports that Orwell originally set the novel in 1980 but that he later shifted the date to 1982 and then to 1984. The introduction to the [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] edition of ''Animal Farm and 1984'' (2003) reports that the title ''1984'' was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed, and that the date was meant to give an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;Introduction to ''Animal Farm and 1984'' by Christopher Hitchens, {{ISBN|978-0-15-101026-4}}; p. x (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its publication history, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' has been either banned or legally [[challenge (literature)|challenged]], as subversive or ideologically corrupting, like the [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novels ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' (1924) by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) by [[Aldous Huxley]], ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' (1940) by [[Arthur Koestler]], ''[[Kallocain]]'' (1940) by [[Karin Boye]] and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953) by [[Ray Bradbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marcus |first1=Laura |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |year=2005 |title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century English Literature |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-82077-4 |page=226 |quote=Brave New World [is] traditionally bracketed with Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' as a dystopia&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers consider the Russian dystopian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by Zamyatin to have influenced ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/freedom-and-happiness-review-of-we-by-yevgeny-zamyatin "Freedom and Happiness"] (a review of ''We'' by Yevgeny Zamyatin) by Orwell, ''The Express Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/08/george-orwell-1984-zamyatin-we "1984 thoughtcrime?

==Background==
[[File:Ingsoc logo from 1984.svg|thumb|The banner of the Party in the 1984 film adaptation of the book. Party flags are mentioned, but never described in the actual novel.]]

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.

Smith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] became involved in a war fought in [[Europe]], [[European Russia|western Russia]], and [[North America]] during the early 1950s. [[Nuclear weapons]] were used during the war, leading to the destruction of [[Colchester]]. [[London]] would also suffer widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell to civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] was absorbed by the [[United States]] to become Oceania. Eventually Ingsoc emerged to form a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in the country.

Simultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]]. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] would emerge in the [[Far East]] after several decades of fighting. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in "a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and [[Hong Kong]]" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues in order to maintain ideological control over the people.

However, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of history, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unclear. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, airplanes and trains, while Julia theorizes that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring "confused street fighting in London itself" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls "the Revolution".

Most of the plot takes place in London, the "chief city of [[Airstrip One]]", the Oceanic province that "had once been called England or Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Part I, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while the ubiquitous ''telescreen'' ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitors the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.

The class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:
* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.
* (II) the middle-class [[Outer Party]], who make up 13% of the population.
* (III) the lower-class [[Proles|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the uneducated working class.
As the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries:
* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defense.
* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (rationing and starvation).
* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).
* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).

The protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising historical records]], to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'', people who have been "vaporised", i.e., not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory.

The story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen." Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.&lt;ref&gt;"striking thirteen" (1:00&amp;nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the year 1984, civilization has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly [[United Kingdom|Britain]]) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the "Party" under the ideology of "[[Ingsoc]]" and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).

Winston Smith is a member of the middle class [[Outer Party]]. He works at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become "unpersons", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a "[[memory hole]]". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion. He realizes that he is already a "[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]" and likely to be caught one day.

While in a proletarian neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother. In the journal, he records his sexual frustration over a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry named [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], whom Winston is attracted to but suspects is an informant. He also suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a secret agent for an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]].

The next day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note confessing her love for him, which simply reads, ''"I love you."'' Winston and Julia begin a torrid affair, an act of the rebellion as the Party insists that sex may only be used for reproduction. Winston realizes that she shares his loathing of the Party. They first meet in the country, and later in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his ex-wife Katharine. Winston also interacts with his colleague Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the [[English language]] called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme admits that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston speculates that Syme will disappear. Not long after, Syme disappears and no one acknowledges his absence.

Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who offers Winston a chance to join the Brotherhood. They arrange a meeting at O'Brien's luxurious flat where both Winston and Julia swear allegiance to the Brotherhood. He sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if "proles" (proletarians) rise up against it.

Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are captured in the shop and imprisoned in the [[Ministry of Love]]. O'Brien reveals that he is actually loyal to the Party, and was simply part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch "thoughtcriminals". Over many months, Winston is tortured and forced to "cure" himself of his "insanity" by changing his own perception to fit the Party line, even if it requires believing that "[[2 + 2 = 5]]". O'Brien openly admits that the Party "is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power." He says that once Winston is brainwashed into loyalty, he will be released back into society for a period of time, before they execute him. O'Brien states that Winston and others who do not love the party will be shot in the back of the head after being released.  Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia.

O'Brien then takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear, in Winston's case rats. As a wire cage holding hungry rats is fitted onto his face, Winston shouts "Do it to Julia!", thus betraying her. After being released, Winston meets Julia in a park. She says that she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. Winston realizes that he and Julia no longer feel for one another and that the Party has even managed to take away their love. Later, Winston sits alone in a café as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasian]] armies in Africa, and, successfully brainwashed, realizes that "He loved Big Brother."

==Characters==
===Main characters===
[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]
* [[Winston Smith]]&amp;nbsp;– the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.
*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&amp;nbsp;– Winston's lover who is a covert "[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.
* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&amp;nbsp;– a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, in order to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.

===Secondary characters===
* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&amp;nbsp;– former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.
* Ampleforth&amp;nbsp;– Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word "God" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for "rod";{{refn|This may be a reference to "[[McAndrew's Hymn]]", which includes the lines "From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God— / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs In on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.
* Charrington&amp;nbsp;– an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.
* Katharine Smith&amp;nbsp;– the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston "can't get rid of". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their "duty to the Party". Although she was a "goodthinkful" ideologue, they separated because she could not have children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be "got rid of" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.
* Tom Parsons&amp;nbsp;– Winston's naïve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, hearing him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do "good work" in the hard labour camps.
* Mrs. Parsons&amp;nbsp;– Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.
** The Parsons children&amp;nbsp;– members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.
* Syme&amp;nbsp;– Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that "He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly." Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.

===Unseen characters===
Whether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:
* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&amp;nbsp;– the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.
* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&amp;nbsp;– ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]—the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.

==World in novel==
===Ingsoc===
{{Main article|Ingsoc}}
Ingsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents.

===Ministries of Oceania===
{{Main article|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}
In London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the façades of which display the Party's three slogans. The ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: "The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation." (Part II, Chapter IX&amp;nbsp;– ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')

====Ministry of Peace====
The [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ministry of Plenty====
The [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability, and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current, "increased rations".

====Ministry of Truth====
The [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), "rectifying" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.

====Ministry of Love====
The [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests, and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face "the worst thing in the world"—until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.

===Doublethink===
{{Main article|Doublethink}}
{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&amp;nbsp;– ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}

===Political geography===
{{Main article|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}
[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]
Three perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:&lt;ref name="Part II, Ch. 9"&gt;Part II, Ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. [[English Socialism]]), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and [[Southern Africa]]
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and [[Russia]], including [[Siberia]]
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]

The perpetual war is fought for control of the "disputed area" lying "between the frontiers of the super-states", which forms "a rough parallelogram with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Hong Kong]]",&lt;ref name="Part II, Ch. 9"/&gt; and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.

Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that the superstates' ideologies are alike and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing in the detestability of the opposing ideologies. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in "the war".

===The Revolution===
{{Main article|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}
Winston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after "a decade of confused fighting". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.

The annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.

While the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganization occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack "thirty years" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the "fourth quarter of 1983" was "also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.

===The War===
{{See also|Perpetual war}}
In 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].

That alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from "Eurasia" to "Eastasia" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured Africa.

Goldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).

===Living standards===
The society of Airstrip One and, according to "The Book", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality "luxuries" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the "Victory" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made "Victory" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[War of the Atlantic]].)

Winston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.

In contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and "The Book" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, "The Book" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only "relatively" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary élite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. "The Book" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or "reintegration" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that "the future belonged to the proles".&lt;ref&gt;Lines 29–35, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: "The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill".&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and "The Book" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Nationalism===
''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay "[[Notes on Nationalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: "Notes on Nationalism"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces. In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the Party's artificial, minimalist language 'Newspeak' addresses the matter.
* Positive nationalism: Oceanians' perpetual love for Big Brother; Neo-Toryism and [[Celtic nationalism]] are, as Orwell argues, defined by love.
* Negative nationalism: Oceanians' perpetual hatred for Emmanuel Goldstein; [[Stalinism]] and  [[Anglophobia]] are, as Orwell argues, defined by hatred.
* Transferred nationalism: Oceania's enemy changes, and an orator changes mid-sentence. The crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.

O'Brien concludes: "The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power."

===Futurology===
In the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.|Part III, Chapter III, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''}}

===Censorship===
[[File:Nineteen Eighty-Four cover by Penguin.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 21st-century printing by [[Penguin Books]] with an intentionally censored cover]]
A major theme of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is censorship, especially in the Ministry of Truth, where photographs are modified and public archives rewritten to rid them of "unpersons" (persons who are erased from history by the Party). On the telescreens, figures for all types of production are grossly exaggerated or simply invented to indicate an ever-growing economy, when the reality is the opposite. One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about Comrade Ogilvy, a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.

===Surveillance===
The inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.

==Newspeak appendix==
{{Main article|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}
"The Principles of Newspeak" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making "all other modes of thought impossible". (A linguistic theory about how language may direct thought is the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].)

Whether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: "Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised" p.&amp;nbsp;422). Some critics (Atwood,&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Atwood]]: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/16/georgeorwell.artsfeatures "Orwell and me"]. ''The Guardian'' 16 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Benstead,&lt;ref&gt;Benstead, James (26 June 2005).

==Sources for literary motifs==
''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' uses themes from life in the Soviet Union and wartime life in Great Britain as sources for many of its motifs. Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement "[[2 + 2 = 5]]", used to torment Winston Smith during his interrogation, was a communist party slogan from the second [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]], which encouraged fulfillment of the five-year plan in four years. The slogan was seen in electric lights on Moscow house-fronts, billboards and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The Forsaken"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia | publisher=Penguin Press | last=Tzouliadis |first=Tim | year=2008 | location=New York | isbn=978-1-59420-168-4 | pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The switch of Oceania's allegiance from Eastasia to Eurasia and the subsequent rewriting of history ("Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped—including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] for supporting the Treaty in his essays for ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' (1941). "The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveller]]s like [[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz]] [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction [[Popular Front]] governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Matt.

The description of Emmanuel Goldstein, with a "small, goatee beard", evokes the image of [[Leon Trotsky]]. The film of Goldstein during the Two Minutes Hate is described as showing him being transformed into a bleating sheep. This image was used in a propaganda film during the [[Kinoks|Kino-eye]] period of Soviet film, which showed Trotsky transforming into a goat.&lt;ref name="Kino-eye"&gt;{{cite book | title=Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov | publisher=University of California Press | last=Vertov |first=Dziga | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-520-05630-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein's book is similar to Trotsky's highly critical analysis of the USSR, ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'', published in 1936.

The omnipresent images of Big Brother, a man described as having a moustache, bears resemblance to the cult of personality built up around [[Joseph Stalin]].

The news in Oceania emphasised production figures, just as it did in the Soviet Union, where record-setting in factories (by "[[Hero of Socialist Labour|Heroes of Socialist Labor]]") was especially glorified. The best known of these was [[Alexey Stakhanov]], who purportedly set a record for coal mining in 1935.

The tortures of the Ministry of Love evoke the procedures used by the [[NKVD]] in their interrogations,&lt;ref name="NKVD tortures"&gt;{{cite book | last=Senyonovna |first=Eugenia | title=Journey into the Whirlwind | year=1967 | publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of rubber truncheons, being forbidden to put your hands in your pockets, remaining in brightly lit rooms for days, torture through the use of their greatest fear, and the victim being shown a mirror after their physical collapse.

The random bombing of Airstrip One is based on the [[V-1 flying bomb|Buzz bombs]] and the [[V-2 rocket]], which struck England at random in 1944–1945.

The [[Thought Police]] is based on the [[NKVD]], which arrested people for random "anti-soviet" remarks.&lt;ref name="Everyday_Stalinism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Sheila |title=Everyday Stalinism |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thought Crime motif is drawn from [[Kempeitai]], the Japanese wartime secret police, who arrested people for "unpatriotic" thoughts.

The confessions of the "Thought Criminals" Rutherford, Aaronson and Jones are based on the [[show trial]]s of the 1930s, which included fabricated confessions by prominent Bolsheviks [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] to the effect that they were being paid by the Nazi government to undermine the Soviet regime under [[Leon Trotsky]]'s direction.

The song "[[Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree]]" ("Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me") was based on an old English song called "Go no more a-rushing" ("Under the spreading chestnut tree, Where I knelt upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree."). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing "chest", and touching your head when you sing "nut"). [[Glenn Miller]] recorded the song in 1939.&lt;ref name="go-no-more--a-rushing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiGONORUSH;ttGONORUSH.html |title=Go No More a-Rushing (Riddle Song) |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hates" (Two Minutes Hate and Hate Week) were inspired by the constant rallies sponsored by party organs throughout the Stalinist period. These were often short pep-talks given to workers before their shifts began (Two Minutes Hate), but could also last for days, as in the annual celebrations of the anniversary of the [[October revolution]] (Hate Week).

Orwell fictionalized "newspeak", "doublethink", and "Ministry of Truth" as evinced by both the Soviet press and that of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUl3Od-xWn8C&amp;pg=PA9|title=Thank you, comrade Stalin!

Winston Smith's job, "revising history" (and the "unperson" motif) are based on the Stalinist habit of airbrushing images of 'fallen' people from group photographs and removing references to them in books and newspapers.&lt;ref name="commisar_vanishes"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=David |title=The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan / Holt |year=1997 |isbn=0-8050-5294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one well-known example, the Soviet encyclopaedia had an article about [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

Big Brother's "Orders of the Day" were inspired by Stalin's regular wartime orders, called by the same name. A small collection of the more political of these have been published (together with his wartime speeches) in English as "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union" By Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref name="on_the_patriotic_war"&gt;{{cite book | title=On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union | publisher=Foreign Languages Press |last=Stalin |first=Joseph | year=1944 | location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sample_Order_of_the_day"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1942/05/01.htm | title=Order of the Day, No. 130, May 1st, 1942 | accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Big Brother's Orders of the day, Stalin's frequently lauded heroic individuals,&lt;ref name="Beijing_edition"&gt;{{cite book | title=On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union | publisher=Foreign Language Press&amp;nbsp;– Peking | last=Stalin |first=Joseph | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Comrade Ogilvy, the fictitious hero Winston Smith invented to 'rectify' (fabricate) a Big Brother Order of the day.

The Ingsoc slogan "Our new, happy life", repeated from telescreens, evokes Stalin's 1935 statement, which became a [[CPSU]] slogan, "Life has become better, Comrades; life has become more cheerful."&lt;ref name="Everyday_Stalinism"/&gt;

In 1940 Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] published [[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]] which described the invention by a "benevolent secret society" of a world that would seek to remake human language and reality along human-invented lines. The story concludes with an appendix describing the success of the project. Borges' story addresses similar themes of [[epistemology]], language and history to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHnFubqgiyoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206|title=Twentieth-century Spanish American Literature to 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
During [[World War II]], Orwell believed that [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British democracy]] as it existed before 1939 would not survive the war. The question being "Would it end via Fascist ''coup d'état'' from above or via Socialist revolution from below"?{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Later, he admitted that events proved him wrong: "What really matters is that I fell into the trap of assuming that 'the war and the revolution are inseparable'."&lt;ref&gt;"London Letter to Partisan Review, December 1944, quoted from vol. 3 of the Penguin edition of the ''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) share themes of the betrayed revolution, the person's subordination to the collective, rigorously enforced class distinctions (Inner Party, Outer Party, Proles), the [[cult of personality]], [[concentration camp]]s, [[Thought Police]], compulsory regimented daily exercise, and youth leagues. [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] resulted from the US annexation of the British Empire to counter the Asian peril to Australia and New Zealand. It is a naval power whose militarism venerates the sailors of the floating fortresses, from which battle is given to recapturing India, the "Jewel in the Crown" of the British Empire. Much of Oceanic society is based upon the USSR under [[Joseph Stalin]]—[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. The televised [[Two Minutes Hate]] is ritual demonisation of the [[enemy of the state|enemies of the State]], especially [[Emmanuel Goldstein]] (''viz'' [[Leon Trotsky]]). Altered photographs and newspaper articles create [[unperson]]s deleted from the national historical record, including even founding members of the regime (Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford) in the 1960s purges (''viz'' the [[Great Purges|Soviet Purges]] of the 1930s, in which [[Old Bolshevik|leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution]] were [[Moscow Trials|similarly treated]]). A similar thing also happened during the French Revolution in which many of the original leaders of the Revolution were later put to death, for example [[Georges Danton|Danton]] who was put to death by [[Robespierre]], and then later Robespierre himself met the same fate.

In his 1946 essay "[[Why I Write]]", Orwell explains that the serious works he wrote since the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39) were "written, directly or indirectly, against [[totalitarianism]] and for [[democratic socialism]]".&lt;ref name=aaron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html|title=George Orwell: Why I Write|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is a [[cautionary tale]] about revolution betrayed by totalitarian defenders previously proposed in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945), while ''[[Coming Up for Air]]'' (1939) celebrates the personal and political freedoms lost in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949). Biographer Michael Shelden notes Orwell's [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] childhood at [[Henley-on-Thames]] as the golden country; being bullied at [[St Cyprian's School]] as his empathy with victims; his life in the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma and the techniques of violence and censorship in the [[BBC]] as capricious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelden|first=Michael|year=1991|title=Orwell&amp;nbsp;– The Authorized Biography|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092161-7|pages=430–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influences include ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' (1940) and ''The Yogi and the Commissar'' (1945) by [[Arthur Koestler]]; ''[[The Iron Heel]] ''(1908) by [[Jack London]]; ''1920: Dips into the Near Future''&lt;ref&gt;John A. Hobson, [http://ariwatch.com/VS/1920.htm ''1920: Dips into the Near Future'']&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John A. Hobson]]; ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) by [[Aldous Huxley]]; ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' (1921) by Yevgeny Zamyatin which he reviewed in 1946;&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, [http://www.orwelltoday.com/weorwellreview.shtml "Review"], ''Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;br /&gt; paraphrasing [[Rayner Heppenstall]], he reportedly said "that he was taking it as the model for his next novel". Bowker, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Managerial Revolution'' (1940) by [[James Burnham]] predicting perpetual war among three totalitarian superstates. Orwell told [[Jacintha Buddicom]] that he would write a novel stylistically like ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905) by [[H. G. Wells]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Extrapolating from World War II, the novel's [[pastiche]] parallels the politics and rhetoric at war's end—the changed alliances at the "[[Cold War]]'s" (1945–91) beginning; the [[Ministry of Truth]] derives from the BBC's overseas service, controlled by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]; [[Room 101]] derives from a conference room at BBC [[Broadcasting House]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The real room 101|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105132434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml|archivedate=5 January 2007|accessdate=9 December 2006}}&lt;br /&gt;[[#References|Meyers (2000)]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] of the University of London, containing the Ministry of Information is the architectural inspiration for the Minitrue; the post-war decrepitude derives from the socio-political life of the UK and the US, i.e., the impoverished Britain of 1948 losing its Empire despite newspaper-reported imperial triumph; and war ally but peace-time foe, Soviet Russia became [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]].

The term "English Socialism" has precedents in his wartime writings; in the essay "[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]" (1941), he said that "the war and the revolution are inseparable...&amp;nbsp;the fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy"&amp;nbsp;– because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeat [[Adolf Hitler]]. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which "will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word."&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds). ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Volume 2: "My Country Right or Left" (1940–43; Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', "English Socialism"&amp;nbsp;(or "[[Ingsoc]]" in [[Newspeak]]) is a [[totalitarian]] ideology unlike the English revolution he foresaw. Comparison of the wartime essay "The Lion and the Unicorn" with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' shows that he perceived a Big Brother regime as a perversion of his cherished socialist ideals and English Socialism. Thus Oceania is a corruption of the British Empire he believed would evolve "into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orwell |first=George |authorlink=George Orwell |editor1-last=Orwell |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Angus |editor2-first=Ian |title=George Orwell: the Collected Essays, Journalism &amp; Letters |year=2000 |publisher=Nonpareil Books |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-56792-134-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEgxAJr1REUC&amp;lpg=PA91 |edition=1st Nonpareil |page=91 |quote=The third was to develop a ''positive'' imperial policy, and aim at transforming the Empire into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2013}}

==Critical reception==
When it was first published, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' received critical acclaim. [[V. S. Pritchett]], reviewing the novel for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' stated: "I do not think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down."&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Howe]],  ''Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four : Text, Sources, Criticism''. New York : Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982. {{ISBN|0-15-565811-5}} pp.&amp;nbsp;290–93.&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. H. Newby]], reviewing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' magazine, described it as "the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman since [[Rex Warner]]'s ''The Aerodrome.''"&lt;ref name="nf"&gt;"First Bites: ''Nineteen Eighty-Four.'' Nigel Fountain, ''The Guardian'', June 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was also praised by [[Bertrand Russell]], [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Harold Nicolson]].&lt;ref name="nf" /&gt; On the other hand, [[Edward Shanks]], reviewing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', was dismissive; Shanks claimed ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' "breaks all records for gloomy vaticination".&lt;ref name="nf" /&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was "odious rather than tragic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Clive Staples|title=''On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature.''

The effect of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' on the English language is extensive; the concepts of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)#Response to Big Brother today|Big Brother]], [[Room 101]], the [[Thought Police]], [[thoughtcrime]], [[unperson]], [[memory hole]] (oblivion), [[doublethink]] (simultaneously holding and believing contradictory beliefs) and [[Newspeak]] (ideological language) have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority. [[Doublespeak]] and [[groupthink]] are both deliberate elaborations of ''doublethink'', and the adjective "Orwellian" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. The practice of ending words with {{nowrap|"-speak"}} (such as ''mediaspeak'') is drawn from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keyes |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Keyes (author) |title=I Love It When You Talk Retro |year=2009 |publisher=St Martins |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, [[11020 Orwell|an asteroid]] was discovered by [[Antonín Mrkos]] and named after Orwell.

==''Brave New World'' comparisons==

However, members of the ruling class of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' use brutal force, torture and [[mind control]] to keep individuals in line, while rulers in ''Brave New World'' keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions.

In October 1949, after reading ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', Huxley sent a letter to Orwell and wrote that it would be more efficient for rulers to stay in power by the softer touch by allowing citizens to self-seek pleasure to control them rather than brute force and to allow a false sense of freedom:

{{quote|
Within the next generation I believe that the world's rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/1984-v-brave-new-world.html Letter from Aldous Huxley to George Orwell].

Elements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictators in ex-communist countries, as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's own ''Brave New World Revisited''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/ Aldous Huxley;s ''Brave New World Revisited'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/books/review/which-dystopian-novel-got-it-right-orwells-1984-or-huxleys-brave-new-world.html|title=Which Dystopian Novel Got It Right: Orwell’s ‘1984’ or Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’?|date=2017-02-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/orwells-1984-and-trumps-america|title=Orwell’s “1984” and Trump’s America|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway" /&gt;

'''''No Pressure''''' is a 2010 [[short film]] produced by the [[global warming mitigation]] campaign [[10:10]], written by [[Richard Curtis]] and [[Franny Armstrong]], and directed by [[Dougal Wilson]]. Intended for cinema and television advertisements,&lt;ref name="guardian-no-pressure" /&gt; ''No Pressure'' is composed of scenes in which a variety of men, women and children in every-day situations are graphically blown to pieces for failing to be sufficiently enthusiastic about the 10:10 campaign to reduce [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions. The film's makers said that they viewed ''No Pressure'' as "a funny and satirical tongue-in-cheek little film in the over-the-top style of Monty Python or South Park".&lt;ref name="McVeigh_The Observer"&gt;{{Cite news

==Background and production==
The film was made in an attempt to challenge the "no pressure" attitude often displayed both by governments and individuals towards taking real action on climate change. 10:10 highlighted the urgency of action with claims that carbon dioxide emissions must be stabilised by 2014 (within four years) in order to avoid disaster,&lt;ref name = EITB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/news/detail/513293/controversial-climate-change-campaign-film-disgusts-make-a-point/ | title = Controversial climate change campaign film disgusts to make a point | first = Olwen | last = Mears | publisher=EITB | date = 1 October 2010 | accessdate = 1 October 2010 | archiveurl=http://www.eitb.com/en/news/detail/513293/controversial-climate-change-campaign-film-disgusts-make-a-point/ | archivedate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "300,000 real people" are already killed by [[climate change]] annually.&lt;ref name="guardian-no-pressure"/&gt; Lizzie Gillet, 10:10 global campaign director, explained: "With climate change becoming increasingly threatening, and decreasingly talked about in the media, we wanted to find a way to bring this critical issue back into the headlines while making people laugh. We were therefore delighted when Richard Curtis agreed to write a short film for the 10:10 campaign".&lt;ref name="McVeigh_The Observer"/&gt;

The film was shot on a location at [[Camden School for Girls]],&lt;ref name="camdennewjournal"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the London [[Borough of Camden]] in North London. According to 10:10, over 50 film professionals and more than 40 actors and extras provided their services at no cost.&lt;ref name="1010-sorry"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The four-minute film consists of a series of short scenes in which groups of people are asked if they are interested in participating in the 10:10 project to reduce [[carbon emissions]]. Those failing to show enthusiasm for the cause are gruesomely blown to pieces.

In the first scene, a bright and chirpy schoolteacher, played by [[Lyndsey Marshal]], tells her class about the 10:10 campaign, and asks what they are doing to reduce their [[carbon footprint]]. She asks which students are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children shrug apathetically. The teacher reassures them that this is "fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice"&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11458726| title=Environmental campaigners axe gory film |date=2 October 2010|accessdate=2 October 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is "no pressure", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children who did not want to participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges.

The second scene shows a group of white-collar workers in an office meeting. The office manager similarly explains the purpose of the 10:10 campaign, and asks who will be participating. While most raise their hands, four raise their hands unconvinced. The manager reassures them that there is "no pressure" to participate, but he is then handed a detonator by an assistant, which he uses to blow up the four workers, splattering appalled co-workers with gore.

The third scene is set on a [[Association football|football]] pitch during team training. The coach, played by [[David Ginola]],&lt;ref name = washpost&gt;{{cite web | url = http://voices.washingtonpost.com/post-carbon/2010/10/reduce_your_carbon_footprint_o.html | title = Reduce your carbon footprint or get ready to explode | first = David | last = Fahrenthold |work=The Washington Post | date = 5 October 2010 | accessdate = 8 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asks the players to explain the 10:10 campaign that the team is participating in. They describe a range of energy-saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach remains unmoved, remarking the campaign would distract him from football. A player tells him that there's "no pressure", produces a detonator and blows him up. Unlike the witnesses depicted in previous scenes, the team is not at all surprised, and casually jogs away to resume training.

A brief interlude with captions explains the campaign, accompanied by music from [[Radiohead]]. In the final scene, the actress [[Gillian Anderson]] is finishing the voice-over for the interlude just seen. The sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her [[carbon footprint]]. Anderson irritably remarks that she thought providing the recording was a sufficient contribution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The sound engineer repeats the film's catchphrase, "no pressure", and detonates Anderson before picking up to leave. The film ends with a shot of Anderson's gory remains sliding down the sound-booth window with the text "Cut your carbon by 10%. No pressure."

==Reception==
Upon its release, ''No Pressure'' provoked an immediate negative reaction in the media, and the resulting controversy became widely referred to as "splattergate" by bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100056810/splattergate-oh-well-we-live-and-learn/ | title = Splattergate: 'Oh well, we live and learn…' | first = James | last = Delingpole |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 3 October 2010| accessdate = 23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman_NYT"&gt;{{Cite news

In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[James Delingpole]] wrote that the film was an "ugly, counterproductive eco-propaganda movie"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100056510/go-green-or-well-kill-your-kids-says-richard-curtis-eco-propaganda-shocker/ | title = 'Go green or we'll kill your kids' says Richard Curtis eco-propaganda shocker | first = James | last = Delingpole |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 1 October 2010 | accessdate = 2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "with ''No Pressure'', the environmental movement has revealed the snarling, wicked, homicidal misanthropy beneath its cloak of gentle, bunny-hugging righteousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100056586/eco-fascism-jumps-the-shark-massive-epic-fail/ | title = Eco-fascism jumps the shark: massive, epic fail! | first = James | last = Delingpole |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 1 October 2010 | accessdate = 2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ConservativeHome]] website described it as "crass, tasteless and unfunny as it gets",&lt;ref name="ConservativeHome"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://conservativehome.blogs.com/centreright/2010/10/no-pressure-but-cut-your-carbon-emissions-or-im-going-to-blow-you-up.html | title=No pressure...but cut your carbon emissions or I'm going to blow you up|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=2 October 2010| author=Robin Simcox| work=[[ConservativeHome]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Melanie Phillips]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' commented on the intended humorous aspect of the film by writing that "The joke was only about blowing dissenters to bits and raining their flesh down on terrified people. Because exterminating human beings is acceptable to greens as a joke. From which we can only assume at best indifference towards and at worst a profound loathing of the human condition".&lt;ref name="Phillips_The Spectator"&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/6336655/hate-actually.thtml| date = 4 October 2010| title = Hate, actually| author=Phillips, Melanie |work=The Spectator |location=UK| accessdate = 4 October 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121145009/http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/6336655/hate-actually.thtml | archivedate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[environmentalist]] and writer [[Bill McKibben]] lamented the film on the Climate Progress website, where he wrote "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, not the least of which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor".&lt;ref name="McKibben"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://climateprogress.org/2010/10/01/bill-mckibben-days-that-suck/ | title=Days that Suck: A response to the "No Pressure" Video|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=2 October 2010| author=Bill McKibben| work=[[Climate Progress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKibben added "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="McKibben"/&gt; McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10.&lt;ref name="US Spectator"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' asked about the film, environmental organisation [[Greenpeace]] spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think you can imagine how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by ''The Daily Caller'' did not comment on the film.&lt;ref name="dailycaller"&gt;{{Cite news

In ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Dominic Lawson]] wrote "As often as 10:10 tried to pull the film off YouTube, their critics re-posted it. This, at least, proves what a cataclysmic misjudgement Curtis had made.

The film generated a huge reaction in the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref name="Vaughan _The Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One comment to ''The Guardian'' read: "To suggest that people who disagree with you deserve to die is incredibly stupid.

''The Guardian'', which was a key collaborator with the 10:10 campaign since its launch and got exclusive rights to show the film première, responded to the criticism by stating that "the film may have been somewhat tasteless, but it was an imaginative attempt to challenge public apathy over climate change".&lt;ref name="McVeigh_The Observer"/&gt; This statement originally ended "and, highly unusually for attempts to communicate about this subject, funny too", but this was later redacted.&lt;ref name = "redacted statement"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.350resources.org.uk/2010/10/03/backlash-over-richard-curtis’s-1010-climate-film/ | title = Backlash over Richard Curtis's 10:10 climate film | publisher=Resources for a sustainable future| date = 3 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later report in the newspaper by Adam Vaughan said that the film, "intended as a tongue-in-cheek spoof of hectoring greens", had created a huge amount of global coverage for 10:10, in print and on the web. The report said that while many people had found the film hilarious, there was a "predictable slating from climate sceptics" as well as furious reactions from some environmentalists. The report also went on to describe other, more reflective responses, which had focused on effective communication, psychology, satire, and ways of engaging with various audiences over climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|title=No Pressure: the fall-out from Richard Curtis's explosive climate film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/oct/04/10-10-activism|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawal==
Although originally planned to be shown in cinema and television advertisements, 10:10 removed the film from their website and YouTube later on 1 October 2010.&lt;ref name=" Singh  The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" The Daily Mail"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday 2 October, 10:10 placed a notice on their website saying, "Many people found the resulting film extremely funny, but unfortunately some didn't and we sincerely apologise to anybody we have offended.

ActionAid, a charity which co-ordinates a schools programme with 10:10, approved the decision to withdraw the film, and stated "Our job is to encourage proactive decisions at class level to reduce carbon emissions. We did it because evidence shows children are deeply concerned about climate change and because we see the impacts of it in the developing world where a lot of our work is. So we think the 10:10 campaign is very important, but the moment this film was seen it was clear it was inappropriate."&lt;ref name="McVeigh_The Observer"/&gt;

In the wake of the film's withdrawal, Richard Curtis admitted that the attempt to draw attention to the cause of lowering {{chem|CO|2}} emissions may have backfired. Curtis said "When you try to be funny on a serious subject, it's obviously risky. I hope people who don't like the little film will still think about the big issue and try to do something about it."&lt;ref name="Milmo_Independent"&gt;{{Cite news

===Withdrawal of sponsors===

Several sponsors withdrew their support of 10:10 as a result of the ''No Pressure'' film. Nick Sharples, [[Sony]] Europe's Director of Communications, issued a statement saying, "we strongly condemn the ''No Pressure'' video which was conceived, produced and released by 10:10 entirely without the knowledge or involvement of Sony", and cutting ties with 10:10: "As a result we have taken the decision to disassociate ourselves from 10:10 at this time".&lt;ref name=NYTsony&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/climate-group-regrets-shock-film-tactic/ | title = Climate Group Regrets Shock Film Tactic (so does Sony) | first = Andrew | last = Revkin |work=New York Times | date = 4 October 2010 | accessdate = 5 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kyocera]]&lt;ref name="US Spectator"/&gt; and [[Eaga]] were removed from the list of 10:10 sponsors, and [[Nat Mags|National Magazine Company]] was removed from the list of 10:10 media partners.&lt;ref name="list of parters"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1010global.org/uk/partners| title=Partners The organisations supporting 10:10

[[350.org]], with whom 10:10 had been collaborating on the 10 October 2010 day of action, broke all current and future relations with 10:10. In a press release, they said: "We respect 10:10's previous work to encourage companies, schools, and churches to voluntarily cut their carbon emissions 10%. Upon seeing the video, however, we have informed 10:10 that we can no longer remain partners on 10 October 2010 or any other initiative. 350.org maintains an absolute commitment to nonviolence in word and deed".&lt;ref name="US Spectator"/&gt;

Founded in 2012 at the Second [[International Intersex Forum]], '''Organisation Intersex International - Europe''' or '''OII Europe''' is the first European intersex [[NGO]], and it brings together national and linguistic affiliates from around the European continent.&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/start/ | title = First ever European Intersex NGO founded.

== Mission ==

The organisation aims to end "mutilating and 'normalising' practices such as genital surgeries" and selective abortion on grounds of intersex, and promote the human rights and full citizenship of intersex people. It aims to engage with state and non-governmental actors.&lt;ref name="start" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tg-eu" /&gt;

The '''Preservation of Coloured Areas Act''' of 1961 was an Apartheid South Africa piece of legislation, which was osstensibly enacted to prevent land in coloured areas from being taken without compensation to the owner even if the owner had not registered his claim. It further entrenched "Coloured Areas" in the law.

This Act further strengthened racial segration legislation of South Africa during the [[Apartheid]] regime.

==Key Effect of Legislation==
The Preservation of Coloured Areas Act had the effect of causing mortgaged land to be seized with compensation then paid to a white "Guardian" in place of the coloured owner.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Repeal==
The act was repealed by the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991]] on 30 June 1991.

The '''Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act, Act No 52 of 1951''', formed part of the [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation in [[South Africa]]. This act authorized the forcible removal of [[Shanty town|squatting communities]]. It allowed eviction and destruction of homes of [[squatters]] by landowners, local authorities, and government officials. It was commenced on 6 July 1951.&lt;ref name= "sahist"&gt;{{Cite web

{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}
The following is a list of [[public relations]], [[propaganda]], and [[marketing]] campaigns orchestrated by [[Edward Bernays]] (22 November 1891 – 9 March 1995).

Bernays is regarded as the pioneer of public relations. His influence radically changed the persuasion tactics used in [[campaign advertising]] and [[political campaign]]s.

Bernays was the nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]]. His early adoption of Freud's [[psychoanalytic]] theory was instrumental in defining the goals and strategies of public relations. Freud theorized that people are motivated by [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] desires. To develop public relations, Bernays synthesized elements of Freud's work with [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s researches into [[crowd psychology]], and [[Wilfred Trotter]]'s theories of [[herd instinct]].

==Cigarettes==
In the 1920s, it was considered taboo for women to smoke in public. George W. Hill, president of the American Tobacco Company, realized that his company was missing a share of the market. He hired Bernays to change the taboo and persuade women to start smoking. Bernays contacted psychoanalyst Abraham Brill to understand the societal perceptions that discouraged women from smoking. Brill told him that for feminists, cigarettes were like "torches of freedom" that symbolized their nonconformity and freedom from male oppression. 

Bernays used this information to build a strategy. He contacted a female friend and asked her to find a group of women to march in the New York City Easter Day parade. He asked her to tell the press that a group of [[women's rights]] marchers would light "[[Torches of Freedom]]". The women lit Lucky Strike cigarettes in front of the eager photographers. The New York Times (1 April 1929) printed: "Group of Girls Puff at Cigarettes as a Gesture of 'Freedom'".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bender. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/bender2.html  Karl Rove &amp; the Spectre of Freud’s Nephew], [[LewRockwell.com]], 4 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, he attempted to convince women that Lucky Strike cigarettes' forest green pack was the most fashionable color.  Letters were written to interior and fashion designers, department stores, and prominent women of society pushing green as the new hot color for the season. Balls, gallery exhibitions, and window displays all featured green after Bernays got through with them. The result was that green did indeed become a very popular color for the 1934 season and Lucky Strike kept their pack color and female clientele intact.

After his semi-retirement in the 1960s, he worked with the pro-health anti-smoking lawyer John Banzhaf's group, ASH and supported other anti-smoking campaigns.

==Water Fluoridation==
Bernays helped the [[Aluminum Company of America]] (Alcoa) and other special interest groups to convince the American public that [[water fluoridation]] was safe and beneficial to human health. This was achieved by using the [[American Dental Association]] in a highly successful media campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard85.html Fluoridation Revisited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313192649/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard85.html |date=2014-03-13 }}. The Rothbard-Rockwell Report, January 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
Bernays applied Freud's observations to convince the public, among other things, that bacon and eggs was the true all-American breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;Alix Spiegel. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612464 Freud's Nephew and the Origins of Public Relations], [[Morning Edition]], 22 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He called for a [[focus group]] to learn why housewives didn't want to buy instant cake mixes. He secured cake mix sales by adding a (symbolic) egg to the list of necessary ingredients.

==Political propaganda==
Bernays once engineered a "pancake breakfast" with vaudevillians for [[Calvin Coolidge]] in what is widely considered one of the first overt [[publicity stunt]]s for a US president.

Bernays's most extreme political propaganda activities were said to be conducted on behalf of the [[multinational corporation]] [[United Fruit Company]] (renamed [[Chiquita Brands International]] in 1984) and the U.S. government to facilitate the successful overthrow (see [[Operation PBSUCCESS]]) of the democratically elected president of [[Guatemala]], Colonel [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzman]]. Bernays's propaganda (documented in the BBC documentary ''[[The Century of the Self]]''), branding Arbenz as communist, was published in major U.S. media. According to a book review by [[John Stauber]] and [[Sheldon Rampton]] of [[Larry Tye]]'s biography of Bernays, ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays &amp; The Birth of PR'', "the term '[[banana republic]]' actually originated in reference to United Fruit's domination of corrupt governments in Guatemala and other Central American countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|title=THE CENTURY OF THE SELF|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Ir2xhL_po|work=THE CENTURY OF THE SELF|publisher=peter1979sk|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
When Venida, a [[hairnet]] manufacturer, hired Bernays' services, he started a campaign to convince women to grow their hair longer so they would buy more hairnets. Although the campaign failed to influence many women, it convinced government officials to require hairnets for certain jobs.

Bernays worked with [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] for [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory]]-brand bar soap. The campaign successfully convinced people that Ivory soap was medically superior to other soaps. He also promoted soap through sculpting contests and floating contests because the soap floated better than its competitors'.

In the 1930s, his [[Dixie Cup]] campaign was designed to convince consumers that only disposable cups were sanitary by linking the imagery of the overflowing cup with subliminal images of vaginas and venereal disease.&lt;ref name="Alan Bilton 2013 16"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Bilton|title=Silent Film Comedy and American Culture|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=fqYJ6uYbBHEC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event promotion==
{{unreferencedsection|date=September 2016}}
In 1920, Bernays successfully hosted the first [[NAACP]] convention in Atlanta, Georgia.  His campaign was considered successful because there was no violence at the convention.  His campaign focused on the important contributions of African-Americans to Whites living in the South.  He later received an award from the NAACP for his contribution.

In October 1929, Bernays was involved in promoting Light's Golden Jubilee. The event, which spanned across several major cities in the U.S., was designed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of [[Thomas Edison]]'s invention of the [[light-bulb]] (though a form of light-bulb had been simultaneously invented by [[Joseph Swan]]). The publicity elements of the Jubilee–including the special issuance of a U.S. postage stamp and Edison's "re-creating" the invention of the light bulb for a nationwide radio audience – provided evidence of Bernays's love for big ideas and "[[ballyhoo]]". A follow-up event for the 75th anniversary, produced for [[television]] by [[David O. Selznick]], was titled ''[[Light's Diamond Jubilee]]'' and broadcast on all four American TV networks on October 24, 1954.

Bernays was the publicity director of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

==The arts==
In 1913, Bernays secured one of his first consulting contracts. American actor [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] hired him to defend a play that promoted [[sex education]] against police interference. Bernays set up a [[front organization]] called the Medical Review of Reviews Sociological Fund. Although the organization purported to fight [[sexually transmitted disease]], its sole purpose was to endorse Bennett's play.&lt;ref name=sludge&gt;{{citation|title=Trust us, we're experts| last2=Stauber|first2=John| last1=Rampton|first1=Sheldon| year=2001|pages=44f}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, to prepare for the [[Ballets Russes]]' US tour, [[Sergei Diaghilev]] hired Bernays to convince American magazines to publish articles telling readers that [[ballet]] is fun to watch.

The '''Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist)''' ('''RCPB-ML''') is a small British [[Communism|communist]] [[political party]], previously named the '''Communist Party of England''' ('''CPE-ML''') on formation in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/index.htm#cpeml|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970's – Index Page|website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; until being reorganised in 1979 after rejecting [[Maoism]] and aligning with [[Hoxhaism|Albania]].&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"&gt;David Boothroyd (2001). ''The History of British Political Parties''. London. Politicos. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's thinking is based on the politics of [[Hardial Bains]], who travelled the world founding [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] [[Communist party|communist parties]].

== History ==
=== Origins (1967–1979) ===
{{Communist parties}}
The RCPB-ML has its origins in the [[Sussex University]]-based English Student Movement, part of the Hardial Bains-inspired tendency known as the Internationalists; and it formed following their Necessity For Change conference in 1967.&lt;ref name="R&amp;F"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.secondwave/uk-maoism.pdf "The Rise &amp; Fall of Maoism: the English Experience"].&lt;/ref&gt; Renamed the English Communist Movement (Marxist–Leninist) in 1970, the group founded the Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist) in March 1972.&lt;ref name=R&amp;F/&gt;

Like other Bains-inspired parties, the CPE-ML took the Chinese side in the [[Sino-Soviet split]], thus being endorsed by [[Albania]], allied at the time with Maoist China and opposing both the capitalist West and the [[Soviet bloc]] in accordance with the [[Three Worlds Theory]] promoted by Beijing. However, during the deterioration in [[Sino-Albanian split|Sino-Albanian]] relations the CPE-ML increasingly sided with [[Enver Hoxha]], developed party to party relations with the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] and renounced China as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]].

The CPE-ML made headlines during its first two years. In May 1973, members of affiliated group, the Birmingham Student Movement, instigated a widely-reported physical attack on [[Hans Eysenck]] at the [[London School of Economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Roderick D. (2010). ''Playing with Fire: The Controversial Career of Hans J. Eysenck''. OUP. p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; though Eysenck declined to press charges. In January 1974, four members of the party were found guilty of possession of petrol bombs and assaulting police.&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Peter (1976). ''Revolutionaries in Modern Britain''. Bodley Head.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one member had received a five year sentence for malicious wounding and assault the previous year.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;

In 1973, the CPE-ML put forward two candidates in parliamentary by-elections and in 1974 stood in six constituencies in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February general election]] and eight seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October general election]]. Their highest recorded vote was 612 (1.2%) in [[Portsmouth South (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth South]] during the second 1974 general election.&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"/&gt;

In 1974, the CPE-ML lost around a tenth of its membership&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/high-tide.pdf "High Tide"].&lt;/ref&gt; following the expulsion of Aravindan Balakrishnan and an associated group accused of "conspiratorial and splittist activities and social fascist slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm|title=Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)|website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group became the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]].

The party had links with the progressive music milieu in the 1970s, with avant-garde composers such as [[Cornelius Cardew]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gott. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n05/richard-gott/liberation-music "Liberation Music"]. A review of ''Cornelius Cardew: A Life Unfinished by John Tilbury'' by ''London Review of Books'' (15 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Chant]] being leading members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpbml.org.uk/spokes.htm|title=Leader|work=rcpbml.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RCPB-ML (1979–present) ===
The CPE-ML was renamed the RCPB-ML in 1979. It is closely related to the [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist)]] and has good relations with the [[New Communist Party of Britain]] (founded 1977). It produces an internet newspaper called ''Workers' Daily Internet Edition'' (''WDIE'') and has a bookshop in south London named John Buckle Books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpbml.org.uk/jbbooks.htm "John Buckle Books"].&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the RCPB-ML founding general secretary). It has been active in promoting solidarity with [[North Korea]]. In 2004, the party declared electoral support for the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]], but it now calls for an end to the system that brings parties to power and calls on workers' and peoples' collectives to intervene directly in the political process. The party has a system of collective leadership and its General Secretary is Michael Chant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/north-korea-friends-of-korea-michael-chant "Meet North Korea's UK fan club: 'They have their own way of doing things'"].&lt;/ref&gt; The party's logo is a black hammer and sickle within a yellow star on a red background.

[[Cornelius Cardew]] died in 1981, John Buckle in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[https://rtuc.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/a-model-communist/ "A Model Communist"].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hardial Bains]] in 1997.

RCPB-ML official Roger Nettleship has stood in several general elections under his own name, including [[Jarrow (UK Parliament constituency)|Jarrow]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpbml.org.uk/wdie-05/d05-043.htm|title=Workers Daily Internet Edition Year 2005 No. 43|work=rcpbml.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]] in 2001 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpbml.org.uk/wdie-10/d10-021.htm|title=Workers Daily Internet Edition Year 2010 No. 21|work=rcpbml.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party supported [[Brexit]] in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcpbml.org.uk/wwie-16/ww16_special_edition_eu.htm|title=Workers' Weekly Internet Edition Year 2016 Volume 46 Number|website=www.rcpbml.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=September 2014}}
The '''Saxon Peasants' Revolt''' ({{lang-de|Sächsischer Bauernaufstand}} or ''kursächsischer Bauernaufstand'') of 1790 was a military conflict between the nobility and the peasants. The hot spots of the insurrection were large areas around Dresden, Leipzig and Zwickau.

The disputes over hunting rights within [[gamekeeping]] reserves established by the nobility initially led to unrest in game in [[Stadt Wehlen|Wehlen]], which rapidly spread to other districts (''Ämter''). However, the government in Saxony was able to bring these riots under control by early July. The previous harsh winter of 1789/1790 and the drought in 1790, however, increased the potential for conflict. So in the summer of 1790, more and more peasants rebelled against the Saxon state, the revolt being centred on [[Wechselburg]]. One of the best known spokesmen for the peasants was Christian Benjamin Geißler, also called "the Rebel of Liebstadt" (''"Rebell von Liebstadt"''). By mid-August, the farmers had taken control of fifteen patrimonial court districts, covering an area of 5,000 square kilometres.

The areas around [[Stolpen]], [[Dresden]], [[Radeberg]], [[Dippoldiswalde]], the two [[Lusatia]]s and [[Torgau]] were now affected by the uprising. The riots took place in a disorganized and very spontaneous manner. Thus, in the area of Königstein and in Upper Lusatia labour was withdrawn. There were even assaults on castles and Saxon military units were disarmed by the peasants. On 23 August in [[Meissen]], 2,000 peasants, armed with [[flail]]s, [[club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[axe]]s, forced the release of imprisoned rebels.

The main demands of the peasants were the abolition of hunting privileges, the abolition of [[socage]], the prohibition of the conversion of contributions in kind into financial [[interest]] by the lords or Saxon district offices. Initially the peasants succeeded in getting the lords to waiver all duties, socage and interest. Some lords were even expelled by their peasants. But a major military operation in September 1790 finally overthrew the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bauernkriege.de/sachs.html ''Sächsischer Bauernaufstand 1790'' at Bauernkriege.de.

The '''Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1997''' [[amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amended]] the [[Constitution of Ireland]] to provide that the confidentiality of meetings of the [[Irish Government|cabinet]] would not prevent the High Court from ordering that certain information be disclosed when this was in the public interest. It was approved by [[referendum]] on 30 October 1997 and signed into law on 14 November of the same year.

==Changes to the text==
Inserted a new subsection in Article 28.4:
{{quote frame|
3º The confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter-
:i. in the interests of the administration of justice by a Court, or
:ii. by virtue of an overriding public interest, pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter stated by them to be of public importance.}}
The existing subsection 3º of Article 28.4 was renumbered as subsection 4º.

==Overview==
In 1992, during the [[Beef Tribunal]], the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] ruled that, as the constitution stood, the confidentiality of meetings of the [[Government of Ireland|Government]] (the cabinet) was unbreachable and absolute. The court derived its ruling from Article 28.4.2º, which requires that the Government observe the principle of collective responsibility. The purpose of the Seventeenth Amendment was to allow cabinet confidentiality to be relaxed in certain circumstances.

The amendment was adopted during the [[Fianna Fáil]]–[[Progressive Democrats]] coalition government led by [[Bertie Ahern]] but had been first drafted and suggested by the previous [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]]–[[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] government led by [[John Bruton]]. The amendment, therefore, had the support of all major parties. The referendum occurred on the same day as the [[Irish presidential election, 1997|1997 presidential election]].

Formed in 1988 under the name of Slovenian Peasant Union as the first democratic political organization in Yugoslavia, it changed its name to Slovenian People's Party in 1992. On 15 April 2000 it merged with the Slovene Christian Democrats to form the SLS+SKD Slovenian People's Party, and changed its name in 2001 to Slovenian People's Party.

SLS won seats in the National Parliament in general elections in Slovenia in the years 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2011,&lt;ref name="State Election Commission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvk-rs.si/index.php/si/arhiv-drzavni-zbor-rs |title=Republic of Slovenia Parliamentary Elections Archive |publisher=State Election Commission |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but missed the parliamentary threshold in 2014. SLS won 6.83% of the vote at the early [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 Slovenian parliamentary election]] on 4 December 2011, thus gaining 6 seats in the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="DVK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volitve.gov.si/dz2011/en/index.html |title=Republic of Slovenia Early Elections for Deputies to the National Assembly 2011 |publisher=National Electoral Commission |accessdate=16 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801150748/http://volitve.gov.si/dz2011/en/index.html |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From March 2013 to December 2014, Franc Bogovič led SLS. In the 2014 European Parliamentary elections, SLS got their first seat in the European Parliament with Franc Bogovič being elected member of the European Parliament on the NSi and SLS joint-list. SLS lost their seats in the National parliament for the first time in the general elections on 13 July 2014. In the local elections in October 2014, SLS won among all Slovenian political parties in the number of elected mayors.&lt;ref name="State Election Commission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volitve.gov.si/lv2014/rezultati/zbirni_podatki.html |title=Republic of Slovenia Local Elections 2014 Results |publisher=State Election Commission |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2014, a new leadership was elected at the SLS Congress in Podčetrtek, Slovenia. The new president of the SLS is Marko Zidanšek.

==Establishment and early years==
The Slovenian People's Party was established in May 1988 under the name of '''Slovenian Peasant Union''' (''Slovenska kmečka zveza'') as the first openly non-Communist political organization in Slovenia and [[Yugoslavia]] after 1945. The establishment of the Slovenian Peasant Union is frequently considered as one of the crucial events in the [[Slovenian Spring]] of 1988. In January 1989, it could register as a party. In the first [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1990|multi-party election]] in Slovenia, the Peasant Union ran as a part of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS coalition]] and won 11 of the 80 seats in the Slovenian Parliament. The party's name was changed to the current form in 1991,&lt;ref name="DayEastThomas"/&gt; alluding to the pre-war Catholic conservative [[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovene People's Party]]. The renaming of the party caused a controversy with the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]], who considered themselves the official heirs of the pre-war Slovene People's Party, since the Slovene People's Party in exile merged with the Slovene Christian Democrats in 1990.

In 1992, Marjan Podobnik was elected as president of the party. Under his leadership, the Slovenian People's Party pursued an [[agrarianism|agrarian]], [[ethnic nationalism|ethnonationalist]] and [[Corporatism|corporatist]] ideology.&lt;ref name="Rizman"&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf M. |last=Rizman |title=Radical Right Politics in Slovenia |work=The radical right in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1999 |pages=155–158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZr1vsDIvlUC&amp;pg=PA342 |accessdate=17 November}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the founder of the Slovenian Peasant Union [[Ivan Oman]] left the party and joined the Slovene Christian Democrats, who were then part of the ruling centrist [[grand coalition]].

Between 1992 and 1996, the Slovene People's Party was, together with the [[Slovenian National Party]], the largest opposition party. Its ideology and policies were marked by a populist shift. In late 1995, representatives of the People's Party called for a referendum to suspend the citizenship of non-ethnic Slovenes. The attempt was stopped by the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref name="Rizman"/&gt;

Ahead of the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1996|parliamentary election of 1996]], the People's Party formed the Slovenian Spring alliance together with the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]] (SKD), that referred to the historical Slovenian People's Party, as well. However the alliance, was disbanded immediately after the elections, when the SLS joined a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]] (LDS), while the SKD went into opposition. In April 2000, strains between SLS and the Liberal Democrats led to the former's withdrawal from the coalition. In early May, SLS, SKD and [[Slovenian Democratic Party|SDS]] elected Christian democrat [[Andrej Bajuk]] prime minister instead.&lt;ref name="DayEastThomas"/&gt;

==Merger==
On 15 April 2000, the Slovene Christian Democrats merged into the Slovenian People's Party,&lt;ref name="ZajcBoh"/&gt; and the abbreviation was temporarily changed to SLS+SKD to signify both predecessors. However, as early as in July of the same year rifts emerged, based on the question of a new electoral system. Therefore, Prime Minister Bajuk, [[Lojze Peterle]], and other centrist Christian democrats left the unified party to form [[New Slovenia]] – Christian People's Party (NSi) in August. The remaining People's Party performed poorly in the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2000|election in October 2000]], but became part of the Liberal-led coalition government of [[Janez Drnovšek]].&lt;ref name="DayEastThomas"/&gt;

==After 2004==
In the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2004|legislative election]] on 3 October 2004, the party won 6.8% of the popular vote and 7 out of 90 seats. Led by [[Janez Podobnik]], the brother of former chairman Marjan Podobnik, the party entered in the centre-right government of [[Janez Janša]].

In 2007, the mayor of Celje [[Bojan Šrot]] replaced Marjan Podobnik as president of the party. This change in leadership coincided with a policy shift. Upon his election, Šrot announced he wanted to transform the SLS in the largest center-right party in Slovenia, thus challenging the primacy of Janez Janša's [[Slovenian Democratic Party]]. Šrot started criticizing some of the [[neo-liberal]] reforms launched by Janša's government, and especially Janša's "anti-[[tycoon]]" policies, aimed against concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of executive managers of privatized former state-owned firms. One of these "tycoons" was also Boško Šrot, Bojan Šrot's brother, and CEO of the [[Laško Brewery]] company.

In the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 election]] the SLS ran a joint list with the [[Youth Party of Slovenia]]. In the electoral campaign, the party tried to distance itself from its former coalition allies. The joint list secured only 5 seats and 5.2% of the vote, a loss of 2 compared to the results of the SLS in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://parties-and-elections.de/slovenia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Radovan Žerjav]], former Minister of Transport in Janez Janša government, replaced Šrot as the leader of the party. Under his leadership, the SLS adopted a more moderate rhetorics. After 11 years in power, the party stayed in opposition, trying to forge an image of a constructive opposition party, supporting moderate conservative policies.

In the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 election]], the SLS increased its support both in number of voters and in percentage, thus reversing the falling trend for the first time after the 2000 election.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Slovenia)|2014 European election]], SLS ran in a joint electoral list with [[New Slovenia]], which received 16.56% of the vote and came in second place, returning 2 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delo.si/assets/info5/20140525/EUvolitve2014/volitve.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The party received 3.98% of the vote in the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2014|Slovenian parliamentary election]] on 13 July 2014, narrowly missing the 4% threshold for representation in the parliament. In 2018 it received only 2.62% of the votes and next day the leader Marko Zidanšek resigned. Party decided that Primož Jelševar would lead the party until the next regular party congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/do-kongresa-sls-a-bo-stranko-vodil-podpredsednik-primoz-jelsevar/457935|title=Do kongresa SLS-a bo stranko vodil podpredsednik Primož Jelševar|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soldiers for the Truth Foundation''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] public charity organization in the United States dedicated to military reform. Its stated mission is to inform the public, [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the media on issues related to the training, readiness, equipment and leadership of US armed forces.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sftt.org/about.html |title=About Soldiers For The Truth |access-date=7 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117025748/http://www.sftt.org/about.html |archive-date=17 November 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation is registered as a non-profit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/eopub78.zip (ZIP compressed) IRS list of 501 (c) organizations]&lt;br&gt; [https://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=96136,00.html IRS Search page]&lt;/ref&gt; Notable issues in which the foundation has been involved include campaigning for better body armor for troops serving in Iraq and contributing to coverage of the abuse of prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib]].

Soldiers For The Truth claims a membership of 20,000&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; and publishes an online magazine called [[Defense Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sftt.org/dw.html |title=Defense Watch |access-date=7 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020957/http://www.sftt.org/dw.html |archive-date=17 November 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; criticising the country's military leadership using information provided by active servicemen and women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1479323,00.html Guardian obituary of D. H. Hackworth]
"Serving soldiers fed his website with information about the army's leadership shortcomings. Last February, he wrote, ''Most combat vets pick their fights carefully. They look at their scars, remember the madness and are always mindful of the fallout ... the White House and the Pentagon are run by civilians who have never sweated it out on a battlefield.'' "&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and organization==
Soldiers for the Truth grew out of the regular opinion pieces written by [[David H. Hackworth]] from the early 1990s on, originally titled "[[Defending America]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sftt.org/ht.html |title=A collection of Col.

Hackworth also used the profits from his own book sales to help fund the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/waronterror/story/0,,582658,00.html Guardian article: ''America's 'elite' troops''] "On his return from Australia, he wrote About Face, a chronicle of his war experiences. It became a best-seller, as did three further books, the profits from the last two of which have been ploughed into Soldiers For The Truth, Hackworth's non-profit foundation."&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly email newsletters were composed by a group of like-minded veterans, their friends and spouses, including R.W. Zimmermann, Bill Rogers, Ray Starmann, Kate Aspy, Barry "Woody" Groton, Ed "Edgar" Schneider, and Kyle Elliot.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Later contributors included author and civilian security analyst Paul Purcell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disasterprep101.com/Author.htm About Paul Purcell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104181025/http://disasterprep101.com/Author.htm |date=4 November 2007 }}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski, a whistleblower who criticised the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans as "Orwellian".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/soldier-for-the-truth/1977/ L.A.

Other authors included former Editor in Chief Ed Offley, Paul Connors, Matt Dodd and Roger Perry.

As of 2007, the foundation's board includes Hackworth's widow Eilhys England, Maj. John Falcon, US Army Retired and Lt. Col. Gary Stahlhut, US Army Reserve Retired.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==Activities==
In October 2001, as the American military prepared for its campaign in Afghanistan, Col. Hackworth assessed the readiness level of most of the troops as follows: "I would be reluctant to jump into a battle zone with any conventional American unit. I would hate to take them into battle - they ain't ready, they are not 'good to go'." He was also critical of the 'elite' troops that were expected to lead the assault.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/waronterror/story/0,,582658,00.html Guardian article: America's 'elite' troops] "I hear a lot of rhetoric about the famous 10th Mountain Division. In World War II it was unquestionably America's finest unit - trained for three years, made up with men from Colorado, Montana, Idaho, really tough men, experts in mountain fighting. What we have now in the 10th Mountain Division is a bunch of kids that are better qualified to play computer games than they are to fight in that kind of terrain."&lt;/ref&gt; Hackworth has repeatedly stated that the American military  is weakened by a combination of senior officers who are primarily concerned about their own careers above the welfare and training of their troops, and a culture of misdirected and wasteful expenditure.

In May 2004, the [[New York Times]] reported that Mr William Lawson, the uncle of an Army reservist serving as a prison guard in Iraq, contacted SFTT by email on 23 March to express his frustration that the guards would become scapegoats for the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, when Lawson himself believed the abuses were "evidence of a complete breakdown in training and authority in the Iraqi prison system". Lawson wrote in his email: "We have contacted the Red Cross, Congress both parties, Bill O'Reilly and many others. Nobody wants to touch this." The staff at SFTT put Lawson in touch with researchers working for [[60 Minutes II]], which broadcast a documentary on the subject within five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E4D9143CF93BA35756C0A9629C8B63 NY Times article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, incoming SFTT president John Falcon stated that the Pentagon-approved "Interceptor" body armor, issued to [[US Marines]] serving in Iraq, did not provide adequate protection against armor-piercing bullets. Falcon said that according to a secret Pentagon report, 80% of marines killed due to torso wounds between 2003 and 2005 would have survived if they had been wearing adequate body armor. SFTT continues to campaign for soldiers to be issued with an allegedly tougher, more protective body armor called "[[Dragon Skin]]". Marines interviewed on the subject appreciated the group's campaign, saying, "Anytime you get better equipment to the Marines, soldiers and sailors, it would make us that more dominant so it would be a good thing." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiiitv.com/home/7562752.html kiii TV - South Texas]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, SFTT is preparing legal action to compel the Pentagon to acknowledge and assist Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the defoliant Agent Blue during the Vietnam War. The cause of Col. Hackworth's death was "a form of cancer now appearing with increasing frequency among Vietnam veterans exposed to the defoliants called Agents Orange and Blue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/dhhackworth.htm Col. Hackworth's obituary page at the Arlington Cemetery website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current President of the Board, [[Frederick Tanne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frederick-tanne.com Frederick Tanne, President of the Board]&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in involving the law firm of Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP in filing the final motion with the Federal Court in Washington, DC in the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) on behalf of the SFTT’s editor for forensic records held by the Department of Defense (“DOD”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sftt.org/our-campaigns/ |title=Soldiers for the Truth Campaigns |access-date=9 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604183317/http://sftt.org/our-campaigns/ |archive-date=4 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ten Years''''' ({{zh|c=十年|j=Sap6 Nin4}}) is a 2015 Hong Kong [[dystopia]]n [[speculative fiction]] [[anthology film]]. It offers a vision of the semi-autonomous territory in the year 2025, with human rights and freedoms gradually diminishing as the [[Government of China|mainland Chinese government]] exerts increasing influence there. Produced on a shoestring budget, the film was a surprise hit, beating ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' at the [[Yau Ma Tei]] cinema where it was first released.

Due to the film's sensitive political themes, mainland Chinese authorities [[Censorship in China|censored]] reports mentioning ''Ten Years'' except in terms of condemnation. State television channels and major internet sites were prohibited from broadcasting the [[35th Hong Kong Film Awards]] live as the film was nominated for [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]], which it eventually won.

==Plot==
The film comprises five short stories set in the year 2025.

===''Extras''===
Prior to an [[International Labour Day]] celebration, government officials concoct a [[false flag]] assassination plot to foment public support for legislation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|National Security Law]]. They hire two petty gangsters to execute the plot: Hairy (Zerisawa Courtney Wu), a middle-aged low-level [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] member, and Peter (Peter Chan), an immigrant from India. While the two argue over who should fire the gun, the director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office]] decides that the leaders of both the TMD and the Fortune Parties are to get shot with real bullets, so as to instigate greater panic in the territory. Misbelieving they will get paid and flee to India afterwards, both Hairy and Peter attempt the assassination but are killed instantly on scene by the police. Later, the government identifies the perpetrators as terrorists and restates the significance of the upcoming legislation.

Director Kwok Zune stated that the triad-like behaviour of the officials was inspired by real-world pro-establishment groups in Hong Kong, who were accused of beating and sexually assaulting pro-democratic protesters during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].&lt;ref name=scmp1/&gt;

===''Season of the End''===
Wong Ching (herself) and Lau Ho-chi (himself) attempt to preserve objects from homes destroyed by [[bulldozer]]s. The last specimen Lau wants to create is his own body.

===''Dialect''===
As the government enacts laws limiting operating areas of non-[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Hong Kong taxi|taxi]] drivers, a Cantonese-speaking driver (Leung Kin-ping) finds himself marginalised as he fails to pass the national Mandarin proficiency test. The driver's wife instructs him to stop using Cantonese with their son, Kongson, so that the boy will do better at his Mandarin [[medium of instruction]] school. A series of vignettes further illustrate the increasing dominance of Mandarin and Leung's struggle adjusting. He is unable to make himself understood by his Mandarin GPS unit and is ridiculed by a passenger for it. Two Mandarin-speaking fares opt to take another cab when they realise he cannot speak the language. One of his passengers, an office lady ([[Catherine Chau]]), is fired from her job for failing to clearly explain something to a client in Mandarin.

The film alludes to a 2003 real-world proposal by the [[Transport Department]] that failed, as well as a regulation introduced in [[Wuhan]].&lt;ref name=scmp1/&gt; In [[Mainland China]], Mandarin (a.k.a. Putonghua) is promoted as a national language, and legislation such as the [[Guangdong National Language Regulations]] restricts the use of Cantonese and all other varieties of Chinese. The name ''Dialect'' comes from the fact that the Mainland government refers to Cantonese as a [[dialect]] despite the fact that it is [[mutually unintelligible]] with Mandarin.&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt; The short was directed by Jevons Au Man-kit, a graduate of the [[The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts|Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]], who said that the taxi driver's plight was influenced by his own struggles to write scripts in Mandarin in an increasingly Mainland-oriented Hong Kong film sector.&lt;ref name=scmp1/&gt;

===''Self-immolator''===
[[File:HK British Consulate Justice Drive 1.JPG|thumb|The British Consulate-General, location of the eponymous self-immolation]]
Au-yeung Kin-fung (Ng Siu-hin), a young hardline supporter for [[Hong Kong independence]], becomes the first to be convicted under the National Security Law and dies during a [[hunger strike]] in prison. An unknown person commits [[self-immolation]] in front of the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong|British Consulate-General]] in [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]]. This escalates public concerns about Hong Kong's undecided future beyond 2047. Au-yeung's friend Karen (Tanzela Qoser) is initially feared to be the self-immolator but is later revealed to have been kidnapped by secret police. Au-yeung's allies, led by Marco ([[Neo Yau Hawk-Sau|Neo Yau]]), break into and set fire to the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Central Government Liaison Office]] in [[Sai Wan]], while a group of Christians gather and pray outside the British Consulate-General to urge the Britons to uphold the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] co-signed with the Beijing authorities. The Communist Party labels the demand for independence a diplomatic affair, thereby justifying the deployment of the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the city. The protests in Sai Wan and Admiralty are crushed violently. As a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals, after witnessing Au-yeung being severely beaten by police, an old woman was moved to commit self-immolation outside the British Consulate-General. The film ends on a prolonged shot of her umbrella burning, alluding to the [[Umbrella Movement]].

The storytelling is intertwined with interviews with commentators analysing ongoing events and providing background information such as Hong Kong's removal from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|UN decolonisation list]] in 1972 at China's behest.

Directed by Chow Kwun-wai, ''Self-immolator'' alludes to the common practice of self-immolation in Mainland China as a form of protest, particularly [[List of political self-immolations|among Tibetans]].&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt; Chow stated that while the plot of this piece may seem extreme, "In 2004, people would also find it hard to believe that [the police can drag a protester into a dark corner and beat him up]", alluding to the [[beating of Ken Tsang]] and other incidents of police brutality during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].&lt;ref name=scmp1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yau|first1=Elaine|title=Ten Years: Hong Kong film that beat Star Wars at the box office, and the directors behind it|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1895992/ten-years-hong-kong-film-beat-star-wars-box-office-and-directors|work=South China Morning Post|date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Local Egg''===
Sam ([[Liu Kai-chi]]), a grocery store keeper, is told about the closure of the last chicken farm in Hong Kong. He then visits his egg supplier, farm owner Cheung who recalls the government's actions to gradually kill off [[Agriculture and aquaculture in Hong Kong|the industry]] despite the fact that he has been meeting their demands. Sam's store is frequently checked by Youth Guards, members of a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]-like uniform group, since his use of "local eggs" on his label is on the censor list. He doubts why "local eggs" must be relabeled "Hong Kong eggs" when they refer to the same thing. Sam finds his son Ming among a squad of Youth Guards [[Egging|throwing eggs]] at a bookstore, but Ming assures his father that he has kept his teaching in mind and has not participated in the vandalism; instead, he often leaks the censor lists and actions to bookstore keepers so that they can remain safe and preserve the books. Relaxed at his son's critical thinking, Sam reminds a bookstore keeper not to get used to such suppressive acts.&lt;ref name=ejinsight1/&gt;

===Epilogue===
''Ten Years'' ends with a quote from the [[Book of Amos]]: {{cquote|It is an evil time. Seek good, and not evil, that you may live.|source={{Bibleverse|Amos|5:13b-14a|NIV}}}} and "Already too late" fading out and replaced by "Not too late".

==Production==
The independent film was conceived by Ng Ka-leung, a graduate of the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]. Ng said that the idea predated the [[Umbrella Movement]], and was inspired by ongoing political, educational and housing problems. He explained in late 2015:

{{Quote|text=I had the idea for ''Ten Years'' early last year. I had been feeling dejected for years about the lack of future for Hong Kong. The [[Moral and national education|national education controversy]] showed that the next generation are at risk of ideological indoctrination. Political, education and housing problems have festered for years and all protest movements have turned out to be futile in the end. I wanted to make a film to flesh out possible future scenarios so people might be goaded into thinking more about the future path Hong Kong should take.&lt;ref name=scmp1/&gt;}}
 
The film was produced on a budget of HK$500,000 (US$64,000).&lt;ref name=ejinsight1&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-budget film on Hong Kong future turns into blockbuster|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20160106-low-budget-film-on-hong-kong-future-turns-in-blockbuster/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast and crew were mainly volunteers.&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffiths|first1=James|title='Ten Years': Dark vision of Hong Kong's future proves surprise box office hit|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/20/asia/hong-kong-ten-years-future/|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=Cable News Network|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed in Hong Kong.

==Release==
[[File:Ten Years movie screen in City Art Square 201604.jpg|thumb|A community screening of ''Ten Years'' on 1 April 2016 in front of [[Sha Tin Town Hall]].]]
The film was featured at the [[Hong Kong Asian Film Festival]] in November 2015 before its general release.&lt;ref name=ejinsight1/&gt; It was initially released on only one screen in Hong Kong at the [[Broadway Cinematheque]] in Yau Ma Tei at the end of 2015. It was a surprise hit, and subsequently received a release at select UA Cinemas. It was further picked up by two independent cinemas, the [[Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre|Metroplex]] in [[Kowloon Bay]] and the Ma On Shan Classics Cinema.&lt;ref name="miracle"/&gt; The Metroplex decided to show the film in its largest cinema (430 seats) boosting ticket sales.&lt;ref name="miracle"/&gt;

By early February 2016 only the independent cinema in Ma On Shan was showing the film. It ended its run there following the weekend of 12 February.&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timmons|first1=Heather|title=Hong Kong’s popular, lucrative horror movie about Beijing has disappeared from theaters|url=http://qz.com/615831/the-most-successful-movie-made-in-hong-kong-in-years-has-been-pulled-from-theaters/|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since being pulled from theatres, the film has been showing at private screening at universities and other rented venues, advertised on social media.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

In February 2016 the international distribution rights for the film were purchased by [[Golden Scene]], a Hong Kong-based distributor.&lt;ref name=20160217hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yuen|first1=Chantal|title=Int’l distribution rights for dystopian HK film Ten Years purchased by Golden Scene|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/02/17/international-rights-for-dystopian-hong-kong-film-ten-years-picked-up-by-golden-scene/|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety1201705864&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frater|first1=Patrick|title=Berlin: Golden Scene Picks up Hong Kong Political Drama ’10 Years’|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/golden-scene-hong-kong-ten-years-1201705864/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2016, with no cinemas screening the film despite high demand, ''Ten Years'' was simultaneously screened at 34 different public locations around Hong Kong, including the underside of motorway flyovers (in [[Sham Shui Po]] and [[Mei Foo]]), the public steps leading to the [[Sha Tin Town Hall]], and the forecourt of the [[Legislative Council Complex]].&lt;ref name="hkfpwhere"/&gt; The screenings were organised by a variety of community groups, educational institutions, and churches.&lt;ref name="hkfpwhere"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grundy|first1=Tom|title=Where can you see 10 Years?

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the first month of its general release, most showings were sold out.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Alan|title=Imagining Hong Kong’s Future, Under China’s Tightening Grasp|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/world/asia/hong-kong-ten-years.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the only cinema showing it in the week of its opening, it grossed more ticket sales than ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'',&lt;ref name=scmp1/&gt; and ranked top ten in Hong Kong's weekend box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?id=_fTENYEARS201&amp;country=HK|title=Ten Years (2015)|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of January 2016 the film surpassed HK$5 million in box office earnings, which one of the directors called a miracle given the film's modest budget and limited screening.&lt;ref name="miracle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|title=‘A miracle’: Dystopian HK film ‘Ten Years’ passes HK$5 million mark at the box office|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/02/03/a-miracle-dystopian-hk-film-ten-years-passes-hk5-million-mark-at-the-box-office/|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the film was only being shown at [[MegaBox (shopping mall)|UA Megabox]], the [[Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre|Metroplex]] and the Ma On Shan Classics Cinema.&lt;ref name="miracle"/&gt; By mid-February, when ''Ten Years'' ended its run at the sole screen where it was still being shown, the film had grossed more than HK$6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Years (2015)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?id=_fTENYEARS201&amp;country=HK&amp;wk=2016W2&amp;id=_fTENYEARS201&amp;p=.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb|IMDb.com, Inc.]]|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''South China Morning Post'' reported that "''Ten Years''" topped the charts on Chinese download site zimuzu.tv after the Hong Kong Film Awards ceremony, but that users were disappointed to find they had downloaded the [[10 Years (2011 film)|2011 American film of the same name]].&lt;ref name=scmp1934107&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1934107/china-downloaders-seeking-hong-kong-set-ten-years-get-10-years|title=China downloaders seeking Hong Kong-set Ten Years get 10 Years, Hollywood rom-com, instead|date=7 April 2016|work=[[South China Morning Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''Ten Years'' received generally positive reviews locally. Some viewers reportedly left the cinema in tears.&lt;ref name="quartz"/&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Hong Kong]]'' called the film "powerful, poignant, relevant and brave", as well as "nightmarish".&lt;ref name=20160114timeout&gt;{{cite news|title=The filmmakers behind 'Ten Years' on the resonating success of their dystopian vision|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/film/features/75349/the-filmmakers-behind-ten-years-on-the-resonating-success-of-their-dystopian-vision.html|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Hong Kong]]|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]'' called it "well-constructed", and wrote: "Viewers will realize that although some of the scenes may seem unfamiliar and others way too radical, the stories are always anchored on developments in the past and the present. There’s always something in the movie that viewers can identify with, something believable and within the realm of the possible."&lt;ref name=ejinsight1/&gt; Writing in the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', Edmund Lee called the film "a reminder of the power of independent, intelligent filmmaking as a vehicle for social and political critique" and "one of the most thought-provoking local films in years".&lt;ref name=scmp1892429&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Edmund|title=Film review: Ten Years – Hongkongers’ worst post-Occupy fears depicted in 5 short films|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1892429/film-review-ten-years-hongkongers-worst-post-occupy-fears-depicted|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Wu said: "Provocation is an art form. Perhaps the true value of Ten Years lies in how uncomfortable it is to us all... As a portrayal of our worst fears, it is arguably the quintessential political horror film of our time. It perfectly plays (or should it be 'preys'?) on many Hongkongers’ primal fears..."&lt;ref name=scmp1934694&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1934694/love-it-or-hate-it-ten-years-points-common-enemy-hong-kong|title=Love it or hate it, Ten Years points to the common enemy in Hong Kong politics – fear|date=10 April 2016|work=[[South China Morning Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''[[Hong Kong Free Press]]'' responded that "while ''Global Times'' and other reviewers have primarily directed their critiques at the likelihood of the film's events actually taking place, the film cannot be entirely interpreted as a prediction for the year 2025. ''Ten Years'' is not a forecast calculated via econometric modelling; it is simply a portrayal of the Hong Kong public's worst fears. Perhaps a more pertinent question raised by the film is why people have come to dread – rather than look forward to – the city’s future. The answer is probably because we have been shown no realistic alternative."&lt;ref name="tong"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tong|first1=Elson|title=Ten Years: A film that speaks to Hong Kong’s worst fears|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/02/07/ten-years-film-speaks-hong-kongs-worst-fears/|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same reviewer observed a message about belonging in Hong Kong: "For example, ''Extras'' and ''Self-Immolator'' [...] portray mainland immigrants, South Asians and elderly characters without treating them as antagonists or resorting to stereotypes. The latter film even features a mixed-race relationship, advocating the idea that Hong Kong identity should be based on civic, not ethnic, factors."&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;

The film was selected to be screened at the 18th Taipei Film Festival opening on 30 June 2016.&lt;ref name=scmp1939567&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/1939567/politically-charged-hong-kong-films-including-ten-years-headline|title=Politically charged Hong Kong films, including Ten Years, headline prestigious Taipei festival|date=28 April 2016|work=[[South China Morning Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry voices===
[[Peter Lam]], chairman of Media Asia and of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, said: "The fact that the film got the prize is a tragedy for Hong Kong's movie industry [because] politics has kidnapped the profession and politicised film-awarding events." Lam added that, from a film investor's perspective: "The movie did not possess the qualities of best film, as you can see that it was not nominated for best actress or best actor awards, nor was it a blockbuster." Crucindo Hung, former chairman of the Federation of Motion Film Producers of Hong Kong, criticised the award as "an out-of-your-mind and outrageous decision."&lt;ref name=thestandard167917&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lo|first1=Kinling|title=Backlash after `emotional win' for Ten Years|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=167917|work=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lam further defended his remark from criticism, but earned further rebuke to his statement implying that a [[wonton noodles]] shop ought never to be able to be voted the best restaurant in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=20160418hongkongfp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/04/18/can-a-wonton-noodles-shop-be-best-restaurant-in-hk-tycoon-blasts-dystopian-film-ten-years-winning-top-award/|title=Tourism Board chief blasts decision to grant Ten Years 'best film' award|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the Chamber of Films said that they would submit a proposal to the Hong Kong Film Awards Association to change the voting mechanism of the awards. Daniel Lam, Chamber of Films member and owner of Universe Films, whose film ''Little Big Master'' lost out to ''Ten Years'', said that current voting mechanism "can be easily manipulated to produce an irrational result".&lt;ref name=hollywoodreporter881291&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hong-kong-film-awards-local-881291|title=Hong Kong Film Awards: Local Producers Want Voting System Changes After 'Ten Years' Win|author=Karen Chu|date=6 April 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Prometheus Global Media, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1940253&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1940253/hong-kong-film-awards-faces-calls-change-voting-system-after|title=Hong Kong Film Awards faces calls to change voting system after controversial Ten Years named best picture|date=30 April 2016|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political response===
On the other hand, the [[Chinese Communist Party]]-controlled ''[[Global Times]]'' called the film absurd and ridiculous, and accused the filmmakers of trying to spread anxiety.&lt;ref name=hkfp1/&gt; It referred to the film's political message as a "virus of the mind" and claimed its box office earnings were minimal.&lt;ref name=hkfp1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|title=State newspaper says dystopian HK film ‘Ten Years’ is ridiculous and promotes desperation|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/01/22/state-newspaper-says-dystopian-hk-film-ten-years-is-ridiculous-and-promotes-desperation/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1903800&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fung|first1=Owen|title=‘Ten Years’ film is absurd and too pessimistic, says Global Times|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1903800/ten-years-film-absurd-and-too-pessimistic-says-global-times|work=South China Morning Post|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that the film was nominated for best picture in the 35th [[Hong Kong Film Awards]], the state-owned [[China Central Television]] announced that it would not live telecast the ceremony, as it had done every year since 1991.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sala|first1=Ilaria Maria|title=Ten Years – the terrifying vision of Hong Kong that Beijing wants obscured|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/ten-years-the-terrifying-vision-of-hong-kong-that-beijing-wants-obscured|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online video website [[Tencent]] has said that it will also not cover the event.&lt;ref name=20160222hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yuen|first1=Chantal|title=Dystopian HK film Ten Years leads to Chinese media boycott of Hong Kong Film Awards|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/02/22/ten-years-banned-in-china/|accessdate=22 February 2016|agency=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's leading film review websites [[Douban]] and Mtime.com do not allow users to create a page for the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Derek Yee]], chairman of Hong Kong Film Awards, who presented the award to the directors, said that it had been hard to find anyone else to present the award, due to fears of being blacklisted for mainland opportunities.&lt;ref name=20160405nytimes/&gt;

Major mainland news websites, including [[Sina Corp|Sina]] and Tencent, covered the awards ceremony, held 3 April 2016, but neglected to mention the winner of best picture, considered one of Asia's top film awards.&lt;ref name=20160403reuters&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=Venus|last2=Kwok|first2=Donny|title=Film depicting China's shadow over Hong Kong wins top Asian award|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-film-tenyears-idUKKCN0X00VQ|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hollywoodreporter880302&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brzeski|first1=Patrick|last2=Chu|first2=Karen|title=Controversial Dystopian Movie 'Ten Years' Wins Best Picture at Hong Kong Film Awards|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/controversial-dystopian-movie-ten-years-880302|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Prometheus Global Media, LLC]]|date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland Chinese cities where [[TVB]], the main Hong Kong television channel, is aired, users on social media reported that the programme was blacked out and replaced with a cooking programme.&lt;ref name=20160405nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Alan|title=China News Blackout as ‘Ten Years’ Takes Hong Kong Best Film Award|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/asia/hong-kong-china-film-award-ten-years.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week of 11 April 2016, Apple was ordered by the Chinese [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television]] to shut down its iTunes Movie and iBooks stores,&lt;ref name=20160422nytimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/technology/apple-no-longer-immune-to-chinas-scrutiny-of-us-tech-firms.html|title=Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face|last=Mozur|first=Paul|date=2016-04-21|last2=Perlez|first2=Jane|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been approved approximately six months earlier.&lt;ref name=20160421macrumors&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/21/apple-china-state-itunes-movies-ibooks/|title=Report: iTunes Movies and iBooks Stores in China Ordered Closed by Chinese State Agency|last=Sumra|first=Husain|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be in response to the availability of ''Ten Years'' in the iTunes Movie store.

==Franchise==
In October 2017, a pan-Asian franchise based on the film was announced.&lt;ref name=franchise&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/sections-news_print.php?id=188549 Bleak Hong Kong film to become pan-Asian], Agence France-Presse, 18 October 2017, in The Standard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]], [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese]] and [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] versions are planned, each offering a very specific take on those societies' "hidden dangers and hidden fears", according to [[Rina B. Tsou]], one of five Taiwanese directors on that project. For instance, the Japanese version would explore a country "plagued by pollution and aging" as well as a "society where morality and personal history are manipulated by technology." "Surveillance and government control" in a Thailand a decade hence will be envisaged by director [[Aditya Assarat]], while the Taiwanese project foretells an island where "immigrant workers are systematically exploited and the loss of culture and dropping birth rate" have caused its inhabitants to turn to "virtual reality escapes."&lt;ref name=franchise/&gt;

Executive producers for the franchise include Andrew Choi, one of the original Hong Kong 'Ten Years' producers, and Japanese filmmaker [[Hirokazu Kore-eda]].&lt;ref name=franchise/&gt;

The '''Transnational Institute''' (TNI), is an international non-profit research and advocacy [[Think_tank|think tank]] that was founded in 1974, [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].

== History ==

TNI was founded in 1974 in Amsterdam. Initially it operated as an international arm of the [[Institute for Policy Studies]]. Later it continued as a non-profit worldwide organisation.{{When|date=October 2018}} 

In [[1976]] the director of the institute ([[Orlando Letelier]]) was [[Assassination of Orlando Letelier|Assassinated]] by the Chilean secret police as ordered by [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/pinochet-directly-ordered-washington-killing-diplomat-documents-orlando-letelier-declassified|title=Pinochet directly ordered killing on US soil of Chilean diplomat, papers reveal|first=Jonathan|last=Franklin|date=8 October 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ips-dc.org/about/history/|title=Our History - Institute for Policy Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activist [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]] is chairman of the supervisory board of the TNI.{{When|date=October 2018}}

The film was originally scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.]] on Friday, November 4, 2005, (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it opened on March 17, 2006, to positive reviews. Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(2003), declined to watch the film and asked not to be credited or paid royalties.

''V for Vendetta'' has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; [[libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]] have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: "The [[Guy Fawkes mask]] has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny – and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Rosie | last = Waites | title = V for Vendetta masks: Who | date =October 20, 2011 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735 |work=BBC News | accessdate = October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 2032, the world is in turmoil, with the United States fractured as a result of prolonged [[Second American Civil War|second civil war]] and a pandemic of the "St. Mary's Virus" that ravaged the U.K and Europe 14 years prior. The United Kingdom is ruled as a [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quicklet On V for Vendetta By Alan Moore|last=Muise|first=Chris|publisher=Hyperink, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=161464084X|location=|pages=1-10|quote=Britain, however, survives under the cold, watchful eye of the Norsefire government, a fascist regime that took control amidst the chaos and confusion after the war.}}&lt;/ref&gt; police state by the [[Norsefire]] Party, under the all-powerful High Chancellor [[Adam Susan|Adam Sutler]].

On November 4, a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask identifying himself as "[[V (comics)|V]]" rescues [[Evey Hammond]], an employee of the state-run British Television Network, from members of the "Fingermen" [[secret police]] while she is out past curfew. From a rooftop, they watch his demolition of London's main criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]], accompanied by fireworks and the "[[1812 Overture]]". Inspector Finch of [[Scotland Yard]] is asked to investigate V's activities while BTN declares the incident an "emergency demolition". V interrupts the broadcast to claim responsibility, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's [[Guy Fawkes Night]] outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. During the broadcast, the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.

V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V then kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the [[Bishop of London]].&lt;!-- Before claiming the bishop is a pedophile you need a citation. Pedophilia is sexual attraction primarily or exclusively towards prepubescents, typically around 13 years old. The dialogue from the aide says that Evey is "a little older than usual". Natalie Portman was about 24 during filming and cannot pass for a prepubescent girl. --&gt; Evey offers to help, and uses the opportunity to escape to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him with her safety, Gordon reveals prohibited materials, including subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. Meanwhile, V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who had experimented on him and many other "undesirables" at [[Larkhill]] concentration camp; seeing her remorse for her past actions, he kills her painlessly.

After Gordon performs a satire of the government on his show, his home is raided later that night and Evey is captured. She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page, a former prisoner who was tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is inexplicably released, and then finds herself in V's home. It turns out that V was the one who had "captured" her at Gordon's home, and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realises she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.

Reading the deceased Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and has been targeting the people who detained him. Despite being stonewalled by the government, Finch searches for the true identity of V, tracing him to a [[biological warfare|bioweapons]] program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him that the program, which was directed by Sutler (who was then Undersecretary of Defence), resulted in the creation of the deadly St. Mary's Virus during Americas war in the middle east which grew worse. He further reveals that Creedy, a leader of the Norsefire Party, released the virus onto English soil particularly on a school called St Mary and a water treatment plant, killing more than 100,000 British residents and framing the outbreak as an attack by a [[terrorist organisation]]. The Party, which promised security in times of social instability, used the ensuing wave of fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the newly created office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], becoming the elected government and taking absolute and total control over the country. Finch later discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is severely shaken.

As November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, and the population questions party rule. The nation slowly descends into anarchy, ignited when one of the Fingermen makes the mistake of shooting and killing a young girl committing vandalism, only to be killed in turn by a mob of enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned [[London Underground]], set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Party Leader Creedy, with whom he has made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying.

As Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. On the surface, thousands of unarmed Londoners wearing Guy Fawkes masks march towards the Houses of Parliament. Since Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the [[British Armed Forces|military]] receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, "He was all of us."

She also studied films such as ''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]'' and read the autobiography of [[Menachem Begin]].&lt;ref name="official production" /&gt; Portman received top billing for the film. Portman's role in the film has parallels to her role as Mathilda Lando in the film ''[[Léon (film)|Léon]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; According to Portman: "the relationship between V and Evey has a complication [like] the relationship in that film." Portman also had her head shaved on screen during a scene where her character is tortured.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://movies.about.com/od/vforvendetta/a/vendetta072505_2.htm | title=Natalie Portman and Joel Silver Talk About "V for Vendetta" | author=Murray, Rebecca | publisher=About.com |accessdate=January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''V for Vendetta'' sets the [[Gunpowder Plot]] as V's historical inspiration, contributing to his choice of timing, language, and appearance.&lt;ref name="official production" /&gt; For example, the names [[Ambrose Rookwood|Rookwood]], [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Percy]] and [[Robert Keyes|Keyes]] are used in the film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators.{{cn|date=June 2017}} The film creates parallels to [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas']] ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', by drawing direct comparisons between V and [[Edmond Dantès]].

According to the official website, "V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story. He wears the mask to hide his physical scars, and in obscuring his identity&amp;nbsp;– he becomes the idea itself."&lt;ref name="official production" /&gt;

As noted by several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror elements from [[Gaston Leroux]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060316/REVIEWS/60308005/1023 |title=V for Vendetta |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=March 16, 2006 |date=March 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Stein |first=Ruthe | title=In 'Vendetta,' disastrous U.S. and British policymaking gives rise to terrorism – what a shocker | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/16/DDGG9HO5VT1.DTL&amp;type=movies | date=March 16, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2006 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; V and the Phantom both wear masks to hide their disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of ''The Phantom of the Opera'', where the masked Phantom takes [[Christine Daaé]] to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolllingstones"&gt;{{cite web|last=Travers |first=Peter | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/7222868/review/9440903/v_for_vendetta| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202516/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/7222868/review/9440903/v_for_vendetta| archivedate=July 24, 2008|title=V for Vendetta| work=rollingstones.com| accessdate=January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, ''V for Vendetta'' takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the [[Third Reich]] and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name="official production" /&gt;&lt;ref name="v for vendetta interviews" /&gt; For example, Adam Sutler&lt;ref name="v for vendetta interviews" /&gt; primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent of the image of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. The slogan "Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith" is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to "[[Ministry of Truth|War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength]]" in Orwell's book.&lt;ref name="LaTimes"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Chocano |first=Carina |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/cl-et-vendetta17mar17,1,1139774.story |title='V for Vendetta'|accessdate=March 17, 2006 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=March 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the state's use of [[mass surveillance]], such as [[closed-circuit television]], on its citizens. Valerie was sent to a detention facility for lesbianism and then had medical experiments performed on her, reminiscent of the [[persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

==Themes and references==

{{quote box|width=30%|"We felt the novel was very prescient to how the political climate is at the moment.

I don't think it's such a big leap to say that things like that can happen when leaders stop listening to the people."|source=—James McTeigue, Director&lt;ref name="official production" /&gt;}}

The filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "With a wealth of new, real-life parallels to draw from in the areas of government surveillance, torture, [[fear mongering]] and [[media manipulation]], not to mention [[corporate crime|corporate corruption]] and religious hypocrisy, you can't really blame the filmmakers for having a field day referencing current events." There are also references to an [[Global spread of H5N1|avian flu]] pandemic,&lt;ref name="LaTimes" /&gt; as well as pervasive use of [[Biometrics|biometric identification]] and [[ECHELON|signal-intelligence gathering]] and analysis by the regime.

Film critics, political commentators and other members of the media have also noted the film's numerous references to events surrounding the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

Despite the America-specific references, the filmmakers have always referred to the film as adding dialogue to a set of issues much broader than the US administration.&lt;ref name="v for vendetta interviews" /&gt; When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]], McTeigue replied, "Yes.

==Production and release==

===Development===
The film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in [[The Matrix series|''The Matrix'' series]]. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of [[Alan Moore]]'s works: ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''.&lt;ref name="vendettasite"&gt;{{cite web| title=V for Vendetta news | publisher=[[Warner Brothers]] | work=vforvendetta.com | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/index2.html | accessdate=March 31, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315172448/http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/index2.html | archivedate=March 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release and relative success of [[Road House (1989 film)|''Road House'']], writer [[Hilary Henkin]] was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowgalaxy.net/Vendetta/Henkin.html |title=V for Vendetta: the Henkin Script}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis were fans of ''V for Vendetta'' and in the mid-1990s, before working on ''[[The Matrix]]'', wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third ''The Matrix'' films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to [[James McTeigue]]. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and found them to be relevant to the current political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story, while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes. James McTeigue cites the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' as his principal influence in preparing to film ''V for Vendetta''.&lt;ref name="official production"&gt;{{cite web| title=Production Notes for V for Vendetta | work=official webpage | publisher=vforvendetta.com | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_02.html | accessdate=April 14, 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315180047/http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_02.html| archivedate=March 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing, as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/696/696867p1.html |title=V for Vendetta: Comic vs. Film |publisher=IGN.com |date=March 17, 2006 |accessdate=January 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended cooperation with his publisher, [[DC Comics]], after its corporate parent, [[Warner Bros.]], failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes&lt;ref name="comicbookresource"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnston |first=Rich |url=https://www.cbr.com/291190-2/ |title=Moore Slams V For Vendetta Movie, Pulls LoEG From DC Comics |publisher=CBR.com |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes (fascism and [[anarchism]]) against one another.

===Filming===
''V for Vendetta'' was filmed in [[London]], United Kingdom, and in [[Potsdam]], Germany, at [[Babelsberg Studios]]. Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]]. Filming began in early March 2005 and principal photography officially wrapped in early June 2005.&lt;ref name="vendettasite" /&gt; ''V for Vendetta'' is the final film shot by [[cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]], who died of a heart attack on December 7, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Guard, Howard

To film the final scene at [[Westminster]], the area from [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Whitehall]] up to Parliament and [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5&amp;nbsp;am. This was the first time the security-sensitive area (home to [[10 Downing Street]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) had ever been closed to accommodate filming.&lt;ref name="About the Production" /&gt; Prime Minister (at the time of filming) [[Tony Blair]]'s son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal,&lt;ref name="tony blair's son"&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian | title=How E got the V in Vendetta | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/23/news| date=March 23, 2006 | accessdate=May 13, 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.&lt;ref name="About the Production" /&gt;

===Post-production===
The film was designed to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].&lt;ref name="Unmasked"&gt;{{cite video | people=Warner Bros |year=2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|publisher=Warner Bros.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] and statues by [[Giacometti]].
One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.&lt;ref name="About the Production"&gt;{{cite web| work=Official website | title=V for Vendetta&amp;nbsp;— About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion===
The cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in [[Thatcherite]] Britain... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.&lt;ref name="v for vendetta interviews" /&gt;

===Release===
The film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.&lt;ref name="vendettasite" /&gt; The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5, 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line "Remember, remember the 5th of November", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17, 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and the failed [[21 July 2005 London bombings|July 21 bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Scott|title=C is for controversy|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/|work=scifi.com|publisher=SCI FI|accessdate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101022910/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/ |archivedate=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production.&lt;ref name="Postponed"&gt;{{Cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Natalie Portman's 'V for Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?entry_id=452 | accessdate=April 25, 2006 | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=August 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on December 11, 2005, at [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]], followed by a premiere on February 13, 2006 at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=numb /&gt;&lt;ref name="v for vendetta interviews" /&gt; It opened for general release on March 17, 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical===
{{See also|List of accolades received by V for Vendetta (film)}}
[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper|Ebert and Roeper]] gave the film a "two thumbs up" rating. [[Roger Ebert]] stated that ''V for Vendetta'' "almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will". [[Margaret Pomeranz]] and [[David Stratton]] from [[At the Movies (Australian TV series)|''At the Movies'']] stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="at the movies"&gt;{{cite web| work=atthemovies.com | title=V for Vendetta | url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1601485.htm | accessdate=April 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a "woeful, depressing failure" and stating that the "cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue."&lt;ref name="jonathan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/03/14/film_2006_v_2006_article.shtml |title=Jonathan on...

===Political===
''V for Vendetta'' deals with issues of [[homosexuality]] (and its negative foil [[homophobia]]), [[criticism of religion]], [[totalitarianism]], [[Islamophobia]], and [[terrorism]]. Its controversial story line and themes have been the target of both criticism and praise from [[sociopolitical]] groups.

On April 17, 2006, the New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists organised a protest against [[DC Comics]] and [[Time Warner]], accusing it of watering down the story's original message in favor of violence and special effects.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite news|last= Launder |first= William |url= http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-05-02/launder-anarchistfight |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313183358/http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-05-02/launder-anarchistfight |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |title= "V" stands for very bad anarchist movie|publisher=Columbia News Service |date=May 2, 2006 |accessdate=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= Inducer |first= Smile |url= http://nymaa.org/node/243 |title= V for Vendetta?

"I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood." However, Graeber went on to state: "Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making. That's what is absent from Hollywood's interpretation."&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;

Film critic [[Richard Roeper]] dismissed [[Christian right|right-wing Christian]] criticism of the film on the television show ''Ebert and Roeper'', saying that V's "terrorist" label is applied in the film "by someone who's essentially Hitler, a dictator."&lt;ref name="ROTTEN &amp;"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=303317 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622110459/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=303317 |archivedate=June 22, 2008 |title=Rotten Tomatoes: Ebert &amp;amp; Roeper: "V for Vendetta" Dark, Thoughtful, And That's Good |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT]] commentators have praised the film for its positive depiction of homosexuals. [[Sarah Warn]] of [[AfterEllen.com]] called the film "one of the most pro-gay ever". Warn went on to praise the central role of the character Valerie "not just because it is beautifully acted and well-written, but because it is so utterly unexpected [in a Hollywood film]."&lt;ref name="afterellen"&gt;{{cite web|work=afterellen.com |title=V for Vendetta: A Brave, Bold Film for Gays and Lesbians |url=http://www.afterellen.com/Movies/2006/3/vendetta.html |accessdate=April 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821205452/http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2006/3/vendetta.html |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Walsh (film critic)|David Walsh]] of the [[World Socialist Web Site]] criticized V's actions as "antidemocratic," calling the film an example of "the bankruptcy of [[Propaganda of the deed|anarcho-terrorist]] ideology;" Walsh writes that because the people have not played any part in the revolution, they will be unable to produce a "new, liberated society."&lt;ref name="socialist criticism"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Walsh |first=David |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/mar2006/vend-m27.shtml |title=Confused, not thought through: V for Vendetta |publisher=World Socialist Website |date=March 27, 2006 |accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was broadcast on China's national TV station, [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) on December 16, 2012 completely uncensored,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Patranobis |first=Sutirtho |url=https://news.yahoo.com/china-shocked-v-vendetta-aired-national-tv-183000484.html |title=China shocked after 'v for vendetta' aired on national tv |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=December 16, 2012 |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; surprising many viewers. While many believed that the government had banned the film, the [[State Administration of Radio, Film and Television]] stated that it was not aware of a ban; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films. Liu Shanying, a political scientist at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that [[Censorship in China|Chinese film censorship]] might be being loosened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Watt | first=Louise | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/20/v-for-vendetta-china-tv_n_2335144.html | title='V For Vendetta' Airs In China, Stunning TV Viewers | work=Huffington Post | date=December 20, 2012 | accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between the film and graphic novel==
The film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel ''V for Vendetta''; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Itzcoff | first = Dave | title = The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date =March 12, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html | accessdate =April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set in 2032: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski &lt;!--Please see talk page before altering this to Lana. The credits listed here must match the credits in the film.--&gt; Brothers to fit a modern [[United States|US]] political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that "[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.&lt;ref name="official production" /&gt; Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Many of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |title=V for Vendetta the Page Vs. The Screen |accessdate=June 26, 2010 | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221050/http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|protégée]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a [[Quran]] is found in his possession.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

The ''V for Vendetta'' [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Astralwerks|Astralwerks Records]] on March 21, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed V For Vendetta Soundtrack Music Information|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7042674|work=CD Universe|publisher=Muze Inc|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original scores from the film's composer, [[Dario Marianelli]], make up most of the tracks on the album.&lt;ref name="tillnes2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tillnes |first=John |title=Soundtrack Review: V for Vendetta by Dario Marianelli (2006) |url=http://soundtrackgeek.com/2008/03/09/soundtrack-review-v-for-vendetta-by-dario-marianelli-2006/ |work=Soundtrack Geek |publisher=Soundtrackgeek.com |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201043653/http://soundtrackgeek.com/2008/03/09/soundtrack-review-v-for-vendetta-by-dario-marianelli-2006/ |archivedate=December  1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack also features three vocals played during the film: "[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]" by [[Julie London]], a cover of [[The Velvet Underground]] song "I Found a Reason" by [[Cat Power]] and "Bird Gerhl" by [[Antony and the Johnsons]].&lt;ref name="tillnes2006"/&gt; As mentioned in the film, these songs are samples of the 872 [[Blacklisted#Political context|blacklisted]] tracks on V's [[Wurlitzer|Wurlitzer jukebox]] that V "reclaimed" from the Ministry of Objectionable Materials. The climax of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' appears at the end of the track "Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)". The Overture's ''[[Finale (music)|finale]]''  is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film.

Three songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the ''V for Vendetta'' soundtrack.&lt;ref name="tillnes2006"/&gt; The first was "[[Street Fighting Man]]" by the [[Rolling Stones]]. The second was a special version of [[Ethan Stoller]]'s "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from "On Black Power" (also in "A Declaration of Independence") by [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and from "Address to the Women of America" by feminist writer [[Gloria Steinem]] were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: "This is no simple reform... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends." The final song was "[[Let It Come Down (Spiritualized album)|Out of Sight]]" by [[Spiritualized]].

Also in the film were segments from two of [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]]'s classic [[bossa nova]] songs, "[[The Girl from Ipanema|The Girl From Ipanema]]" and "[[Corcovado (song)|Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars]]". These songs were played during the "breakfast scenes" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's ''Symphony No.5'']] also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter "V" in [[Morse code]].&lt;ref name="graphic novel"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Moore |first= Alan |author2=David Lloyd  |title= [[V for Vendetta]] |quote=Inspector Finch recognises the background noise as Beethoven's Fifth, and states: "It's Morse code for the letter "V"" |publisher= Vertigo |date=November 2005|isbn= 1-4012-0792-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News | title=Newswatch 1940s | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1940s.stm | accessdate=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Deitrich's [[Benny Hill]]-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the "[[Yakety Sax]]" theme. Inspector Finch's alarm clock begins the morning of November 4 with the song "Long Black Train" by [[Richard Hawley]], which contains the [[foreshadowing]] lyrics "Ride the long black train... take me home black train."

===Books===
The original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASIN|1401207928|title=V for Vendetta [Hardcover]}} {{ISBN|978-1-4012-0792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film renewed interest in Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.&lt;ref name="Televisionpoint"&gt;{{cite web|work=televisionpoint.com |title=V for Vendetta graphic novel is a US Bestseller |url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410 |accessdate=April 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119122204/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410 |archivedate=November 19, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of '''Vice President of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]''' existed from April 1963 to June 1967. It was established by the new [[1963 Yugoslav Constitution|Yugoslav Constitution]] adopted on 7 April 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odluka o proglašenju ustava Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|newspaper=Službeni list Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|location=Belgrade|pages=261–292|volume=XIX|issue=14|date=10 April 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first to serve in the role was [[Aleksandar Ranković]] who assumed office on 30 June 1963. Due to an affair involving wire-tapping of Yugoslav president and general secretary of the League of Communists [[Josip Broz Tito]], Ranković was forced to resign from the Central Committee and from the vice presidency on 1 July 1966. He was subsequently replaced by [[Koča Popović]] two weeks later who served out the remainder of Ranković's four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odluka o proglašenju ustava Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|newspaper=Službeni list Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|location=Belgrade|pages=261–292|volume=XIX|issue=14|date=10 April 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1967 new amendments to the 1963 constitution were approved which disestablished the vice presidency once Ranković and Popović's combined four-year term was up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odluka o proglašenju ustavnih amandmana|newspaper=Službeni list Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|location=Belgrade|pages=485–486|volume=XXIII|issue=18|date=26 April 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office ceased to exist on 30 June 1967.

A '''watching brief''' is a method normally used in criminal [[Legal case|cases]] by [[lawyer]]s to represent clients not directly a party to the suit and to function as an observer. The method is normally used to help protect the rights and interests of victims of a crime, or also to protect a defendant from possible [[malicious prosecution]]. This method is used in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[Malaysia]]. Essentially, the lawyer must familiarize himself with the case at hand and understand the legal implication of every action or omission vis a vis his clients' interests.

In other countries like Kenya, the lawyer watching brief has to work hand in hand with the prosecutor to ensure that the Police file is availed in court at the hearing and witnesses bonded to attend court. Whereas he is not strictly performing the duty of the police, the advocate watching brief plays a crucial role in ensuring that the evidence presented to court is sufficient to secure a conviction for the offender thus preventing his client from civil suits for malicious prosecution arising from an acquittal.

To familiarize oneself with the matter, it is absolutely necessary that the lawyer obtains all witness statements and documents to be relied on and peruses them carefully. Should there be a loophole in the evidence, he should raise it with the prosecution for redress. To achieve this, it is imperative that the lawyer develops a cordial relationship with the prosecutor so that the information flowing to him (prosecutor) will appear as persuasive suggestions as opposed to orders which are more often likely to be ignored since the lawyer has no control over the prosecutor in his line of duty. Further, in Kenya, apart from introducing himself, the lawyer watching brief has no right of audience before the court and so the prosecutor becomes his mouthpiece.

In other words, being retained to watch brief should never be one passive, boring duty but one that should interest every lawyer interested in criminal jurisprudence. It is actually calling to account every party in the trial without being heard-working behind the scenes-and giving the much needed backup to the side enforcing your client’s rights.

'''Wiam Wahhab''' ({{lang-ar|وئام وهاب}}) (born October 11 1964) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] politician. He is a [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] from [[Jahlieh]], [[Chouf District]].

A journalist, and former political advisor to Lebanese [[Prince Talal Arslan]] between 1991 and 2000, he ran unsuccessfully in the legislative elections of 1996.

He was appointed as minister of the environment in the government of [[Omar Karami]] (October 2004 to February 2005), during the period when Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] was assassinated.

In 2006 Wahhab founded the [[Tayyar Al-Tawhid|Arab Tawhid party]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110415003536/http://www.dailystar.com.lb:80/Apr/12/Beirutis-voice-mixed-reactions-over-French-niqab-ban.ashx ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was involved in various feuds and fights against the [[Druze]] who support the Progressive Socialist Party of [[Walid Jumblatt]].

Wiam Wahhab is part of the [[March 8 Alliance]] who also includes the [[Hezbollah]], the [[Amal Movement]] and the [[Free Patriotic Movement]], who is opposed to the policies of the [[March 14 Alliance]] and is aligned with the Syrian regional policies.

Wahhab has espoused Arab nationalist viewpoints, is extremely pro-Syrian, and is known for aggressive media attacks on [[March 14 Alliance]] policies and personalities.

==Controversy==
In a television interview during the World Cup, he said he supported Brazil for their soccer, but Germany politically "because they hate the Jews and they burned them". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqsDkMo9TNo |title=Arab antisemitism compilation presented to the UN Part 2/2 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a television interview, Wahhab made disparaging comments about the [[Niqab]] which Saudi women wear, and about the Saudi government, blasting the March 14 alliance of [[Saad Hariri]] for his backing from Saudi Arabia, noting Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses such as amputations and forcing women to wear the niqab, and criticizing [[Wahhabism]], and Saudi Arabia's alliance with the United States.

This led allies of Wahhab to distance themselves from his comments. Sunni Muslim protesters yelled "There is no God but Allah", and "Wiam, you pig: you should be chained down". An [[Islamist]] organization offered $3,500 to any person who beheaded Wahhab due to his comments on the niqab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iloubnan.info/politics/actualite/id/58120] {{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wahhab was forced to apologize to Saudi women for the niqab remarks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110319092202/http://www.alarabiya.net:80/articles/2011/03/16/141770.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

Wahhab has called on Egyptian protestors to destroy the Israeli embassy.

Wahhab commented on Turkey's warnings to Syria during the 2011 uprising by claiming that Syria and [[Bashar Al Assad]] were prepared to launch 100,000 rockets at Turkey if it tried to invade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=313741 |title=Wahhab slams Mikati, praises Rai’s positions |website=Nowlebanon.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Dunya/2011/10/06/lubnanli-bakan-esatin-turkiye-planini-anlatti |title=Lübnanlı bakan Esat'ın Türkiye planını anlattı - Dünya Haberleri |website=Sabah.com.tr |date=2011-10-06 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
