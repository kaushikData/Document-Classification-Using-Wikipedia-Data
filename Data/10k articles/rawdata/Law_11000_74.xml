The '''adversarial system''' or '''adversary system''' is a legal system used in the [[common law]] countries where two advocates represent their parties' case or position before an impartial person or group of people, usually a [[jury]] or [[judge]], who attempt to determine the truth and pass judgment accordingly.&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sandra Beatriz|title= The Discourse of Court Interpreting: Discourse Practices of the Law, the Witness and the Interpreter |publisher=John Benjamins|date=July 2004|page=31|isbn=978-1-58811-517-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVwg_sQ5a5UC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22adversarial+system%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Edward P. |author2=Katharine C.

The adversarial system is the two-sided structure under which [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] courts operate that puts the prosecution against the defense.

==History==
Some writers trace the process to the medieval mode of [[trial by combat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.com/ |title=Maintaining the adversarial system: The practice of allowing jurors to question witnesses during trial |author=Kirsten DeBarba |year=2002 |work= |page=55 no. 5 (October 1): 1521–1548 |publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review |accessdate=August 15, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070815103709/http://www.proquest.com/| archivedate= 15 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Strick, ''Injustice for All'' (New York: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1977): 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. The use of the [[jury]] in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system and provides the opportunity for both sides to argue their point of view.

==Basic features==
As an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, they may not be questioned by a prosecutor or judge unless they choose to do so. However, should they decide to testify, they are subject to [[cross-examination]] and could be found guilty of [[perjury]]. As the election to maintain an accused person's [[right to silence]] prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.

By contrast, while [[defendant]]s in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition. However, this is mainly because it is not the prosecutor but the judges who question the defendant. The concept of "cross"-examination is entirely due to adversarial structure of the common law.

Judges in an adversarial system are impartial in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision, rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&amp;mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.

The [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.

All evidence must be relevant and not [[hearsay]] evidence.

Peter Murphy in his ''Practical Guide to Evidence'' recounts an instructive example. A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.

The name "adversarial system" may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.

The [[right to counsel]] in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in 1836 that England gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the [[Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836]]), although in practice English courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. During the second half of the 18th century advocates like [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] and [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]] helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law countries today. In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and in state cases at least since the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=CRS/LII Annotated Constitution Sixth Amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1963 that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.

One of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime; an obviously false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.

In some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defense. In England the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in England and Wales (it was already possible in Scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. The criticism reflects the idea that if the accused can be inferred to be guilty by exercising their right to silence, it no longer confers the protection intended by such a right. In the United States, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.

Lord Devlin in ''The Judge'' said: "It can also be argued that two prejudiced searchers starting from opposite ends of the field will between them be less likely to miss anything than the impartial searcher starting at the middle."&lt;ref&gt;P Devlin, ''The Judge'' (Oxford University Press, 1970) 60-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach==
There are many differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.

Proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.

In addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges.

Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the United States, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. Plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. Many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the United States, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12416">An '''agency cost''' is an [[Economics|economic]] concept concerning the fee to a "[[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]" (an organization, person or group of persons), when the principal chooses or hires an "[[Agent (economics)|agent]]" to act on its behalf. Because the two parties have different interests and the agent has [[information asymmetry|more information]], the principal cannot directly ensure that its agent is always acting in its (the principal's) best interests.&lt;ref name=Bebchuk&gt;''Pay Without Performance'' by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004 ([http://www.pay-without-performance.com/Preface%20and%20Introduction.pdf preface and introduction])&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of this cost include that borne by [[shareholder]]s (the principal), when [[Corporate management#Top-level managers|corporate management]] (the agent) buys other companies to expand its power, or spends money on wasteful pet projects, instead of maximizing the value of the corporation's worth; or by the voters of a politician's district (the principal) when the politician (the agent) passes legislation helpful to large contributors to their campaign rather than the  voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencycosts.asp#ixzz1zbYtzjNh Investopedia explains 'Agency Costs']&lt;/ref&gt;  Though effects of agency cost are present in any agency relationship, the term is most used in business contexts.

==Sources of the costs==

The costs consist of two main sources:

# The costs inherently associated with using an agent (e.g., the risk that agents will use organizational resource for their own benefit) and
# The costs of techniques used to mitigate the problems associated with using an agent—gathering more information on what the agent is doing (e.g., the costs of producing [[financial statements]]) or employing mechanisms to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal (e.g. compensating executives with equity payment such as [[stock option]]s).

==In corporate governance==

The information asymmetry that exists between shareholders and the [[Chief Executive Officer]] is generally considered to be a classic example of a [[principal–agent problem]]. The agent (the manager) is working on behalf of the principal (the shareholders), who does not observe the actions, or many of the actions, or is not aware of the repercussions of many of the actions of the agent. Most importantly, even if there was no asymmetric information, the design of the manager's contract would be crucial in order to maintain the relationship between their actions and the interests of shareholders.

Information asymmetry contributes to [[moral hazard]] and [[adverse selection]] problems.

Agency costs mainly arise due to contracting costs and the divergence of control, separation of ownership and control and the different objectives (rather than shareholder maximization) the managers.

Professor [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] of the [[Harvard Business School]] and the late Professor William Meckling of the [[Simon School of Business]], [[University of Rochester]] wrote an influential paper in 1976 titled "Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure".&lt;ref&gt;

There are various actors in the field and various objectives that can incur costly correctional behaviour. The various actors are mentioned and their objectives are given below.

===Management===
The classic case of corporate agency cost is the professional manager—specifically the CEO—with only a small stake in ownership, having interests differing from those of firm's owners.

Instead of making the company more efficient and profitable, the CEO may be tempted into: 
*[[empire-building]] (i.e. increasing the size of ''the corporation'', rather than the size of its profits,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p_JmAsp9-FsC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22shareholder+value%22+empire-building&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0FfjT5fkLaWO2QXw8u3mCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shareholder%20value%22%20empire-building&amp;f=false The Art of Capital Restructuring: Creating Shareholder Value Through Mergers ...  By H. Kent Bake, p.60-1]&lt;/ref&gt; "which usually increases the executives' prestige, perks, compensation", etc., but at the expense of the efficiency and thus value of the firm); 
*not firing subordinates whose mediocrity or even incompetence may be outweighed by their value as friends and colleagues;&lt;ref&gt;Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.16&lt;/ref&gt;  
*retaining large amounts of cash that, while wasteful, gives independence from capital markets;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMAMEETINGS/EFMA%20ANNUAL%20MEETINGS/2010-Aarhus/EFMA2010_0126_fullpaper.pdf What Drives Corporate Excess Cash? Evidence from a Structural Estimation?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809192120/http://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMAMEETINGS/EFMA%20ANNUAL%20MEETINGS/2010-Aarhus/EFMA2010_0126_fullpaper.pdf |date=August 9, 2013 }} Hamed Mahmudiy, Michael Pavlin, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and of course 
*a maximum of compensation with a minimum of "strings"—in the form of pressure to perform—attached.&lt;ref name=15-17&gt;''Pay Without Performance - the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation'' by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004, 15-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Venturing onto fraud, management may even manipulate financial figures to optimize bonuses and stock-price-related options.

===Concentrated Shareholders===
In jurisdictions outside the US and UK, a distinct form of agency costs arises from the existence of dominant shareholders within public corporations (Rojas, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Rojas
 |first=Claudio R.

 |journal=University of British Columbia Law Review
 |volume=47
 |issue=1
 |pages=59–128
 |ssrn=2391775
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bondholders===
Bondholders typically value a risk-averse strategy since they do not benefit from higher profits. Stockholders on the other hand have an interest in taking on more risk. If a risky project succeeds shareholders will get all of the profits themselves, whereas if the projects fail the risk maybe shared with the bondholder (although the bondholder has a higher priority for repayment in case of issuer bankruptcy than a shareholder&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ally.com/do-it-right/investing/stock-basics-an-investors-guide/ Stock Basics: An Investor's Guide] Ally.com&lt;/ref&gt;).

Because bondholders know this, they often have costly and large ex-ante contracts in place prohibiting the management from taking on very risky projects that might arise, or they will simply raise the interest rate demanded, increasing the cost of capital for the company.

===Board of directors===
In the literature, the board of directors is typically viewed as comprising both the management and the shareholders and in some cases, the management could also be part of the shareholders.

===Labour===
Labour is sometimes aligned with stockholders and sometimes with management. They too share the same risk-averse strategy, since they cannot diversify their labour whereas the stockholders can diversify their stake in the equity. Risk averse projects reduce the risk of bankruptcy and in turn reduce the chances of job-loss. On the other hand, if the CEO is clearly underperforming then the company is in threat of a hostile takeover which is sometimes associated with job-loss. They are therefore likely to give the CEO considerable leeway in taking risk averse projects, but if the manager is clearly underperforming, they will likely signal that to the stockholders.

===Other stakeholders===
Other stakeholders such as the government, suppliers and customers all have their specific interests to look after and that might incur additional costs. Agency costs in the government may include the likes of government wasting taxpayers money to suit their own interest, which may conflict with the general tax-paying public who may want it used elsewhere on things such as health care and education. The literature however mainly focuses on the above categories of agency costs.

==In agricultural contracts==
While complete contract theory is useful  for explaining the terms of agricultural contracts, such as the sharing percentages in tenancy contracts ([[Steven N. S. Cheung]], 1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transaction Costs, Risk Aversion, and the Choice of Contractual Arrangements|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Economics.|year=1969|first=Steven N S|last=Cheung|volume=12|issue=1|pages=23–42|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jlecono12&amp;div=6&amp;id=&amp;page=|format=|accessdate=2009-06-14|doi=10.1086/466658}}&lt;/ref&gt; agency costs are typically needed to explain their forms.  For example, piece rates are preferred for labor tasks where quality is readily observable, e.g. sharpened sugar cane stalks ready for planting. Where effort quality is difficult to observe, e.g. the uniformity of broadcast seeds or fertilizer, wage rates tend to be used. Allen and Lueck (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Douglas W. | first2=Dean |last2=Lueck | title = The Nature of the Farm: Contracts, Risk, and Organization in Agriculture | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2004 | page=258 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2-BwHyuU3QC&amp;dq=nature+of+the+farm&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn=978-0-262-51185-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that farm organization is strongly influenced by diversity in the form of moral hazard such that crop and household characteristics explain the nature of the farm, even the lack of risk aversion. Roumasset (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The nature of the agricultural firm |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date=March 1995|first=James|last=Roumasset|volume=26|issue=2|pages=161–177 |doi= 10.1016/0167-2681(94)00007-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V8F-3YF4GM7-9/2/a0ac95be32fd3bcf2328913d7b426c91|format=|accessdate=2009-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; finds that warranted intensification (e.g. due to land quality) jointly determines optimal specialization on the farm, along with the agency costs of alternative agricultural firms. Where warranted specialization is low, peasant farmers relying on household labor predominate.  In high value-per-hectare agriculture, however, there is extensive horizontal specialization by task and vertical specialization between owner, supervisory personnel and workers. These agency theories of farm organization and agricultural allow for multiple shirking possibilities, in contrast to the principal-agency version of sharecropping and agricultural contracts ([[Stiglitz]], 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Incentives and Risk Sharing in Sharecropping|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|year=1974|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|volume=41|issue=2|pages=219–255 |jstor=2296714|doi=10.2307/2296714|publisher=The Review of Economic Studies Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Principal And Agent|journal=Princeton, Woodrow Wilson School - Discussion Paper|year=1988|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|volume=|issue=12|pages=|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/priwdp/12.html|accessdate=2009-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sharecropping|journal=Princeton, Woodrow Wilson School - Discussion Paper |year=1988|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|volume=|issue=11|pages=|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/priwdp/11.html|accessdate=2009-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which trades-off labor shirking vs. risk-bearing.

'''Annual leave''' is [[paid time off]] work granted by [[employer]]s to [[employee]]s to be used for whatever the employee wishes. Depending on the employer's policies, differing number of days may be offered, and the employee may be required to give a certain amount of advance notice, may have to coordinate with the employer to be sure that staffing is adequately covered during the employee's absence, and other requirements may have to be met. The vast majority of countries today mandate a minimum amount of paid annual leave by law, though the United States is a notable exception in mandating no minimum paid leave and treating it as a perk rather than a right.

Most countries around the world have [[labour law]]s that mandate employers give a certain number of paid time-off days per year to workers. Canada requires at least two weeks (and at least three weeks for most workers in [[Saskatchewan]]);{{sfn|Ray|Sanes|Schmitt|2013|p=10}} in the European Union the countries can set freely the minimum, but it has to be at least equivalent to 4 working weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/104/EC |journal=Official Journal of the European Communities |date=23 November 1993 |volume=L 307 |page=20 |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31993L0104&amp;from=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-time employment in Australia requires twenty annual leave days a year.{{sfn|Ray|Schmitt|2007|pp=1–3, 8}} US law does not require employers to grant any vacation or holidays, and about 25 per cent of all employees receive no paid vacation time or paid holidays.{{sfn|Ray|Schmitt|2007|p=1}}

According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the United States, the average paid holidays for full-time employees in small private establishments in 1996 was 7.6 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=15 June 1998 |title=Employee Benefits in Small Private Industry Establishments, 1996 |url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ebs.nws.htm |location=Washington |publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the US Armed Forces earn 30 vacation days a year, not including national holidays.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Although the law does not mandate vacation time, many employers nonetheless offer paid vacation, typically around 10 work days in the private sector,{{sfn|Ray|Sanes|Schmitt|2013|p=1}} to attract employees. Under US federal law, employers usually must compensate terminated employees for accrued but unused vacation time. Additionally, many American employers provide paid days off for national holidays, such as [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Memorial Day]], [[Labor Day]], and [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

Some countries, such as [[Denmark]] and [[Italy]], or particular companies may mandate summer holidays in specific periods.

[[Argentina]] has different labour laws, for public employment and private employment. Public employees, have between a minimum of 21 days paid to 45 days paid for vacations (including holidays and weekends). Private employees have since 14 paid days to 28 paid days (including holidays and weekends). In both cases is always relying on the years of service. The more years the worker has the more days of paid vacation they will have.

===Consecutive holidays===
Consecutive holidays refers to holidays that occur in a group without [[working day]]s in between. In the late 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese government passed a law that increased the likelihood of consecutive holidays by moving holidays from fixed days to a relative position in a month, such as the second Monday.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8085">[[File:Portada de la Constitucion de 1826.jpg|thumb|Argentine Constitution of 1826]]
The '''Argentine Constitution of 1826''' was a short-lived [[Constitution of Argentina]] drafted during the [[Argentine Civil Wars]]. [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] was appointed [[President of Argentina]] under this constitution. It was rejected by most Argentine provinces, and then abolished.

==Context==
The [[Argentine War of Independence]], which began in 1810, was soon followed by the [[Argentine Civil Wars]], as the provinces had conflictive views over the national organization. The [[Federales (Argentina)|federals]] supported the autonomy of the provinces, and the [[Unitarian party]] supported a political centralization of the country in Buenos Aires. The [[Argentine Constitution of 1819]], drafted by the [[Congress of Tucumán]], was highly centralist. It was abolished in 1820 after the federal victory at the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|battle of Cepeda]]. The office of the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]], the head of state at the time, was abolished as well. The provinces stayed united as a country by the [[Treaty of Pilar]], but without any constitution or head of state for the time being. This period is known as the "anarchy of the year XX".&lt;ref&gt;Furundarena, pp. 221-228&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Benegas]] between Buenos Aires and Santa Fe included an agreement to call for a new Constituent Assembly, which would work at the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]]. The treaty did not mention the political system, which would be discussed at the assembly, nor the reaction to the [[Luso-Brazilian invasion of the Banda Oriental]]. The assembly was attended by representatives of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and San Luis. However, the legal complaints of the representatives of Buenos Aires did not allow the Assembly to begin its work. The assembly was closed shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Furundarena, pp. 231-239&lt;/ref&gt;

Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Corrientes signed the [[Quadrilateral Treaty]], to call a new Constituent Assembly, this time in Buenos Aires. Again, it did not specify the political system. The new assembly was convened in Buenos Aires on February 27. As the number of representatives was proportional to the population, Buenos Aires had the highest number. Twelve of the thirteen provinces accepted to hold the Congress in Buenos Aires; San Luis proposed Tucumán.&lt;ref&gt;Furundarena, pp. 239-263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deliberations==
The Assembly began the deliberations on December 1824. [[Manuel Antonio Castro]] and [[Narciso Laprida]] were the president and vicepresident of it. The assembly first drafted a "Fundamental law", that confirmed it as a [[constituent assembly]] and temporarily appointed the [[governor of Buenos Aires Province]] as the [[head of state]] of the country, until the formal creation of one. The provinces ratified that they would be part of a same country, and would retain their local institutions until the sanction of new ones. To avoid the resistances caused by the 1819 constitution, the 7º article clarified that the new constitution would not come into force until it was accepted by the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, pp. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly approved a treaty of friendship with Britain in 1825, with the British recognition to the 1816 Argentine declaration of independence. It also allowed [[British subject]]s to keep their religion, and to build their own churches and cemeteries. The treaty also ended the commerce of slaves. The Congress accepted as well the declaration of independence of the provinces of the [[Upper Peru]], which became a new country, named [[Bolivia]] after the liberator [[Simón Bolívar]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luso-Brazilian invasion was resisted by the local population of the Banda Oriental, and the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] began a rebellion against the Brazilian forces. They called the [[Congress of La Florida]], rejecting the Brazilian annexation and requesting the reincorporation into the United Provinces. The request was accepted in the Assembly with the unanimous votes of the Argentine provinces. The government of Buenos Aires informed the Brazilian emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] of this resolution, and that the national armies would only react in self-defense. The emperor then [[Argentine-Brazilian War|declared war]] on the United Provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the war, the Assembly took several related resolutions, aiming to strength the military and centralize the power. It began with the legal organization of the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], the national wealth and a national bank. The assembly changed as well the number of people represented by the representatives, from 15,000 to 7,500. This allowed each province to duplicate their number of representatives. However, several representatives were not from the provinces that they represented: [[Manuel Dorrego]] and [[Manuel Moreno]], both from Buenos Aires, represented Santiago del Estero and the Banda Oriental, thanks to the increased numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juan Gregorio de las Heras]] resigned as governor of Buenos Aires, so [[Elías Bedoya]], representative of Córdoba, proposed a law to create a stable head of state figure, the [[President of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]]. This proposal was opposed by Manuel Moreno, who considered that the definitive head of state should only be appointed once the constitution was finished and clearly outlined duration, attributions and system of election; in the meantime the head of state should still be provisory. However, his opinion was in the minority. The new law was sanctioned on February 6, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, pp. 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; The president was elected immediately: [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], with 35 votes. [[Carlos María de Alvear]], [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]] and [[Juan Antonio Álvarez de Arenales]] got a single vote each one.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Bautista Bustos]], governor of Córdoba, rejected the appointment of Rivadavia, and his province retired from the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivadavia proposed a bill to declare Buenos Aires the [[capital city]] of the country. This proposal was widely rejected, both by the other provinces and by the representatives of Buenos Aires. With this proposal, the [[Buenos Aires Province]] would cease to exist. The city, all things inside it (such as the port) and a territory around it would belong to the national government. The institutions of the Buenos Aires province would be abolished, and the remaining territory would be divided into two provinces. The law was approved, despite of the high resistance to it. Las heras resigned as governor, and the Buenos Aires legislature was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, pp. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly asked the provinces to select the type of government. The support to [[republicanism]] was absolute, nobody desired a monarchy; but the dispute of centralism or federalism was still divisive. Some provinces selected the federal organization and others the centralist organization; most members of the Assembly were centralists.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, pp. 59-62&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of American Law Schools''' ('''AALS'''), formed in 1900, is a [[non-profit organization]] of 179 [[law school]]s in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;"Member Schools." AALS Website http://www.aals.org/member-schools/. Retrieved 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; These member schools enroll and graduate most of the nation's lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;"History." AALS Website http://www.aals.org/about/history/. Retrieved 2015-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt; AALS incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization in 1971. Its headquarters are in Washington, D.C.

==Leadership==

The plenary legislative body of AALS is the House of Representatives, composed of one representative from each member school, selected by faculty from that school. A 10-member Executive Committee leads AALS. It is composed of the President, Immediate Past President and President-Elect, six other elected members and, ex officio, the AALS Executive Director. The Executive Committee has the responsibility for conducting the association's affairs in the interim between the annual meetings of the House of Representatives, which elects the officers and other Executive Committee members.

==AALS Annual Meeting==

The AALS Annual Meeting is a four-day gathering of law teachers, librarians, and administrators from law schools in the U.S. and other countries. Since the 1970s, the conference has taken place in early January, rotating its location among several large U.S. cities including New York City, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Programs at the conference explore professional development topics, legal issues, and administrative concerns. Legal educators use the conference to connect with their colleagues from other law schools and countries around matters of common interest.

==Other AALS Conferences==

AALS hosts a number of events throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;"Professional Development." AALS Website http://www.aals.org/about/professional-development/. Retrieved 2015-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual AALS Conference on Clinical Legal Education has become a mainstay of the association's activities with the 2015 conference having almost 700 clinicians in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum, AALS Activities Report, May 15, 2015. http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/council_reports_and_resolutions/June2015CouncilOpenSessionMaterials/2015_may_aals_report.authcheckdam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The conference's sessions focus on practice areas and common areas of concern for clinicians.

Every summer, AALS offers the New Law School Teachers Conference in Washington, D.C. This meeting provides professional development and networking opportunities to law faculty in their first few years of teaching, including clinical and legal writing teachers.

AALS periodically holds other meetings focused on professional development concerns. Recent topics have included torts, environmental law, constitutional law, intellectual property, family law, and business law.&lt;ref&gt;"Professional Development." AALS Website http://www.aals.org/about/professional-development/. Retrieved 2015-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty Recruitment Services==

Each year, AALS compiles the Faculty Appointments Register (FAR) from information submitted by candidates for entry-level, tenure-track law teaching jobs. Law school hiring teams review this information and invite candidates to screening interviews at the Faculty Recruitment Conference held each fall in Washington, D.C. Successful candidates are then invited to interview at the schools interested in hiring them.&lt;ref&gt;Chafee, Eric C. "From Law Practice to the Legal Academy: How to  Make the Leap." ''The Young Lawyer'' (December 2011, Vol. 16, No.3) http://www.americanbar.org/publications/young_lawyer/2011-12/december_2011/law_practice_legal_academy.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

AALS also publishes the Placement Bulletin which lists available faculty and administrative positions, as well as positions related to legal education outside of law schools. Individuals who are registered for the FAR may access the Placement Bulletin online; others can order the publication separately.&lt;ref&gt;"Faculty Recruitment Services." AALS Website http://www.aals.org/services/faculty-recruitment-services/. Retrieved 2015-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Activities and Publications== 
   
AALS disseminates news and information about law schools' innovations and acts as a voice for legal education to prospective law students, faculty, the media, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;"Communicating the Value of Legal Education" The AALS News, August 2015.   http://www.aals.org/about/publications/newsletters/aals-news-august-2015/the-value-of-legal-education/.&lt;/ref&gt; The association leadership is frequently called on to articulate issues in legal education, from the value of a law degree to what law schools are doing to support diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Statement on the Value of Legal Education. AALS. (http://www.aals.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Statement-on-the-Value-of-a-Legal-Education.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Law Schools Evolve to Meet Social, Economic Changes." ''Diverse: Issues in Legal Education'', January 2, 2014. http://diverseeducation.com/article/59857/&lt;/ref&gt; AALS engages with the media and the public on the latest changes and challenges facing the law academy and how law schools are responding.

The association's YouTube channel hosts content from member schools, select AALS Annual Meeting sessions, and other videos related to legal education.&lt;ref&gt;AALS YouTube page, http://www.aals.org/youtube.&lt;/ref&gt;

AALS publishes the AALS Directory of Law Teachers, the "desk book" of deans and law teachers. The directory lists by school the full-time faculty and professional staff of all AALS member and fee-paid law schools, and contains biographical sketches of 10,000 full-time teachers.

The ''Journal of Legal Education'', published by AALS since 1948, addresses issues confronting legal educators, including curriculum development, teaching methods, and scholarship. It serves as an outlet for emerging areas of scholarship and teaching. Currently, the journal is co-published by Northeastern University School of Law and University of Washington School of Law, with the schools providing editorial leadership and administrative support.

AALS also jointly sponsors the ''Clinical Law Review'', a semi-annual, peer-edited journal devoted to issues of lawyering theory and clinical legal education. The Review is edited, administered, and financially supported by New York University School of Law and jointly sponsored by the Clinical Legal Education Association (CLEA).

Four times a year, AALS publishes AALS News, a newsletter that keeps readers informed of AALS activities and topics of interest to the legal academy.

==Involvement in the Solomon Amendment==
The AALS requires its members to follow a nondiscrimination policy regarding "race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation," and for member law schools to require this of any employer to which it gives access for recruitment.

The [[United States Armed Forces]] "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT) policy was seen by the AALS as impermissible discrimination. However, the AALS excused its members from blocking access to the military since the passage of the [[Solomon Amendment]]s, which denies federal funding to the parent university of a law school as well as the school itself if military recruiters are not given full campus access. However, the AALS at the time required schools to take "ameliorative" measures when allowing military recruiters on campus, including placing "warning" signs on campus when military recruiting takes place, scheduling interviews off campus away from "core" areas, "prohibit[ing] entirely the delivery of discretionary support services" to military recruiters, charging military employers who use law school resources "reasonable fees for use of law school staff, facilities and services," etc.&lt;ref&gt;On-Campus Military Recruiting – Balancing AALS Rules, Other Nondiscrimination Policies and the Solomon II Amendment, December 15, 1998, {{cite web|url=http://home.pacbell.net/pkykwan/AALS/documents/Dec15Supp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040210212240/http://home.pacbell.net/pkykwan/AALS/documents/Dec15Supp.htm |archivedate=2004-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AALS at the time encouraged law schools to deny benefits to military recruiters that they would ordinarily provide employers, such as coffee and free parking. Specifically, the AALS wrote in a memo to all law school deans in the United States:

{{quote|The main point of this Report therefore is that reasonable access does not dictate equal access. Though schools should conduct themselves professionally regarding the military on this issue, the language of the law does not obligate schools to do anything else beyond providing reasonable access; within the bounds of professional conduct, reasonable access does not in the Section's view imply that schools are obligated to provide other free services or amenities (such as, perhaps, scheduling appointment times, collecting and transmitting resumes, free parking, endless supplies of coffee, snacks or lunches and the like). Beyond providing the "reasonable access" mentioned in the law, schools should avoid entanglement with military on-campus activities and devote their energies and resources to maximizing amelioration.&lt;ref&gt;AALS Section on Gay and Lesbian Legal Issues, September 15, 1998, {{cite web|url=http://home.pacbell.net/pkykwan/AALS/documents/Sept15Report.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017191450/http://home.pacbell.net/pkykwan/AALS/documents/Sept15Report.htm |archivedate=2003-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The AALS engaged in litigation challenging the Solomon Amendments as violative of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (see e.g., ''[[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.]]''). In an interesting coincidence, The [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General's]] School of the [[United States Army]] is a fee-paying nonmember of AALS.

Although DADT has been ended, and although President Barack Obama called upon college campuses to welcome military recruiters during his State of the Union Speech (1/25/11), some law professors have questioned why the AALS has issued no statement declaring an end to its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;DADT Repeal and On-Campus Military Recruiters, PrawfsBlawg, December 24, 2010, http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2010/12/dadt-repeal-and-on-campus-military-recruiters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Association of Christian Schools International v. Stearns''''' was filed in spring 2006 by [[Association of Christian Schools International]] against the [[University of California]] claiming religious discrimination over the rejection of five courses as college preparatory instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acsi-stearns/ruling0808.pdf |title=Association of Christian Schools International et al. v.

James Otero]] entered summary judgment against plaintiff ACSI, upholding the University of California's standards.&lt;ref name="North County Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/08/08/news/californian/murrieta/za3f1fe48ff6b8872882574a0000ff96d.txt |title=Judge throws out religious discrimination suit |publisher=[[North County Times]] |date=August 8, 2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815065757/http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/08/08/news/californian/murrieta/za3f1fe48ff6b8872882574a0000ff96d.txt |archivedate=August 15, 2008 |df= }}{{Citation broken|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
The suit filed in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] alleged that the university system's rejection of several courses, including a history course, a government course, and science courses, was "viewpoint discrimination" that violated the [[United States constitution|constitution]]al rights of applicants from Christian schools whose high school coursework is deemed inadequate preparation for college. The books in particular were published by [[A Beka Book]]s and [[Bob Jones University Press]]. They contained problems such as statements that where science and the Bible contradict, the student must choose the Bible, and judgment of the value of American historical figures on their religion. The UC board concluded that those books did not offer proper preparatory instruction for the university. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of six children who had not been rejected from the university, but were required to take additional, remedial courses. In August 2006, the case was allowed to proceed against the university while [[lawsuit]]s against individual school officials were thrown out.&lt;ref name=NCSE1&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2006/08/creationist-lawsuit-against-uc-system-to-proceed-00791 | title=Creationist lawsuit against UC system to proceed |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | date=August 10, 2006| first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association retained leading [[intelligent design]] proponent [[Michael Behe]] to testify in the case as an expert witness. Behe's expert witness report claimed that the Christian textbooks were excellent works for high school students and he defended that view in a deposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Behe|Behe, Michael J.]] (April 2, 2007) [http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007-04-02_Behe_expert_report.pdf Expert Witness report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627000000/http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007-04-02_Behe_expert_report.pdf |date=June 27, 2008 }} in Association of Christian Schools International et al. v.

==Decision==
{{Wikisource|Association of Christian Schools International v. Sterns}}

On March 28, 2008, the defendants won a legal victory when their motion for partial summary judgment was granted, and the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/interim-victory-in-california-creationism-case | title=Interim victory in California creationism case |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | date=April 1, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part of the judgment, the court focused on several creationist/intelligent design texts and quoted Behe's testimony against the plaintiffs:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acsi-stearns/msjruling_033108.pdf Association of Christian Schools International, et al. v. Sterns et al.: Order denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granting defendant's motion for partial summary judgment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416041845/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acsi-stearns/msjruling_033108.pdf |date=2008-04-16 }}, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. CV 05-6242 SJO (MANx); Case 2:05-cv-06242-SJO-MAN Document 164,  filed 28 March 2008.  Access date 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Plaintiff's evidence also supports Defendants' conclusion that these biology texts are inappropriate for use as the primary or sole text. Plaintiffs' own biology expert, Professor Michael Behe, testified that "it is personally abusive and pedagogically damaging to de facto require students to subscribe to an idea. . . . Requiring a student to, effectively, consent to an idea violates his personal integrity. Such a wrenching violation [may cause] a terrible educational outcome." (Behe Decl. Para. 59.)

Yet, the two Christian biology texts at issue commit this "wrenching violation." For example, [[Biology for Christian Schools]] declares on the very first page that:

#"'Whatever the Bible says is so; whatever man says may or may not be so,' is the only [position] a Christian can take. . . ."
#"If [scientific] conclusions contradict the Word of God, the conclusions are wrong, no matter how many scientific facts may appear to back them."
#"Christians must disregard [scientific hypotheses or theories] that contradict the Bible." (Phillips Decl. Ex. B, at xi.)}}

Biologist [[PZ Myers]] wrote, "The judge pointed out that the books that Behe approved flatly state that Christians must accept creationist conclusions—unlike our biology books, which don't demand any religious litmus test of their readers—and were therefore perfect examples of exactly the problem he was complaining about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/mike_behe_friend_to_evolution.php |title=Mike Behe, friend to evolution |publisher=[[Pharyngula (blog)]] |date=April 2, 2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405204411/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/mike_behe_friend_to_evolution.php |archivedate=April 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The August 2008 ruling concluded that various books offered by the school shouldn't be used for a college-preparatory history class because "it didn't encourage critical thinking skills and failed to cover 'major topics, themes and components' of U.S. history", Otero wrote. The judge said Calvary provided little admissible evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="North County Times" /&gt;

On January 26, 2009, ACSI filed an appeal on the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/04/whats-new-acsi-v-stearns-004756 | title=What's new in ACSI v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">'''Attachment''' is a legal process by which a [[court]] of law, at the request of a [[creditor]], designates specific property owned by the [[debtor]] to be transferred to the creditor, or sold for the benefit of the creditor.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; A wide variety of legal mechanisms are employed by debtors to prevent the attachment of their assets. For example, a declaration of [[bankruptcy]] will severely limit the ability of creditors to attach the property of the debtor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Many jurisdictions have a [[homestead exemption]] or other property exemptions which limit the ability of creditors to attach the debtor's primary residence, vehicle, and/or personal effects.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

==Prejudgment attachment==
'''Prejudgment attachment''' or [[Prejudgment writ of attachment]] allows recovery of money damages by levying a [[security interest]] on the property of the party paying money damages. A writ of attachment is filed to secure debt or claim of the creditor in the event that a judgment is rendered.&lt;ref name=Ohare&gt;{{ cite book | author1= John O'Hare|author2 = Kevin Browne| title=Civil Litigation | edition=12th | publisher=Thomson | location=London | year=2005 | isbn =  0-421-90690-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign attachment''' procedures have existed from time to time in [[Scottish law|Scotland]], where it was known as ''arrestment'', in [[French law|France]], where it was known as ''[[saisie arret]]'', in the [[Law of the United States|U.S]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=A Treatise upon the Customary Law of Foreign Attachment: And the Practice of the Mayor's Court of the City of London | url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=c400AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=foreign+attachment+brandon&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=KTUU8iJ2cC&amp;sig=t19XRCXk7f88kfdw0FZY4ZO4xvU | author=Brandon, W. | year=1861 | publisher=Butterworths | location=London | pages = 1–2}} ([[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prejudgment attachment in Chinese litigation proceeding''' can be obtained by the plaintiff before filing the case with court or arbitration commission in the case of emergency where failure to take immediate action will result in irreparable damage to relevant party. However, the party shall file its case with court or arbitration body within thirty days after the prejudgment attachment is granted by courts.

===Historical London procedure===
The person holding the property or owing the money had to be within the City at the time of being [[service of process|served]] with the process, but all persons were entitled to the benefit of the custom. The [[plaintiff]] having started the action, and made a satisfactory [[affidavit]] of his [[debt]], was entitled to issue attachment, which thereupon affected all the money or property of the [[defendant]] in the hands of the third party, the [[garnishee]]. The garnishee had all the defences which would be available to him against the defendant, his alleged creditor. If there had been no [[fraud]] or collusion, the garnishee could plead payment under the attachment. The court to which this process belonged was the [[Lord Mayor's Court]], the procedure of which was regulated by the [[Mayor's Court of London Procedure Act 1857]]. This custom, and all proceedings relating to it, were expressly exempted from the operation of the [[Debtor's Act 1869]].&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite wikisource |editor-first= Hugh |editor-last= Chisholm |chapter= Attachment |wslink= 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica |plaintitle= [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition= Eleventh |year= 1911 |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment of earnings==
{{main|Attachment of earnings}}
Attachment of earnings, also known as garnishment, is a process whereby the creditor attaches money owed to the debtor by the debtor's employer.

A husband and wife from New York went on a car trip with a friend Babcock to [[Ontario]]. While in Ontario they had a [[motor vehicle accident]]. Babcock sued Jackson, the driver, claiming his negligence caused the car crash. 

This case brought up a question of ‘choice of law’; if the law of the place of residence of the accident victims (New York) be applied, or, should the law of the place of the tort (Ontario) be applied. Under the old conflict rules, the law of the place of the accident should apply. However, Ontario had a law that prohibited passengers from suing the driver.

The court rejected a traditional fixed method of determining which law should apply, and instead, a process of weighing factors such as relationship between the party, decision to take the trip, connections to the locality. Thus, the Court held that the parties did not have substantial connection with Ontario and so it would be unfair to apply the law as the location was largely fortuitous. The Court found that the jurisdiction with the most connections was New York and so New York law should apply.

[[Bahá’u’lláh]], the prophet-founder of the [[Bahá’í Faith]], called for global agreement on human rights protection nearly eighty years before the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)]] in 1948. He taught that an “equal standard of human rights must be recognized and adopted.”&lt;ref&gt;Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace,  US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982 second edition, at 182.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bahá’u’lláh called for governments to protect the human rights of their populations and to ensure their welfare. To safeguard human rights, He urged global leaders to establish a world commonwealth that would include a system of collective security to protect populations against tyranny and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 3. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine basis for human rights==
The Bahá’í Writings make clear that human rights are not merely a political or social concept that is contingent on recognition by governments. Rather, the Bahá’í perspective is that human rights exist with or without governments; indeed, they are a divine endowment flowing from the creation of all human beings with the potential to reflect the attributes of God. All human beings have for this reason an equal spiritual dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, governments have a moral obligation to respect this divine endowment, an obligation that would exist even in the absence of treaties or customary legal norms obligating them to do so.  Bahá’u’lláh impressed upon rulers this sacred duty: “For is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind? God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 247.&lt;/ref&gt; These are divinely-ordained responsibilities that no government can legitimately shirk.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bahá’u’lláh also teaches that because of this equal spiritual dignity, all human beings are members of a single human family that should be unified. This means that all should treat one another as brothers and sisters, and in turn honor and respect the rights of all other human beings, not only as co-equals, but as spiritual relatives. He declares, “Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of this fundamental connectedness is a precondition, according to the Bahá’í teachings, for the full realization of human rights. Bahá’u’lláh asserts in this connection: “The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights will remain no more than a morally 
admirable concept so long as they are not anchored in such an appreciation for human unity. That unity provides the impetus, the motivation, the will, to uphold and defend the rights of others. And it implies that human rights are the concern of everyone, not just governments.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The earliest use of the terminology of human rights in publications by Bahá’í institutions coincided with the inception of their official relationship with the [[United Nations]]. Three of the first four documents submitted to the newly established international organization in 1947 and 1948 were statements on various aspects of human rights intended as contributions to the preparatory work on the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]. The first of these was an eight-page statement entitled “A Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bic.org/statements/bahai-declaration-human-obligations-and-rights.&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented to the Human Rights Commission&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrc.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt; in February 1947 on behalf of eight national Bahá’í administrative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Albert Lincoln, "Bahá’í-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights", at 7.http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Bahá'í International Community|Bahá’í International Community (BIC)]] explains that concern for human rights can be found throughout the Bahá’í Writings. [[Bahá’u’lláh]], urged the rulers of the earth to “rule with justice ... safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that “there shall be an equality of rights and prerogatives for all mankind.”&lt;ref&gt;Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace,  US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982 second edition, at 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoghi Effendi]], the authorized interpreter of Baha’u’llah’s teachings, states that:
“[t]he unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which .... the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples.”&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, The World Order Bahá’u’lláh, US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, at 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', the [[Universal House of Justice]] (the supreme governing institution of the Faith) underscores the importance of the UDHR and its related conventions, asserting that “all such measures, if courageously enforced and expanded, will advance the day when the specter of war will have lost its power to dominate international relations.”&lt;ref&gt;The Universal House of Justice, [[The Promise of World Peace]]. http://bahai.uga.edu/peace.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá’í views on human rights are based on the concept that every person is essentially a spiritual being endowed by the Creator with talents and capacities, and that the purpose of life is to realize that potential for the benefit of society as well as the individual concerned. The equal dignity of all human beings and the need for both solidarity and legal equality among them are clearly posited in many passages of the Bahá’í sacred scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Albert Lincoln, "Bahá’í-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights", at 7. http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are encapsulated in the concept of the “oneness of mankind”, which is described as the “pivot round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve”.&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, The World Order Bahá’u’lláh, US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, at 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations of contributions to human rights issues by the Bahá’í community==
The Bahá’í community plays an active role in enhancing a culture of human rights. Scores of statements on various aspects of human rights have been released since the presentation of “A Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights” in 1947. The Bahá’í community is dedicated to the integration of human rights in every aspect of global community life and favours education as the main approach to the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Bahá’í-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights", at 11. http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender equality===
Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the [[Bahá’í Faith]]. Baha’i belief states that [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|the equality of the sexes]] is a spiritual and moral standard that is essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of peace. The Bahá'í teachings note the importance of implementing the principle in individual, family, and community life. 
The [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] has released various statements on gender equality and particularly the role of women. In 1947, a statement entitled “Elimination of Discrimination Against women”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bic.org/statements/elimination-discrimination-against-women&lt;/ref&gt; was presented to the 25th session of [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] on the Status of Women. As part of the statement, the [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] emphasized that the Baha'i Writings stress the principle of equality of education for men and women, as well as that of compulsory universal education, and elaborate the responsibilities of parents and of Bahá’í institutions to ensure equal opportunities in the education of children. In fact it is stated that if parents are not able to educate both boy and girl, the girl should be given preference because she is the future mother and first educator of the child.

For the [[International Women's Year]] in 1975, the [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] released a pamphlet &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/documents/bic/equality-men-women-new-reality&lt;/ref&gt; entitled “Equality of Men and Woman: A New Reality” which stated that equality of the sexes is, for Bahá’ís, a spiritual and moral standard essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of world order. Without the qualities, talents, and skills of both women and men, full economic and social development of the planet becomes impossible. For "[t]he world of humanity is possessed of two wings — the male and the female. So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength the bird will not fly. Until womankind reaches the same degree as man, until she enjoys the same arena of activity, extraordinary attainment for humanity will not be realized; humanity cannot wing its way to heights of real attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Peace, Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Bahá’í World Centre, August 1985 at page 40. http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/CP/cp-39.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eradicating poverty and rethinking prosperity===
In a statement in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/documents/bic/eradicating-poverty.&lt;/ref&gt; entitled “Eradicating Poverty: Moving Forward as One”, the [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] offered two principles as guides for efforts in the realm of poverty eradication: justice and unity. They emphasised that these principles underlie a vision of development in which material progress serves as a vehicle for the moral and cultural advancement of humanity. Justice provides the means capable of harnessing human potential to eradicate poverty from our midst, through the implementation of laws, the adjustment of economic systems, the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, and unfailing adherence to the highest ethical standards in private and public life. Unity assures that progress is systemic and relational, that a concern for the integrity of the family unit and the local, national, and global community must guide poverty alleviation efforts.

Furthermore, in 2010 in their contribution to the 18th session of [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] on sustainable development, [[Bahá'í International Community|Bahá’í International Community (BIC)]] challenged the assumption that human beings are slaves to self-interest and consumerism. In the statement “Rethinking Prosperity: Forging Alternatives to a Culture of Consumerism”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/documents/bic/rethinking-prosperity&lt;/ref&gt; they state that the transition to [[sustainable consumption]] and production is part of a global enterprise which enables all individuals to fulfill their dual purpose, namely to develop their inherent potentialities and to contribute to the betterment of the wider community. It is not enough to conceive of sustainable consumption and production in terms of creating opportunities for those living in poverty to meet their basic needs. Rather, with the understanding that each individual has a contribution to make to the construction of a more just and peaceful social order, these processes must be arranged in a way that permits each to play his or her rightful role as a productive member of society. Within such a framework, sustainable consumption and production could be characterized as processes that provide for the material, social and spiritual needs of humanity across generations and enable all peoples to contribute to the ongoing advancement of society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">The '''Breed of Horses Act 1535 and the Horses Act 1540''' were pieces of legislation passed by the [[Parliament of England]] designed to improve the national stock of [[horse]]s through [[Horse breeding|equestrian eugenics]]. They were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1863]].

==Breed of Horses Act 1535==
The '''Breed of Horses Act 1535''' (''[[27 Henry VIII]], c. 6'') mentions a marked decay in the quality of the breed, the cause it is claimed that "''in most places of this Realme little horsis and naggis of small stature and valeu be suffered to depasture and also to covour marys and felys of very small stature''".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statute thus required each owner of enclosed [[deer]]-parks to possess a minimum of two [[mare (horse)|mare]]s whose height was to be above thirteen hands high in order for them to be bred with horses of no shorter than fourteen hands high.

==Horses Act 1540==
The '''Horses Act 1540''' (''[[32 Henry VIII]], c.13'') ordered that no stallion under 15 hands (60 inches, 152&amp;nbsp;cm) and no mare under 13 hands (52 inches, 132&amp;nbsp;cm) was permitted to run out on common land, or to run wild, and no two-year-old colt under 11.2 hands (46 inches, 117&amp;nbsp;cm) was allowed to run out in any area with mares. Annual round-ups of the commons were enforced, and any stallion under the height limit was ordered to be destroyed, along with "all unlikely tits whether mares or foals."&lt;ref name=Wortley541-2&gt;{{harvnb|Wortley|2008|pp=541–542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement for swingeing culls of "under-height" horses was partially repealed by a statute of Queen Elizabeth I in 1566 (''[[8 Elizabeth I]], c.8'') on the basis that the poor lands could not support the weight of the horses desired by Henry VIII because of "their rottenness ... they are not able to breed beare and bring forth such great breeds of stoned horses as by the statute of 32 Henry VIII is expressed, without peril of miring and perishing of them", and thus many ponies of Britain's mountain and moorland pony breeds in their native environments escaped the slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5811">'''Car donation''' is the practice of giving away no-longer-wanted [[automobile]]s or other vehicles to [[charitable organization]]s.  In the United States, these donations can provide a [[tax]] benefit.

==In the United States==
Some critics have claimed that car donations are essentially a [[tax shelter]].  However, non-profit organizations in the US have come to rely increasingly upon the revenue from car donations. This type of donation has become increasingly widespread; in 2000, 733,000 U.S. taxpayers reduced their taxes by $654 million.

===Tax considerations===
Although advertised as an easy way to dispose of an old car, donors need to fulfill certain post-donation requirements to qualify for the tax deduction,&lt;ref name="IRS4303"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4303.pdf Internal Revenue Service Publication 4303, A Donor's Guide to Vehicle Donations]&lt;/ref&gt; such as obtaining a written acknowledgment of the car's subsequent sale by the charity,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and [[itemized deduction|itemizing]] tax returns instead of taking the [[standard deduction]].

For vehicles valued at less than [[U.S. dollar|$]]500, the deduction amount comes from the donor's own estimate of the car's value, even if the charity receives less money from its sale.  Deductions greater than [[U.S. dollar|$]]500 are limited to the proceeds of selling the vehicle, usually at [[auction]].  The U.S Internal Revenue Service advises that starting in 2005:

{{quote|The rules for determining the amount that a donor may deduct for a charitable contribution of a qualified vehicle, including an automobile, with a claimed value of more than $500 changed at the beginning of 2005 as a result of the  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In general, that Act limits a donor's deduction to the amount of the gross proceeds from the charity's sale of the vehicle.

For vehicles valued at over $500, taxpayers are required to attach the charity's written acknowledgment to their tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/Help-&amp;-Resources/Tools-&amp;-FAQs/FAQs-for-Individuals/Frequently-Asked-Tax-Questions-&amp;-Answers/Itemized-Deductions,-Standard-Deduction/Gifts-&amp;-Charitable-Contributions/Gifts-&amp;-Charitable-Contributions | title=Gifts &amp; Charitable Contributions | publisher=IRS | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==In the United Kingdom==
Car donation schemes in the UK are slightly different from those operating in the United States and only established themselves as a valued source of income for UK charities in January 2010, led by Giveacar – a non-profit organisation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/14/giveacar-scraps-sells-cars-for-charity&lt;/ref&gt; Operating as a non-profit organisation allows charities to avoid the large overheads created by profit-making car donation companies. In addition, whereas car donation in the US has been incentivised through tax breaks, in the UK there are no such tax benefits to donating your car.

==Practices==
Vehicle donations in America are operated in a wide variety of plans, ranging from highly organized and professional-grade not-for-profit, national, or local [[Charitable organization|charities]] to [[scrap yards]], [[hauler]]s, [[Tow-truck company|tow-truck companies]] and [[salvager]]s who establish programs that may support a charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cardonors.org/benefits-of-donating/ |title=Car Donation |publisher=CarDonors.org |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014007/http://cardonors.org/benefits-of-donating/ |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charity Navigator, the guidance of the rating agencies concerning car donation programs, where the charity receives a flat fee for the use of their name by a third party, versus program management by a third party,there are some questionable companies who contract to use a nonprofit's agencies name and logo to raise funds and then just give them a flat fee unrelated to income or performance. This is frowned upon by rating agencies and the government. However, a percentage return program is viewed positively if the nonprofit receives more than 50% of the generated income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=158|title=Guide To Donating Your Car|publisher=Charity Navigator|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that engage a third party, but with a "cost maximum cap" involved, such as with national charities like the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], performance in this area is exemplary, with 70-80% on average being returned to the nonprofit.

==Benefit to charities==
Many charities run donation programs which accept car donations, such as Goodwill, Salvation Army and even the American Cancer Society. Many charities will use your car donation directly to transport volunteers and supplies to areas that need help. Some even have their own car lots which sell the donated cars but many have their donations processed through auto auction companies. Many processing companies also collect and sell donated cars and distribute the money to a charity the donor indicates. The processing company typically takes a percentage of the sale value of the car,  but these programs allow charities without their own facilities or staff dedicated to fund raising to benefit from vehicle donation programs.

Ideally, donors should also investigate how much money from the sale of the car goes to the auction processor and how much actually benefits the charity's programs, as opposed to its administrative overhead.&lt;ref name="IRS4303" /&gt;

A '''climate-friendly school''' is a school that uses [[education for sustainable development]] (ESD) to promote a culture of sustainability in which students, staff and families hold shared values and beliefs about the importance of taking action for a more sustainable society. Taking care of the environment and contributing to reducing [[climate change]] is an integral part of this. [[Climate action]] means different things to different schools. Some schools see climate action as key to “doing their part” to take care of the planet. For other schools, it is about addressing issues directly affecting them. For example, several schools in disaster-prone [[Japan]] see climate action as a practical way of helping students and their families stay safe and prepare for the future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002467/246740e.pdf|title=Getting Climate-Ready: A Guide for Schools on Climate Action|last=Gibb|first=Natalie|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100193-2|location=|pages=5, 7–8, 10, 15, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whole-school approach to climate action ==
[[File:Figure 1 Whole school approach to climate change Getting Climate-Ready.svg|thumb|The whole-school approach to climate change]]
In a whole-school approach, students’ classroom learning about climate change is reinforced by the formal and informal messages promoted by the school’s values and actions. In other words, students and other members of the school community live what they learn, and learn what they live. The whole-school approach to climate change means that an educational institution includes action for reducing climate change in every aspect of school life. This includes school governance, teaching content and methodology, campus and facilities management as well as cooperation with partners and the broader communities. The active involvement of all internal and external school stakeholders, namely students, teachers, principals, school staff at all levels and the wider school community such as families and community members in reflecting and acting on climate change is key to a whole-school approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio, Athens, Greece ===
As an experimental school, the 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio is encouraged to introduce innovative programmes. In 2013, the school introduced complex systems into biology and chemistry courses for 157 senior secondary students. In the complex systems unit, students worked in groups to investigate climate change, virus transmission, and ecosystem dynamics with the help of computer simulations. Through their investigations, students discovered the properties of complex systems, such as positive and negative [[Feedback|feedback loops]]. They also had opportunities to apply their learning. For example, a group of students measured the energy sustainability of the school building, to find its weaknesses and construct an action plan to improve it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Al-Kawthar Secondary School, Beirut, Lebanon ===
Al-Kawthar Secondary School works to raise awareness of climate change within their school. So far, 2,421 students, 310 teachers, and 110 families have been involved in projects including [[Tree planting|tree-planting]], making handicrafts from recycled materials, visiting national forests, recycling, and conserving water. The school also hosted film nights and workshops where students, families and teachers suggested ways to save the planet. Following the ISO-26000 guidelines for socially responsible institutions, the school has committed to a continuous process of improvement. At the beginning of the school year, the environmental committee develops an action plan based on what was learned and achieved the previous year. The committee keeps a record of their activities, so the school can identify high-impact activities and activities that could be scaled up. Teachers and students deepen their learning by sharing their experiences with other schools in [[Lebanon]] and around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ASPnet Schools, Côte d’Ivoire ===
In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], one of the most widespread uses of forest resources is in [[traditional medicine]] which is of vital importance with regard to primary health care and contributes to preserving traditional knowledge and cultural heritage. Realizing that the biodiversity of their forests is under threat, the [[UNESCO ASPNet|ASPnet]] schools, together with university researchers and medical practitioners, united their forces to come to the rescue of the forest resources in Côte d'Ivoire. The schools promote botanical gardens where parents as well as traditional medicine practitioners teach students how to conserve and manage forest resources in a more sustainable way. Through the study visits in the botanical garden, students acquire traditional knowledge of medicinal plant cultivation which will enable them to identify, protect, preserve and promote the medicinal plants which have tremendous ecological and cultural importance in Côte d'Ivoire. In collaboration with the experts and researchers, the ASPnet schools are now considering creating a genebank as well as replanting endangered species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ===
Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen's environment team has invited janitors, teachers, students, engineers and others to participate in experiential, non-formal learning activities. They created a [[green roof]], built [[Solar cooker|solar ovens]] and bamboo bicycle racks, planted spice, flower, and meditation gardens, and converted used cooking oil into [[biodiesel]]. These activities have created bonds between different members of the school community, awakened a sense of belonging and pride in the school, and built an environment where ideas and information are shared freely. The environment team has also offered trainings for school community members in order to secure buy-in for the projects. For example, training on waste sorting and cooking oil collection was offered to employees. Also, a gardening workshop was organized for student volunteers, so they could assist maintenance staff in caring for the expanding school gardens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endrupskolen School, Fredensborg, Denmark ===
Thanks to a partnership with a local non-profit organization, Endrupskolen School offers students inspiring and hands-on learning experiences. Eight times throughout the school year, students visit gardens, farms and kitchens run by the non-profit organization “Haver til Maver.” During each visit, classes meet experts such as farmers, cooks, biologists or gardeners who guide students in exploring plants, trees, vegetables, smells and tastes. According to Endrupskolen teachers, these visits have given students the skills and commitment needed to build better food futures for themselves, their families and society as a whole. In addition, learning outside the traditional classroom has helped students develop better relationships with their peers and a better sense of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nagoya International School, Nagoya, Japan ===
The [[Nagoya International School]] is committed to developing a school culture of sustainability, as expressed in their school mission statement. The institution aims to “nurture in its students the capacity to objectively define what is truly needed in the global society, to take action on their own, and to become active agents for [[sustainable development]].”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14977">The '''Ad Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances''' was a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|truth commission]] created in 2003 to investigate about [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] people during a [[Algerian Civil War|civil]] [[Algerian Civil War|conflict]]. Its creation took place after the current president, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], was elected and after he set up a National Human Rights Institution. Then, the commission was linked in order to give people the truth about what happened in the 1990s. However, its report was not made public and consequently Algerians are not aware of their relatives' fate.

== Background ==
Since [[Algeria's independence from France|Algeria's independence]] in 1962, the army have played an important role in the political life of Algeria:&lt;ref name="Arnould"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnould|first=Valerie|date=2007-05-30|title=Amnesty, peace and reconciliation in Algeria|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14678800701333028|journal=Conflict, Security &amp; Development|volume=7|issue=2|pages=227–253|doi=10.1080/14678800701333028|issn=1467-8802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was often sardonically remarked by Algerians that while every state has an army, in Algeria the army had a state."&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Military forces had fought against French rule for independence, then an authoritarian regime was put in place in 1962.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; It was led by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] who worked with the army.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; Until President [[Houari Boumédiène]]'s death in 1978, the military forces had been under control.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; Then, they came to power and chose "'their" man as President, leaving to the FLN the sole task of running the administration".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Washington-Brown|first=Linda Joyce|date=2002-09|title=A Message From the FLN President: Join Us and Bring A Friend|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00006223-200209000-00014|journal=Nurse Educator|volume=27|issue=5|pages=241|doi=10.1097/00006223-200209000-00014|issn=0363-3624}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[Chadli Bendjedid]] was elected president. In 1991, seeing that the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), an Islamic party, was about to win the next election, the army officially took power, leaving no place to political parties and cancelled the future election. President Chadli Bendjedid dissolved the [[People's National Assembly]] and resigned. 

This marked the beginning of the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]]. A temporary government, the [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]], was put in place, initially led by  [[Mohamed Boudiaf]]. But he was assassinated six months later and left his place to [[Ali Kafi]]. Kafi was  in power until the dissolution of the High Council of State and was succeeded by [[Liamine Zéroual]]. During this period, extremist militias such like [[Groupe Islamique Arme|Groupe Islamique Armé]] rose&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristianasen|first=Wendy|date=2006|title=Truth &amp; Justice after a Brutal Civil War: Algeria: The Women Speak|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4007174|journal=Review of African Political Economy|volume=33|issue=108|pages=346–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they disagreed with the decisions taken about the election. They started to show violence against police, [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|military]] and civilians, including terrorist attacks. Therefore, a state of emergency was declared. Islamic people began to disappear, to be killed and to be forced to move. Islamic people were chosen randomly. In other words, they could or could not be linked with any militias or act of violence. 

In 1999, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], who was close to [[Houari Boumédiène|Boumédiène]], was elected president and ended the war. Islamic groups agreed to lay down their weapons for Algeria to become at peace again. At the end of the conflict, more than 150,000&lt;ref name="IOP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usip.org/publications/2003/09/commission-inquiry-algeria|title=Commission of Inquiry: Algeria|website=United States Institute of Peace|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; deaths and 7,000 disappearances were registered.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt;

== Purpose of the inquiry commission ==
In 2003, President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] put in place a commission to investigate past crimes.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt; It was called “Ad Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances".&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt; It was made up of six commissioners, five men and one woman, all Algerian.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt; They were all chosen by the President. The aim of the commission was [[truth-seeking]], especially to know what happened to the disappeared people. It was also meant to plan and give [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] to the families of the victims.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt; However, it is said that the commission functioned more as "a ‘management centre' and interface between families of the disappeared and the Algerian public administration"&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; than a commission of investigation.

== Results of the commission ==

=== Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation ===
In 2005, the President called a referendum to approve the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]] (CPNR).&lt;ref name="flawed"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2005/10/06/a-flawed-charter|title=A flawed charter|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came out of a previous law enacted in 1999&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt; which "promoted peace and national reconciliation".&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; With this law, Islamist groups agreed to stop violence, expecting a peaceful state.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; The charter was approved in the referendum, with 96% in favour.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; In effect, Algerians accepted amnesty. However, the opposition maintained that the approval was "the result of the government's programme of propaganda".&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;

Therefore this charter aimed at peacemaking and granting amnesty to murderers and criminals.&lt;ref name="Channel"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kawakiby Channel|title=Processus de Justice Transitionnelle : Cherifa Khaddar (Algérie)|date=2015-10-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9kvcNKvRCs|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt; They all could to get through it unscathed, whether they were considered terrorists or not. There were exceptions for crimes like "massacres, rapes and bombings in public places."&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt; The word "terrorism" does not appear in this charter. The past events were qualified as a "national tragedy", a way for the government not to denounce and condemn their criminals but also to promote peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2017/08/DAUM/57773|title=Mémoire interdite en Algérie|date=2017-08-01|work=Le Monde diplomatique|access-date=2018-11-19|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Algerian government has considered reconciliation through forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;

The charter also stipulates that anyone who continues to speak about this period twill be imprisoned for a period from 3 to 5 years and have a fine to pay.&lt;ref name="Channel"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"In 2017, a law was adopted, it forbids to mention the "national tragedy" whether for analysis or reflective reason." said Karima Dirèche, a franco-algerian historian.&lt;ref name="consequences"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Even journalists, foreign or not, can have trouble if they try to investigate and know what happened and what is being done to improve the situation. All of these measures emphasize a collective [[amnesia]]&lt;ref name="consequences"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rts.ch/info/monde/9288390-les-consequences-de-l-amnesie-forcee-apres-la-decennie-noire-algerienne.html|title=Les conséquences de l'amnésie forcée après la "décennie noire" algérienne|work=rts.ch|access-date=2018-11-08|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Channel"/&gt;&amp;mdash;people are forced not to talk about it.

However, the charter also returned to past arrests. Indeed, people who had been accused of terrorism and punished could be given back their civil rights or their relatives could be compensated.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consequences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt;

=== Reparations ===
The charter specifies that reparations should be made to the victims.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt; Therefore, since 2006, the government has paid reparations of about $37 million USD. More than 2,000 families were paid, but only if they could provide a death certificate.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt; However, several families refused to acknowledge that their relatives were dead since no proof was given. 

The focus on reparations was similar to the [[Equity and Reconciliation Commission]] in [[Morocco]], where disappearances began under the rule of King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] after he assumed the throne in 1957.His son, King [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]], continued these policies. In the 1990s, under local and international pressure, he established an Advisory Council on Human Rights (CCDH) to investigate human rights violations and provide advice. In 2003, the CCDH asked for the creation of a truth commission to investigate violations in depth. The purpose of the commission was to provide recommendations, medical care and money compensations to the victims. However, the commission did not give any names and was limited in its investigations. It concluded that 742 disappeared people were dead. Several cases remain unsolved, with no answers.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt; Morocco began to offer reparations to victims.

== Report ==
The commission reported in 2005, but only the President had access to its report. Nevertheless, Chairman Farouk Ksentini declared that the state was held responsible for about 6,146 disappearances and deaths.&lt;ref name="IOP"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Cherida Khaddar reported that she had seen her brother and her sister die in front of her eyes.&lt;ref name="consequences"/&gt; She is the head of the [[non-governmental organization]] Djazairouna. She commemorates the victims of the civil war with other families on March 8 and tries and denounce the government but she often ends at the police station and is mistreated.&lt;ref name="consequences"/&gt;
Djazairouna is an association made to help victims of terrorism in Algeria. The victims can receive any type of help : clothes, food or money, from insofar as possible. Members of associations also tries to visit the victims who have been hospitalized. They also bring a psychological support and accompany them in all the steps they undertake, judicial or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.djazairouna.ranahna.dz/index.php?pg=6|title=:: Association Djazairouna ::|last=|first=|date=|website=www.djazairouna.ranahna.dz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bouteflika in promising peace to the Algerians, had 'ended the dreams of truth and justice for thousands of families of the disappeared'"&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is what Nacéra Dutour argued about the charter, illustrating the victims' state of mind. The victims and their family disagreed with the outcome of the Inquiry Commission and rejected the charter.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;

Dutour founded SOS Disparus, an association for the disappeared, chaired by her mother Fatima Yous.&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt; Before creating this organization, Dutour had worked with international groups in France.&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt; Her involvement in this crisis is due to the fact that her son had been arrested while fasting during Ramadan whereas he was not involved in politics and tried to become a taxi driver.&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt; Every Wednesday her association demonstrates in front of the Parliament to claim their rights.&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt; They called for an efficient commission which would denounce what had happened and condemn the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt; They wanted justice. As Cherifa Khaddar points out:&lt;blockquote&gt;“We want the courts to deal with those who ordered and those who carried out acts of violence, even if Mr Bouteflika later pardons them,”&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nacéra Dutour adds : &lt;blockquote&gt;"[a referendum could not] 'be the means by which a government evades its international obligations.'".&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the end, apart from monetary compensation, Algerian people have not obtained redress. As a consequence, a lot of families are stuck between two states of mind: remaining silent about what happened or denouncing it and taking the risk of being arrested and imprisoned.

Many Algerians continue to seek the truth about the disappeared even if no [[retributive justice]] takes place.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; On the other hand, prosecuting is a hard task since there is not enough evidence to prove someone's responsibility. Farouk Ksentini, the President of the National Consultative Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, stated that most information about disappearances come from the families, with very few witnesses.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; Moreover, with the report of the commission not being public, the issue is the "Algerian authorities' obstruction of any investigation, even non-judicial, into past atrocities."&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;

== Women's role in Algerian society ==
Women play a significant role in Algeria. Their place in Algerian society goes back to [[Algerian War]] for independence where they could be solicited to place bombs in the Europeans areas. Akila Ouared, who was an agent in [[Front de Libération National|Front de Libération National (FLN)]] during Algerian War reported: &lt;blockquote&gt;“We women were always there at the helm.”&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nowadays, as only men disappeared and were killed during the civil war, women have to take their position in society.&lt;ref name="Kristianasen"/&gt; This is the reason why women's groups have arisen, such as Djazairouna and SOS Disparus. 

== International involvement ==
During the [[Algerian Civil War]], no countries intervened because it was thought that the army was doing the right thing in order to prevent the rise of Islamic groups.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; Countries such like France or the United States were afraid of the impact of groups as [[Islamic Salvation Front]] on Western affairs: "the FIS would pose serious threats to the West's economic and security interests in the region".&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;

Nevertheless, in 2007 a conference called "Truth, Peace and Conciliation" was held.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt; The Algerians invited international experts to the conference, but they were refused visas or otherwise barred from entry.&lt;ref name="Arnould"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">A '''Commissioner of Bankruptcy''' (England and Wales) was, from 1571 to 1883, an official appointed (initially by [[commissioner|commission]] of the [[Lord Chancellor]]) to administer the estate of a [[bankrupt]] with full power to dispose of all his lands and tenements.&lt;ref&gt;W Blackstone, Comm. Laws Eng. II. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner of bankrupt. ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Bankrupts were defined as insolvent persons engaged in trade or business and kept distinct from other insolvents until 1861. The proceedings of that administration were the distribution of the property of an insolvent person to that person's creditors in proportion to the debts.

==History==
The first formal regulation of the distribution of the property of an insolvent person to that person's creditors was by the [[Statute of Bankrupts|Statute of Bankrupts 1542]]. Administration was delegated to certain members of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] and the chief justices of [[High Court of Justice|King's Bench]] and [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]].

==Commissioners of Bankrupts 1571–1883==

===1571–1831===
Under the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1485–1601#Public Acts|Bankrupts Act 1571]] administration was passed to ''commissioners of bankrupts'' appointed by and superintended by the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper. Their ''Office of the Commissioners of Bankrupts'' was attached to the [[Court of Chancery]].

===Court of Bankruptcy 1831–1883===
A separate Court of Bankruptcy was established in 1831 under the [[Bankruptcy Court (England) Act 1831]] to replace those commissioners. The court consisted of four judges and only six commissioners. A decade later district courts were established and any person could obtain protection from either of those courts if he or she vested all property in an [[Official Assignee|official assignee]]. In 1861 the Court of Bankruptcy was confined to London and was afterwards known as the London Court of Bankruptcy.

It was merged with the High Court by the [[Bankruptcy Act 1883]].

===Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors 1842–1861===
From 1842 under the [[Bankruptcy Act 1842]] persons not being a trader or being a trader and owing less than £300 could obtain the protection of the official assignee from this court in London or one of the district courts of bankruptcy. Jurisdiction of this court passed to the Court of Bankruptcy in [[Bankruptcy Act 1861|1861]].

==High Court of Justice in Bankruptcy 1883—==
The [[Bankruptcy Act 1883]] transferred jurisdiction to the High Court and County Courts.

The '''Concordat of 2008''' was an agreement between the [[Catholic Church]] and Brazil, signed in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in the presence of the President of Brazil, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luiz da Silva]] on 13 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=511IMQ009 Alberto Dines, “Acordo por debaixo dos panos”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021142939/http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=511IMQ009 |date=21 October 2009 }}, {{es icon}} (Agreement behind the scenes) Observatório da Imprensa, 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the clause on religious instruction that aroused the greatest controversy.&lt;ref name="Tarso" /&gt; Instead of non-sectarian religious education regulated by the educational authorities, which was laid down by the Education Act (LDB), Article 11 of the concordat permits the introduction into state schools of [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catholic catechism]] under the control of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=15311&amp;kb_header_id=37401], Translations of the relevant clauses from the Brazilian Education Act (LDB) and the Concordat&lt;/ref&gt; This encountered opposition because Brazil has a diverse religious landscape, which includes not only the major world religions, but also Afro-Brazilian ones like [[Candomblé]] and the indigenous religions of the Amazon rainforest. The Ministry of Education feared that introduction of sectarian religious instruction in state schools could jeopardize the Brazilian policy of religious inclusiveness.&lt;ref name="Tarso" /&gt;

The basic legal instrument governing copyright law in [[Bangladesh]] is the '''''Copyright Act, 2000'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/bangla_all_sections.php?id=846 কপিরাইট আইন, ২০০০] (Act No. XXVIII of 2000) – [http://www.clcbd.org/document/577.html English translation] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely based on Pakistan's [[Copyright law of Pakistan#Copyright Ordinance, 1962|''Copyright Ordinance, 1962'']].

== Copyright Act, 2000==

=== Objects of copyright ===

According to section 15 copyright subsists in
*literary works
*dramatic works
*musical works
*artistic works (''i.e.'' painting, sculpture, drawing, engraving or a photograph, a work of architecture and any other work of artistic craftsmanship)
*cinematographic films
*sound recordings
and includes computer programmes (cf. s. 14 sub-s. 2) as well as addresses and speeches (cf. s. 17 cl. d).

Foreign works are covered by section 69 read with the ''International Copyright Order, 2005''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpdt.gov.bd/Act_download/Copyright%20Rules%20English.pdf para. 3 with schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812163758/http://www.dpdt.gov.bd/Act_download/Copyright%20Rules%20English.pdf |date=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Owner of copyright ===

The first owner of copyright in general is  '''author''' (exceptions: [[Work for hire|works for hire]],&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [http://www.clcbd.org/lawdictionary/75.html ''Suraiya Rahman vs. Skill Development for Underprivileged Women''], 17 BLD ([[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|HCD]]) 284 = 49 (1997) DLR (HCD) 222&lt;/ref&gt; Government works; s. 17).
 
The owner of copyright may '''assign''' the copyright (s. 18) or grant any interest in the copyright by '''[[license]]''' (s. 48). Licenses may also be granted by the Copyright Board (ss. 50–54).

Registration of copyright with the Copyright Office is not obligatory, but if registration has taken place the Register of Copyrights gives ''prima facie'' evidence of the particulars entered therein (s. 60).

=== Term of copyright ===

Copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work published within the lifetime of the author subsists until '''60 years''' from the beginning of the calendar year next following the year in which the author dies (''[[Post mortem auctoris|p.m.a.]]''; s. 24).

Copyright in a cinematographic film (s. 26), a sound recording (s. 27), a photograph (s. 28), a computer programme (s. 28A) or a work of the Government, a local authority or an international organisation (ss. 30–32) subsists until 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year next following the publication of the work.

=== Meaning of copyright ===

Copyright means ''inter alia'' the exclusive right
*to reproduce the work
*to issue copies of the work to the public
*to perform or broadcast the work
*to make any translation or adaption of the work (for details see s. 14).

In addition, special [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] lie with the author (s. 78) as well as a ''[[droit de suite]]'' (s. 23).

=== Copyright infringement ===

When copyright is infringed (s. 71), the owner of copyright (as well as the exclusive licensee) is entitled to certain '''[[Legal remedy|civil remedies]]''' ([[injunction]], [[damages]], accounts; s. 76). Jurisdiction lies with the [[Law of Bangladesh#Civil Courts|court of District Judge]] of the place where the person instituting the proceeding resides or carries on business (s. 81).

Infringing copies are deemed to be the property of the owner of the copyright, who accordingly may take proceedings for the recovery of possession thereof or in respect of the conversion thereof (s. 79). Infringing copies may be seized by the police (s. 93) and can be forbidden to be imported (s. 74).

Copyright infringement may also lead to '''[[criminal charge]]s''' (ss. 82 to 91) to be tried by no court inferior to that of a Court of Sessions (s. 92).

=== No infringement ===

Certain acts are said not to constitute an infringement of copyright (s. 72). These include ''inter alia''
*[[Fair dealing|fair use]] of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work for the purpose of private study, private use, criticism, review (sub-s. 1) or reporting current events (sub-s. 2)
*the reproduction or adaptation of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work by a teacher or a pupil for the purpose of instruction or examination (sub-s. 8)
*the publication or performance of a literary, dramatic or musical work by the staff and students of an educational institution (sub-s. 9)
*the making of up to 3 copies of a book by a non-profit or educational library for its use if such book is not available for sale (sub-s. 15)
*the reproduction or publication of certain Government works (unless prohibited; sub-s. 17)
*the making or publishing of a painting, drawing, engraving or photograph of architecture (sub-s. 19) or a sculpture or other artistic work if such work is permanently situated in a public place (sub-s. 20)

=== Related rights ===

Related rights include the ''broadcast reproduction right'' of broadcasting organisations (s. 33; term 25 years), the ''performer's right'' (s. 35; term: 50 years) and the right of ''publishers'' relating to the typographical arrangement of their editions (s. 38; term: 25 years).

=== Other provisions ===

*particulars to be included in sound recordings and video films (s. 73)
*[[legal deposit]] of books (s. 62) as well as periodicals and newspapers (s. 63) with the [[National Library of Bangladesh]]

'''''Courvoisier v. Raymond''''', 23 Colo. 113 (1896), was a case decided by the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] that affirmed the use of a [[reasonable person|reasonableness]] standard when determining the validity of a mistaken self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A. et al.  ''The Torts Process, Seventh Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual background==
Courvoisier was a jewelry store owner, and he was awoken in the middle of the night when robbers tried to break into his store.  He retrieved his revolver and chased them outside.  Raymond was a [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] police officer who began to approach Courvoisier, and Courvoisier shot him.  Courvoisier said that he mistook Raymond for a robber, but the trial court found for Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The Colorado Supreme Court reversed the decision for Raymond because of faulty [[jury instructions]] in the trial court.  The trial court failed to give the instruction that Courvoisier should not be held [[legal liability|liable]] if his mistake that Raymond was a robber was reasonable given the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debt''' is when something, usually [[money]], is owed by one party, the [[borrower]] or [[debtor]], to a second party, the lender or [[creditor]]. Debt is a deferred payment, or series of payments, that is owed in the future, which is what differentiates it from an immediate purchase. The debt may be owed by [[sovereign state]] or country, [[local government]], [[company]], or an individual. Commercial debt is generally subject to [[contractual term]]s regarding the amount and timing of repayments of [[Principal (finance)|principal]] and [[interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|p=348|journal=Weekly Notes of Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the County Courts of Philadelphia, and the United States District and Circuit Courts for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|title=Brooke et al versus the City of Philadelphia et al|volume=34|issue=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUqTAAAAIAAJ|publisher=Kay and brother|year=1894|author=[[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loan]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], notes, and [[mortgage loan|mortgages]] are all types of debt.  The term can also be used [[metaphor]]ically to cover [[morality|moral]] obligations and other interactions not based on [[economic value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|debt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a "debt of gratitude" to the second person.

==Etymology==
The English term "debt" was first used in the late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=debt |title=Debt|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "debt" comes from "dette, from [[Old French]] dete, from Latin debitum "thing owed," neuter past participle of debere "to owe," originally, "keep something away from someone," from de- "away" (see de-) + habere "to have" (see habit (n.)). Restored spelling [was used] after c. 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=debt |title=Debt|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related term "debtor" was first used in English also in the early 13th century; the terms "dettur, dettour, [came] from Old French detour, from Latin debitor "a debter," from past participle stem of debere;...The -b- was restored in later French, and in English c. 1560-c. 1660." In the [[King James Bible]], various spellings are used; the spellings "detter [are used] three times, debter three times, debtor twice and debtour once." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=debt |title=Debt|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms ==

=== Interest ===
[[Interest]] is the fee paid by the borrower to the lender.  Interest is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding principal, which percentage is known as an [[interest rate]], and is generally paid periodically at intervals, such as monthly or semi-annually.

Interest rates may be [[Fixed interest rate loan|fixed]] or [[Floating interest rate#floating rate loan|floating]]. In floating-rate structures, the rate of interest that the borrower pays during each time period is tied to a benchmark such as [[LIBOR]] or, in the case of [[inflation-indexed bond]]s, [[inflation]].

There are many different conventions for calculating interest.  Depending on the terms of the debt, [[compound interest]] may accumulate at a specific interval.  In addition, different [[day count convention]]s exist, for example, sometimes each month is considered to have exactly thirty days, such that the interest payment due is the same in each calendar month.  The [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) is a standardized way to calculate and compare interest rates on an annual basis.  Quoting interest rates using APR is required by regulation for most loans to individuals in the United States and United Kingdom.

For some loans, the amount actually loaned to the debtor is less than the principal sum to be repaid. This may be because upfront fees or [[point (mortgage)|points]] are charged, or because the loan has been structured to be [[Islamic banking|sharia-compliant]]. The additional principal due at the end of the term has the same economic effect as a higher interest rate.

Riskier borrowers must generally pay higher rates of interest to compensate lenders for taking on the additional risk of default.  Debt investors assess the risk of default prior to making a loan, for example through credit scores and corporate and sovereign ratings.

=== Repayment ===
There are three main ways repayment may be structured: the entire principal balance may be due at the maturity of the loan; the entire principal balance may be [[Amortization (business)|amortized]] over the term of the loan; or the loan may partially amortized during its term, with the remaining principal due as a "[[balloon payment]]" at maturity. Amortization structures are common in [[mortgage]]s and [[credit card]]s. 

===Default provisions===

Debtors of every type [[default (finance)|default]] on their debt from time to time, with various consequences depending on the terms of the debt and the law governing default in the relevant jurisdiction.  
If the debt was secured by specific [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], such as a car or home, the creditor may seek to repossess the collateral.  In more serious circumstances, individuals and companies may go into [[bankruptcy]].

== Types of borrowers ==

=== Individuals ===
Common types of debt owed by individuals and households include [[mortgage loan]]s, car loans, [[credit card]] debt, and [[income tax|income taxes]]. For individuals, debt is a means of using anticipated [[income]] and future [[purchasing power]] in the present before it has actually been earned. Commonly, people in industrialized nations use consumer debt to purchase houses, cars and other things too expensive to buy with cash on hand.

People are more likely to spend more and get into debt when they use credit cards vs. cash for buying products and services.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, P., &amp; Rose, R. L. (2012). [https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/17603/ChatterjeeNew.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Do payment mechanisms change the way consumers perceive products?] Journal of Consumer Research, 38(6), 1129–1139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, N.

[http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/transparency.pdf The effect of payment transparency on consumption: Quasi experiments from the field]. Marketing Letters, 14, 173–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The transparency effect refers to the fact that the further you are from cash (as in a credit card or another form of payment), the less transparent it is and the less you remember how much you spent.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; The less transparent or further away from cash, the form of payment employed is, the less an individual feels the “pain of paying” and thus is likely to spend more.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Furthermore, the differing physical appearance/form that credit cards have from cash may cause them to be viewed as [[Monopoly money#As a phrase|“monopoly” money]] vs. real money, luring individuals to spend more money than they would if they only had cash available.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, P., &amp; Rose, R. L. (2012). Do payment mechanisms change the way consumers perceive products? Journal of Consumer Research, 38(6), 1129–1139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these more formal debts, private individuals also lend informally to other people, mostly relatives or friends. One reason for such informal debts is that many people, in particular those who are poor, have no access to affordable credit. Such debts can cause problems when they are not paid back according to expectations of the lending household. In 2011, 8 percent of people in the [[European Union]] reported their households has been in arrears, that is, unable to pay as scheduled "payments related to informal loans from friends or relatives not living in your household".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_files/pubdocs/2013/73/en/2/EF1373EN.pdf|title=Household over-indebtedness in the EU: The role of informal debts.|last=|first=|date=2013|website=eurofound.europa.eu|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
A [[company]] may use various kinds of debt to [[finance]] its [[Business operations|operations]] as a part of its overall [[corporate finance]] strategy.

A [[term loan]] is the simplest form of corporate debt. It consists of an agreement to lend a fixed amount of money, called the [[principal sum]] or principal, for a fixed period of time, with this amount to be repaid by a certain date. In commercial loans [[interest]], calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year, will also have to be paid by that date, or may be paid periodically in the interval, such as annually or monthly. Such loans are also colloquially called "[[bullet loan]]s", particularly if there is only a single payment at the end – the "bullet" – without a "stream" of interest payments during the life of the loan.

A [[syndicated loan]] is a loan that is granted to companies that wish to borrow more money than any single lender is prepared to risk in a single loan. A syndicated loan is provided by a group of lenders and is structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial banks or investment banks known as arrangers. Loan syndication is a [[risk management]] tool that allows the lead banks [[underwriting]] the debt to reduce their risk and free up lending capacity.

A company may also issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], which are debt [[security (finance)|securities]]. Bonds have a fixed lifetime, usually a number of [[year]]s; with long-term bonds, lasting over 30 years, being less common. At the end of the bond's life the money should be repaid in full. Interest may be added to the end payment, or can be paid in regular installments (known as [[coupon (bond)|coupons]]) during the life of the bond.

A [[letter of credit]] or LC can also be the source of payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the letter of credit will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used primarily in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the [[land development]] process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the [[advising bank]] of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to [[giro]]s and [[traveler's cheque]]. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a [[commercial invoice]], [[bill of lading]], and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.

Companies also use debt in many ways to leverage the [[investment]] made in their [[asset]]s, "leveraging" the return on their [[Stock|equity]]. This [[leverage (finance)|leverage]], the proportion of debt to equity, is considered important in determining the riskiness of an investment; the more debt per equity, the riskier.

=== Governments ===
[[File:Government debt gdp.png|thumb|Government debt as a percentage of national GDP]]
[[File:1979 $10,000 Treasury Bond .jpg|thumb|right|1979 U.S. Government $10,000 [[treasury bond]]]]
Governments issue debt to pay for ongoing expenses as well as major capital projects. Government debt may be issued by sovereign states as well as by local governments, sometimes known as municipalities.

Debt issued by the government of the United States, called [[United States Treasury security|Treasuries]], serves as a reference point for all other debt.  There are deep, transparent, liquid, and open capital markets for Treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lew, Jacob (2016), [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-04-11/america-and-global-economy America and the Global Economy], Foreign Affairs, May/June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Treasuries are issued in a wide variety of maturities, from one day to thirty years, which facilitates comparing the interest rates on other debt to a security of comparable maturity.  In finance, the theoretical "[[Risk-free interest rate|Risk-free rate]]" rate is often approximated by practitioners by using the current yield a Treasury of the same duration.

The overall level of indebtedness by a government is typically shown as a ratio of debt-to-GDP. This ratio helps to assess the speed of changes in government indebtedness and the size of the debt due.

== Assessments of creditworthiness ==

=== Income metrics ===
The [[debt service coverage ratio]] is the ratio of income available to the amount of debt service due (including both interest and principal amortization, if any).  The higher the debt service coverage ratio, the more income is available to pay debt service, and the easier and lower-cost it will be for a borrower to obtain financing.

Different debt markets have somewhat different conventions in terminology and calculations for income-related metrics.  For example, in mortgage lending in the United States, a [[debt-to-income ratio]] typically includes the cost of mortgage payments as well as insurance and property tax, divided by a consumer's monthly income.  A "front-end ratio" of 28% or below, together with a "back-end ratio" (including required payments on non-housing debt as well) of 36% or below is also required to be eligible for a conforming loan.

=== Value metrics ===

The [[loan-to-value ratio]] is the ratio of the total amount of the loan to the total value of the [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] securing the loan.

For example, in mortgage lending in the United States, the loan-to-value concept is most commonly expressed as a "[[down payment]]."  A 20% down payment is equivalent to an 80% loan to value.  With home purchases, value may be assessed using the agreed-upon purchase price, and/or an [[real estate appraisal|appraisal]].

=== Collateral and recourse ===
A debt obligation is considered secured if creditors have recourse to specific [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Collateral may include claims on tax receipts (in the case of a government), specific assets (in the case of a company) or a home (in the case of a consumer). Unsecured debt comprises financial obligations for which creditors do not have recourse to the [[asset]]s of the borrower to satisfy their claims.

=== Role of rating agencies ===
[[Credit bureaus]] collect information about the borrowing and repayment history of consumers.  Lenders, such as banks and credit card companies, use [[credit scores]] to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers. In the United States, the primary credit bureaus are [[Equifax]], [[Experian]], and [[TransUnion]]. 

Debts owed by governments and private corporations may be rated by [[Credit rating agency|rating agencies]], such as [[Moody's]], [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Fitch Ratings]], and [[A. M. Best]]. The government or company itself will also be given its own separate rating. These agencies assess the ability of the debtor to honor his obligations and accordingly give him or her a [[credit rating]]. Moody's uses the letters ''Aaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa Ca C'', where ratings ''Aa-Caa'' are qualified by numbers 1-3. S&amp;P and other rating agencies have slightly different systems using capital letters and +/- qualifiers. Thus a government or corporation with a high rating would have Aaa rating.

A change in ratings can strongly affect a company, since its cost of [[refinancing]] depends on its [[creditworthiness]]. Bonds below Baa/BBB (Moody's/S&amp;P) are considered [[High-yield debt|junk]] or high-risk bonds. Their high risk of default (approximately 1.6 percent for Ba) is compensated by higher interest payments. Bad Debt is a loan that can not (partially or fully) be repaid by the debtor. The debtor is said to [[Default (finance)|default]] on his debt. These types of debt are frequently repackaged and sold below face value. Buying junk bonds is seen as a risky but potentially profitable investment.

== Debt markets ==

=== Market interest rates ===
{{Main|Bond valuation}}

=== Loans versus bonds ===
[[Bond (finance)|Bonds]] are debt [[security (finance)|securities]], tradeable on a [[bond market]]. A country's regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, in North America, each [[security (finance)|security]] is uniquely identified by a [[CUSIP]] for trading and settlement purposes. In contrast, [[loan]]s are not [[security (finance)|securities]] and do not have [[CUSIP]]s (or the equivalent). Loans may be sold or acquired in certain circumstances, as when a bank [[syndicated loan|syndicates]] a loan.

Loans can be turned into securities through the [[securitization]] process.  In a securitization, a company sells a pool of assets to a securitization trust, and the securitization trust finances its purchase of the assets by selling [[Debt securities|securities]] to the market. For example, a trust may own a pool of home [[mortgage loan|mortgages]], and be financed by [[residential mortgage-backed security|residential mortgage-backed securities]].  In this case, the asset-backed trust is a debt issuer of [[residential mortgage-backed security|residential mortgage-backed securities]].

=== Role of central banks ===
[[Central bank]]s, such as the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]], play a key role in the debt markets. Debt is normally denominated in a particular [[currency]], and so changes in the valuation of that currency can change the effective size of the debt. This can happen due to [[inflation]] or [[deflation]], so it can happen even though the borrower and the lender are using the same [[currency]].

== Criticisms ==
{{POV section|date=September 2018}}
Some argue against debt as an instrument and institution, on a personal, family, social, corporate and governmental level. [[Islamic banking|Islam forbids lending with interest]] even today. In hard times, the cost of servicing debt can grow beyond the debtor's ability to pay, due to either external events (income loss) or internal difficulties (poor management of resources).

Debt with an associated interest rate will increase through time if it is not repaid faster than it grows through interest. This effect may be termed [[usury]], while the term "usury" in other contexts refers only to an excessive rate of interest, in excess of a reasonable profit for the [[risk]] accepted.

In international legal thought, [[odious debt]] is debt that is incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of the state. Such debts are thus considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state.  International [[Third World debt]] has reached the scale that many [[economist]]s{{Who|date=September 2018}} are convinced that [[debt relief]] or [[debt cancellation]] is the only way to restore global equity in relations with the [[developing nation]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Excessive debt accumulation{{clarify|date=September 2018}} has been blamed for exacerbating economic problems{{By whom|date=September 2018}}. For example, before the [[Great Depression]], the [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] was very high.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Economic agents were heavily indebted.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} This excess of debt, equivalent to excessive expectations on future returns, accompanied asset bubbles on the stock markets. When expectations corrected, deflation and a [[credit crunch]] followed. [[Deflation]] effectively made debt more expensive and, as Fisher explained, this reinforced deflation again, because, in order to reduce their debt level, economic agents reduced their [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and investment. The reduction in demand reduced business activity and caused further unemployment. In a more direct sense, more [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] also occurred due both to increased debt cost caused by deflation and the reduced demand.

{{anchor|Mental health}}At the household level, debts can also have detrimental effects — particularly when households make spending decisions assuming income will increase, or remain stable, in years to come. When households take on credit based on this assumption, life events can easily change indebtedness into over-indebtedness. Such life events include unexpected unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, [[business failure]], illness, or home repairs. Over-indebtedness has severe social consequences, such as financial hardship, poor physical and mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The relationship between debt and mental health: a systematic review. | author=Fitch | journal=Mental Health Review Journal | year=2011 | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=153–166 | doi=10.1108/13619321111202313|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; family stress, stigma, difficulty obtaining employment, exclusion from basic financial services ([[European Commission]], 2009), work accidents and industrial disease, a strain on social relations (Carpentier and Van den Bosch, 2008), absenteeism at work and lack of organisational commitment (Kim ''et al.'', 2003), feeling of insecurity, and relational tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_files/pubdocs/2010/70/en/2/EF1070EN.pdf | title=Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU.

== Levels and flows ==
{{Main|Debt levels and flows}}

Global debt [[underwriting]] grew 4.3 percent year-over-year to {{US$|5.19{{nbsp}}trillion|link=yes}} during 2004. It is expected to rise in the coming years if the spending habits of millions of people worldwide continue the way they do.

== History ==
{{Main|History of money}}

Traditions in some cultures demand that debt be forgiven on a regular (often annual) basis, in order to prevent systemic inequities between groups in society, or anyone becoming a specialist in holding debt and coercing repayment. An example is the Biblical [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee year]], described in the [[Book of Leviticus]].

'''The Electronic Communications Act 2000''' (c.7) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that:
*Had provisions to regulate the provision of [[cryptography|cryptographic]] services in the UK (ss.1-6); and
*Confirms the legal status of [[electronic signature]]s (ss.7-10).

The United Kingdom government had come to the conclusion that encryption, encryption services and electronic signatures would be important to [[e-commerce]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

By 1999, however, only the security services still hankered after key escrow.{{fact|date=March 2018}} So a "[[sunset clause]]" was put in the bill. The Electronic Communications Act 2000 gave the [[Home Office]] the power to create a registration regime for encryption services. This was given a five-year period before it would automatically lapse, which eventually happened in May 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12460">'''Evidence management''' is the administration and control of evidence related to an event so that it can be used to prove the circumstances of the event, and so that this proof can be tested by independent parties with confidence that the evidence provided is the evidence collected related to the event.
{{TOC right}}

==Aspects of evidence management==
Evidence management requires that the evidence is:
*collected in a fashion which does not compromise the nature of the evidence
*kept in a fashion which maintains the nature of the evidence{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*handled in a fashion which allows no doubt that the evidence could not have been accidentally or deliberately altered or substituted
that is, the evidence presented for the proof is the exact evidence collected.&lt;ref name="fsc1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Assurance Applied to Authentication of Digital Evidence |work=Forensic Science Communications |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/oct2004/research/2004_10_research01.htm |accessdate=2008-03-26 |date=2004-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312121928/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/oct2004/research/2004_10_research01.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forensics and Incident Response|url=https://www.peerlyst.com/categories/forensics-and-incident-response|publisher=www.peerlyst.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence management requiries the techniques used in:
*[[warehousing]] and inventory control, of many items of evidence related to many events
*curation and keeping of delicate and sensitive items, of a broad range in type of material and size
{{main article|Collection curation|Digital curation}}
*secure custodianship and handover of responsibility, from the time and place of collection to the time and place of presentation as elements of a proof, often called either '''chain of custody''' or '''evidence continuity'''
{{main article|Chain of custody}}

===Evidence lifetime===
Evidence must be managed and administered over its entire lifetime.  The lifetime of a piece of evidence includes a number of key stages,&lt;ref name="iapepr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Property Room Standards |publisher=International Association for Property and Evidence |url=http://www.iape.org/Standards_7-03/index.htm |accessdate=2008-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080204172810/http://www.iape.org/Standards_7-03/index.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mineh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Evidence handling |publisher=[[Minnesota]] Department of [[Corrections]] |url=http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/FormsWorking/NSI/107.055RC.htm |accessdate=2008-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531155547/http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/FormsWorking/NSI/107.055RC.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the piece of evidence's acquisition to its eventual disposal:
*Acquisition, which can be by:
**Collection, for example at a crime scene
**Seizure
**Voluntary deposit
*Description, which includes:
**Indexing
**Describing
**Digitising, for example, photographing or scanning
*[[Duty of care]], for example document seizure from a business which by definition requires the documents to carry out its business, can include:
**Copying of evidence
**Provision of copies to evidence owner
*Analysis, which includes:
**Information interpretation, for example the content of documents
**Materials testing, for example of drug type, paper type, ink type
**Environmental context investigation, for example of included matter, animal life, fingerprints
*Assessment
**Relevance to elements of proofs
*Presentation, which includes
**Disclosure, for example pre trial to defence
**In court, and at appeal
*Disposal, which can be by:
**Return to owner
**Destruction, of illicit or redundant or obsolete or sensitive or confidential material
**Sale or donation, of no owner identifiable material

===Accountability and responsibility===
At all stages of its life, the piece of evidence must typically be moved in and out of storage, and be handled by different people.  This places very strong requirements on the integrity of the chain of custody, and in particular on the personnel involved and the [[duty of care]] of the organisation responsible.  For example, [[Interpol]] has published standards to combat corruption, and Standard 4.12&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Standards to Combat Corruption in Police Forces/Services |publisher=[[Interpol]] Group of Experts on Corruption |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/corruption/standard/Default.asp |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to systems and states:
:'' 'Having and maintaining systems of revenue collection, money and property handling and for the control and preservation of evidence that ensure that those collecting or handling money, dealing with evidence or handling property are accountable and that the systems are such as to deter corruption.' ''

Evidence and property management is typically considered critical to the extent that the efficiency or economy of the processes are secondary to the integrity of the evidence and property.&lt;ref name="wappmpgp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccc.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/Western%20Australia%20Police%20Property%20Management%20Practices.pdf|title=Western Australia Police Property Management Practices - Good Practice (page 11)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Western Australian Police]] and [[Corruption and Crime Commission]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digitising of evidence is reducing the need to handle the original evidence until it is presented.  The reduction in the handling of the original evidence lessens the likelihood of deliberate tampering or accidental contamination and reduces [[chain of custody]] requirements and overheads.

While the chain of custody stops with presentation, accountability and responsibility remains until the evidence is disposed of.

===Evidence management and its impact on criminal prosecutions===
Evidence management is critical to the outcome of criminal prosecutions. If any of the above [[#Aspects of evidence management|aspects of evidence management]] fail in relation to the evidence required for a prosecution, then it can compromise the outcome of the prosecution.

===Standards and procedures===
The proper management of evidence is so important to organisations responsible for evidence that they develop formal standards for the management, administration, and handling of evidence.  The failure to apply proper standards to property processing can result in severe criticism of an organisation.&lt;ref name="wappmp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccc.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/Western%20Australia%20Police%20Property%20Management%20Practices.pdf|title=Western Australia Police Property Management Practices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Western Australian Police]] and [[Corruption and Crime Commission]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards and procedures can vary&lt;ref name="wappmpgp"/&gt; from consensual indicative standards internationally adopted as a benchmark reference by organisations across the world,&lt;ref name="iapepr"/&gt; be specific to the initial evidence handling procedures for specific institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Procedure - Preservation of a Crime Scene and Evidence |publisher=[[Queensland]] [[Corrections|Corrective]] Services |url=http://www.correctiveservices.qld.gov.au/index.shtml |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; be the lifetime standards for evidence handling for an organisation,&lt;ref name="mineh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Evidence handling |publisher=[[Minnesota]] Department of [[Corrections]] |url=http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/FormsWorking/NSI/107.055RC.htm |accessdate=2008-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531155547/http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/FormsWorking/NSI/107.055RC.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be formal national standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Community and materials - Chain of Custody |publisher=Standards Australia |url=http://www.standards.org.au/cat.asp?catid=126&amp;ContentId=673&amp;News=1 |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of physical evidence==
The primary aspect of the management of physical evidence is the provision of suitable storage facility.  Storage facilities for evidence can vary in size from a single secure cabinet in an office to large dedicated [[warehouse]]s.
The physical storage of evidence in modern departments is often accomplished using 
hi-density shelving systems. These systems allow use of only one aisle to access several rows of shelving by means of rolling carriages that have shelving mounted to them.
This results in storing double the amount of evidence in the same space that would be used on static shelving. These hi-density system can accommodate shelving, shelving with lockable drawers, bulk rack, pallet rack, and lockable cabinets. In addition hi-density style systems can lock off specific aisles for the various degrees of security often needed for items such as guns and drugs.

All but the smallest evidence storage facilities will contain multiple [[#Physical container|physical containers]] for separate pieces of evidence. The default container is a storage box although plastic bins and bags are also seen.
Larger storage facilities will also provide environmentally controlled sections, for example cold rooms or freezers, for the preservation of evidence.
High-density systems are even more valuable when special environments such as cold rooms are required because they require less space.

==Physical container==
{{Main article|Security bag}}
The physical containers used to store items of evidence are sometimes called '''evidence storage units'''
The [[packaging]] used to store evidence perform a number of functions.  These include:
*physical stability of the evidence;
*regular and organised stacking and placement to allow optimal access;&lt;ref name="iape-ps7"&gt;{{cite web |title=Property Standards #7 |publisher=International Association for Property and Evidence |url=http://www.iape.org/Standards/PS07/index.html |accessdate=2008-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423052936/http://www.iape.org/Standards/PS07/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*protection of evidence management personnel from dangers inherent in the evidence.

Physical containers for pieces of evidence varying in the type of storage they provide.

Highly desirable pieces of evidence such as precious metals, currency, jewelry, firearms, and drugs often require higher levels of storage to protect them from theft, and reentry into the criminal environment.&lt;ref name="iape-ps7"/&gt;

Inherently dangerous items of evidence such as drugs, and chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological materials require higher levels of storage to protect the well being of evidence management personnel.&lt;ref name="iape-ps7"/&gt;

Typically physical containers are of a size and shape that they are able to be handled by a single person.  Small items can be placed in an [[evidence bag]]: a [[plastic bag]] with special [[tamper resistant]] features and places to record the [[chain of custody]]. Large volumes of evidence will require larger containers typically able to be handled using a [[fork lift]].

==Evidence management organisational units==

===Evidence storage work unit===
Most organisations collecting evidence have specific work units responsible for the safe keeping and preservation of evidence.  The evidence storage work unit, typically called a '''property office''' is responsible for:

====Other duties of a property office====
When the organisation is a [[police]] agency, the property office is typically also responsible for found property.

'''George Gill Green''' (January 16, 1842 &amp;ndash; February 26, 1925) was a [[patent medicine]] [[entrepreneur]], and Union [[surgeon]] in the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
George Gill Green was born in [[Clarksboro, New Jersey|Clarksboro]], [[East Greenwich Township, New Jersey]], to Mary Ann (1820-1844) and Lewis M. Green (1818-1894). George Green's mother was from [[Pennsylvania]], and his father worked as a butcher. 

Green attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] medical school for two years, but left in 1864 before he graduated. 

He enlisted in the [[142nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] (active 1864-1865) during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865). In 1867 he started a wholesale drug business in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] but the factory was destroyed by a fire. He moved to [[Ohio]], married Angie Brown, and they had their first child there.

Green bought the rights to "Green's August Flower" and "Dr. Boschee's German Syrup" from his father, Lewis, who sold the elixir under the name "L.M. Green". George created a marketing campaign involving mass mailings of free samples, and the distribution of thousands of his almanacs. Both elixirs were mostly [[laudanum]]. He became a millionaire and in 1880 he built Woodbury's Opera House. 

The family moved to [[Woodbury, New Jersey|Woodbury]], New Jersey on November 23, [[Thanksgiving Day]] in 1872. 

The Greens had a son, George Gill Green II (1883-1971), who was born on January 17, 1883 and died in January 1971. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunningham  |first=John T. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=This Is New Jersey |year=1994 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMk1LTo9wYcC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;ots=nb2PBwBENz&amp;dq=%22George+G.+Green%22&amp;sig=MuPMmb91cD1adJxTzoKkr_8OHk8 |isbn=0-8135-2141-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Green acquired an uncompleted hotel in [[Pasadena, California]], and in 1894 completed and opened it as [[Hotel Green]] in [[Southern California]].

Green completed a summer home, "Kil Kare Castle," in 1895 at [[Lake Hopatcong]] in New Jersey.

In 1898 Green built an annex west of Hotel Green, the "Central Annex" building or "Castle Green" on the block across Raymond Avenue. "Castle Green" is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Pasadena, California|National Register of Historic Places in Pasadena]], the [[California State Historic Landmark]] Register, and the City of Pasadena Register of City Treasures. 

In 1903 Green added a third annex to the Hotel Green, known as the "Wooster Block." His [[patent medicine]] business declined after the passage of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906, and by 1916 his company's products were discontinued. 

George Gill Green died on February 26, 1925 in [[Woodbury, New Jersey]].

{{Elections}}
{{Politics}}

In [[political science]], an '''initiative''' (also known as a '''popular''' or '''citizens' initiative''') is a means by which a [[petition]] signed by a certain minimum number of [[Voter registration|registered voters]] can force a public vote ([[referendum]], sometimes called a plebiscite).

The initiative may take the form of a '''direct initiative''' or an '''indirect initiative'''. In a direct initiative, a measure is put directly to a vote after being submitted by a petition. In an indirect initiative, a measure is first referred to the [[legislature]], and then put to a popular vote only if not enacted by the legislature.

The vote may be on a proposed [[statute]], [[constitutional amendment]], charter amendment or [[local ordinance]], or to simply oblige the [[executive (government)|executive]] or legislature to consider the subject by submitting it to the order of the day. It is a form of [[direct democracy]].

== Canada ==

=== British Columbia ===
The Canadian province of British Columbia has a citizen initiative law known as the Recall and Initiative Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/96398_00 |title=Table of Contents - Recall and Initiative Act |publisher=Bclaws.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original proposal was [[British Columbia recall and initiative referendum, 1991|put to voters in a referendum]] held in October 1991 and was supported by over 83% of voters. It was subsequently put into force by the incoming NDP government. Since it came into force in 1995, several attempts have been made to hold an initiative, but until the fall of 2010, none had succeeded in reaching the first of the thresholds, securing signatures of 10% of registered voters in each riding throughout British Columbia. The first referendum was held under this legislation on September 2011 on the subject of repealing the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]]. Details of its use in BC are available on the Elections BC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/index.php/referenda-recall-initiative/initiative/ |title=Initiative &amp;#124; Elections BC |publisher=Elections.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==

{{main|European Citizens' Initiative}}
The rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe#Parliamentary power and transparency|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE) included a limited indirect initiative right (Article I-46(4)). The proposal of introducing the [[European Citizens' Initiative]] (ECI) was that 1,000,000 citizens, from minimal numbers of different member states, could invite the executive body of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[European Commission]], to consider any proposal "on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Constitution." The precise mechanism had not been agreed upon. Critics underlined the weakness of this right of initiative, which did not ultimately entail any vote or referendum.

A similar scheme under the same name, European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), has been put forward in the now ratified European [[Lisbon Treaty]] (which entered into force on 1 December 2009), enabling a limited indirect initiative right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708193731/http://bookshop.europa.eu/eubookshop/download.action?fileName=NA7809931ENC_002.pdf&amp;eubphfUid=10740063&amp;catalogNbr=NA-78-09-931-EN-C ]&lt;/ref&gt; It follows very similar rules to the ones outlined in the European Constitution, requiring the signatures of 1,000 000 European Nationals. These citizens would thereby obtain the same right to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal as the Council has had since the establishment of the [[European Communities]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cs - čeština |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2009-0389+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 7 May 2009 - Implementation of the citizens' initiative - P6_TA-PROV(2009)0389 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does require that the signatures come from a "significant number" of Member States. It is suggested that this significant number will need to be around a quarter of member states, with at least 1/500 of the citizens in those member states supporting the initiative. With the variety of languages within the European Union, this creates a significant hurdle for people to navigate. The treaty also makes it clear that right of initiative should not be confused with the right to [[petition]], particularly since a petition is directed to Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=49&amp;pageRank=3&amp;language=en |title=Parliament : Petitions |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a citizens' initiative is directed to the Commission; whereas a petition is a method of remonstrance, usually focussing on perceived infringements of European Law, an initiative is a grassroots proposal for new legislation. In 2013 the subjects of ongoing open initiatives of the European Citizens' Initiative are e.g. about "water and sanitation as a human right" (against [[Water privatization]]), "30 km/h - making the streets liveable!" ([[Traffic calming]] in towns), "[[Basic Income#Basic Income Movement in Europe|Unconditional Basic Income]]" (UBI - Exploring a pathway towards emancipatory welfare conditions), or to "End [[Ecocide]] in Europe" (to give the Earth Rights).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/ongoing?lg=en ''Open initiatives''] at the European Citizens' Initiative official register of The European Commission (often translated in EU-languages). Retrieved 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains to be seen if the ECI evolves into a full initiative or remains in its present state of a ''de facto'' petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/ |title=European Citizens' Initiative on the European Commission's web |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Citizens' Initiative on the initiator's web:&lt;br&gt;[http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/ citizens-initiative.eu]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.democracy-international.org/eci.html democracy-international.org/eci.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===

Since March 1, 2012, groups of at least 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[Finland|Finnish]] citizens with [[suffrage]] have had the constitutional right to send a citizens' initiative (Finnish: ''kansalaisaloite'', Swedish: ''medborgarinitiativ'') to the [[Parliament of Finland]].&lt;ref name="finland-citizens-initiative"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/tietoa/briefly-in-english|title=Citizens' initiatives in Finland|publisher=Ministry of Justice of Finland|accessdate=2013-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602052612/https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/tietoa/briefly-in-english|archivedate=2013-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finland-constitution"&gt;Note: the text is an unofficial translation used by the Ministry of Justice of Finland.

=== France ===

A limited, indirect form of local initiative was added to the [[French Constitution]] (article 72-1, ''référendum d'initiative locale'') on 28 March 2003 as part of [[decentralization]] reforms. However, the only power these "local referendum initiatives" confer on citizens is the ability to add propositions to their local assembly's meeting agenda. The decision as to whether to submit citizen propositions to a popular vote (referendum) rests with the local assembly.

=== Germany ===

All German states have the right to initiative.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, there is no constitutional citizens' initiative in Germany at a federal level.

===Ireland===
The [[Constitution of Ireland]], since its [[enactment of the Constitution of Ireland|1937 enactment]], has never made provision for initiatives.&lt;ref name="constconv_5_3_2"/&gt; Since 2012, the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) has a  [[joint committee]] to which the public can submit [[petition]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/public-petition-oireachtas-594866-Sep2012/|title=How does the new public petitions system work?|last=Barry|first=Aoife|date=14 September 2012|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the committee must formally consider them but need not accept them.&lt;ref name="dail2015042100056"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042100056#WRD00800|title=Written Answer No.225: Constitutional Convention Recommendations|date=21 April 2015|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|page=56|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/about/31stdail/psop-committee/jointsub-committeeonpublicpetitions/|title=Joint Committee on Public Petitions|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/public_petitions.html|title=Public petitions|date=10 October 2016|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=19 December 2016|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May–June 2013, when the [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]] considered Dáil electoral reform, members voted 83:16 in favour of allowing "citizens' initiatives" in general,&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §2 Question 9&lt;/ref&gt; 80:19 to allow them specifically for legislation,&lt;ref name="citzconvq10"&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §2 Question 10&lt;/ref&gt; and 78:17 to allow them for [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional amendment]]s.&lt;ref name="citzconvq10"/&gt; In April 2015, the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|Fine Gael–Labour government]] rejected the recommendations on the basis that there is sufficient public involvement in legislation through the petitions committee and the [[pre-legislative scrutiny]] process.&lt;ref name="dail2015042100056"/&gt;

Article 48 of the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] gave a right of initiative: if more than 50,000 voters demanded a change in law, the Oireachtas had two years to enact it, failing which 75,000 voters could petition for a [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922, Schedule 1|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 48 |nopp=Y|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constconv_5_3_2"&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §5.3.2 "Background"&lt;/ref&gt; The only attempt to invoke this was organised in 1927 by [[Fianna Fáil]], the largest [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] party, which sought to abolish the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]. By May 1928 Fianna Fáil claimed 96,000 signatures and attempted to have the petition [[Laying before the house|laid before]] the [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil]] (lower house). The motion was deferred, ostensibly to allow the Dáil [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]] committee to define the method of dealing with such petitions.&lt;ref&gt;

===Romania===
According to Article 74 of the Romanian Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=3#t3c1s3sba74|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 74|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, groups of at least 100,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage that reside in at least one quarter of all the counties and with a minimum 5,000 signatures per county have the right to send a Citizens' Initiative which must be considered by the legislative body (Initiatives that address fiscal or international matters are not covered by this right).  If the initiative concerns changing the Constitution, Article 150 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=7#t7c0s0sba150|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 150|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the group must include at least 500,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage who reside in at least half of all the counties, with a minimum of 20,000 per county. Article 151 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=7#t7c0s0sba151|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 151|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also states that any amendments brought to it, must be also approved by means of a National Referendum.

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] a vote initiated by the public is called a [[Referendums in New Zealand#Citizens initiated referendums|citizen initiated referendum]].  These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months.

== Philippines ==
{{main|People's Initiative}}
People's initiative to propose amendments to the constitution is enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution under Article XVII Section 2, which states:

{{quote|Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters therein. No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.}}

This provision is further protected by Republic Act 6735 or ''The Initiative and Referendum Act.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joselito Guianan Chan, Managing Partner, Chan Robles &amp;amp; Associates Law Firm |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno6735.htm |title=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |publisher=Chanrobles.com |date=1989-08-04 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law defines initiative as:
# A petition to propose amendments to the constitution.
# A petition to propose enactment of national legislation.
# A petition to propose enactment of local resolution or ordinance on regional, provincial, city, municipal, or barangay level.

The law also provides ''indirect initiative'' defining the exercise of people's initiative through a proposition sent to congress or local legislative body for action.

== Switzerland ==
{{Main|Popular initiative (Switzerland)}}

The [[federal popular initiative]] was included in the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] in 1891, permitting a certain number of citizens (currently 100,000 signatures within 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/vi/index.html?lang=de ''Eidgenössische Volksinitiative''], website of "The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation" (German, possible to switch to French or Italien language). Retrieved 2013-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;) to make a request to amend a constitutional article, or even to introduce a new article into the constitution. The right of initiative is also used at the cantonal and communal level in Switzerland (all [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s, all [[Communes of Switzerland|commune]]s where the [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] citizens' participation originates); many cantons allow initiatives to enact regular non-constitutional law, but the federal system does not.

If the necessary number of supporters is reached, the initiative will be put to a [[plebiscite]] about two or three years later; the delay helps prevent short-term political moods from getting into the constitution. The parliament and government will both issue their official opinions on whether they recommend voting for or against the proposed amendment, and these opinions will be published.

The parliament may also pass an alternative amendment suggestion which will also be included on the ballot; in this case, the voters cast two votes, one for whether or not they want an amendment, and one for which one they want, the original one from the initiative or the one introduced in parliament, in case a majority decides for amending.

A citizen-proposed change to the constitution in Switzerland at the national level needs to achieve both a majority of the national popular vote and a majority of the canton-wide vote  to pass. The vast majority of national initiatives introduced since 1891, when the system started, have failed to receive voter support. But the initiatives have proven to be a useful tool to force the government to concentrate on subjects that will otherwise remain hidden from the politic, lowering the distance between the government and the citizens.

==United States ==
{{Main|Initiatives and referendums in the United States}}
{{cn span|In the [[United States]], a popular vote on a measure is referred to as a [[referendum]] only when originating with the [[legislature]]. An initiative may be called a "[[ballot measure]]", "initiative measure", or "proposition".|date=May 2013}}

The United States has no initiative process at the national level, but the initiative is in use at the level of state government in 24 states and the [[Initiatives and referendums in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |title=State by state listing of where initiatives and referendums are used |publisher=Iandrinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211180917/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |archivedate=2016-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also in common use at the local government level.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section I]] of the [[United States Constitution]] [[Vesting Clause|vests]] "all legislative powers herein granted" to the [[United States Congress|Congress of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution, Article I, Section I&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a national initiative procedure would likely require an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the Constitution]], which would under [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] require two-thirds of both houses of Congress or the application of two-thirds of the [[state legislatures]] to propose, and three-fourths of all state legislatures (or conventions in three-fourths of the [[U.S. state|states]]) to ratify. The Constitution itself, pursuant to [[Article VII of the United States Constitution|Article VII]], was ratified by state conventions rather than by a referendum.

Several proposals have been made to institute a national referendum. The [[Ludlow Amendment]], introduced several times to the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Louis Ludlow]], of [[Indiana]], between 1935 and 1940, proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would require a national referendum to [[declare war]] except in the case of invasion or attack. The amendment came closest to overcoming a [[discharge petition]] on January 10, 1938, when it was defeated in the House by a vote of 209 to 188. That was short of the two-thirds vote required for its passage.

Unsuccessful attempts to get initiatives have nevertheless occurred, but since the proposals were bills, not a constitutional amendments, no initiative could probably have lawfully been voted on notwithstanding the bills' passage. The first attempt to get national ballot initiatives occurred in 1907 when House Joint Resolution 44 was introduced by Rep. [[Elmer Fulton]] of [[Oklahoma]]; the proposal was never put to a vote. In 1977, both the Abourezk-Hatfield National Voter Initiative and the Jagt Resolutions never got out of committee. [[Senator Mike Gravel]] was part of that effort.

The modern system of [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] originated in the state of [[South Dakota]], which adopted initiative and referendum in 1898 by a popular vote of 23,816 to 16,483. [[Oregon]] was the second state to adopt and did so in 1902, when the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] adopted it by an overwhelming majority. The "Oregon System," as it was at first known, subsequently spread to many other states, and became one of the signature reforms of the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s-1920s).

==Brazil ==

On Brazil, a popular law initiative requires two conditions to be send to analysis by the national congress: signatures from at least 1% of the people allowed to vote from all the country and at least 0,3% of the people allowed to vote from each of at least 5 of the 27 federal unities (the 26 states plus the federal district). If both conditions are achivied, then the congress is obliged to discus and vote the initiative.

'''Julius Binder''' (May 12, 1870 in [[Würzburg]] &amp;ndash; August 28, 1939 in [[Göttingen]]) was a German [[philosophy of law|philosopher of law]]. He is principally known as an opponent of legal positivism, and for having remained as an active scholar during the 1930s in [[Nazi Germany]] who did not speak out against the prevailing government of that time.

== Life ==
After studying law in Würzburg with honors (1894) and Habilitation (1898), he became professor in Rostock (1900), Erlangen (1903), Würzburg (1913) and Göttingen (1919). He founded the "International Hegel Federal" and became a member of the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]].

After he had applied in earlier works the concept of rights from [[Immanuel Kant]] (as in: "Legal concept and idea of law" from the year 1915), he later became a strong critic of [[Neokantianism|Neokantian]] legal philosophy, especially the philosophy of law of Rudolf Stammler. Since the 1920s, Julius Binder—and later along with Karl Larenz, Gerhard Dulckeit and Walther Schönfeld –- he applied a [[Neohegelian]] approach to jurisprudence in the system of the so-called "objective idealism". Binder was the academic teacher of the German legal philosopher and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] proponent Karl Larenz. He rejected [[legal positivism]].

In addition, Binder, along with others such as [[Ernst Forsthoff]], [[Carl Schmitt]], Karl Larenz among legal philosophers, did not criticize the Nazi legal system.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Arthur: Rechtsphilosophie und Nationalsozialismus.

Since 1890 he was a member of the Corps Bavaria Würzburg.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kösener Corpslisten]] 1960, '''138''', 512&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''justification of the state''' refers to the source of legitimate authority for the [[State (polity)|state]] or [[government]]. Typically, such a justification explains why the state should exist, and to some degree scopes the '''role of government''' - what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do.

There is no single, universally accepted justification of the state. In fact, [[anarchism|anarchists]] believe that there is no justification for the state at all, and that human societies would be better off without it. However, most political [[ideology|ideologies]] have their own justifications, and thus their own vision of what constitutes a legitimate state. Indeed, a person's opinions regarding the role of government often determine the rest of their political ideology. Thus, discrepancy of opinion in a wide array of political matters is often directly traceable back to a discrepancy of opinion in the justification for the state.

The [[constitution]]s of various countries codify views as to the purposes, powers, and forms of their governments, but they tend to do so in rather vague terms, which particular laws, courts, and actions of politicians subsequently flesh out. In general, various countries have translated vague talk about the purposes of their governments into particular state laws, bureaucracies, enforcement actions, etc.

The following are just a few examples.

== Transcendent sovereignty ==
In feudal [[Europe]] the most widespread justification of the state was the emerging idea of the [[divine right of kings]], which stated that monarchs draw their power from [[God]], and that the state should only be an apparatus that puts the monarch's will into practice. The legitimacy of the state's lands derived from the lands being the personal possession of the monarch. The divine-right theory, combined with [[primogeniture]], became a theory of [[hereditary monarchy]] in the [[nation state]]s of the [[early modern]] period.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was not a state in that{{which?|date=November 2017}} sense, and was not a true [[theocracy]], but rather a federal entity.

The political ideas current in [[China]] at that time involved the idea of the [[mandate of heaven]]. It resembled the theory of divine right in that it placed the ruler in a divine position, as the link between Heaven and Earth, but it differed from the divine right of kings in that it did not assume a permanent connection between a [[dynasty]] and the state. Inherent in the concept was that a ruler held the mandate of heaven only as long as he provided good government. If he did not, heaven would withdraw its mandate and whoever restored order would hold the new mandate. This is true theocracy;{{cn|date=November 2017}} the power and wisdom to govern is granted by a higher power, not by human political schemes, and can be equally removed by [[tian | heaven]]. This has similarities to the idea presented in the Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] from the time when Israel requests "a king like the nations" ({{bibleverse| 1 Samuel | 8:5 | KJV}}) through to Christ himself telling his contemporary [[leader]]s that they only had power because God gave it to them.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The classic Biblical example comes in the story of King [[Nebuchadnezzar II | Nebuchadnezzar]], who according to the [[Daniel 4 | Book of Daniel]] ruled the Babylonian empire because God ordained his power, but who later ate grass like a ox for seven years because he deified himself{{cn|date=November 2017}} instead of acknowledging God. Nebuchadnezzar is restored when he again acknowledges God as the true sovereign.

== Self-aggrandizement ==
In [[Renaissance Italy]], contemporary theoreticians saw the primary purpose of the less-overtly monarchical Italian city-states as civic glory.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The social contract ==
In the period of the eighteenth century, usually called [[the Enlightenment]], a new justification of the European state developed. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's [[social contract theory]] states that governments draw their power from the governed, its 'sovereign' people (usually a certain ethnic group, and the state's limits are legitimated theoretically as that people's lands, although that is often not, rarely exactly, the case), that no person should have absolute power, and that a ''legitimate'' state is one which meets the needs and wishes of its citizens. These include security, peace, economic development and the resolution of conflict. Also, the social contract requires that an individual gives up some of his natural rights in order to maintain social order via the rule of law. Eventually, the divine right of kings fell out of favor and this idea ascended; it formed the basis for modern [[democracy]].

==Public goods==
This is an example of the theoretical thinking shifting the emphasis from faith and theoretical principles such as sovereignty to the socio-economic logic, as Karl Marx did.
Thus modern political theorists typically legitimize the state with two major ideas: redistribution and the provision of public goods. In ''The Limits of Government'', philosopher [[David Schmidtz]] takes on the second of these ideas.
While a market system may allow self-interested to create and allocate many goods optimally, there exists a class of "collective" - or "public goods" that are not produced adequately in a market system. These collective goods are goods that all individuals want but for whose production it is often not individually rational for people voluntarily to do their part to secure a collectively rational outcome. The state can step in and force us all to contribute toward the production of these goods, and we can all thereby be made better off. There are actually many different opinions when it comes to this topic.

==Political ideologies==
It is on those questions that one can find the differences between [[conservatism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[libertarianism]], [[fascism]], especially the latter, and other political ideologies. There are also two ideologies - [[anarchism]] and [[communism]] - which argue that the existence of the state is ultimately unjustified and harmful. For this reason, the kind of society they aim to establish would be stateless.

Anarchism claims that the community of those fighting to create a new society must themselves constitute a [[stateless society]]. Communism wishes to immediately or eventually replace the communities, unities and divisions that things such as work, money, exchange, borders, nations, governments, police, religion, and race create with the universal community possible when these things are replaced.&lt;ref&gt;http://prole.info/wcpw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State socialism]] states that the degree to which a state is working class is the degree to which it fights government, class, work, and rule. The degree to which it wins such a fight is held to be the degree to which it is communist instead of capitalist, socialist, or the state. [[Anarcho-capitalism]] argues that taxes are theft, that government and the business community complicit in governance is [[organized crime]] and is equivalent to the criminal underworld, and that defense of life and property is just another industry, which must be privatized. [[Anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-collectivism]] says that taxes, being theft, are just property, which is also theft, and that the state is inherently capitalist and will never result in a transition to communism, and says that those fighting against capitalism and the state to produce a communist society must themselves already form such a community. However, the majority of viewpoints agree that the existence of ''some'' kind of government is morally justified. What they disagree about is the proper role and the proper form of that government.

There are several ways to conceive of the differences between these different political views. For example, one might ask ''in what areas'' should the government have jurisdiction, to ''what extent'' it may intervene in those areas, or even what constitutes ''intervention'' in the first place.  Some institutions can be said to exist only because the government provides the framework for their existence; for instance, [[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that the institution of [[property|private property]] only exists due to government.  The intervention debate can be framed in terms of [[big government]] versus [[small government]].

{{LGBT rights}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''rights in Asia''' are limited in comparison to many other areas of the world. Same-sex sexual activity is outlawed in at least twenty Asian countries. While at least eight countries have enacted protections for LGBT people, only [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan]] provide a wider range of [[LGBT rights]] - including same-sex relationship recognition.

In [[Afghanistan]], [[Brunei]], [[Iran]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]], homosexual activity is punished with the death penalty.&lt;ref name="ILGA"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Sponsored Homophobia 2016: A world survey of sexual orientation laws: criminalisation, protection and recognition|url=http://ilga.org/downloads/02_ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2016_ENG_WEB_150516.pdf|work=[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]]|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="10Countries"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/ |title=Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punished by death |publisher=The Washington Post |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment such as [[imprisonment]]. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority countries such as [[Azerbaijan]], [[Jordan]], and [[Turkey]], homosexuality is legal, but usually socially unacceptable.

Egalitarian relationships modeled on the Western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare.&lt;ref name="10Countries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="http://muslimvillage.com/author/mv-media/ MV Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimvillage.com/2014/04/20/52563/brunei-sultan-institutes-death-penalty-for-homosexuality/|title=Brunei: Sultan institutes death penalty for homosexuality|author=[http://muslimvillage.com/author/mv-media/ MV Media]|publisher=Muslim Village|date=20 April 2014|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |title=7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts |publisher=ILGA |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029185853/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |archivedate=2009-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambodia]], [[East Timor]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Cyprus]] (excluding Northern Cyprus) are viewed as the most open to the LGBT community in Asia. Japan, Israel, Thailand, Taiwan and Nepal are the major players in legislation. {{as of|2018}}, only the [[British Overseas Territories]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] and the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] have legalized [[same-sex marriage]].

In a 2011 [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN General Assembly declaration for LGBT rights]], state parties were given a chance to express their support or opposition on the topic. Only [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Thailand]], and [[East Timor]] expressed their support. They were later joined by Vietnam and the Philippines. State parties who expressed opposition were [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], the [[Maldives]], [[North Korea]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tajikistan]]. Other Asian parties did not show support or opposition.

The first and only LGBT political party in the world, [[Ladlad]], was established in the Philippines in 2003.

In 2016, during an African-led coalition to dislodge the recently established UN expert on LGBT issues, the majority of Asian nations backed to retain the role of the UN LGBT expert, with only Muslim nations, with the addition of China and Singapore, declaring their opposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2402">In [[criminal law]], '''lying in wait''' refers to the act of hiding and waiting for an individual with the intent to kill that person or inflict serious bodily harm to that person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindserpent.com/American_History/reference/1999_Black_7/sec_l.pdf {{smallcaps|Black's Law Dictionary}}], ''Lying in wait'' (Accessed January 29, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Because lying in wait involves [[Malice aforethought|premeditation]], some jurisdictions have established that lying in wait is considered an [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstance]] that allows for the imposition of harsher criminal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindserpent.com/American_History/reference/1999_Black_7/sec_l.pdf {{smallcaps|Black's Law Dictionary}}], ''Lying in wait'' (Accessed January 29, 2016); see also H.

Rev. 311, 313 (2003) (discussing application of special circumstances when criminal defendants lie in wait).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have traced the origins of this doctrine as far back as 1389, when the [[English Parliament]] passed a law that denied the right of pardon to individuals who killed while lying in wait.&lt;ref&gt;H. Mitchell Caldwell, [http://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1477&amp;context=umlr ''The Prostitution of Lying in Wait''], 57 U. Miami L. Rev. 311, 313 (2003) (citing 13 Rich. 2, c.l (1389)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794, [[Pennsylvania]] passed a law that defined first degree murder as "[a]ll murder which shall be perpetrated ... by lying in wait".&lt;ref&gt;''Schad v. Arizona'', 501 U.S. 624, 641-42 n.8 (1991) (internal citations and quotations omitted) (discussing origins of doctrine).&lt;/ref&gt; Many states modeled their penal codes after the Pennsylvania law, but by the beginning of the twenty first century, only four states identified "lying in wait" as a "death qualifying act".&lt;ref&gt;H.

'''''McGowan v. Maryland''''', 366 U.S. 420 (1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McGowan v. Maryland|366|420|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the court held that laws with religious origins are not unconstitutional if they have a [[Secularism|secular]] purpose.

==Background==
A large discount store in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]] was fined for selling goods on a Sunday, in violation of a local [[blue law]].  The Court rejected an establishment clause challenge to laws saying that most large-scale commercial enterprises remain closed on Sundays. The Court's review of the history demonstrated that Sunday closing laws were originally efforts to promote [[church attendance]]. "But, despite the strongly religious origin of these laws, non religious arguments for Sunday closing began to be heard more distinctly."

The Court said that the Constitution does not ban federal or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of some or all religions. It concluded that, as currently written and administered, most Sunday closing laws are of a secular rather than religious character. They provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens. To say that the State cannot prescribe Sunday as a day of rest for these purposes solely because centuries ago such laws had their genesis in religion would give a constitutional interpretation of hostility to the public welfare rather than one of mere separation of church and state.

==Constitutional text==
The relevant clauses of the 1st and 14th Amendments to the [[United States Constitution]]:

===The 1st Amendment===

:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

===Section 1 of the 14th Amendment===

:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

==The court's decision==
The Court held that Maryland's laws did not violate the First Amendment. The plaintiffs claimed only economic injury, not that they had been prevented from the free exercise of their religion. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Warren concluded:

:[The] appellants allege only economic injury to themselves; they do not allege any infringement of their own religious freedoms due to Sunday closing. In fact, the record is silent as to what appellants' religious beliefs are. Since the general rule is that "a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities," (''[[United States v. Raines]]'', 362 U.S. 17, 22) we hold that appellants have no standing to raise this contention.

The Court also held that the law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren again:

:...the Court has [previously] held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power [even when], in practice, their laws result in some inequality.

In reaching their conclusion, the Court also examined the wider question of whether laws proscribing or limiting Sunday trading were constitutional. They held that such laws did not violate the [[Separation of church and state|division between church and state]], because - no matter the historical roots of such laws - the laws existed as constituted in order to fulfill a secular objective. In other words, even if Sunday trading laws were originally intended to facilitate and encourage church attendance in the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial United States]], the laws as presently constituted were intended to improve the "health, safety, recreation, and general well-being" of citizens. The present purpose of the laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all; the fact that this day is of particular significance for one or more religions does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals in this manner.

In a dissent, Justice Douglas argued that the Sunday closing laws were an attempt by the Protestant majority to impose its beliefs on the country. He wrote:

:The Court picks and chooses language from various decisions to bolster its conclusion that these Sunday laws, in the modern setting, are "civil regulations." No matter how much is written, no matter what is said, the parentage of these laws is the Fourth Commandment, and they serve and satisfy the religious predispositions of our Christian communities. (Also:)  “The First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom to flourish — whether the result is to produce Catholics, Jews, or Protestants, or to turn the people toward the path of Buddha, or to end in a predominantly Moslem nation, or to produce in the long run atheists or agnostics. On matters of this kind government must be neutral.”

[[File:Cold war europe military alliances map en.png|thumb|Two military alliances ([[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact]]) in Europe during the [[Cold War]]]]
A '''military alliance''' is an [[international agreement]] concerning [[national security]], when the contracting parties agree to mutual protection and support in case of a [[crisis]] that has not been identified in advance.&lt;ref name="Bergsman2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergsmann |first=Stefan |chapter=The Concept of Military Alliance |title=Small States and Alliances |year=2001 |pages=25–37 |isbn=978-3-7908-2492-6 |chapterurl=http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/05_small_states_04.pdf}} {{ISBN|978-3-662-13000-1}} (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; Military alliances differ from [[coalition|coalitions]], as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.&lt;ref name="Bergsman2001"/&gt;

Military alliances can be classified into [[defense pact|defense pacts]], [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression pacts]] and [[entente (type of alliance)|ententes]].&lt;ref name="KrauseSinger2001"&gt;{{cite book |first=Volker |last=Krause |first2=J. David |last2=Singer |chapter=Minor Powers, Alliances, And Armed Conflict: Some Preliminary Patterns |title=Small States and Alliances |year=2001 |pages=15–23 |isbn=978-3-7908-2492-6 |chapterurl=http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/05_small_states_03.pdf}} ({{ISBN|978-3-662-13000-1}} (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Military alliances are related to [[collective security]] systems but can differ in nature.  An early 1950s memorandum from the [[United States Department of State]] explained the difference by saying, that historically alliances "were designed to advance the respective nationalistic interests of the parties, and provided for joint military action if one of the parties in pursuit of such objectives became involved in war".  While a collective security arrangement  "is directed against no one; it is directed solely against aggression. It seeks not to influence any shifting 'balance of power' but to strengthen the 'balance of principle'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Imperial Temptation: The New World Order and America's Purpose |last=Tucker |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert W. Tucker |first2=David C. |last2=Hendrickson |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |year=1992 |pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obvious motivation in states engaging in military alliances is to protect themselves against threats from other countries.  However states have also entered into alliances to improve ties with a particular nation or to manage conflict with a particular nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weitsman |title=Dangerous Alliances |pages=18–19}}{{full|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of alliances, including their formation and cohesiveness (or lack thereof), is a subject of much academic study past and present, with the leading scholars generally considered to be [[Glenn H. Snyder]] and [[Stephen Walt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www18.georgetown.edu/data/people/dlb32/publication-31923.pdf |title=Remaking Alliances for the War on Terrorism |first=Daniel |last=Byman  |authorlink=Daniel Byman |journal=The Journal of Strategy Studies |volume=29 |number=5 |date=October 2006 |pages=767–811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European historiography ==

In the European historical context, a military alliance can be viewed as a league between independent states, defined by treaty, for the purpose of combined action, defensive or offensive, or both. Alliances have often been directed to specific objects carefully defined in the treaties. Thus the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance of 1668]] between Great Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands, and the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance of 1689]] between the Holy Roman Empire, Holland, England, Spain and Saxony, were both directed against the power of [[Louis XIV of France]]. The Quadruple or Grand Alliance of 1814, defined in the [[Treaty of Chaumont]], between Great Britain, Austria, Russia and Prussia, had for its object the overthrow of [[Napoleon]] and his dynasty, and the confining of France within her traditional boundaries. The [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] between Germany, Austria and Italy was ostensibly directed to the preservation of European peace against any possible aggressive action of France or Russia; and this led in turn, some ten years later, to the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance between Russia and France]], for mutual support in case of any hostile action of the other powers.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=695}}

Occasionally, however, attempts have been made to give alliances a more general character. Thus the [[Holy Alliance]] of 26 September 1815 was an attempt, inspired by the religious idealism of the Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], to find in the "sacred precepts of the Gospel",{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=695}} a common basis for a general league of the European governments, its object being, primarily, the preservation of peace. So, too, by Article VI of the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Treaty]] signed at Paris on 20 November 1815 – which renewed that of Chaumont and was again renewed, in 1818, at [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] –  the scope of the Grand Alliance was extended to objects of common interest not specifically stated in the treaties. The article runs: "In order to consolidate the intimate tie which unites the four sovereigns for the happiness of the world, the High Contracting Powers have agreed to renew at fixed intervals, either under their own auspices or by their respective ministers, meetings consecrated to great common objects and to the examination of such measures as at each one of these epochs shall be judged most salutary for the peace and prosperity of the nations and the maintenance of the tranquillity of Europe".{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=695}}

It was this article of the treaty of the 20 November 1815, rather than the Holy Alliance, that formed the basis of the serious effort made by the great powers, between 1815 and 1822, to govern Europe in concert. In general it proved that an alliance, to be effective, must be clearly defined as to its objects, and that in the long run the treaty in which these objects are defined must – to quote [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s somewhat cynical dictum – "be reinforced by the interests" of the parties concerned.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=695}} Yet the "moral alliance" of Europe, as Count [[Karl Nesselrode]] called it,{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=695}} though it failed to secure the permanent harmony of the powers, was an effective instrument for peace during the years immediately following the downfall of Napoleon; and it set the precedent for those periodical meetings of the representatives of the powers, for the discussion and settlement of questions of international importance, which, though cumbrous and inefficient for constructive work, contributed much to the preservation of the general peace during much of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=695}}

'''Miller Park''' is a [[baseball park]] located in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. It is home to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and was completed in 2001 as a replacement for [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The park is located just southwest of the intersection of [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|Interstate&amp;nbsp;94]] and Miller Park Way. The title sponsor is the [[Miller Brewing Company]]. Miller's contract with the stadium was for $40 million, and runs until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportsbusiness/s/stadiumnames.html|title=ESPN.com: SPORTSBUSINESS - Stadium naming rights|website=espn.go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller Park features [[North America]]'s only fan-shaped convertible roof, which can open and close in less than 10&amp;nbsp;minutes. Large panes of glass allow natural grass to grow, augmented with [[infrared lamp|heat lamp]] structures wheeled out across the field during the off-season.

==Construction==
[[File:Milwaukee Miller Park brewer satellite view.png|300px|thumb|left|Miller Park during construction on March 31, 2000. Milwaukee County Stadium is adjacent.]]
Miller Park is one of the largest construction projects in Wisconsin history.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts, Figures &amp; Rules|url=http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/mil/ballpark/mil_ballpark_field.jsp|work=Milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miller Park|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/millerpark-milwaukee-wi-usa|work=Emporis.com|publisher=EMPORIS GMBH|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built with US$290 million of public funds from a 0.1% [[sales tax]] that began January 1, 1996, and is scheduled for retirement upon completion, sometime around 2017. The tax is applied on purchases in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and four surrounding counties: [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee]], [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]], [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington]], and [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha]]. The tax was controversial, in part because of the notion of using public funds for a privately owned sports team. The [[Wisconsin State Senate|state senator]] who cast the deciding vote in the funding bill, [[George Petak]] of [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], lost a [[recall election]] based on his vote for the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Inaugural Ball|first=Drew|last=Olson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tDEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SjAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6194,9717124&amp;dq=en|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=March 31, 2001|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greg-bromberg.blogs.sportsline.com/mcc/blogs/view/5814658?tag=George%20Petak|title=Miller Park a testament to America's pastime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundbreaking took place on November 9, 1996, in a parking lot behind County Stadium. Originally scheduled to open in 2000, Miller Park's construction was delayed after three construction workers were [[Big Blue Crane collapse|killed in an accident]]. A [[Lampson International|Lampson]] Transi-lift crane 3 (nicknamed "Big Blue"), brought in to build the roof, collapsed while lifting a 450-ton roof section, during windy conditions, on July 14, 1999, killing three workers. A camera crew was filming construction of the stadium on that day and captured the collapse on video as it occurred. Repair work and an investigation forced the Brewers to stay in County Stadium for one more year, until 2001.  There was some talk of having the Brewers move to Miller Park in the middle of 2000, but it was determined that too many corners would need to be cut for it to be a realistic possibility.&lt;ref name=Storied&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MillerParkStadium.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Exterior view showing retractable roof]]
The stadium has a retractable roof, built in a unique fan-shaped style, with the roof panels opening and closing simultaneously in a sweeping manner from the first- and third-base sides toward center field. The complex and massive roof was a significant factor in the $392 million cost of the stadium. It allows the seating area to be heated 30&amp;nbsp;°F warmer than the outside temperature when closed, allowing games to be played in inclement weather and in more comfortable conditions than an open-air stadium. The idea of the stadium having a retractable roof had been considered right away in the initial design, as to help counter the unpredictable Wisconsin weather in the early spring and late autumn.

[[File:MillerPark2.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Miller Park in 2006]]The design team was appointed after a design competition in the mid-1990s. The architectural concept for the stadium was developed by the Los Angeles-based sports and entertainment team [[NBBJ]], who worked closely with a Los Angeles-based team of engineers [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], who were responsible for all stages of the structural and building services engineering design for the stadium, with the exception of the mechanical mechanisms that move the roof structure. The original versions of these mechanisms were designed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America as part of a design and build contract, but they have now been replaced by new designs after their failure. The executive architect responsible for the delivery of the final stadium design was a Dallas-based team of [[HKS, Inc.]] In addition to these major players there were a significant contributions from local teams including Eppstein Uhen Architects.

The stadium design followed the trend of retro-designed ballparks with current amenities that began in 1992 with [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in [[Baltimore]].

The original grass playing surface was installed on March 10, 2001, with County Stadium's surface infield dirt and [[home plate]] transplanted into the new stadium.

===Structural challenges===
[[File:Milwaukee_Miller_Park_2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Miller Park in 2009]]
The unconventional [[Fan (implement)|fan]]-shaped [[retractable roof]] has not been without complications. Major elements of the pivot system behind home plate and the outfield roof track have been replaced, even after the crane incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Design Flaws Noted in Miller Park Foof|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www2.jsonline.com/sports/brew/mpark/apr02/36057.asp|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=April 17, 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214065844/http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brew/mpark/apr02/36057.asp|archivedate=February 14, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2006 season, the roof's [[bogie]] system was replaced at a cost of over $13 million. The 10 new, 24-feet-(7.3&amp;nbsp;m)-long, {{convert|60|hp}} bogies were paid for with money from the settlement between the stadium district and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of America]]. Six of the bogies weigh 66 tons apiece, while the four others weigh 49 tons. The work was completed by lifting sections of the roof approximately six inches with [[Enerpac]] hydraulic lifts, while a 300-ton crane replaced the bogies individually. "The bogies will last for the life of the facility," said Mike Duckett, executive director of the Miller Park stadium district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Baseball Season Ends, Stadium Roof Repair Begins|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=502143|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=September 21, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031093908/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=502143|archivedate=October 31, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was completed by the start of the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grainger.com/content/supplylink-hydraulics-repairs|title=Hydraulic Tools Help Heavy-Duty Repairs – Grainger Industrial Supply|website=www.grainger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miller Park Roof Is Back At Full Speed|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/businessofsports/archive/2007/07/13/miller-park-roof-is-back-at-full-speed.aspx|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=July 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141452/http://blogs.jsonline.com/businessofsports/archive/2007/07/13/miller-park-roof-is-back-at-full-speed.aspx|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue resulting from the design of the roof and the adjacent large glass panels is that, during day games when the roof is fully open, shadows cover home plate and the batters boxes, while the pitchers mound is in full sunlight. This was a safety concern for batters, and was addressed during the 2010 season, when it was determined that a larger shadow would cover both home plate and the pitchers mound if only one half of the roof was opened.  This tactic continues to be used.

===Additions===
In time for the 2006 season there were three additions to the stadium. Two sets of LED scoreboards were added. One replaced the formerly manually operated "out of town" scoreboards along the left and right field walls with a new set of [[LED]] scoreboards along the left-field wall. The new "out of town" scoreboards show continually updated information about other Major League games, including the score, hits, errors, outs, and an image of the field displaying the runners on base. A second-tier marquee scoreboard was also added along the bottom of the 300-level of the stadium stretching from foul pole to home plate to foul pole, with the portion closest to the foul lines used to provide [[closed captioning|open captions]] of announcements from the [[public address system]] and advertisements. The section of the second-tier scoreboard above home plate displays statistics for those unable to see the main scoreboard above the center-field wall. The final addition to Miller Park for the 2006 season was the addition of a field-level picnic area in the corner of right-field. The picnic area has a capacity of 75 and provides a place for fans to watch the game in a leisurely setting and be within feet of the right-fielder. Known first as the Mercedes-Benz Field Haus, the picnic area's name was changed to [[AirTran Airways]] Landing Zone in 2009, and later to the current name, the ATI Club.

[[File:Miller_Park_panorama,_Milwaukee,_August_2013.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Miller Park panorama from August 20, 2013.]]
During the 2007 season, as the Brewers got closer to the team record of home runs in a season, a home run counter was added to the right of the center field scoreboard. In the shape of a gas pump, the counter was sponsored by [[Citgo]], whose name could be seen as a play on words for a home run (C-It-Go). The counter kept track of the home runs hit by the Brewers during the season and when a home run was hit, the player's name was shown on the display as well as the distance of the home run. The Citgo home run counter was removed after the 2009 season.

Early into the 2008 season, the Brewers also added a sponsored strikeout counter to the tier of the second deck of the right field bleachers, which illuminates a K when a Brewers' pitcher notches a strikeout and keeps track of how many strikeouts as a team the Brewers have.  Prior to this addition, Bernie Brewer would hang strikeout K's from the railing of his club house, including backwards K's to denote a [[Baseball scorekeeping#Outs|called strike three]].

In 2009, Miller Park's outfield was replaced with "Lo-Mo" [[Kentucky bluegrass]] just like the infield was the prior year. The new turf, common in other ballparks around baseball, is denser and has a sand base, instead of the sand and clay mix under the original grass. The turf yields truer hops and fewer instances in which the baseball skips under an outfielder's glove than the previous turf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brewers Playing on Improved Turf|first=Adam|last=McCalvy|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090414&amp;content_id=4260030&amp;vkey=news_mil&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mil|work=milwaukeebrewers.com|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also for the 2009 season, the [[Harley-Davidson]] Deck was opened on the field level of the stadium in left-center field.

During the off-season between 2010 and 2011, the stadium's original centerfield scoreboard (a smaller videoboard atop a larger black and amber message display board) was replaced by a full length and full color [[Daktronics]] [[1080p]] [[high definition television|high definition]] display board which is the ninth-largest screen among current MLB stadiums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/acrobat/2013-04/176488360-14165153.pdf|title=Baseball stadiums by the board|date=14 April 2012|format=PDF Graphic|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a public address/sound system upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Miller Park to Get Bigger, Better Scoreboard|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/97990759.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance==
[[File:View behind home plate at Miller Park.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The view from behind home plate.]]
From the year Miller Park opened in 2001, the Brewers have averaged 31,783 fans per game, or 2,574,423 per season, while placing 11th out of 30 franchises in total attendance, despite having only seven winning seasons through the 2018 season, and having won only two MLB playoff series in just five total series appearances, and having the smallest market size of any Major League city.&lt;ref&gt;https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2013/05/30/milwaukee-still-the-smallest-metropolitan-area-with-a-major-league-baseball-team/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Brewers set a franchise record of 3,071,373, and beginning in 2004 they have attracted at least two-million fans; an ongoing streak of fifteen consecutive years, the twelfth longest in Major League history. Prior to Miller Park, the previous such consecutive streak in Milwaukee baseball history was four years, from 1954 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/mlb/attendance/_/year/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/attend.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIL/attend.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
[[File:Sausage race.jpg|thumb|right|The sausages running along the 3rd base side.]]
* [[Bernie Brewer]], the team mascot, has a club house above the left field seats. Following every Brewers home run and victory, Bernie Brewer slides into a home plate shaped platform (The Kalahari "Splash Zone" was discontinued for the 2012 season). This is different from his old home at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], where Bernie slid into a giant mug of beer in center field which had been sponsored over the years by [[Pabst Blue Ribbon|Pabst]], Miller, and [[Sentry Foods]]. During the home run celebration, a short burst of fireworks is shot out from the top of the center field scoreboard, and above Bernie's club house, the call words of Brewers' radio announcer [[Bob Uecker]] are illuminated, "Get Up, Get Up, Get Outta Here, Gone!"
* The [[Hank the Dog]] mascot made his debut on September 13, 2014. Hank the real dog was found wandering the field at the [[Spring training]] complex in [[Maryvale Baseball Park|Maryvale, Arizona]] on February 17, 2014. He was named after former Brewer and Braves great Hank Aaron. He would soon become an international sensation.&lt;ref name="2015 Milwaukee Brewers Media Guide"&gt;2015 Milwaukee Brewers Media Guide&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Barrelman mascot made his debut on April 6, 2015. The barrelman served as the team's primary logo from 1970–1977.&lt;ref name="2015 Milwaukee Brewers Media Guide"/&gt;
* The Johnsonville&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2018/01/24/johnsonville-take-over-sponsorship-famous-racing-sausages/1063054001/|title=Johnsonville takes over sponsorship of Famous Racing Sausages|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sausage Race]] occurs during each game in the middle of the 6th inning; it was moved from the bottom of the 6th inning to enable the sausages to create more excitement for the fans as the Brewers prepared to bat. The current "racing sausages" are the [[Bratwurst]], the [[Polish sausage|Polish]], the [[Italian sausage|Italian]], the [[Hot Dog]] and the [[Chorizo]]. The chorizo sausage (to salute the region's growing [[Latino]] population) was added on July 29, 2006 for one race, and became a full-time participant in 2007.

==Notable events==

===Baseball===
[[File:Miller Park, Brewers vs. Reds (August 17, 2013).JPG|Batting practice prior to a Milwaukee Brewers-Cincinnati Reds game  on August 17, 2013|thumb|500px]]
On opening day April 6, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] and MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] had first pitch honors for the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/articles/Miller-Park-in-Milwaukee-Wisconsin.html|title=Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin|website=www.city-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/mil/ballpark/history.jsp|title=Miller Park Information|website=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park hosted the [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 MLB All-Star Game]], which ended infamously in a tie.

In April 2007, [[Winter storms of 2006–07|snow storms in northern Ohio]] caused the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] to postpone their [[Opening Day|home opening series]] against the [[2007 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] and forced the Indians to find a different location for their home series against the [[2007 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. Major League Baseball took advantage of Miller Park's roof and moved the Indians-Angels series to Milwaukee. All seats were sold for $10 apiece, and attendance was 52,496 for the three games.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070409&amp;content_id=1888109|title=Angels-Indians Series Moved|accessdate=February 15, 2009|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=April 9, 2007|publisher=MLB.com|location=Cleveland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was a reminder to many of the 1989 film ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', which featured scenes filmed in [[Milwaukee County Stadium#Movie location|Milwaukee County Stadium]], though the film was about a fictionalized Cleveland Indians team. The first game of the series was played on the same day that the film's "Wild Thing Edition" was released on DVD. When [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]] came in to [[Closer (baseball)|close]] for the Indians, the song [[Wild Thing (Chip Taylor song)#Troggs single|"Wild Thing"]] was played over the PA system, in an homage to the film. Also, the Indians' mascot [[Slider (mascot)|Slider]] slid down Bernie Brewer's slide following Indians home runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2832830|title=Indians Feel Right at Home in Milwaukee|accessdate=February 15, 2009|last=Drehs|first=Wayne|date=April 10, 2007|publisher=ESPN.com|location=Milwaukee|quote=Even Slider, the team's mascot, got into the act, making the trip to Milwaukee so he could twist his way down Bernie Brewer's slide after [[Kelly Shoppach]] and [[Casey Blake]] hit Indians' home runs. In the top of the ninth, when Borowski came in to close out the game, the Miller Park sound system blasted "Wild Thing", a tribute to the baseball classic "Major League", which was filmed in Milwaukee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games were the first to be played under [[American League]] rules in Milwaukee since 1997 (the Brewers' final season in the AL), and have been the only games played under AL rules in Miller Park.

[[Hurricane Ike]]'s landfall in Houston forced the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Houston Astros]] to play a two-game series at Miller Park on Sunday, September 14 and Monday, September 15, 2008.&lt;ref name="jsonline1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cubs-Astros to Play At Miller Park|first=Tom|last=Haudricourt|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/32536479.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=September 14, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park became the first neutral site in [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] history to host a [[no-hitter]], when [[Carlos Zambrano]] of the Chicago Cubs threw the first no-hitter in the history of the park against the Houston Astros on Sunday, September 14, 2008. The next day, his teammate [[Ted Lilly]], took a no-hitter into the 7th inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zambrano Throws No-Hitter as Cubs Beat Astros 5-0 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=5801676 |work=[[ABC News]] |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304233903/http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=5801676 |archivedate=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zambrano's First No-No Is Also First At Miller Park|first=Charles F.|last=Gardner|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/32534739.html|publisher=jsonline.com|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2009|quote=Zambrano, who pitched the first no-hitter in the history of Miller Park, smiled as he talked about how much he likes to pitch in the Brewers' stadium. "I like the mound, and it's a beautiful ballpark," Zambrano said. "I wish we had a new ballpark, a clubhouse like that."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bowling===
Miller Park hosted the 2007 [[United States Bowling Congress]] Masters finals on Sunday, October 28, 2007. The playing surface was fitted with four bowling lanes for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Brewers press release, [http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070524&amp;content_id=1983483&amp;vkey=pr_mil&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mil "Miller Park to host 2007 USBC Masters finals"], MLB.com, May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro football===
Miller Park was one of the venues being considered for a [[United Football League (2009–)|United Football League]] expansion team according to former league commissioner Michael Huyghue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More Pro Football in Milwaukee?|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/57272617.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=September 4, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Brewers maintain that Miller Park was not built with the intention of also fielding a football team, though the stadium in the early 90's was planned to have a football layout before the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] decided to play in Green Bay full-time after the 1994 season and subsequent redesigns as a baseball-only facility.

===Soccer===
During the 2014 All-Star break, Miller Park hosted an untelevised [[Exhibition game|international friendly match]] between [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[C.D. Guadalajara|Chivas of Guadalajara]] on July 16, 2014. The [[association football|soccer]] pitch was laid out in a first baseline-to-left field configuration, with a narrower width than a standard soccer pitch due to the constraints of the field. The teams played to a 1-1 draw in front of about 31,000 in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wisn.com/sports/swansea-city-chivas-guadalajara-tie-at-miller-park/26995086#!biTdmf|title=More than 31,000 watch soccer at Miller Park; Swansea City, Chivas Guadalajara play to 1-1 tie|date=17 July 2014|publisher=[[WISN-TV]] Milwaukee|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015 All-Star Break, Miller Park hosted a friendly between Mexican side [[Club Atlas]] and English [[Premier League]] side [[Newcastle United]] on July 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Announce 2015/16 Pre-Season Schedule|url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20150604/united-announce-201516-pre-season-schedule_2281670_4763102|website=NUFC.co.uk|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Club Atlas won the match 2-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/soccer/fast-start-lifts-atlas-over-newcastle-at-miller-park-b99537747z1-315162031.html|title=Fast start lifts Atlas over Newcastle at Miller Park|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three year hiatus, Miller Park once again hosted a friendly match between Mexican sides [[C.F. Pachuca]] and [[Club León]].  Pachuca won the match 3-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C.F. Pachuca beats Club Leon in third-ever friendly at Miller Park|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/2018/07/11/pachuca-tops-leon-third-ever-soccer-match-miller-park/773272002|website=jsonline.com|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie premiere===
On August 11, 2012 Miller Park hosted an event called "Field of Honor: A Salute to the Greatest Generation". Over 30,000 tickets were sold for the event, which included the premiere showing of ''Honor Flight'', a documentary detailing the [[Honor Flight]] movement, where veterans of World War II are flown into Washington, D.C. on commercial flights via donations and non-profit organizations in order to visit the [[National World War II Memorial]] in person. The promoters were hoping to best a world record for a movie premiere attendance, previously held for the premiere in Brazil of a soccer film.

===Arctic Tailgate===
The Arctic Tailgate is an annual event where fans camp outside Miller Park the day before single game tickets are sold, which is usually the last weekend of February (it is delayed or moved into the stadium's heated concourse if the temperatures are well below {{convert|0|F|C}} for the safety of fans). The tradition is said to have started as early as the 1990s where Brewers fans would try to be the first to acquire tickets for Opening Day. Since 2006, the Brewers have made it an official event, even providing the waiting fans coffee, hot chocolate, and doughnuts in the morning, discounts on tickets for the first week of games in the season, as well as a free lunch consisting of a hot dog, chips, and a soda, eaten in a heated tent afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/mil/ticketing/arctic_tailgate.jsp|title=Brewers Arctic Tailgate|publisher=brewers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 101,000 tickets were sold for the 2015 Arctic Tailgate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haudricourt|first1=Tom|title=Brewers sell 101,000 tickets at Arctic Tailgate|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/294525571.html|website=JSOnline.com|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Film===
Miller Park was also a major filming location for the motion picture ''[[Mr. 3000]]'', which centered on a fictional Brewers player played by the late comedian [[Bernie Mac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonbaas.com/mr3000_weblog.html|title=Jon Baas - "Mr. 3000" on-set journal entries|first=Jon|last=Baas|website=www.jonbaas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicknames===
Miller Park is commonly referred to as "Wrigley North" by the fans of rival [[Chicago Cubs]]. The nickname is a play on [[Wrigley Field]] since Miller Park is north of Wrigley Field and fans from Chicago frequently travel to Miller Park due to its close proximity when the Brewers are playing the Cubs. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisn.com/article/brewers-fans-tired-of-cubs-fans-filling-miller-park/22988416&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2018/02/08/brewers-give-wisconsin-residents-first-shot-tickets-home-games-against-cubs/318381002/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''''Mitchel v. Reynolds'''''&lt;ref&gt;1 PWms 181, 24 ER 347, 45 Digest (Repl) 395, [1558-1774] All ER Rep 26&lt;/ref&gt; is a landmark decision in the history of the law of [[restraint of trade]]. It is generally cited for establishing the principle that reasonable restraints of trade, unlike unreasonable restraints of trade, are permissible and therefore enforceable and not a basis for civil or criminal liability. It is largely the basis in US antitrust law for the "[[rule of reason]]."&lt;ref&gt;See ''National Soc'y of Professional Engineers v. United States'', 435 U.S. 679, 689 (1978) (the rule of reason is the "standard for testing the enforceability of covenants in restraint of trade which are ancillary to a legitimate transaction").&lt;/ref&gt; William Howard Taft, then Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, later US President and then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, quoted ''Mitchel'' extensively when he first developed the antitrust rule-of-reason doctrine in ''United States v. Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;85 F. 271 (6th Cir. 1898)&lt;/ref&gt; which was affirmed in 1899 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. United States]]. See ''Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.'', 485 U.S. 717, 737-39 (1988) (dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens: "Although Judge Taft was writing as a Circuit Judge, his opinion is universally accepted as authoritative.").&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine also played a major role in the 1911 Supreme Court case ''[[Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States]]'' 221 U.S. 1 (1911).&lt;ref&gt;''Mitchel'' is also referred to in ''Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.'', 485 U.S. 717, 729 n.3 (1988), in which the Supreme Court declared certain  types of price fixing to be potentially reasonable.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mitchel'' is also cited for the proposition that usually harmful practices may be rebuttably presumed unlawful, so that the burden of showing legitimacy is placed on the proponent of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;See concurring opinion of Justice White in ''United States v. Singer Mfg. Co''., 374 U.S. 174 (1963), where he argued that defrauding the patent office should be at least rebuttably presumed illegal under the antitrust laws, citing ''Mitchel''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factual setting ==
[[File:Pen Baker.jpg|thum|right|300px|A bake shop]]
Reynolds was a baker at [[St Andrew Holborn (parish)|St Andrew Holborn]], which included both [[Lincoln's Inn]] and [[Gray's Inn]], and therefore a considerable number of lawyers. In this litigation-prone environment, Reynolds chose to rent his bakeshop business to Mitchel for five years and gave Mitchel a bond for £50 with the condition that the bond would be void if Reynolds refrained from acting as a baker in the parish for the next five years. Reynolds resumed his trade as a baker at another location in the parish within the five years, and Mitchel sued on the bond.

== The lawsuit ==

Reynolds defended by demurrer, contending that the bond was void because it was on a restraint of trade. His position was that any such restraint of trade was illegal per se, since it prevented him from exercising his trade as a baker.

Although general restraints of trade are unlawful, the court of the Queen's Bench, per Chief Justice Parker (Lord Macclesfield), held this restraint of trade reasonable and therefore lawful.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitchel v. Reynolds'', 1 P. Wms. 181, 24 E.R. 347 (Q.B. 1711).&lt;/ref&gt; It was ancillary to a legitimate transaction (the rental or sale of the bakeshop business) and it was reasonably necessary to effectuate the main purpose. Its extent was limited to what was necessary to accomplish the main purpose of the transaction. If Reynolds reopened his bakery business, he would attract his old customers and deprive Mitchel of the benefit of his bargain with Reynolds, which included the goodwill of the business (i.e., the habit of the customers to continue to buy baked goods at the same location). Although a restraint of trade without a good reason to support it is presumed unlawful,&lt;ref&gt;Such a restraint is not "necessary" in the sense of being needed to accomplish the lawful main purpose of another undertaking.&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled, the presumption can be rebutted and overcome by facts such as those present here: the restraint of trade was necessary and ancillary to a lawful transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Judge Bork explained the doctrine in ''Rothery Storage &amp; Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc.'', 792 F.2d 210, 224 (D.C. Cir. 1986), in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To be ancillary, and hence exempt from the ''per se'' rule, an agreement eliminating competition must be subordinate and collateral to a separate, legitimate transaction. The ancillary restraint is subordinate and collateral in the sense that it serves to make the main transaction more effective in accomplishing its purpose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See also ''Schering-Plough Corp.v. FTC'', 402 F.3d 1056,1073 (11th Cir.2005) ("In
order for a condition to be ancillary, an agreement limiting competition must
be secondary and collateral to an independent and legitimate transaction.").&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent interpretations of the ''Mitchel'' doctrine ==

Even if a restraint is necessary and ancillary, within the meaning of the ''Mitchel'' and ''Addyston Pipe'' cases, it may still be an unreasonable restraint of trade if its anticompetive effects, and consequent harm to the public interest, outweigh its benefits. As Judge Ginsburg opined in the ''Polygram'' case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the only way a new product can be profitably introduced is to restrain the legitimate competition of older products, then one must seriously wonder whether consumers are genuinely benefited by the new product.&lt;ref&gt;''PolyGram Holding, Inc. v. FTC'', 416 F.3d 29, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same vein, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission stated a similar approach in the 1995 [http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/0558.htm ''Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property'']:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the Agencies conclude that the restraint has, or is likely to have, an
anticompetitive effect, they will consider whether it is reasonably necessary to achieve procompetitive efficiencies. If the restraint is reasonably necessary, the Agencies will balance the procompetitive efficiencies and the anticompetitive effects to determine the probable net effect on competition in each relevant market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/0558.htm#t42 ''Antitrust Guidelines'', §&amp;nbsp;4.2]. See also ''Rothery'', supra note _.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Questions have been raised as to how necessary a restraint must be to the accomplishment of the main purpose to which it is claimed to be ancillary. For example, must it be indispensable? Is it sufficient if it is of some aid? The FTC-DOJ 2000 [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/joint-venture-hearings-antitrust-guidelines-collaboration-among-competitors/ftcdojguidelines-2.pdf ''Guidelines for Collaborations among Competitors''] say that, in determining whether a restraint is "reasonably necessary," the issue is "whether practical, significantly less restrictive means were reasonably available when the agreement was entered into."&lt;ref&gt;Id. §&amp;nbsp;3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related issue is "necessary to what?" In one recent case, a court rejected a credit card issuer's attempted justification of a restriction against competitive dealings said to be reasonably necessary to promote "loyalty" and "cohesion."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc.'', 163 F. Supp. 2d 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), aff'd, 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; ''How necessary'' and ''necessary to what'' thus remain controverted issues under the doctrine of ''Mitchel v. Reynolds''.

'''oBIX''' (for Open Building Information Exchange) is a standard for [[Representational state transfer|RESTful Web Services]]-based interfaces to [[building]] [[control system]]s. oBIX is about reading and writing data over a [[Computer network|network]] of devices using [[XML]] and [[URI]]s, within a framework specifically designed for [[building automation]].

Building control systems include those electrical and mechanical systems that operate inside a building, including Heating and Cooling ([[HVAC]]), Security, Power Management, and Life/Safety Alarms that are in nearly all buildings as well as the myriad of special purpose systems that may be tied to particular buildings such as A/V Event Management, Theatre Lighting, Medical Gas Distribution, Fume Hoods, and many others.

oBIX is a web services interface because it does not necessarily allow deep interactions with the underlying control systems. This interface can enable communications between enterprise applications and embedded building systems as well as between two embedded building systems. Facilities and their operations to be managed as full participants in knowledge-based businesses.

oBIX is being developed within [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]][http://www.oasis-open.org], the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. Version 1.0 was completed as a committee standard in December 2006.

== Background ==

Presently most mechanical and electrical systems are provided with embedded digital controls (DDC). Most of these devices are low cost and not enabled for TCP/IP. They are installed with dedicated communications wiring. Larger DDC controllers provide network communications for these dedicated controllers. There are many well established binary protocols ([[BACnet]], [[LonTalk]], [[Modbus]], [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]]) that are used on these dedicated networks in addition to numerous proprietary protocols. While these binary protocols can be used over TCP/IP networks - they have challenges with routers, firewalls, security, and compatibility with other network applications. There is an added challenge in that the industry is split between several largely incompatible protocols.

Because oBIX integrates with the enterprise, it enables mechanical and electrical control systems to provide continuous visibility of operational status and performance. By exposing these operations using web services, it enables owners and tenants to use the full array of standard databases and OLAP tools to analyse their performance. oBIX enables facilities operators, owners and tenants to make decisions based on a fully integrated consideration of all life-cycle, environmental, cost, and performance factors.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for verifiability|date=February 2011}}

== Scope ==

oBIX provides a publicly available web services interface specification that can be used to obtain data in a simple and secure manner from HVAC, access control, utilities, and other building automation systems, and to provide data exchange between facility systems and enterprise applications. Release 1 provides a normalized representation for three of elements common to control systems:

* '''Points''': representing a single scalar value and its status – typically these map to sensors, actuators, or configuration variables like a setpoint.
* '''Alarming''': modeling, routing, and acknowledgment of alarms.  Alarms indicate a condition which requires notification of either a user or another application.
* '''Histories''': modeling and querying of time sampled point data.  Typically edge devices collect a time stamped history of point values which can be fed into higher level applications for analysis.

oBIX 1.0 provides a low level object model which can be extended during implementation. While points are directly addressable (and thereby settable), direct interaction with the points requires too much knowledge of the underlying control system for the enterprise developer. The underlying points can be aggregated, the results named, alarm levels set, and histories begun using the oBIX '''contract'''. If oBIX exposes a low level object model for control systems, oBIX contracts create the higher level type libraries that most programmers actually want to work with.

== Uses of oBIX ==

=== Tenant interactions ===
To keep a public space open in the evening may require a range of calls to different organizations within a building, each initiating an interaction with a separate building control system. To schedule a public meeting tonight from 7:00 to 9:00, the organizer may have to:

* Call Security to warn the guard, and keep the (1) Access Control System working in day-time mode until 9:30. The guard may also need to disable the (2) Intrusion Detection System during that period.
* Call Maintenance to make sure the room's (3) Environmental Controls are set properly for the event. This may include over-cooling (or heating) the room in advance to make sure that the room will be comfortable when filled with the anticipated numbers of callers.
* Call the media support group to make sure the (4) A/V Event Management system is properly warmed up before the event,

In an oBIX-enabled building, these features are accomplished by instead sending an [[iCalendar]] meeting invitation to the room and/or its support systems.

=== Emergency response ===
The [[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP) is a standard increasingly used for relaying information from various agencies to the public and to police and first responders. One challenge that public notification faces is that the traditional [[Emergency Broadcasting System]] for transmitting information over the radio is now much less effective, now that the public is tuned 
instead to personal media players such as the [[iPod]]. New versions of these protocols anticipate, for example, direct texting of all cell phones in range of a given cell tower or set of cell towers.

In a similar manner, current proposals suggest direct messaging to [[Intelligent Building]]s to invoke named oBIX contracts, with effects ranging from temporary user security elevation, to initiating process shut down, to notifying in-building warning systems to read messages aloud.

The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] anticipates Emergency Responders being able to access certain classes of geo-tagged sensor information from buildings from within their maps to improve situational awareness.

=== Emerging power markets ===
The [http://www.gridwiseac.org GridWise Architecture Council] envisions an open market or Power Providers, Transmission, Distribution, and Customer Agents negotiating freely for live power contracts based on instantaneous demand/response. The ongoing installation across the US of Electric Meters able to provide time-of-day-metering is one step to enabling this. Another is the development of [[Intelligent Building]]s able to negotiate with the grid.

These grid negotiations are likely to be of two forms. (1) An intelligent agent residing in the building, and negotiating with the building tenants and their business processes negotiates set building system operating postures. (2) An external agent hired by the building tenants aggregates demand across multiple buildings and buys power on their behalf. Markets based on these interactions are considered to be key to creating market conditions to drive  rapid innovation in on-site power storage and generation technologies.

'''Organizational conflict''', or '''workplace conflict''', is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of [[needs]], [[values]] and [[Conflict of interest|interests]] between people working together. [[Conflict (process)|Conflict]] takes many forms in [[organization]]s. There is the inevitable clash between formal authority and power and those individuals and groups affected. There are disputes over how revenues should be divided, how the work should be done, and how long and hard people should work. There are jurisdictional disagreements among [[individual]]s, [[Departmentalization|departments]], and between [[Trade union|unions]] and [[management]]. There are subtler forms of conflict involving rivalries, [[jealousies]], [[personality clashes]], role definitions, and struggles for [[Power (social and political)|power]] and favor. There is also conflict within individuals&amp;nbsp;– between [[competition|competing needs]] and demands&amp;nbsp;– to which individuals respond in different ways.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn= 9780876205402|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type==
Conflict affecting organizations can occur in [[individual]]s, between individual and between groups. Conflicts within work groups are often caused by struggles over control, status, and scarce resources. Conflicts between groups in organizations have similar origins. The constructive [[conflict resolution|resolution]] of such conflicts can most often be achieved through a rational process of problem solving, coupled with a willingness to explore issues and alternatives and to listen to each other.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Personal conflict ===
A personal conflict involves a conflict between two people, most often from a mutual dislike or personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conflict Resolution Principles 150|url=http://www.toolingu.com/definition-950150-105250-personal-conflict.html|work=Supervisor Essentials Training|publisher=TOOLINGU|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Boston University FSAO, "Causes for workplace conflict can be personality or style differences and personal problems such as substance abuse, childcare issues, and family problems. Organizational factors such as leadership, management, budget, and disagreement about core values can also contribute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Conflict|url=http://www.bu.edu/fsao/resources/workplace/|work=Faculty and Staff Assistance|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Colorado–Boulder]] cites as primary causes of workplace conflict as poor communication, different values, differing interests, scarce resources, personality clashes, and poor [[Job performance|performance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/fsap/conflict.html Resolving Workplace Conflict], University of Colorado–Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many difficulties in this area are beyond the scope of [[management]] and more in the province of a professional counselor or workplace mediator, but there are some aspects of personal conflict that managers should understand and some they can possibly help remedy. Social conflict refers to interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup differences.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; Organizational conflict at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ ''Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

It was pointed out that there is a basic incompatibility between the authority and structure of formal organizations and the human personality. [[Human behavior]] cannot be separated from the culture that surrounds it.&lt;ref name="conf2"&gt;{{cite book |author = Chris Argyris|title = Personality and organization; the conflict between system and the individual|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|location = New York|year = 1957|pages = 47–54|isbn = |oclc = 243920|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intragroup conflict ===
Conflict arises in groups because of the scarcity of freedom, position, and resources. People who value independence tend to resist the need for interdependence and, to some extent, conformity within a group. People who seek power therefore struggle with others for position or status within the group. Rewards and recognition are often perceived as insufficient and improperly distributed, and members are inclined to compete with each other for these prizes.&lt;ref name="conf3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore M Mills|title= The Sociology of Small Groups|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|year=1967 |pages=14–17|isbn= |oclc=255221|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western culture, winning is more acceptable than losing, and competition is more prevalent than cooperation, all of which tends to intensify [[intragroup conflict]]. Group meetings are often conducted in a win-lose climate&amp;nbsp;— that is, individual or subgroup interaction is conducted for the purpose of determining a winner and a loser rather than for achieving mutual problem solving.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Intergroup conflict ===
Intergroup conflict occurs in four general forms. Horizontal strain involves competition between functions, for example, sales versus production, research and development versus engineering, purchasing versus legal, line versus staff, and so on. Vertical strain involves competition between hierarchical levels, for example, union versus management, foremen versus middle management, shop workers versus foremen.&lt;ref name="conf5" /&gt; A struggle between a group of employees and management is an example of vertical strain or conflict. A clash between a sales department and production over inventory policy would be an example of horizontal strain.

Certain activities and attitudes are typical in groups involved in a win-lose conflict. Each side closes ranks and prepares itself for battle. Members show increased loyalty and support for their own groups. Minor differences between group members tend to be smoothed over, and deviants are dealt with harshly. The level of morale in the groups increases and infuses everyone with competitive spirit. The power structure becomes better defined, as the "real" [[leader]]s come to the surface and members rally around the "best" thinkers and talkers.&lt;ref name="conf3" /&gt;

In addition, each group tends to distort both its own views and those of the competing group. What is perceived as "good" in one's own position is emphasized, what is "bad" is ignored; the position of the other group is assessed as uniformly "bad," with little "good" to be acknowledged or accepted. Thus, the judgment and objectivity of both groups are impaired. When such groups meet to "discuss" their differences, constructive, rational behavior is severely inhibited.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt; Each side phrases its questions and answers in a way that strengthens its own position and disparages the other's. Hostility between the two groups increases; mutual understandings are buried in negative [[stereotype]]s.

It is easy to see that under the conditions described above, mutual [[solution]]s to problems cannot be achieved. As a result, the side having the greater power wins; the other side loses. Or the conflict may go unresolved, and undesirable conditions or circumstances continue. Or the conflict may be settled by a higher authority.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt;

None of these outcomes is a happy one. Disputes settled on the basis of power, such as through a [[strike action|strike]] or a lockout in a labor-management dispute, are often deeply resented by the loser. Such settlements may be resisted and the winner defeated in underground ways that are difficult to detect and to counter. When this happens, neither side wins; both are losers. If the conflict is left unresolved, as when both sides withdraw from the scene, intergroup cooperation and effectiveness may be seriously impaired to the detriment of the entire [[organization]]. Disputes that are settled by higher authority also may cause resentment and what is called "lose-lose" consequences. Such settlements are invariably made on the basis of incomplete [[information]]&amp;nbsp;— without data that the conflict itself obscures&amp;nbsp;— and therefore are poor substitutes for mutually reasoned solutions. Again, both sides have lost. A specific approach to resolving intergroup conflict is outlined in the next chapter on organization development.&lt;ref name="conf3"/&gt;

== Causes ==

===Role conflict===
{{Main|Role conflict}}
One fact of personal conflict includes the multiple roles people play in organizations.
[[Behavioral]] scientists sometimes describe an [[organization]] as a system of position roles. Each member of the organization belongs to a role set, which is an association of individuals who share interdependent tasks and thus perform formally defined roles, which are further influenced both by the expectations of others in the role set and by one's own personality and expectations. For example, in a common form of classroom organization, students are expected to learn from instructors by listening to them, following their directions for study, taking exams, and maintaining appropriate standards of conduct. [[teacher|Instructors]] are expected to bring students high-quality learning materials, give lectures, write and conduct tests, and set a scholarly example. Another in this role set would be the dean of the school, who sets standards, hires and supervises faculty, maintains a service [[Employment|staff]], readers and graders, and so on. The system of roles to which an individual belongs extends outside the organization as well, and influences their functioning within it. As an example, a person's roles as partner, parent, descendant, and church member are all intertwined with each other and with their set of organizational roles.&lt;ref name="conf5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Daniel Katz; Robert Louis Kahn|title= The social psychology of organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1966 |pages=18–33|isbn= |oclc=255184|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, there exist opportunities for role conflict as the various roles interact with one another. Other types of role conflict occur when an individual receives inconsistent demands from another person; for example, they are asked to serve on several time-consuming committees at the same time that they are urged to get out more production in their work unit. Another kind of role strain takes place when the individual finds that they are expected to meet the opposing demands of two or more separate members of the [[organization]]. Such a case would be that of a worker who finds himself pressured by their boss to improve the quality of their work while their work group wants more production in order to receive a higher bonus share.

These and other varieties of role conflict tend to increase an individual's anxiety and [[frustration]]. Sometimes they motivate him to do more and better work. Other times they can lead to frustration and reduced efficiency.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971 |pages=Chapter 8|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passive aggressive behavior===
{{Main|Passive aggressive behavior}}Passive aggressive behavior is a common response from workers and managers which is particularly noxious to team unity and productivity. In workers, it can lead to sabotage of projects and the creation of a hostile environment. In managers, it can end up stifling a team's creativity. De Angelis says "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;De Angelis, Paula: Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Leadership in the Workplace, (Kindle Edition - Jun 22,2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Office romance ===
{{Main|Office romance}}Office romances can be a cause of workplace conflict. 96 percent of human resource professionals and 80 percent of executives said workplace romances are dangerous because they can lead to conflict within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/02/14/BU144015.DTL Dangerous love: An Office romance could cost you your job, Julie N. Lynem, [[San Francisco Chronicle]], Feb. 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public displays of affection]] can make co-workers uncomfortable and accusations of favoritism may occur, especially if it is a supervisor-subordinate relationship. If the relationship goes awry, one party may seek to exact revenge on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://working.canada.com/national/resources/atwork/story.html?id=4f8d63ab-a97a-42b5-b3a1-54983d3aef8f When an Office Romance Sours], Working.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, quality problems, missed deadlines or delays, increased stress among employees, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, disruption to work flow, decreased customer satisfaction, distrust, split camps, and [[Gossip#Workplace gossip|gossip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/337162_workcoach29.html Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict], Maureen, Moriarty, [[Seattlepi]], Oct. 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The win-lose conflict in groups may have some of the following negative effects:&lt;ref name="conf4"&gt;{{cite book |author=John E Jones;  J William Pfeiffer|title=The 1973 annual handbook for group facilitators|publisher=University Associates|location=San Diego, Calif. |year=1973 |pages=106–109|isbn= 9780883900819|oclc=9160197|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Divert time and energy from the main issues
* Delay decisions
* Create [[deadlocks]]
* Drive unaggressive committee members to the sidelines
* Interfere with listening
* Obstruct exploration of more alternatives
* Decrease or destroy [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]]
* Cause members to drop out or resign from committees
* Arouse anger that disrupts a meeting
* Interfere with [[empathy]]
* Incline underdogs to [[sabotage]]
* Provoke [[personal abuse]]
* Cause defensiveness
Conflict is not always destructive. When it is destructive, however, managers need to understand and do something about it. A rational process for dealing with the conflict should be programmed. Such a process should include a planned action response on the part of the manager or the organization, rather than relying on a simple reaction or a change that occurs without specific action by management.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

===Stress===
{{Main|Occupational stress}}Interpersonal conflict among people at work has been shown to be one of the most frequently noted stressors for employees.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, A., &amp; Newton, T. (1985). Stressful events, stressors and psychological strains in young professional engineers. Journal of Occupational Behaviour, 6(2), 151-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, C., Spector, P. E., &amp; Shi, L. (2007). Cross-National Job Stress: A Quantitative and Qualitative Study. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 28(2), 209-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict has been noted to be an indicator of the broader concept of workplace harassment.&lt;ref name="Bowling, N. A. 2006"&gt;Bowling, N. A., &amp; Beehr, T. A. (2006). Workplace harassment from the victim's perspective: A theoretical model and meta-analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology, 91(5), 998-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to other stressors that might co-occur, such as [[role conflict]], role ambiguity, and [[workload]]. It also relates to strains such as [[anxiety]], depression, physical symptoms, and low levels of [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Bowling, N. A. 2006"/&gt;

===Positive outcomes===

Group conflict does not always lead to negative consequences. The presence of a dissenting member or subgroup often results in more penetration of the group's problem and more creative solutions. This is because disagreement forces the members to think harder in an attempt to cope with what may be valid objections to general group opinion. But the group must know how to deal with differences that may arise.&lt;ref name="conf2" /&gt;

True interdependence among members leads automatically to [[Dispute resolution|conflict resolution]] in the group. Interdependence recognizes that differences will exist and that they can be helpful. Hence, members learn to accept ideas from dissenters (which does not imply agreeing with them), they learn to listen and to value openness, and they learn to share a mutual problem-solving attitude to ensure the exploration of all facets of a problem facing the group.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt;

Intergroup conflict between groups is a sometimes necessary, sometimes destructive, event that occurs at all levels and across all functions in [[organization]]s. Intergroup conflict may help generate creative tensions leading to more effective contributions to the organization's [[goal]]s, such as competition between sales districts for the highest [[Sales|sale]]s.&lt;ref name="conf5"/&gt; Intergroup conflict is destructive when it alienates groups that should be working together, when it results in win-lose [[competition]], and when it leads to compromises that represent less-than-optimum outcomes.

== Resolution ==

=== Conflict management ===
Constantino helps organizations design their own, ad hoc [[conflict management]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=adr] Conflict and dispute management system design: overview.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tosi, Rizzo, and Caroll suggested that improving organizational practices could help resolve conflicts, including establishing [[superordinate goals]], reducing vagueness, minimizing authority- and domain-related disputes, improving policies, procedures and rules, re-apportioning existing resources or adding new, altering communications, movement of personnel, and changing reward systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W7504E/w7504e07.htm Conflict Management], FAO Corporate Document Repository.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large organizations have a [[human resources]] department, whose tasks include providing confidential advice to internal "customers" in relation to problems at work. This could be seen as less risky than asking one's manager for help. HR departments may also provide an impartial person who can mediate disputes and provide an objective point of view. Another option is the introduction of the Ombudsman figure at the organizational level, charged with surveying common causes of conflict and suggesting structural improvements to address them.

* [[Counseling]] - when personal conflict leads to frustration and loss of [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], counseling may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener&amp;nbsp;— something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt;  Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings&amp;nbsp;— that is, to express them to a concerned and understanding listener, is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting their work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.  There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
*[[Conflict avoidance]] - non-attention or creating a total or partial separation of the combatants allowing limited interaction&lt;ref name="Montana"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick J. Montana|title=Management|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=New York|year=2008 |page=265|isbn=0-7641-3931-2|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Smoothing]] - stressing the achievement of harmony between disputants&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[Power (social and political)|Dominance or power intervention]] - the imposition of a solution by management at a higher level than the level of the conflict&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[Compromise]] - seeking a resolution satisfying at least part of each party's position&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[wikt:confrontation|Confrontation]] - a thorough and frank discussion of the sources and types of conflict and achieving a resolution that is in the best interest of the group, but that may be at the expense of one or all of the conflicting parties&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindred Greer, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVWpipM-Rnw&amp;list=UUGwuxdEeCf0TIA2RbPOj-8g Managing Conflict in Teams] (8-min video). ''[[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].'' Professor Lindred Greer gives tips for managing conflicts, which left unchecked, can go viral, hurt productivity, and create employee turnover.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trained conflict resolver can begin with an economical intervention, such as getting group members to clarify and reaffirm shared goals. If necessary, they move through a systematic series of interventions, such as testing the members' ability and willingness to compromise; resorting to confrontation, enforced counseling, and/or termination as last resorts.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Kaye 1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kenneth Kaye]]|title=Workplace Wars and How to End Them: Turning Personal Conflict into Productive Teamwork|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York|year=1994|isbn=0-8144-0215-1|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace conflict may include disputes between peers, supervisor-subordinate conflict or intergroup disputes. When disputes are not dealt with in a timely manner, greater efforts may be needed to solve them. [[Party-Directed Mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between colleagues or peers, especially those based on deep-seated interpersonal conflict or multicultural or multiethnic ones. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The [[Negotiated Performance Appraisal]] (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change===
Management is presumed to be guided by a vision of the future. The manager reflects in their decision-making activities the values of the organization as they have developed through time, from the original founder-owner to the present top-management personnel. In navigating a path between the values of the organization and its objectives and goals, management has expectations concerning the organization's effectiveness and efficiency and frequently initiates changes within the organization. On other occasions, changes in the external environment&amp;nbsp;— [[market demand]], [[technology]], or the political, social, or economic environment&amp;nbsp;— require making appropriate changes in the activities of the [[organization]]. The organization faces these demands for change through the men and women who make up its membership, since organizational change ultimately depends on the willingness of employees and others to change their attitudes, behavior, their degree of knowledge and skill, or a combination of these.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alfred W Clark|title= Experimenting with organizational life: the action research approach|publisher=Plenum Press|location= New York|year=1976 |pages=|isbn= 9780306308796|oclc=1976875|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perkins Coie''' is an international law firm headquartered in [[Seattle, Washington]], and founded in 1912. It is the oldest and largest law firm headquartered in the Pacific Northwest and has a total of 19 offices across the United States and Asia. In addition to corporate representation, the firm often represents political clients.

==History==
The firm was founded in 1912 and has represented the [[Boeing Company]] since the founding of the aerospace company in 1916. Other clients include or have included [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]], [[Starbucks]], [[Costco]], [[Craigslist]], [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Intel]], [[Twitter]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Zillow]], [[REI]], [[Intellectual Ventures]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Expedia]], [[Safeco]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Quora]] and [[Nintendo]].
 
Perkins Coie is counsel of record for the [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Democratic Leadership Council]], the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], and the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]. Other political clients include nearly all Democratic members of the United States Congress. It has also represented several presidential campaigns, including those of [[John Kerry]],&lt;ref name = NYT1/&gt; [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/11/white-house-counsel-craig-out-bauer-in/30115/|title=White House Counsel: Craig Out, Bauer In|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|date=November 12, 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haberman|first1=Maggie|title=Clinton Hires Campaign Lawyer Ahead of Likely Run|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/04/clinton-hires-campaign-lawyer-ahead-of-likely-run/|accessdate=April 3, 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group's Political Law practice was for many years headed by [[Robert Bauer]] and is now chaired by [[Marc Elias]].&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
The firm represented [[Christine Gregoire]] in the prolonged litigation surrounding her 2004 Washington gubernatorial election.

A team of Perkins lawyers headed by Elias successfully represented [[Al Franken]] in his recount and legal battle over the 2008 Senatorial election in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2009/09/18/overtime-the-2008-u-s-senate-race-chapter-3-how-frankens-attorneys-outmaneuvered-colemans-team-to-secure-the-senate-seat/|title=Overtime: The 2008 U.S. Senate Race, Chapter 3: How Franken’s attorneys outmaneuvered Coleman’s team to secure the Senate seat. – Twin Cities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Perkins Coie, led by partner Harry Schneider, represented [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]], the alleged driver and bodyguard of Osama Bin Laden. The case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court ruled that the Bush Administration's use of military commissions to try terrorism suspects was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins Coie worked in the ''Doe v. Reed'' case concerning petition signatures in state ballot initiative campaigns, which was argued successfully before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/experience/doe-1-et-al-v-reed-et-al.html|title=Doe #1, et al. v.

Perkins Coie was hired in 2015 as counsel for the presidential campaign of [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name = NYT1/&gt; As part of its representation of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Elias retained the intelligence firm [[Fusion GPS]] for opposition research services. Those services began in April 2016 and concluded before the [[2016 U.S. Presidential election]] in early November. A notable product of that research was the [[Trump-Russia dossier|dossier]] describing alleged [[Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election|attempts by Russia]] to promote the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.&lt;ref name= WashPo25oct17/&gt; During the campaign, the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million and $3.6 million respectively.&lt;ref name=WashPo25oct17&gt;{{cite news|last1=Entous|first1=Adam|last2=Barrett|first2=Devlin|last3=Helderman|first3=Rosalind S.|title=Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/clinton-campaign-dnc-paid-for-research-that-led-to-russia-dossier/2017/10/24/226fabf0-b8e4-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html|accessdate=25 October 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=25 October 2017|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 24, 2017, Perkins Coie released Fusion GPS from its [[client confidentiality]] obligation.&lt;ref name=WashPo25oct17/&gt;

Perkins Coie has been retained to conduct the independent investigation into potential sexual abuse by Dr. Richard Strauss during the course of his employment with [[The Ohio State University]] [[Ohio State Buckeyes|athletics program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/ohio-state-university-probe-into-allegations-against-physician.html|title=Ohio State University Probe Into Allegations Against Physician, Dr. Richard Strauss - Perkins Coie|website=Perkins Coie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==
Living alumni of the firm include the 16th [[Lieutenant Governor of Washington]] [[Cyrus Habib]], former Attorney General of Washington State [[Rob McKenna]], 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judges [[Margaret McKeown]] and [[Ronald M. Gould]], and Oregon State Representative [[Chris Garrett (politician)|Chris Garrett]].

In 2009, President Obama appointed [[Robert Bauer]], the chair of the firm's Political Law practice, to become his [[White House Counsel]]. Bauer returned to private practice with Perkins Coie in 2011.  In 2015, [[Hillary Clinton]] named [[Marc Elias]] as general counsel to her campaign.&lt;ref name="politico.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/hillary-clintons-power-players-116874.html#ixzz3abek1A2Y|title=The power players behind Hillary Clinton's campaign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">'''''Priestman v Colangelo''''' S.C.R. 615, 19 DLR (2d) 1 (1959) is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the exemption of [[police officer]]s and other public authorities from being held liable for [[tort]]ious acts. This case is also the most famous of the series of "stumbling [[police]]" cases dealt with by the Supreme Court during this era{{ref|cases}}.

==Synopsis==
A police officer was pursuing a [[car theft]] [[suspect]] when the officer attempted to [[police shooting|shoot out]] the rear tire of the suspect's car. The bullet missed the [[tire]], but hit the driver instead, causing him to drive off the road and kill two [[pedestrian]]s. The Court held that the officer was not [[Public liability|liable]] because he had acted reasonably in the course of his [[statutory duty]] to [[arrest|apprehend]] the suspect. A test for [[negligence]] was proposed by Locke J., viz:

"If the circumstances are such that the [[legislature]] must have contemplated that the exercise of a [[statutory power]] and the discharge of a statutory duty might interfere with private rights, and the person to whom the power is given and upon whom the duty is imposed acts reasonably, such interference will not give rise to an action."

==Notes==
#{{note|cases}} other cases include ''Robertson v. Joyce'' (1948), 92 C.C.C. 382 and ''Beim v. Goyer'' (1965), 57 D.L.R. (2d) 253.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">'''Protected Concerted Activity''' is a legal term used in labor policy to define employee protection against employer retaliation in the [[United States]].  It is a legal principle under the subject of the [[freedom of association]].  The term defines the activities workers may partake in without fear of employer retaliation. In countries where there is relatively robust employee dismissal protection, the protection of protected concerted activity is less of a distinct legal issue. In liberal market societies like the United States, where it is comparatively easy for an employer to fire an employee, the issue of protected concerted activity has become an important employment protection.  

The [[National Labor Relations Act]], the main labor policy governing labor relations in the United States, defines concerted activity in Section 7.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Section 7 - Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection...&lt;ref&gt;Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally speaking, there is protected concerted activity when two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment, although it is (on rare occasions) possible for conduct to be so egregious that it becomes unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Steel, 245 N.L.R.B. 814, 816 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Employees have a right to advocate in this manner even where there is no union involved.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Board v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 14 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  

At times, protected concerted activity has extended to individual employees; for example, when an employee speaks individually to his or her employer on behalf of him or herself and one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions. An individual employee who seeks to enforce a collective bargaining agreement will generally be deemed to be engaged in concerted activity.&lt;ref&gt;NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, 465 U.S. 822 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an employee who acts as a "whistleblower" may or may not be engaging in concerted activity; if the complaint is entirely individual and the employee has not discussed it with co-workers, it is unlikely to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act (though it may well be protected under some other public policy).&lt;ref&gt;See Meyers Industries, Inc., 281 N.L.R.B. 882 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act does not limit the manner, time, or place in which employees can engage in concerted activity. Consequently, in recent years, the General Counsel of the [[National Labor Relations Board]] has often taken the position that employee conversations about common workplace issues which make use of social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] are protected against retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45807d6567 Report of the Acting General Counsel Concerning Social Media Cases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224021509/http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45807d6567 |date=2013-02-24 }}, OM 12-31 (Jan. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RedLibre''' is a non profit project where a group of people, entities, administrations and companies interested in building a free data network to be able to provide data and share resources among other uses.

RedLibre has been related mainly to Wireless Community Networks, very near the [http://freenetworks.org/ FreeNetwork] project, but in Spain being a point of contact for the people to allow to join projects. To do that, at the beginning it was agreed a network allocation (in Spanish)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redlibre.net/direccionamiento RedLibre's network allocation]&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[CIDR]] and all the groups interested in becoming a freenetwork in Spain could reserve a subnetwork so compatibility and connectivity could be possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lestrobe.xtreemhost.com/analisis-de-la-red-guifi.net/AnalisisDeLaRedCiudadanaGufiNet.pdf Güifi used the FreeNetwork and RedLibre network proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;

RedLibre is a free networks wireless meta community in [[Spain]].

The goals of the RedLibre project are:
#Build a Free Network (Red Libre)
#Bring technology to society and make communication easier
#Create an emergency network which could be used in a moment of disaster

The RedLibre project was created in September 2001 by [[Jaime Robles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Flickenger  |first=Rob |title=Building wireless community networks |isbn=0-596-00502-4 |year= 2003 |publisher=O'Reilly|pages=127|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kaqfs82Wk6MC&amp;pg=PA127}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the first Spanish [[wireless community network]].

'''Revenue rulings''' are public administrative rulings by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] of the [[United States federal government]] that apply the law to particular factual situations. A Revenue Ruling can be relied upon as precedent by all taxpayers. 

==Function and authority==

A Revenue Ruling is "an official interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service that has been published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Revenue Rulings are issued only by the National Office and are published for the information and guidance of taxpayers, Internal Revenue Service officials, and others concerned."&lt;ref&gt;26 C.F.R. sec. 601.601(d)(2)(i)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue Rulings are published "to promote correct and uniform application of the tax laws by Internal Revenue Service employees and to assist taxpayers in attaining maximum voluntary compliance by informing Service personnel and the public of National Office interpretations of the internal revenue laws, related statutes, treaties, regulations, and statements of Service procedures affecting the rights and duties of taxpayers."&lt;ref&gt;26 C.F.R. sec. 601.601(d)(2)(iii).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Mitchell Rogovin &amp; Donald L. Korb, "The Four R’s Revisited: Regulations, Rulings, Reliance, and Retroactivity in the 21st Century: A View From Within", 46 Duquesne Law Review 323, 330 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A taxpayer may, for a fee, seek advice from the IRS as to the proper tax treatment of a transaction. This is called a [[private letter ruling]]. A private letter ruling binds only the IRS and the requesting taxpayer. Thus, a private ruling may not be cited or relied upon for [[precedent]].

The IRS does have the option of redacting the text of a private ruling and issuing it as a Revenue Ruling, which may become binding on all taxpayers and the IRS. "Even if it is clear that the taxpayer did not rely on a revenue ruling, courts will often hold the Service to the position expressed in the revenue ruling."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Rogovin &amp; Donald L. Korb, "The Four R’s Revisited: Regulations, Rulings, Reliance, and Retroactivity in the 21st Century: A View From Within", 46 Duquesne Law Review 323, 336 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue Rulings are published both in the [[Internal Revenue Bulletin]] and in the [[Federal Register]]. The numbering system for Revenue Rulings corresponds to the year in which they are issued. Thus, for example, Revenue Ruling 79-24 was the twenty-fourth Revenue Ruling issued in 1979.

Public administrative rulings are part of second tier authorities and are subordinate to the Internal Revenue Code and other statutes, Treasury regulations, treaties and court decisions. They hold higher weight than tier 3 authorities such as legislative history and private letter rulings. Revenue Rulings can be used to avoid certain [[IRS penalties]].

==Comparison with revenue procedures==
Revenue Rulings are different from [[Revenue Procedures]].  A Revenue Procedure is an official statement of a procedure that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers under the law, while a Revenue Ruling is the conclusion of the IRS on how the law is applied to a specific set of facts. Generally, a Revenue Ruling states the IRS position, whereas a Revenue Procedure provides return filing or other instructions concerning the IRS position. 

For example, a Revenue Ruling holds that taxpayers may deduct certain automobile expenses, and a Revenue Procedure provides that taxpayers entitled to deduct these automobile expenses may compute them by applying certain mileage rates in lieu of determining actual operating expenses.

Revenue Rulings and Revenue Procedures are alike in that both are issued only by the National Office and both are for the information and guidance of taxpayers.

United States Jaycees|link=|volume=468|page=609|pin=|year=1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was an opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturning the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]'s application of a [[Minnesota]] antidiscrimination law.  The Eighth Circuit had concluded that, by requiring the United States [[United_States_Junior_Chamber|Jaycees]] to admit women as full voting members, the Minnesota Human Rights Act violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the organization's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States Jaycees v.

==Majority opinion==
In an opinion authored by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]], the Court held:

* Application of the Minnesota Human Rights Act to compel the Jaycees to accept women as regular members did not abridge either male members' freedom of intimate association or their freedom of expressive association.
* The Act was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Several features of the Jaycees, including its large size, unselective membership, and purpose, placed it outside the sphere of relationships protected by the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;468 U.S. at 620-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court ruled that the State's compelling interest in combating gender discrimination justified the law's impact on the Jaycees' First Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;468 U.S. at 626.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote an opinion concurring with parts I and III of the Court's opinion and concurring in the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;468 U.S. at 631.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Rehnquist|Justice Rehnquist]] concurred in the judgment without joining either opinion. [[Warren E. Burger|Justices Burger]] and [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]] took no part in deciding the case.&lt;ref&gt;468 U.S. at 611.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5593">The '''rota system''', from the Old Church Slavic word for "family"; or the '''lestva system''', from the Old Church Slavic word for "ladder" or "staircase", was a system of collateral succession practiced 
(though imperfectly) in [[Kievan Rus']] and later [[Appanage]] and early [[Muscovite Russia]], in which the throne passed not linearly from father to son, but laterally from brother to brother (usually to the fourth brother) and then to the eldest son of the eldest brother who had held the throne.  The system was rationalised by [[Yaroslav the Wise]], who assigned each of his sons a principality based on [[Agnatic seniority|seniority]], though it predates his reign and was also used among the Norse of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Smyth, ''Scandinavian York and Dublin: The History and Archaeology of Two Related Viking Kingdoms'' (Dublin, 1979), vol. ii, pp. 304&amp;ndash;07&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the [[Grand prince|Grand Prince]] died, the next most senior prince moved to [[Kiev]] and all others moved to the principality next up the ladder.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Shields Kollmann, “Collateral Succession in Kievan Rus’.”  ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 14 (1990): 377-87; Janet Martin, Medieval Russia 980-1584 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only those princes whose fathers had held the throne were eligible for placement in the rota; those whose fathers predeceased their grandfathers were known as [[izgoi]], "excluded" or "orphaned" princes.

The concept was first noted by [[Sergei Soloviev]],&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Soloviev, ''Istorii Rossii s drevneishchikh vremen''. 29 volumes in 15 books, vol. 1 (Moscow: Izdatel'stvo sotsial'no-ekonomicheskoi literatury, 1960), 346-348.&lt;/ref&gt; and later summed up by [[Vasily Klyuchevsky|Vasily Kliuchevsky]],&lt;ref&gt;Vasily Kliuchevsky, ''Kurs russkoi istorii'', Lektsia 18.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the intervening years, the structured and institutionalized rota system they presented has come under criticism by some, who doubt any such succession system to the Kievan throne existed at all.  Indeed, scholars such as Sergeevich and Budovnitz argued that the seemingly endless internecine war among the princes of Kiev indicates a total lack of any established succession system. Others have modified the system but not fully abandoned it, such as [[A. D. Stokes]], who denied that there was ever a geographic hierarchy of principalities, although there was a hierarchy of the princes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Stokes, “the System of Succession to the Thrones of Russia, 1054-1113,” in R. Auty, L. R. Lewitter, and A. P. Vlasto, eds., Gorski Vijenats: A Garland of Essays Offered to Professor Elizabeth Mary Hill (Cambridge: Modern Humanities Research Association, 1970), 268-275.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Martin]] argued that the system, in fact, worked.  She argues that the interprincely wars were not a breakdown or absence of a system, but the further refinement of the system as the dynasty grew in size and relations became more complex. Each new outburst of violence addressed a new problem rather than rehashing old disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Medieval Russia'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rota system was modified by the princely summit conference held at [[Liubech]] in the [[Chernigov]] lands in northern [[Ukraine]] in 1097. Certain lands were granted as patrimonial lands, that is inherited lands outside the rota system. These lands were not lost by a prince when the Kievan throne became vacant, and they served as core lands that grew up into semi-independent (if not outright independent) principalities in the later centuries of Kievan Rus, leading some historians to argue that Kievan Rus ceased to be a unified state.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Medieval Russia'', 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  After this conference, the rota system continued to work within these patrimonial principalities at least up to the Mongol Invasion.  The rota system also continued with regard to the Kievan throne after 1113 up to the Mongol Invasion as well.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Medieval Russia'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rota system in some aspects survived Kievan Rus' by more than a century. Indeed, the [[Muscovite civil war]] (1425–1453) between [[Vasily II]] and [[Dmitry Shemyaka]] was over this very issue. Shemyaka's father, [[Yury of Zvenigorod]], claimed that he was the rightful heir to the throne of the principality of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] through collateral succession. However, Yury's elder brother, [[Vasily I]] had passed the throne on to his son [[Vasily II]]. Dmitry and his brothers continued to press their father's and their line's claim to the throne, leading to open war between Vasily II and Shemyaka which led to Vasily's brief ouster and blinding, and Dmitry' assassination by poison in [[Novgorod the Great]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Medieval Russia'', 239-244.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the civil war though, Vasily I's father, [[Dmitry Donskoi]], had, in fact, passed the throne on to Vasily by a will that called for linear succession rather than collateral succession, but the issued didn't come to a head until Vasily's death because he was the eldest of his generation and was thus the rightful successor by both linear and collateral succession.  Thus it was only with Vasily II that the Muscovite princes were finally able to break the long-held tradition of collateral succession and establish a system of linear succession to the Muscovite throne. In doing so, they kept power in Moscow, rather than seeing it pass to other princes in other towns.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Medieval Russia'', 239-244.&lt;/ref&gt;

It contrasts with the '''long title''' which, while usually being more fully descriptive of the legislation's purpose and effects, is generally too unwieldy for most uses.  For example, the short title ''[[House of Lords Act 1999]]'' contrasts with the long title ''An Act to restrict membership of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage; to make related provision about disqualifications for voting at elections to, and for membership of, the House of Commons; and for connected purposes''.

The '''long title''' (properly, the '''title''' in some jurisdictions) is the formal title appearing at the head of a [[statute]] (such as an [[Act of Parliament]] or of [[Act of Congress|Congress]]) or other legislative instrument.  The long title is intended to provide a summarised description of the purpose or scope of the instrument. Like other descriptive components of an Act (such as the [[preamble]], section headings, side notes, and short title) the long title seldom affects the operative provisions of an Act, except where the operative provisions are unclear or ambiguous and the long title provides a clear statement of the legislature's intention

==Significance of long titles==
In the United Kingdom, the long title is important since, under the procedures of Parliament, a Bill cannot be amended to go outside the scope of its long title. For that reason, modern long titles tend to be rather vague, ending with the formulation "and for connected purposes". The long title of an older Act is sometimes termed its [[rubric]], because it was sometimes printed in red.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Short titles for Acts of Parliament were not introduced until the mid-19th century, and were not provided for every Act passed until late in the century; as such, the long title was used to identify the Act. Short titles were subsequently given to many unrepealed Acts at later dates; for example, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689) was given that short title by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]], having until then been formally referred to only by its long title, ''An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown''.  Similarly, in the US, the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which was famously ruled unconstitutional in part by ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', was called "An Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States". 

The long title was traditionally followed by the [[preamble]], an optional part of an Act setting out a number of preliminary statements of facts similar to [[Recital (law)|recital]]s, each starting ''Whereas...''.

== Short titles ==
Unlike the long title, which precedes the [[preamble]] and [[enacting formula]], and thus sits outside the main body of text, the short title for modern legislation is explicitly defined by a specific section, typically at the very end or very beginning of the main text.  As with the above example, short titles are generally made up of just a few words that describe in broad terms the area of law being changed or the thing affected, followed by the word "Act" and then the year in which the legislation is formally enacted.

A notable exception is [[Israel]], in which this convention is reversed. The short title sits outside the main body of legislation, and the summary description of the law, which is made optional, is defined by a specific section if existing. For example, the Combating Iran's Nuclear Program Act, which under the usual convention would have begun with the long title "An Act to sanction entities assisting Iran in promoting its nuclear program or obtaining weapons of mass destruction or means of carrying weapons of mass destruction and to limit corporations who have business relations with Iran, for its favor or in its territory, as part of the international struggle against Iran's nuclear program" and whose first section would have read "This Act may be Cited As the 'Combating Iran's Nuclear Program Act, 5772-2012'", actually begins with the short title "Combating Iran's Nuclear Program Act, 5772-2012", and its first section reads "The Purpose of this Act is to sanction entities assisting Iran in promoting its nuclear program or obtaining weapons of mass destruction or means of carrying weapons of mass destruction and to limit corporations who have business relations with Iran, for its favor or in its territory, as part of the international struggle against Iran's nuclear program."

The titles of legislation enacted by the United States Congress, if they include a year, invariably add the preposition "of" between the word "Act" and the year. Compare the Australian [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] (Cth), [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] (UK), and [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (USA).  Even if no year was included in the official short title enacted by Congress, it is traditional always to precede the year with an "of" if it needs to be appended in prose after the short title. This convention is followed by most but not all [[U.S. state]]s; for example, the Act of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|Pennsylvania legislature]] that consolidated the governments of the city of [[Philadelphia]] and [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]] is generally (though not formally) called the [[Act of Consolidation, 1854]]. The vast majority of Acts passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] do not include the year of enactment as part of the short title. In the Philippine Congress, titling of legislation primarily follows the U.S. convention.

Since the early 20th century, it has become popular in the United States to include the names of key legislators in the short titles of the most important Acts.  This was at first done informally; that is, the names appeared in legal treatises and court opinions but were not part of the statute as enacted.  Eventually members of Congress began to formally write their own names into short titles (thereby immortalizing themselves for posterity), as in the [[Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]] and the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].  In some states, like California, some short titles consist ''only'' of the names of the key legislators, as in the [[Lanterman–Petris–Short Act]], the statutory basis of the [[5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold)|"5150" involuntary psychiatric hold]] used for detaining Hollywood celebrities. 

Draft legislation ([[bill (proposed law)|bills]]) also uses short titles, but substitutes the word "Bill" for " Act ".

==Use==
===United Kingdom===
The wording after "An Act" varies somewhat between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the long title opens with the words "An Act to ...". For example, the short title of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] is ''House of Lords Act 1999'', but its long title is ''An Act to restrict membership of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage; to make related provision about disqualifications for voting at elections to, and for membership of, the House of Commons; and for connected purposes''. UK bills substitute the words "A Bill" for "An Act". Thus, before it passed, the long title of the House of Lords Bill 1999 was "A Bill to restrict membership...". Because of the way they are used to define the scope of bills, many British long titles are quite long.

===US===
While the long titles of most Acts of the US Congress read, "An Act to...", [[appropriations bill#United States|appropriations bills]] begin, "An Act making appropriations for...". Bills begin "A Bill for an Act..." Legislation in [[U.S. state]]s also vary both in the exact wording and the level of detail of long titles. A typical long title in Illinois is, "AN ACT concerning safety", giving only a very broad characterization of the subject matter. On the other hand, a recent New Hampshire law carried the long title, "AN ACT relative to establishing a municipal bond rescission process, authorizing governing bodies to call a special meeting to consider reduction or rescission of appropriations, and clarifying special procedures enabling towns to respond appropriately to the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]."

===Australia===
Australian long titles are more like American than British ones in that they are short and broad: for example, "A Bill for an Act to provide for the establishment of the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and for related purposes". However, not all states use long titles and an Act may instead have an explicit "Purpose" section.

===Ireland===
An Act may be cited in an [[enacting formula|enactment]] or other document by, amongst other things, the short title of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 2005]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0023/sec0014.html section 14(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand long titles ceased to be used after 2000.

===South Africa===
Long titles in South Africa omit the initial "An".

==Effect of repeal==

===United Kingdom===

An Act may continue to be cited by the short title authorised by any enactment notwithstanding the repeal of that enactment.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 19(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

Notwithstanding the repeal of an enactment giving a short title to an Act, the Act may, without prejudice to any other mode of citation, continue to be cited by that short title.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comma==
Originally short titles had a comma preceding the year. Whether this is retained or not depends on the country involved: it has been dropped in Ireland and the United Kingdom, but retained in Canada.

===United Kingdom===

It is actually not necessary to use the comma as, although normal punctuation is now used by draftsmen, and is included in Queen's Printer's copies of Acts of Parliament, it is not part of an Act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Duke of Devonshire v. O'Connor (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 468 at p. 478, per [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]], [[Master of the Rolls|M.R.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The comma preceding the calendar year in printed copies of Acts is omitted on the authority of a note by Sir Noel Hutton QC, [[First Parliamentary Counsel]], as to which see "The Citation of Statutes" 82 [[Law Quarterly Review|LQR]] 24-24. The validity of this note is questioned by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]], Fourth Edition, Reissue, Volume 44(1), footnote 10 to paragraph 1268.

[[Glanville Williams]] said that it "seems sensible" to omit the comma preceding the calendar year in references to Acts passed before 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. [[Learning the Law]]. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. Page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In citing an Act by its short title, a comma immediately before a reference to a year and a comma immediately after such a reference that is not required for the purpose of punctuation may be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 2005]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0023/sec0014.html section 14(3)(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definite article==
The [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] recommends that the [[definite article]] at the beginning of the "statute title" should be omitted when citing a statute of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]. Third Edition. 2010. Paragraph 23.2.1 at page 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
In ''Re Boaler'', Buckley LJ said:

{{Blockquote|The fact that for the purpose of identification only and not of enactment also authority is given to identify the statute by a particular name in which the word "action" occurs is, I think, immaterial. The words "This Act may be cited as the Vexatious Actions Act 1896," effect nothing by way of enactment. They do no more than create a name, and whether it is as matter of description accurate or not is immaterial. In support of this view I refer to that which Lord Haldane said in ''Vacher &amp; Sons v. London Society of Compositors''(2) as regards the title "Trade Disputes Act, 1906," and that which Lord Moulton said in the same case(3), and to that which the latter said further in ''National Telephone Co. v. Postmaster-General''.(4)

:(4) [1913] A. C. 546, at p. 560.&lt;ref&gt;Re Boaler [1915] 1 KB 21 at 27, CA&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Wheatley'', Bridge LJ said of the [[Explosives Act 1875]] and the [[Explosive Substances Act 1883]]:

{{Blockquote|Looking at the two statutes, at the nature of the provisions which they both contain, and in particular at the short and long titles of both statutes, it appears to this court that they are clearly [[in pari materia]], ...&lt;ref&gt;R v Wheatley [1979] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 144 at 147, [1979] 1 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 954 at 957, CA&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
Since the second half of the nineteenth century, short titles  have become the usual method of referencing earlier [[statute law]] within legislation itself.  In the UK this replaced the earlier method of citing the long title together with the chapter number and the [[regnal year]](s) of the [[parliamentary session]] in which it received [[Royal Assent]].  For example, modern legislation would simply refer to "the Evidence Act 1845", whereas in the past it would have been necessary to use wording such as "the Act passed in the eighth and ninth year of Her Majesty's reign chapter one hundred and thirteen intituled 'An Act to facilitate the Admission in Evidence of certain official and other Documents{{'"}}.

Short titles were introduced because the titles of statutes (now commonly known as [[long title]]s) had become so long that they were no longer a useful means of citation. For example, the title of 19 Geo.2 c.26 (1745) ([[Attainder of Earl of Kellie and others Act 1746]]) ran to 65 lines of King's Printer and to over 400 words.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]], Statute Law Revision: Fifteenth Report, Draft Statute Law Repeals Bill, Law Com 233, Scot Law Com 150, Part IV, para. 4.2, p. 76, footnote 2 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1995/233.html BAILII] [http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/rep150.pdf Scottish Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Short titles were first introduced for Acts of Parliament in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]], Statute Law Revision: Fifteenth Report, Draft Statute Law Repeals Bill, Law Com 233, Scot Law Com 150, Part IV, para. 4.2, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Amending Acts also began to take the opportunity to create short titles for earlier Acts as well as for themselves.  Eventually the [[Short Titles Act 1892]] (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c.10) was passed to create short titles for almost all{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}{{Quantify|date=February 2009}} remaining legislation. This statute was repealed and replaced by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]], which conferred short titles on about 2,000 Acts. The [[Short Titles Act (Northern Ireland) 1951]] conferred short titles on 179 Acts applying to [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]] conferred short titles on 164 pre-union Acts of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. Further short titles were given by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1948]], the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1977]] and the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1978]]. 

In Ireland, ''ex post facto'' short titles have been conferred by the [[Short Titles Act 1962]], the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2007]], the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2009]] and the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2012]]. In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], certain Acts were renamed by Schedule 1 to the [[Legislation Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2001-14/default.asp Copies of the Legislation Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name changes ==
In a few cases, particular Acts have had more than one short title given to them, for example because subsequent amendments to their contents have rendered the earlier name inaccurate. For example, when the 1992 version of [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law: the Government]] – the so-called "Direct Election law" – made the post of [[Prime Minister of Israel]] elected, it added provisions regarding the Prime Ministerial election to the [[:he:חוק הבחירות לכנסת|Knesset Election Law, 1969]], and renamed it as "Knesset and Prime Minister Elections Law, 1969". This change was reverted following the abolition of direct Prime Ministerial elections in 2001.

British (and [[Parliament of England|English]]) legislation that has been "inherited" by the legal systems of other countries has also sometimes ended up with a short title in one jurisdiction that differs from that used in another: for example, the Act of Parliament that created the [[Dominion of Canada]] in 1867 is formally known in Canada as the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], but is still known as the [[British North America Act 1867]] in British law; note also the differing comma convention. Similarly, the Act "21 &amp; 22 George III c.48" of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] is "Yelverton's Act (Ireland) 1781 [I]" in [[Northern Ireland]] and "Calendar Act, 1781" in the [[Republic of Ireland]]; the short titles were assigned respectively by Acts of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Oireachtas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=21 December 2010 |archiveurl=http://194.109.159.7/tna/20101221070722/http://legislation.gov.uk/aip/Geo3/21-22/48 |url=http://legislation.gov.uk/aip/Geo3/21-22/48 |title= Yelverton’s Act (Ireland) 1781 [I]|work=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titlesact1962"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0005/sched1.html |title=Short Titles Act, 1962, Schedule 1|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

Most short titles include a descriptive phrase followed by the type of legislation and the year of enactment; for example, the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] is an Act of Parliament relating to human rights that received Royal Assent in 1998. Some exceptions exist, such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], whose formal short title in the UK (as given by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]) is simply "Bill of Rights", without a year, although it is not a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] but an Act.

More narrowly focused legislation may have a secondary phrase in parentheses, such as the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) Regulations 2002 (a [[Statutory Instrument]]).

Laws that relate primarily to other laws, such as amendments, contain the short titles of those laws in their own short titles, for example the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 (Amendment) Act 2010. Subsequent enactments can lead to particularly lengthy short titles; for example, the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868, amended by the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868 (Amendment) Act 1869, and itself amended by the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868 (Amendment) Act 1879 (Amendment) Act 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maclaurin|first=H. N. |title=Sanitary Legislation and Administration in England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0A1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |accessdate=26 May 2017 |series=Votes &amp; Proceedings |volume=Vol.2 No.41 |date=11 September 1893 |publisher=New South Wales Legislative Council |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent shorter convention is that an act amending "Foo Act yyy1" will have short title "Foo (Amendment) Act yyy2".

If a law is passed with the same title as another law passed in the same year, an ordinal number will be added to distinguish it from the others; this is particularly common for [[Finance Act]]s (Finance (No. 3) Act 2010) and commencement orders that bring parts of an Act into force (Environment Act 1995 (Commencement No.13) (Scotland) Order 1998). However, for laws that amend other laws, this ordinal numbering does not reset every year (For example, even though only two amendments were made to the Israeli Criminal Procedure Law in 2018, these amendments are numbered No.81 and No.82 in their titles.)

In Ireland, the [[Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Act 2012]] was enacted in 2015 rather than 2012.&lt;ref name="irl31"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/ca/31/enacted/en/html|title=Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution Act, 2012|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by both houses of the [[Oireachtas]] in 2012 but not [[signed into law]] by the [[President of Ireland|President]] until 2015, after an intervening referendum and court challenge.&lt;ref name="irl31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/bills/2012/7812/document1.htm|title=Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012|accessdate=3 April 2017|publisher=Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0424/696371-court-to-deliberate-on-2012-childrens-referendum/|title=Court rejects appeal on Children's Referendum|date=24 April 2015|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2(2) of the act, which assigns the short title, could not be amended between the houses' passing the bill and its being enacted (though it could still be amended by a subsequent act of the Oireachtas). This act's short title is longer than its long title ("An Act to Amend the Constitution",&lt;ref name="irl31"/&gt; as required by the constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article46_3|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 46.3 |nopp=Y|quote=Every such Bill shall be expressed to be "An Act to amend the Constitution".|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15624">The '''Sino-Pakistan Agreement''' (also known as the '''Sino-Pakistan Frontier Agreement''' and '''Sino-Pak Boundary Agreement''') is a 1963 document between the governments of [[Pakistan]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] establishing the border between those countries. It resulted in China ceding over  {{convert|1,942 to 5,180|km2|sqmi}} to Pakistan and Pakistan recognizing Chinese [[sovereignty]] over hundreds of square kilometers of land in [[Kashmir#Northern Areas|Northern Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]]. The agreement is controversial, not recognized as legal by [[India]], which also claims sovereignty over part of the land. In addition to increasing tensions with India, the agreement shifted the balance of the [[Cold War]] by bringing Pakistan and China closer together while loosening ties between Pakistan and the [[United States]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:sinopak.JPG|thumb|left|CM Aslam with Premiere Zhou en Lai, Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Chairman Mao ZeDong at a reception at the residence of Chairman Mao following the conclusion of the Sino-Pak Boundary Agreement]] --&gt;

==Issue and result==
In 1959 Pakistan became concerned that Chinese maps showed areas of Pakistan in China. In 1961 Ayub Khan sent a formal Note to China, there was no reply. It is thought that the Chinese may not have been motivated to negotiate with Pakistan because of Pakistan's relations with India, with which China was soon to enter a war with.

After Pakistan voted to grant China a seat in the United Nations, the Chinese withdrew the disputed maps in January 1962, agreeing to enter border talks in March. The willingness of the Chinese to enter the agreement was welcomed by the people of Pakistan. Negotiations between the nations officially began on October 13, 1962 and resulted in an agreement being signed on 2 March 1963. It was signed by foreign ministers Chen Yi for the Chinese and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for the Pakistani.

The agreement resulted in China withdrawing from about 750 sq m of territory, and Pakistan withdrawing its claim to about 2,050 sq m of territory (which it had not in fact occupied or administered).

China's extended territory became known as [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]]. The area is part of [[Kargilik County]].

{{quote|The Government of the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Government of Pakistan]]; HAVING agreed, with a view to ensuring the prevailing peace and tranquility on their respective border, to formally delimit and demarcate the boundary between [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]] and the contiguous areas the defence of which is under the actual control of [[Pakistan]], in a spirit of fairness, reasonableness, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, and on the basis of the ten principles as enunciated in the Bandung conference. Being convinced that this would not only give full expression to the desire of the people of [[China]] and [[Pakistan]] for the development of good neighbourly and friendly relations, but also help safeguard Asian and world peace.

Have resolved for this purpose to conclude the present agreement and have appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries the following.

For the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]]; [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

For the [[Government of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], [[Minister (government)|Minister]] of [[External Affairs]].

Who, having mutually examined their full powers and found them to be in good and due form have agreed upon following:

'''Article 1'''
In view of the fact that the boundary between [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]] and the contiguous areas the defence of which is under the actual control of [[Pakistan]] has never been formally delimited, two parties agree to delimit it on the basis of the traditional customary boundary line including features and in a spirit of equality, mutual benefit and friendly cooperation.

'''Article 2'''
In accordance with the principle expounded in Article 1 of the present agreement, the two parties have fixed as follows the alignment of the entire boundary line between China's Sinkiang and the contiguous areas the defence of which is under the actual control of Pakistan.

:1 Commencing from its north western extremity at height 5,630 metres (a peak the reference coordinates of which are approximately longitude 74 degrees 34 minutes east and latitude 37 degrees 3 minutes north), the boundary line runs generally eastward and then South-eastward strictly along the main watershed between the tributaries of the [[Tashkurgan River]] of the Tarim river system on the one hand on the tributes of the [[Hunza River|Hunza]] river of the [[Indus]] river [[system]] on the other hand, passing through the [[Kilik Pass|Kilik Daban]] (Dawan), the [[Mintaka Pass|Mintake]] Daban (pass), the Kharchanai Daban (named on the Chinese map only), the Mutsgila Daban (named on the Chinese map only) and the Parpik Pass (named on the Pakistan map only) and reaches the [[Khunjerab Pass|Khunjerab]] (Yutr) Daban (Pass).

:2 After passing through the Khunjerab (Yutr) Daban (pass) the boundary line runs generally southward along the above-mentioned main watershed up to a mountain-top south of the Daban (pass), where it leaves the main watershed to follow the crest of a spur lying generally in a south-easterly direction, which is the watershed between the Akjilga river ( a nameless corresponding river on the Pakistan map) on the one hand, and the Taghumbash (Oprang) river and the Koliman Su (Oprang Jilga) on the other hand. According to the map of the Chinese side, the boundary line, after leaving the south-eastern extremity of the spur, runs along a small section of the middle line of the bed of the Koliman Su to reach its confluence with the Kelechin river. According to the map of the Pakistan side, the boundary line, after leaving the south-eastern extremity of this spur, reaches the sharp bend of the Shaksgam or Muztagh river.

:3 From the aforesaid point, the boundary lines runs up the Kelechin river (Shaksgam or Muztagh river) along the middle line of its bed its confluence (reference coordinates approximately longitude 76 degrees 2 minutes east and latitude 36 degrees 26 minutes north) with the Shorbulak Daria (Shimshal river or Braldu river).

:4 From the confluence of the aforesaid two rivers, the boundary line, according to the map of the Chinese side, ascends the crest of a spur and runs along it to join the [[Karakoram]] range main watershed at a mountain-top (reference coordinates approximately longitude 75 degrees 54 minutes east and latitude 36 degrees 15 minutes north) which on this map is shown as belonging to the Shorgulak mountain. According to the map of the Pakistan side, the boundary line from the confluence of the above mentioned two river ascends the crest of a corresponding spur and runs along it, passing through height 6.520 meters (21,390 feet) until it joins the Karakoram range main watershed at a peak (reference coordinates approximately longitude 75 degrees 57 minutes east and latitude 36 degrees 3 minutes north).

:5 Thence, the boundary line, running generally south-ward and then eastward strictly follows the Karakoram range main watershed which separates the Tarim river drainage system from the Indus river drainage system, passing through the east [[Mustagh Pass]] (Muztagh pass), the top of the Chogri peak ([[K2]]) the top of the [[Broad Peak]], the top of the [[Gasherbrum]] mountain (8,068), the [[Indira Col|Indirakoli]] pass (names of the Chinese maps only) and the top of the [[Teram Kangri]] peak, and reaches its south-eastern extremity at the [[Karakoram Pass]]. Then alignment of the entire boundary line as described in section one of this article, has been drawn on the one million scale map of the Pakistan side in English which are signed and attached to the present agreement. In view of the fact that the maps of the two sides are not fully identical in their representation of topographical features the two parties have agreed that the actual features on the ground shall prevail, so far as the location and alignment of the boundary described in section one is concerned, and that they will be determined as far as possible by bgint survey on the ground.

'''Article 3'''
The two parties have agreed that:
:i) Wherever the boundary follows a river, the middle line of the river bed shall be the boundary line; and that
:ii) Wherever the boundary passes through a deban (pass) the water-parting line thereof shall be the boundary line.

'''Article 4'''
One the two parties have agreed to set up, as soon as possible, a joint boundary demarcation commission. Each side will appoint a [[chairman]]([[Chaudry Mohammad Aslam]] for the Pakistani side), one or more members and a certain number of advisers and technical staff. The joint boundary demarcation commission is charged with the responsibility in accordance with the provisions of the present agreement, to hold concrete discussions on and carry out the following tasks jointly.

:1) To conduct necessary surveys of the boundary area on the ground, as stated in Article 2 of the present agreement so as to set up boundary markers at places considered to be appropriate by the two parties and to delineate the boundary line of the jointly prepared accurate maps.

:To draft a protocol setting forth in detail the alignment of the entire boundary line and the location of all the boundary markers and prepare and get printed detailed maps, to be attached to the protocol, with the boundary line and the location of the boundary markers shown on them.

:2) The aforesaid protocol, upon being signed by representatives of the governments of the two countries, shall become an annex to the present agreement, and the detailed maps shall replace the maps attached to the present agreement.

:3) Upon the conclusion of the above-mentioned protocol, the tasks of the joint boundary demarcation commission shall be terminated.

'''Article 5'''
The two parties have agreed that any dispute concerning the boundary which may arise after the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of boundary line actually existing between the two countries shall be settled peacefully by the two parties through friendly consultations.

'''Article 6'''
The two parties have agreed that after the settlement of the [[Kashmir dispute]] between [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], the sovereign authority concerned will reopen negotiations with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] on the boundary as described in Article. Two of the present agreement, so as to sign a formal boundary treaty to replace the present agreement, provided that in the event of the sovereign authority being Pakistan, the provisions of the present agreement and of the aforesaid protocol shall be maintained in the formal boundary treaty to be signed between the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]].

'''Article 7'''
The present agreement shall come into force on the data of its signature.

Done in duplicate in [[Peking]] on the second day of March 1963, in the Chinese and English languages, both side being equally authentic.}}

==Significance==
The agreement was moderately economically advantageous to Pakistan, which received grazing lands in the deal, but of far more significance politically, as it both diminished potential for conflict between China and Pakistan and, Syed indicates, "placed China formally and firmly on record as maintaining that Kashmir did not, as yet, belong to India.&lt;ref&gt;Syed, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; India does not recognize the agreement, under which China holds {{convert|5180|km2|sqmi}} of northern Kashmir, as legal.&lt;ref&gt;Syed, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=78171 | title = China illegally occupying land | date = 2006-12-04 | accessdate = 2009-03-13 | author = Press Trust of India | publisher = expressindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Factbox: India and China border dispute festers | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = 2006-11-15 | accessdate = 2009-03-13 | url = http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/DEL108225.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', reporting on the matter in 1963, expressed the opinion that by signing the agreement Pakistan had further "dimmed hopes of settlement" of the [[Kashmir conflict]] between Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870184,00.html | title = Signing with the Red Chinese | publisher = ''Time'' | date = 1963-03-15 | accessdate = 2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Jane's International Defence Review]]'', the agreement was also of significance in the Cold War, as Pakistan had ties with the United States and membership in the [[Central Treaty Organization]] and the [[Southeast Asian Treaty Organization]].&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;{{cite journal | title = Strategic and security issues: Pakistan-China defense co-operation an enduring relationship | journal = Jane's International Defence Review | date = 1993-02-01 | accessdate = 2009-03-13 | url = http://www.janes.com/extract/idr93/idr00903.html| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130127023014/http://www.janes.com/extract/idr93/idr00903.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was part of an overall tightening of association with China for Pakistan, which resulted in Pakistan's distancing from the United States.&lt;ref name=Jane/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dixit | first = Jyotindra Nath | title = India-Pakistan in War &amp; Peace | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-415-30472-5 | page = 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitra | first = Subrata Kumar |author2=Mike Enskat |author3=Clemens Spiess  | title = Political parties in South Asia | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-275-96832-4 | page = 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defining borders, the two countries also entered into agreements with respect to trade and air-travel, the latter of which was the first such international agreement China had entered with a country that was not [[Communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Syed, 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Constitution of 1924''', formally titled the '''Constitution of the Republic of Turkey''' ([[Ottoman language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''Teşkilât-ı Esasiye Kanunu''; {{lang-tr|1924 Türk Anayasası}}), was the [[constitution|fundamental law]] of [[Turkey]] from 1924 to 1961. It replaced the [[Turkish Constitution of 1921|Constitution of 1921]] and was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] following the proclamation of the [[republic]] on October 29, 1923. It was ratified on April 20, 1924. It remained in force until the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 ''coup d'état'']], following which it was replaced by the [[Turkish Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]].

==Summary==
The Turkish Constitution of 1924 had 105 articles and was divided into six sections:
* Section I - Fundamental Provisions, Articles 1-8: Section I describes the basic structural concepts of the newly established Turkish government. These provisions included establishment of a [[republic]] which places [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] power in the hands of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] who are given the authority to elect the [[President of Turkey]]. [[Judiciary|Judicial]] power is extended to independent courts that are sanctioned by the National Assembly in accordance to their established laws. The provisions also declare the [[Capital city|national capital]] of [[Ankara|Angora]], the state religion of [[Islam]], and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] as the official [[national language]].&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section II - The Legislative Power, Articles 9-30: Section II establishes the [[Election law|electoral laws]] of the new government, the legislative capabilities of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly]], and the procedure for the election of the [[President of Turkey]]. The right to vote is given to [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Citizenship|citizens]] who are 18 years of age or older, and those age 30 and older may run for official positions in government if they meet the requirements of office.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Election|Elections]] for members of the National Assembly take place every four years and those elected maintain their position until their term ends and they are not reelected or are [[Impeachment|impeached]] by a vote among the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Assembly is given sole legislative power as well as control over the [[Government budget|national budget]] and the creation of [[Treaty|international treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section III - The Executive Power, Articles 31-52: Section III establishes the [[Election law|electoral procedure]] for the office of the [[President of Turkey]] and the limits of the powers of the executive. The president is elected every four years following the election of the National Assembly, is elected by the members of the new National Assembly, and takes power immediately following his election.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 92.&lt;/ref&gt; This section also gives the president power to approve and veto legislation drafted by the National Assembly, appoint his own [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet ministers]], and grants the president authority over the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] as [[Commander-in-chief|chief of the armed forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade.

* Section IV - The Judicial Power, Articles 53-67: Section IV elaborates upon the fundamental structure of the [[judiciary]] under the new republic by establishing the duties of officially appointed [[Judge|judges]] and the creation of a 21 member [[Supreme court|High Court]]. This High Court consists of 11 members of the Court of Appeals and 10 members of the Council of State who are elected to the High Court by their own membership. The decisions of the High Court are final and cannot be subject to confirmation or veto by the other branches of power.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section V - Public Law of the Turks, Articles 68-88: Section V defines the general rights and freedoms afforded to the [[Turkish people]] under the new government.

''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; This section also specifically defines the term [[Turkish people|"Turk"]] in a legal manner and also establishes the basic foundations of the [[Tax law|tax codes]] to be used under the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section VI - Miscellaneous Provisions, Government Officials and Employees, Finance, and Amendments to the Constitution, Articles 89-105: The final section of the Constitution of 1924 includes provisions that define the territories that make up the new [[Turkey|Turkish state]], define eligibility for candidates for positions in government jobs, establish the procedure for creation of a [[Government budget|national budget]], and establish the procedure in which [[Amendment|amendments]] to the [[constitution]] may be presented to the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, Edward Meade. "The New Constitution of Turkey". ''Political Science Quarterly'' 40, no.  1 (March 1925): 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
The Constitution of 1924 was in application for 36 years from 1924 until 1961. During this time, it served as the basis for many fundamental changes that sought to transform [[Turkey]] into a modern, secular and democratic Republic.

*The ratification of the Constitution on April 20, 1924.
*The list of [[150 personae non gratae of Turkey]], ratified on April 23, 1924 (revised June 1, 1924), declared about 150 persons, who were holding high positions within the imperial government or were fierce supporters of the Ottoman Sultan, unwanted in the new Republic.

==Amendments==
The first change occurred on April 10, 1928, which changed, inter alia, Article 2 and the sentence "Religion of the Turkish state is Islam" was deleted.&lt;ref&gt;beykent.edu.tr, [http://kampus.beykent.edu.tr/Paylasim/Dosyalar/Anayasalar_129807210772392500.pdf TC Anayasaları, 1921, 1924, 1961 ve 1982 Anayasalarını karşılaştırılması] {{tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further changes followed on 10 and December 11, 1931 and 1934 respectively. As a result, women were given the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote and stand for election]]. In 1937, the constitution was changed twice. Law No. 3115 of February 5, 1937 enshrined the six basic principles of [[Kemalism]] in the Constitution.

On January 10, 1945, the constitution was revised with Law No. 4695 in the sense of [[Turkification]] of the language and translated into modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. However, this recast was reversed by Law No 5997 of December 24, 1952, which restored the constitution to its constitution before 1945.

'''''United States v. Graham''''', 846 [[F. Supp. 2d]] 384 (D. Md. 2012),&lt;ref name=BennettOrder&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Graham |vol=846 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=384 |pinpoint= |court=D. Md. |date=2012 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20120305625 |accessdate=2018-03-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland|Maryland District Court]] case in which the Court held that historical cell site location data is not protected by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. Reacting to precedent established by the recent Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Antoine Jones|United States v. Jones]]'' in conjunction with the application of the third party doctrine, Judge [[Richard D. Bennett]], found that "information voluntarily disclosed to a third party ceases to enjoy Fourth Amendment protection" because that information no longer belongs to the consumer, but rather to the telecommunications company that handles the transmissions records.&lt;ref name= ArsArticle&gt;''[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/obama-admin-wants-warrantless-access-to-cell-phone-location-data.ars Obama admin wants warrantless access to cell phone location data]'' Timothy B. Lee (Mar. 8, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The historical cell site location data is then not subject to the privacy protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment standard of [[probable cause]], but rather to the [[Stored Communications Act]], which governs the voluntary or compelled disclosure of stored electronic communications records.

A three judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court on the Fourth Amendment issue in August 2015, but the full court ''[[en banc]]'' upheld the district court in May 2016.

==Background==
With the increase in usage of cellular phones by the public, the government turned to exploitation of cellular phone technology to track the movements of suspects. This phenomenon led to suits by defendants who claimed that use of such technology to track their movements amounted to an invasion of their privacy.&lt;ref name= MattRichtel2&gt;''[http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic86897.files/September_29/Privacy/Live_Tracking_of_Mobile_Phones.pdf Live Tracking of Mobile Phones Prompts Court Fights on Privacy]'' Matt Richtel, The New York Times (December 10, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts were divided over whether such tracking amounted to intruding in a person's personal sphere. Some courts decided that such tracking to obtain cell site location data implicated the Fourth Amendment, and applied the 'probable cause' standard stipulated under the Fourth Amendment to such cases- ''[[In re Application of the United States]]'' [809 F. Supp. 2d 113 (E.D.N.Y. 2011)], ''In re Application of the United States'' [747 F. Supp. 2d 827 (S.D. Tex. 2010)]. These courts however also clarified that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated if the request for acquisition of cell site location information is for a short period of time.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

Other cases were decided in favor of applying the 'specific and articulable facts' standard under the Stored Communications Act, since the courts believed that such acquisition of historical cell site location data did not implicate the Fourth Amendment- ''[[United States v. Dye]]'' (N.D. Ohio Apr. 27, 2011), ''[[United States v. Velasquez]]'' (N.D. Cal Oct, 22, 2010), ''[[In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data]]'', 724 F.3d 600 (5th Cir. 2013).&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

==Facts==
The Defendants, Aaron Graham and Eric Jordan, were charged for a series of armed robberies of commercial entities including a Burger King restaurant and a McDonald's restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland on February 5, 2011. Ten minutes after the McDonald's robbery, the defendants were found and arrested by the police and, upon request, provided their cell phone numbers to the officers at the scene.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; Two cell phones were recovered from the Defendant's car, which matched the numbers that the Defendants had provided earlier. Before Baltimore Detective Christopher Woerner searched the contents of the phones, he requested search warrants for the devices from the Circuit Court.

On March 25, 2011, Magistrate Judge Susan K. Gauvey granted the government's request to order Sprint/Nextel, Inc. to "disclose to the government 'the identification and address of cellular towers (cell site locations) related to the use of' the Defendants' cellular telephones" &lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; pursuant to the [[Stored Communications Act]]. The order requested the disclosure of geographic data for August 10–15, 2010; September 18–20, 2010; January 21–23, 2011; and February 4–5, 2011 dates important for linking the defendants to the robberies. Gauvey determined that the goal of linking the suspects to the robberies fit the standard of the government offering "specific and articulable facts." &lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; On July 15, 2011, the government was granted a second order from Magistrate Judge [[Paul W. Grimm]] for the cell site location for the period of July 1, 2010 through February 6, 2011. Spring/Nextel, Inc. provided the data to the government pursuant to this order.

On December 8, 2011, Judge Bennett of the District Court held a hearing to determine if the Cellular Phone Data and Historical Cell Site Location Data should be granted the [[motion to suppress]] at the Defendant's request.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

==Court Proceedings==

===Defendants' Claims===
The Defendants argued that the historical cell site location data acquired without a warrant was in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the "length of time and extent of the cellular phone monitoring intruded on the Defendants' expectation of privacy."&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; The Defendants claimed that the data granted to the government allowed the "government to paint an intimate picture of the Defendants' whereabouts over an extensive period of time".&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; They contended that the implications of this technology allow the government to retroactively surveil a suspect through a device he carries with him twenty-four hours a day, even to constitutionally protected places such as the home.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

===Plaintiff's Claims===
In response to the Defendants' claims, the government argued that they lacked [[standing]] because Defendant Jordan used a fictitious name and address when subscribing to the phone service and this demonstrated a lack of privacy interest in the location records. The government also contended that the records were the proprietary business records of the cell phone carriers and that the Defendants voluntarily gave their records to the cellular service company. The government analogized the cell site location data to the pen register, and used the third-party doctrine established by the Supreme Court case ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' to argue that the defendants had voluntarily given their information to the third party which did not implicate the Fourth Amendment based on precedent.

The government also contended that the Stored Communications Act's "lower 'specific and articulable facts' standard provides adequate privacy protections... and notwithstanding recent cases [''United States v. Antoine Jones''], the majority of courts have concluded that "the government's acquisition of cell site location data without a warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment".&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; Lastly, the government argued that, if the Court were to conclude that the acquisition of the cell site location data was unconstitutional, the appropriate remedy would not be suppression of the evidence.

==Opinion of the Court==

==='Specific and Articulable Facts' Standard===
The court reiterated that the 'specific and articulable facts' standard stipulated in the Stored Communications Act, is lower than the threshold requirement established by the 'probable cause' standard under the Fourth Amendment. The 'specific and articulable facts' standard is defined in section 2703(d) of the Act. It states that the governmental entity seeking the information must offer specific and articulable facts that "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

===Expectation of Privacy===
Regarding the government's argument about the defendant's lack of standing because of the fictitious name he used, the Court considered the issue combined with the legitimacy of the expectation of privacy in the historical cell site location data. The court cited ''[[Katz v. United States]]'', wherein it was stated that any object that a person knowingly exposes to the public, cannot rightfully be claimed as the subject of a Fourth Amendment protection. However, anything that a person strives to protect as private, even if such object is situated in an area accessible to the public, may fall under the purview of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name= AlexanderScolnik6&gt;Scolnik, Alexander (2009),''[http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4471&amp;context=flr Protections for Electronic Communications: The Stored Communications Act and the Fourth Amendment]'', Fordham Law Review '''78'''(1): 349-397&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Katz v. United States'', [[John Marshall Harlan II|Justice Harlan]] evolved a two-prong test to determine when an object may be the subject of a Fourth Amendment protection. He stated that protection may be extended to those areas where a person has a subjective expectation of privacy, and that expectation is also objectively reasonable.&lt;ref name="AlexanderScolnik6"/&gt; [[Justice Rehnquist]] reiterated this principle in ''[[Rakas v. Illinois]]'', when he stated that a 'legitimate expectation of privacy' cannot be confined to a mere subjective expectation of something being kept private. He stated that a legitimate expectation of privacy "must have a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society."&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

The court in this case declined to consider the issue of the defendants' 'standing' separately from the issue of the legitimate expectation of privacy in the historical cell site location data. The court pronounced that the real and substantial issue to be decided in the case was whether the defendants had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the historical cell site location data or not.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

===Third Party Doctrine===
In ''[[Katz v. United States]]'', the Supreme Court held that the "Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public...is not subject of Fourth Amendment protection." &lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; First the Court cited ''Smith v. Maryland'' where the Supreme Court held that "a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties," and that the users of third party services are aware that they are conveying their information to the companies in order for the service to work.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; Using the reasoning of ''[[United States v. Miller]]'', the Court determined that historical cell site location records were not the Defendant's private papers, but were the business records of the cellular providers. Coupling this logic with the Fourth Circuit's in ''[[United States v. Bynum]]'', which "concluded that because Bynum voluntarily conveyed his location to his internet company, he enjoyed no reasonable expectation of privacy in that information," the Court determined that the third-party doctrine was applicable to historical cell site location information and that the Fourth Amendment was therefore not implicated.

===Mosaic Theory===
Next, the Court considered the question of time - if there was an exception to the third-party doctrine if the records requested were "cumulative." Judge Bennett cited multiple past orders in various districts which held that there was no Fourth Amendment violation if the request was for a concrete and short period of time.&lt;ref name= Texas&gt;''[https://www.eff.org/files/2010_1029_texas_cellphonetracking_opinion.pdf In re Application of the United States]'', 747 F. Supp. 2d 827 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (Smith, Mag. J.)&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the mosaic theory of the Fourth Amendment created in ''[[United States v. Maynard]]'' (the D.C. Circuit case leading to the Supreme Court ''United States v. Antoine Jones'' case), the court found that "individual investigatory steps taken by law enforcement do not amount to a Fourth Amendment violation, but when viewed in the aggregate...infringe on a person's reasonable expectations of privacy."&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt; However, Judge Bennett disagreed with this reasoning and stated that Congress expressly intended to require only "specific and articulable facts" in its enactment of the Stored Communications Act for the precise purpose that individuals do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in information conveyed to third parties. Therefore, citing the majority opinion in ''U.S. v. Jones'', Judge Bennett reasoned that if technology is altered in the future to intrude on the reasonable expectation of privacy, the legislature would be the body best fit to address this issue.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

===Differences from ''United States v. Jones''===
Because the ''Jones'' case set the Supreme Court precedent for surveillance by the government using certain electronic devices to be violations of the Fourth Amendment, Judge Bennet elucidated the distinctions between ''U.S. v. Jones'' and the case at hand. A [[GPS]] device was the issue in Jones, and Judge Bennett noted that unlike GPS information, historical cell site location data is only ''retroactive'', not ''prospective'' - it does not give the government the ability to track the precise movements of the suspect in real time. The next difference between the two and from ''Smith v. Maryland'' that Judge Bennett noted was that historical cell site location can "only reveal which cellular towers were used to route a particular call" and therefore can only give a general location where a cell phone was used and only where the closest cellular tower was. Also, Judge Bennet separates the cases because the GPS surveillance was conducted without a valid warrant in ''Jones,'' but in this case, the Stored Communications Act had the standard of "specific and articulable facts," which enabled the judicial branch to prevent and remedy executive overreaching.

Lastly, Judge Bennett specified that the majority opinion in ''Jones'' ultimately did not consider whether the "search" in the case violated the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore, until a higher court analyzes this question or Congress comes up with a solution other than the Stored Communications Act,  Judges must apply the facts of the case to the law as is currently interpreted.&lt;ref name= BennettOrder/&gt;

===Appropriate Remedy===
Because the officers pursuing the historical cell site location data relied in good faith on the Stored Communications Act and the orders issued by the Magistrate Judges, the [[exclusionary rule]] does not apply as per ''[[Illinois v. Krull]]''. There was no challenge to whether the Stored Communication Act applied to this case. Therefore, the data would still be admissible in the trial as evidence and suppression would not be an appropriate remedy.

===Holding===
The court held that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated in the acquisition of historical cell site location data because of the application of the third party doctrine. The court stated that such information is created and kept by third parties as part of their ordinary course of business. Judge Bennett concluded that the Defendants' Fourth Amendment rights were not violated when the government, according to the standards of the Stored Communications Act, acquired their historical cell site location data.&lt;ref name= Kerr&gt;''[http://volokh.com/2012/03/04/are-historical-cell-site-data-protected-under-the-fourth-amendment-after-united-states-v-jones/ Are Historical Cell-Site Data Protected Under the Fourth Amendment After United States v. Jones?]'', The Volokh Conspiracy (March 4, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Defendants' Motion to Suppress Evidence of historical cell site data was therefore denied.

==Court of Appeals==
In August 2015, a three judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to overturn the district court ruling that Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. "We conclude that the government's warrantless procurement of the CSLI [cell site location information] was an unreasonable search in violation of Appellants' Fourth Amendment rights. Nevertheless, because the government relied in good faith on court orders issued in accordance with Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or the Stored Communications Act ("SCA"), we hold the court's admission of the challenged evidence must be sustained."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/124659.P.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/warrant-required-for-mobile-phone-location-tracking-us-appeals-court-rules/
&lt;/ref&gt;
The government asked the court to rehear the case en banc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/in-2016-terror-suspects-and-7-eleven-thieves-may-bring-surveillance-to-supreme-court/|title=In 2016, terror suspects and 7-Eleven thieves may bring surveillance to Supreme Court|website=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments in the appeal were heard March 23, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/article_051533de-e103-58f7-9960-c7a2e74479aa.html|title=Cell phone privacy case argued in federal appeals court|website=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 the full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, voted 12-3 that the government can get the information without a warrant under a decades-old legal theory that it had already been disclosed to a third party, in this case a telephone company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-mobilephones-idUSKCN0YM2CZ|title=U.S. court says no warrant needed for cellphone location data|date=2016-05-31|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further Comments==
Some commentators have expressed the opinion that the decision does not postulate a general rule with respect to surveillance measures through new technology. They have reflected the view that in drawing a difference between prospective and historical data, Judge Bennet may have rendered a narrow decision, which is particular to historical data.&lt;ref name= Kerr/&gt;

In a subsequent case decided September 23, 2014, Judge Bennet noted that "''United States v. Graham'' is currently on appeal to the Fourth Circuit and has been pending before that Court for nearly two years."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Herevia'', 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133142, at *22-23 n.8 (D. Md. Sept. 23, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Manning''''' was the [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]] of former United States Army [[Private First Class]] Bradley E. Manning&lt;ref name=Rizzo&gt;Jennifer Rizzo, [http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/23/bradley-manning-charged/ "Bradley Manning charged"], CNN, February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (known after the trial as [[Chelsea Manning]]).&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Semansky, [https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/22/bradley_manning_wants_to_live_as_a_woman_named_chelsea_begin_hormone_therapy.html "Bradley Manning wants to live as a woman: 'I am Chelsea Manning{{' "}}], ''Toronto Star'', August 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|List of charges in United States v. Manning}}
The material in question includes 251,287 [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomatic cables]], over 400,000 classified army reports from the Iraq War (the [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq War logs]]), and approximately 90,000 army reports from the war in Afghanistan (the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan War logs]]). WikiLeaks also received two videos. One was of the [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike]] (dubbed the "[[Collateral Murder]]" video); the second, which was never published, was of the May 2009 [[Granai airstrike]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Zetter, [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/02/manning-to-be-court-martialed/ "Bradley Manning to Face All Charges in Court-Martial"], ''Wired'', February 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning was charged on July 5, 2010, with violations of Articles 92 and [[General article (military law)#United States|134]] of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], which were alleged to have taken place between November 19, 2009, and May 27, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-31/us/wikileaks.suspect.attorney_1_bradley-manning-wikileaks-website-leaker?_s=PM:US "Attorney for WikiLeaks suspect says he's seen no evidence on documents"], CNN, August 31, 2010.

==Pre-trial hearings==

===Article 32 hearing===
[[File:David E. Coombs.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|upright=0.96|Manning is represented by [[David Edward Coombs|David Coombs]].]]
A panel of experts ruled in April 2011 that Manning was fit to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/us/30brfs-PANELSAYSWIK_BRF.html?ref=bradleyemanning "Panel Says WikiLeaks Suspect Is Competent to Stand Trial"], Associated Press, April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Article 32 hearing]], presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza, was convened on December 16, 2011, at [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], Maryland, to determine whether to proceed to a court martial. The army was represented by Captains Ashden Fein, Joe Morrow, and Angel Overgaard. Manning was represented by military attorneys Major Matthew Kemkes and Captain Paul Bouchard, and by civilian attorney [[David Edward Coombs|David Coombs]].

The hearing resulted in Almanza recommending that Manning be referred to a general court-martial, and on February 3, 2012, the [[Convening authority (court-martial)|convening authority]], [[Major General]] Michael Linnington, commander of the [[United States Army Military District of Washington|Military District of Washington]],&lt;ref name="MDW Cdr"&gt;Linnington was later promoted to Lt.

[http://mdwhome.mdw.army.mil/leaders/commanding-general Jeffrey S. Buchanan].&lt;/ref&gt; ordered Manning to stand trial on all 22 specified charges, including aiding the enemy. Manning was formally charged ([[Arraignment|arraigned]]) on February 23, and declined to enter a plea.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding fitness to stand trial, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/us/30brfs-PANELSAYSWIK_BRF.html?ref=bradleyemanning "Panel Says WikiLeaks Suspect Is Competent to Stand Trial"], Associated Press, April 29, 2011.

====Prosecution evidence====
The lead prosecutor, Captain Fein, argued that Manning had given enemies "unfettered access" to the material and had displayed an "absolute indifference" to classified information. He showed the court a video of [[Adam Gadahn]], an al-Qaeda spokesman, referencing the leaked material.&lt;ref&gt;Denver Nicks, ''Private: Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks, and the Biggest Exposure of Official Secrets in American History'', Chicago Review Press, 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution presented 300,000 pages of documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. Nicks writes that Manning appeared to have taken few security precautions. After Manning's arrest, detectives searched a basement room in Potomac, Maryland, and found an [[Secure Digital|SD card]] they say contained the Afghan and Iraq War logs, along with a message to WikiLeaks. Investigators said Manning had also left computer trails of Google and [[Intelink]] searches, and of using [[Wget]] to download documents.&lt;ref&gt;Nicks 2012, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel Almanza heard from two army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU), and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from [[ManTech International]], who works for the CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 U.S. military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on the SD card; and 10,000 cables on a personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also said they had recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning had admitted to being the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt;

Johnson said he found a text file called wl-press.txt on an external hard drive in Manning's room in Iraq. The file was created on November 30, 2009, and gave the contact detail in Iceland for WikiLeaks. He said he also recovered 14–15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange, using the [[Adium]] instant messaging client. The MacBook's log-in password was found to be the encryption key. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin [[Chaos Computer Club]]'s domain (ccc.de), had names associated with them, Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank. Johnson also said he found [[Secure Shell|SSH logs]] on the MacBook that showed an [[SSH File Transfer Protocol|SFTP connection]], from an IP address that resolved to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt; There was also a text file named "[[Readme]]" attached to the logs, apparently written by Manning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Items of historical significance of two wars Iraq and Afghanistan Significant Activity, Sigacts, between 00001 January 2004 and 2359 31 December 2009 extracts from CSV documents from Department of Defense and CDNE database. These items have already been sanitized of any source identifying information.&lt;p&gt;

You might need to sit on this information for 90 to 180 days to figure out how best to send and distribute such a large amount of data to a large audience and protect the source.&lt;p&gt;

This is possibly one of the most significant documents of our time, removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century assymmetric warfare.&lt;p&gt;

Have a good day.&lt;ref name=Nicks137&gt;Nicks 2012, pp. 137–138; also see [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/manning-assange-laptop/ Zetter, December 19, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook. The operating system was re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31 an attempt was made to erase the hard drive by doing a "[[Disk formatting|zero-fill]]," which involves overwriting material with zeroes. This process was started, cancelled, then started again with a single pass. The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from unallocated space.&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;The army investigators' testimony [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/manning-assange-laptop/ Zetter, December 19, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defense arguments====
[[File:Bradley Manning 1.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|180px|Manning in September 2009]]
The defense named 48 people it wanted to appear on Manning's behalf. The list was believed to include President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]. Clinton had said that the diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks "did not represent significant consequences to foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ed Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/05/bradley-manning-wikileaks-fragile-mind |title=Bradley Manning team to highlight WikiLeaks suspect's fragile mental state &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama was named because of an April 2011 statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42770631/ns/us_news-security/t/did-obama-taint-wikileaks-suspects-right-fair-trial/|title=Did Obama taint Manning's right to fair trial? – US news – Security |publisher=NBC News |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/04/22/video-of-obama-on-bradley-manning-he-broke-the-law/ |title=Video Of Obama On Bradley Manning: "He Broke The Law" |publisher=Forbes |date= April 22, 2011|accessdate=2013-08-02 |first=Andy |last=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephanie Condon |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20056566-503544.html |title=Obama says Bradley Manning "broke the law" – Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/04/23/manning_10/ |title=President Obama speaks on Manning and the rule of law |publisher=Salon.com |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53601.html |title=Barack Obama on Bradley Manning: 'He broke the law' – MJ Lee and Abby Phillip |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that Manning "broke the law":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_zC44SBaZPoNDBjZmNiYWItNDk0YS00MmNjLTllZDAtMjVlZTYwOTRjOGE3 |title=Defense Article 32 Witness List.pdf – Google Drive |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The defense requests the presence of [redacted] in order to discuss the issue of Unlawful Command Influence (UCI).

Manning's lawyers argued that the government had overstated the harm the release of the documents had caused, and had overcharged Manning in order to obtain evidence against Assange. They suggested that other people had had access to Manning's workplace computer, and under cross-examination Shaver acknowledged that some of the 10,000 cables on Manning's personal computer did not match cables published by WikiLeaks. Coombs asked for the dismissal of any charge related to the use of unauthorized software, arguing that Manning's unit had been "lawless ... when it comes to information assurance."

The defense also raised the issue of whether Manning's [[gender identity disorder]] had affected Manning's judgment. Manning had e-mailed master sergeant, Paul Adkins, in April 2010 to say she was suffering from gender confusion and, despite then living as a man, attaching a photograph of herself dressed as a woman. After Manning's arrest, the army found information about [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] in her room, and Manning's commander, Captain Steven Lim, learned that she had been calling herself Breanna. Defense lawyers argued that the superiors had failed to provide adequate counseling, and had not taken disciplinary action or revoke Manning's security clearance. They also suggested that the "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" policy—which was repealed in September 2011—had made it difficult for Manning to serve in the army as a gay man.&lt;ref&gt;For the prosecution argument about Manning's "absolute indifference," and for the defense argument about Manning's unit being "lawless," see Serena Marshall, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/final-arguments-pfc-mannings-wikileaks-case/story?id=15215559#.T4EUD9XNjZw "Court Martial for Bradley Manning in Wikileaks Case?"], ABC News, December 22, 2011.

===Defense request to depose six witnesses===
After the hearing, in January 2012, Coombs filed a request to depose six witnesses, whose names were redacted in the application, and who are believed to have been involved in classifying the leaked videos. Coombs argues that the videos were not classified at the time they were obtained by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;David Coombs, [https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/01/Manning-Deposition-Request.pdf "Request for oral depositions"], ''United States v.

===Article 39 hearing===
An Article 39&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSec|10|839}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] was convened on April 24, 2012, during which the judge, Colonel Denise Lind, denied a defense motion to dismiss the charge of aiding the enemy, and ruled that the government must be able to show that Manning knew the enemy would be able to access information on the WikiLeaks site. She ordered the CIA, FBI, DIA, State Department, and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to release documents showing their assessment of whether the leaked material had damaged the national interest of the United States. Lind said she would decide after reading the documents whether to make them available to Manning's lawyers. She also ordered forensic imaging of five computers removed from Manning's work station that had not yet been wiped clean.&lt;ref name=Article39April&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/bradley-manning-judge-to-rule-on-request-to-drop-charges/ "Bradley Manning Judge to Rule on Request to Drop Charges"], ABC News, April 24, 2012.

At the start of the hearing, Manning replaced the assigned two military defense lawyers, Major Matthew Kemkes and Captain Paul Bouchard, with Captain Joshua Tooman. The next Article 39 hearing was set for June 6–8 and trial was set for September 2012.&lt;ref name=Article39April/&gt;

===Petition to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals===
The [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] filed a petition in May 2012 asking the [[Army Court of Criminal Appeals]] to order press and public access to motion papers, orders, and transcripts. Petitioners included [[Julian Assange]], [[Amy Goodman]] of ''Democracy Now!'', Chase Madar, author of ''The Passion of Bradley Manning'' (2011), and [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''Salon''.&lt;ref&gt;David Dishneau, [http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/gi-seeks-dismissal-10-counts-wikileaks-case-16421258#.T760UsWo1ro "GI Seeks Dismissal of 10 Counts in WikiLeaks Case"], Associated Press, May 24, 2012.

On September 19, 2012, Manning's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss all charges with [[Prejudice (legal procedure)#Criminal law|prejudice]], arguing that Manning had been unable to obtain a [[speedy trial]].&lt;ref name=m2d4loast&gt;[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_zC44SBaZPoUnJGb280ZU5MS2c/edit Motion to Dismiss] of September 19, 2012 as cited in Nathan Fuller (September 29, 2012) [http://www.bradleymanning.org/news/the-government-has-made-an-absolute-mockery-of-bradley-mannings-right-to-a-speedy-trial "The government has made an 'absolute mockery' of Bradley Manning's right to a speedy trial"] ''BradleyManning.org''&lt;/ref&gt; The motion claimed that the 845 days spent in pretrial confinement was longer than the periods that the law says is unreasonable.&lt;ref name=KlasfeldDelays&gt;Adam Klasfeld, [http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/01/50828.htm "Landmark Delays in Manning Court-Martial, Lawyer Says"] ''Courthouse News Service'', October 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (United States military law normally requires a trial within 120 days.&lt;ref name=KlasfeldSecrecy&gt;Adam Klasfeld, [http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/10/51150.htm "Judges Doubt Need for Secrecy in Bradley Manning Court-Martial"] ''Courthouse News Service'', October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) Judge Lind ruled against the defense motion and allowed for the delay because the prosecution needed more time to prepare its case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ed Pilkington at Fort Meade, Maryland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/26/bradley-manning-trial-rejects-dismiss-charges?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Bradley Manning judge rules length of soldier's detention 'reasonable' &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date= February 26, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial plea===
[[File:Providence — a short film featuring Chelsea Manning's voice.webm|thumb|thumbtime=0:08|Audio recording of an excerpt of Manning's statement given on February 28, 2013.]]
On February 28, 2013, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 specified charges. Military judge Colonel Denise Lind accepted the guilty pleas, for which Manning could face up to 20 years in prison. Manning did not plead guilty to the most significant charge of aiding the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21610811 "Bradley Manning pleads guilty to some Wikileaks charges"], BBC News, February 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning acknowledged having provided archives of military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks. She pleaded guilty to 10 criminal counts in connection with the material leaked, which included videos of airstrikes in Iraq and Afghanistan in which civilians were killed, logs of military incident reports, assessment files of detainees held at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba]], and a quarter-million cables from American diplomats stationed around the world. Manning read a statement recounting how she joined the military, became an intelligence analyst in Iraq, decided that certain files should become known to the American public to prompt a wider debate about foreign policy, downloaded them from a secure computer network and then ultimately uploaded them to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="Confession to 10 crimes Manning"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Charlie Savage]], [[Scott Shane]] | title = Soldier Admits Providing Files To WikiLeaks | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 1, 2013 | page = A1 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/bradley-manning-admits-giving-trove-of-military-data-to-wikileaks.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the judge asked Manning to explain how she could admit that her actions were wrong, Manning replied, "Your Honor, regardless of my opinion or my assessment of documents such as these, it's beyond my pay grade—it's not my authority to make these decisions about releasing confidential files."&lt;ref name="Confession to 10 crimes Manning" /&gt; An audio recording of Manning's statement was released by journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] on March 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Greenwald, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/bradley-manning-tapes-own-words "Finally: hear Bradley Manning in his own voice"], ''The Guardian'', March 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning put the files on a camera digital storage card and took it home on a leave in early 2010. Manning then decided to give the files to a newspaper,  first calling ''The Washington Post''. Next, ''The New York Times'' was contacted and an unanswered voice mail message was left. In January 2010, Manning called the public editor's line at [[Bloomberg News]], but got no response. Manning then copied the files and uploaded them to WikiLeaks, through its website, using a directory the group designated as a "cloud drop box" server. Manning was frustrated that WikiLeaks did not publish files about 15 people who printed "anti-Iraqi" pamphlets. After uploading the files, Manning was engaged in more online conversations with someone from WikiLeaks, who Manning thought was a senior figure, like [[Julian Assange]]. In retrospect, Manning described the relationship as "artificial."&lt;ref name="Confession to 10 crimes Manning" /&gt;

==Trial==
The trial began on June 3, 2013, at [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], Maryland, before Colonel Denise Lind, chief judge, U.S. Army Trial Judiciary, 1st Judicial Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/85257345005031B1/%28JAGCNetDocID%29/1st+Judicial+Circuit?OpenDocument Judge Advocate General Corps website], last updated September 24, 2012, retrieved July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening for the prosecution, Captain Joe Morrow accused Manning of having "harvested" hundreds of thousands of documents from secure networks, then making them available within hours to the US's enemies by dumping them on the Internet: "This is a case about what happens when arrogance meets access to classified information," he said.&lt;ref name=McGeoughJune42013&gt;Paul McGeough, [http://www.smh.com.au/world/wikileaks-trial-begins-on-a-lownote-20130604-2nmog.html "WikiLeaks trial begins on a low-note"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For the defense, Coombs described Manning as "young, naïve and good intentioned." Coombs recounted an incident in which a convoy was hit by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]], which U.S. troops were relieved did not result in any American fatalities. Manning was reportedly disturbed by her comrades' lack of sympathy upon later learning that an Iraqi civilian had been killed in the incident. Coombs said that by releasing material she felt the public should see, Manning had hoped to make a difference. Manning additionally believed that much of the information she released was "already basically in the public domain," and that it was of historical importance.&lt;ref name=TateJune32013/&gt;

On July 2, at the trial's 14th day of sessions, prosecutors rested their case, having presented testimony from 80 witnesses and evidence showing that Manning's training repeatedly instructed her to not give classified information to unauthorized people. The government also presented evidence that [[Osama bin Laden]] asked for and received from an associate the Afghanistan battlefield reports WikiLeaks published,&lt;ref&gt;David Dishneau &amp; Pauline Jelinek, [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/prosecution-winding-down-wikileaks-case "Prosecution rests in Manning's WikiLeaks trial"], Associated Press, July 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and that al-Qaeda leaders reveled in WikiLeaks' publication of reams of classified U.S. documents, urging members to study them before devising ways to attack the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last=Associated Press | title=Prosecution submits al-Qaida excerpts in Wikileaks trial | url=http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/Prosecution-Wrapping-up-in-WikiLeaks-Trial-213901581.html| work= | newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | location=[[Burlington, Vermont]] | pages= 5A | date=July 2, 2013 | id= | accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---hard copy and soft copy sources are different but are the same article---&gt;

On July 10, the defense rested its case after presenting evidence from 10 witnesses. Manning did not take the stand. Attempting to undercut the most serious charge against Manning—aiding the enemy—defense lawyers called [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Yochai Benkler]], who testified that until WikiLeaks started publishing the material Manning leaked, even [[The Pentagon]] apparently viewed the anti-secrecy website as a legitimate journalistic enterprise. Thereafter, said Benkler, the public, the military and traditional news media perceived WikiLeaks as a group that supported terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-bradley-manning-court-martial-20130710,0,6795975.story "Bradley Manning's defense rests its case in WikiLeaks scandal"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, Judge Lind rejected a defense motion to dismiss the charge of aiding the enemy, citing Manning's extensive training as an intelligence analyst and the sheer volume of records that were leaked as reasons to allow the charge to proceed. In its rebuttal case, the prosecution entered three tweets from WikiLeaks that Manning may have viewed to show that the organization was not a legitimate journalistic enterprise. In surrebuttal, the defense entered articles into evidence depicting WikiLeaks as an important journalism outlet, a platform "just as important as" the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie Tate, [https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-18/world/40646119_1_judge-denise-lind-elizabeth-goitein-collateral-murder "Judge in Bradley Manning trial rejects motion to dismiss key charge"], ''The Washington Post'', July 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, chief prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein delivered the government's closing argument, portraying Manning as an "anarchist" who sought to "make a splash" by providing vast archives of secret documents to WikiLeaks. Arguing that Manning must be found guilty of aiding the enemy, Fein said, "He was not a whistleblower. He was a traitor, a traitor who understood the value of compromised information in the hands of the enemy and took deliberate steps to ensure that they, along with the world, received it." Fein contended that Manning's "wholesale and indiscriminate compromise of hundreds of thousands of classified documents" for release by the WikiLeaks staff, whom he called "essentially information anarchists," was not an ordinary journalistic disclosure but a bid for "notoriety, although in a clandestine form." Fein addressed the court for nearly six hours.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-07-25/&gt;

The next day, defense attorney Coombs countered with his own closing argument, portraying Manning as "a young, naïve, but good-intentioned soldier who had human life and his humanist beliefs center to his decisions, whose sole focus was, 'Maybe I just can make a difference, maybe make a change.{{' "}} Coombs said his client released only files she believed would cause no harm yet spark debate and prompt change, and that if Manning had not been selective, she would have leaked much more. Playing excerpts from the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video that Manning admitted supplying to WikiLeaks, Coombs told Judge Lind: "When the court looks at this, the defense requests that you not disengage, that you not look at this from the eyes of 'this happened on a battlefield.' Did they all deserve to die? That is what Private Manning is thinking as he is watching this video he is seeing, and he's questioning."&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-07-27b/&gt;

With closing arguments concluded, Col. Lind began her deliberations. Manning chose to have her court-martial heard by the judge only instead of a jury.&lt;ref&gt;David Dishneau, [http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/06/03/bradley-manning-trial-begins-3-years-after-arrest.html "Bradley Manning Trial Begins 3 Years After Arrest"], Associated Press, June 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
On July 30, 2013, Judge Lind issued her findings regarding the charges. Manning was acquitted of aiding the enemy by knowingly giving out intelligence through indirect means, and was convicted of 19 of the 21 or 22 specified charges, including theft and six counts of espionage.&lt;ref name="nydailynews" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-07-31/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; The hearing on sentencing began on July 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikileaker PFC.

==Sentencing==
The judge ruled in January 2013 that Manning's sentence would be reduced by 112 days because of treatment during confinement at Quantico.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, Julie and Nakashima, Ellen.

Michael Worsley, testified that Manning had been left isolated in the army, trying to deal with gender-identity issues in a "hyper-masculine environment." On August 14 during the sentencing hearing, Manning apologized for past actions, telling the court: "I am sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States. I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions. When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people. ...

==Petition for commutation of sentence==
On September 3, 2013, Manning's attorney announced that he had filed on his client's behalf a Petition for Commutation of Sentence, submitted with a letter to the [[Secretary of the Army]] and, through the Department of Justice's [[Office of the Pardon Attorney]], to President Obama, seeking a presidential pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Ian. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-usa-wikileaks-manning-idUSBRE9830XS20130904 "Manning seeks presidential pardon in WikiLeaks case"], Reuters, September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted Manning's sentence to a total of 7 years confinement, starting with the initial date of arrest. As a result of the commutation Manning was released on May 17, 2017.&lt;ref name="HillObamaCommutes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-17jan2017" /&gt;

==Appeal==

On May 31, 2018, the [[United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals|U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld Chelsea Manning's 2013 court-martial conviction of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]]. The court rejected Manning's contention that the statute is too vague to provide fair notice of the criminal nature of disclosing classified documents. "The facts of this case," the three-judge panel ruled, "leave no question as to what constituted national defense information. Appellant's training and experience indicate, without any doubt, she was on notice and understood the nature of the information she was disclosing and how its disclosure could negatively affect national defense." The court also rejected Manning's assertion that her actions in disclosing classified information related to national security are protected by the First Amendment. Manning, the court found, "had no First Amendment right to make the disclosures—doing so not only violated the nondisclosure agreements she signed, but also jeopardized national security."&lt;ref name=CourtOfCriminalAppeals/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32607">'''Wrongful execution''' is a [[miscarriage of justice]] occurring when an innocent person is put to death by [[capital punishment]]. Cases of wrongful execution are [[Capital punishment debate|cited as an argument]] by opponents of capital punishment, while proponents suggest that the argument of innocence concerns the credibility of the justice system as a whole and does not solely undermine the use of death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&amp;scid=6 "Innocence and the Death Penalty"] at ''Death Penalty Information Center'' (U.S.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/yesdeathpenalty/chapter3 Answers to the argument against the Death Penalty]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of people are claimed to have been innocent victims of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;William Kreuter, [http://www.justicedenied.org/executed.htm "The Innocent Executed"] at ''Justice Denied, the Magazine for the Wrongly Convicted''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Keys, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070804222621/http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html "Thirty Years of Executions with Reasonable Doubts: A Brief Analysis of Some Modern Executions"], Capital Defense Weekly, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Newly available [[DNA evidence]] has allowed the [[exoneration]] and release of more than 20 [[death row]] inmates since 1992 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA Exoneree Case Profiles|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/know/|website=www.innocenceproject.org|access-date=2014-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218201335/http://www.innocenceproject.org/know/|archive-date=2013-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but DNA evidence is available in only a fraction of capital cases. Others have been released on the basis of weak cases against them, sometimes involving prosecutorial misconduct; resulting in [[acquittal]] at retrial, charges dropped, or innocence-based pardons. The [[Death Penalty Information Center]] (U.S.) has published a list of 10 inmates "executed but possibly innocent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent "Executed But Possibly Innocent"] at Death Penalty Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 39 executions are claimed to have been carried out in the U.S. in the face of evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100627053204/http://www.law.northwestern.edu/wrongfulconvictions/issues/deathpenalty/Executinginnocent/ "Executing the Innocent"], Northwestern Univ. School of Law Center on Wrongful Convictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1976 the United States has executed over 1,400 offenders: none of them have since been granted a posthumous exoneration.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer-Moss, Jessica (2013) "Flawed Forensics and the Death Penalty: Junk Science and Potentially Wrongful Executions," Seattle Journal for Social Justice: Vol. 11 : Iss. 2, Article 10. (p.760)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, reviews prompted by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] have resulted in one pardon and three exonerations for people executed between 1950 and 1953 (when the execution rate in [[England and Wales]] averaged 17 per year), with compensation being paid.

==Specific examples==

===Australia===
[[Colin Campbell Ross]] was hanged in Melbourne in 1922 for the murder of 12-year-old Alma Tirtschke the previous year in what became known as the [[Gun Alley Murder]]. The case was re-examined in the 1990s using modern techniques and Ross was eventually pardoned in 2008, by which time [[capital punishment in Australia]] had been abolished in all jurisdictions—the last execution taking place in 1967.

===People's Republic of China===
{{anchor|Wei}}Wei Qing'an ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 魏清安, 1961–1984, 23 years old) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for the rape of Kun Liu, a woman who had disappeared. The execution was carried out on 3 May 1984 by the Intermediate People's Court. In the next month, Tian Yuxiu (田玉修) was arrested and admitted that he had committed the rape. Three years later, Wei was officially declared innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.9ask.cn/Article/sdzz/201007/830981.shtml|title=魏清安案：法院枪口下还有多少冤案待昭雪？-法治新闻-中顾法律网|publisher=News.9ask.cn|date=21 July 2010|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Teng}}Teng Xingshan ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 滕兴善, ?–1989) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for supposedly having raped, robbed and murdered Shi Xiaorong (石小荣), a woman who had disappeared. An old man found a dismembered body, and incompetent police forensics claimed to have matched the body to the photo of the missing Shi Xiaorong. The execution was carried out on 28 January 1989 by the [[Huaihua]] Intermediate People's Court. In 1993, the previously missing woman returned to the village, saying she had been kidnapped and taken to Shandong. The absolute innocence of the wrongfully executed Teng was not admitted until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/20060214/n241816037.shtml|title=滕兴善 一个比佘祥林更加悲惨的人-搜狐新闻|publisher=News.sohu.com|date=2007-04-02|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Nie}}Nie Shubin ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 聂树斌, 1974–1995) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for the rape and murder of Kang Juhua (康菊花), a woman in her thirties. The execution was carried out on April 27, 1995 by the [[Shijiazhuang]] Intermediate People's Court. In 2005, ten years after the execution, Wang Shujin (Chinese: 王书金) admitted to the police that he had committed the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zwjkey.com/onews.asp?Id=1387|title=聂树斌案材料——《刑事申诉书》 - 包头律师专家服务网|publisher=Zwjkey.com|date=2007-07-08|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/69228|title=南方周末 - 聂树斌案，拖痛两个不幸家庭（2012年2月9日）|publisher=Infzm.com|date=2012-02-10|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qoγsiletu or [[Huugjilt]] (Mongolian:qoγsiletu, Chinese:[[:zh:呼格吉勒图|呼格吉勒图]], 1977-1996) was an [[Inner Mongolia]]n who was executed for the rape and murder of a young girl on June 10, 1996. On December 5, 2006, ten years after the execution, Zhao Zhihong ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 赵志红) wrote the ''Petition of my Death Penalty'' admitting he had committed the crime. Huugjilt was posthumously exonerated and Zhao Zhihong was sentenced to death in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhuang|first1=Pinghui|title=China’s ‘smiling killer’ sentenced to death for 1996 murder that saw innocent teenager executed|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1708050/chinese-smiling-killer-hear-sentence-1996-murder-saw-innocent-teenager|accessdate=19 August 2015|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Harry Gleeson was executed in Ireland in April 1941 for the [[Murder of Moll McCarthy]] in County Tipperary in November 1940. The [[Garda Síochána|Gardai]] withheld crucial evidence and fabricated other evidence against Gleeson.

===Republic of China (Taiwan)===
Jiang Guoqing (Jiang is the family name, Chinese: [[:zh:江國慶|江國慶]], 1975–1997) was a Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force private who was executed by a military tribunal on August 13, 1997 for the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl. On January 28, 2011, over 13 years after the execution, Xu Rongzhou (Chinese: 許榮洲), who had a history of sexual abuse, admitted to the prosecutor that he had been responsible for the crime. In September 2011 Jiang was posthumously acquitted by a military court who found Jiang's original confession had been obtained by torture. [[Ma Ying-jeou]], the Republic of China's president, apologised to Jiang's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sui|first1=Cindy|title=Taiwan pays compensation for wrongful execution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15476561|accessdate=19 August 2015|publisher=BBC Asia-Pacific|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1660, in a series of events known as the [[Campden Wonder]], an Englishman named William Harrison disappeared after going on a walk, near the village of Charingworth, in Gloucestershire. Some of his clothing was found slashed and bloody on the side of a local road. Investigators interrogated Harrison’s servant, John Perry, who eventually confessed that his mother and his brother had killed Harrison for money. Perry, his mother, and his brother were hanged. Two years later, Harrison reappeared, telling the incredibly unlikely tale that he had been abducted by three horsemen and sold into slavery in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Though his tale was implausible, he indubitably had not been murdered by the Perry family.
*[[Timothy Evans]] was tried and executed in March 1950 for the murder of his wife and infant daughter. An official inquiry conducted 16 years later determined that it was Evans's fellow tenant, serial killer [[John Christie (murderer)|John Reginald Halliday Christie]], who was responsible for the murder. Christie also admitted to the murder of Evans's wife, as well as five other women and his own wife. Christie may have murdered other women, judging by evidence found in his possession at the time of his arrest, but it was never pursued by the police. Evans was posthumously pardoned in 1966. The case had prompted the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1965.
*George Kelly was executed in March 1950 for the 1949 murder of the manager of the Cameo Cinema in Liverpool, UK and his assistant during a robbery that went wrong. This case became known as the [[Cameo Murder]]. Kelly's conviction was overturned in 2003. Another man, Donald Johnson, had confessed to the crime but the police bungled Johnson's case and had not divulged his confession at Kelly's trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowccott|first1=Owen|title=Man hanged 53 years ago was innocent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/11/ukcrime.owenbowcott |accessdate=2 September 2015 |publisher=The Guardian|date=11 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mahmood Hussein Mattan]] was executed in 1952 for the murder of Lily Volpert. In 1998 the Court of Appeal decided that the original case was, in the words of Lord Justice Rose, "demonstrably flawed". The family were awarded £725,000 compensation, to be shared equally among Mattan's wife and three children. The compensation was the first award to a family for a person wrongfully hanged.
*[[Derek Bentley]] was a [[mentally handicapped]] young man who was executed in 1953. He was convicted of the murder of a police officer during an attempted robbery, despite the facts that it was his accomplice who fired the gun and that Bentley was already under arrest at the time of the shooting. The accomplice who actually fired the fatal shot could not be executed due to his young age, and served only ten years in prison before he was released.&lt;ref&gt;Yallop, David (1991).

{{see also|List of wrongful convictions in the United States}}
[[University of Michigan]] law [[professor]] [[Samuel R. Gross|Samuel Gross]] led a team of experts in the law and in [[statistics]] that estimated the likely number of unjust convictions. The study, published in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''  determined that at least 4% of people on death row were and are likely innocent. Gross has no doubt that some innocent people have been executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent US death row study: 4% of defendants sentenced to die are innocent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/ Many Prisoners on Death Row are Wrongfully Convicted]&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed. For example, in the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, "it would be shouted from the rooftops that ... Virginia executed an innocent man." The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Romano, "[http://www.truthinjustice.org/DNA-DP.htm When DNA Meets Death Row, It's the System That's Tested]", [[Washington Post]], December 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chipita Rodriguez]] was hanged in [[San Patricio County, Texas]] in 1863 for murdering a horse trader, and 122 years later, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] exonerating her.

[[Thomas Griffin (black farmer)|Thomas and Meeks Griffin]] were executed in 1915 for the murder of a man involved in an interracial affair two years previously but were pardoned 94 years after execution. It is thought that they were arrested and charged because they were viewed as wealthy enough to hire competent legal counsel and get an acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/15/south.carolina.pardon/index.html|work=CNN|title=Tom Joyner gets justice for electrocuted kin, 94 years later|date=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Arridy]] (April 15, 1915 – January 6, 1939) was a mentally disabled American man executed for rape and murder and posthumously granted a pardon. Arridy was sentenced to death for the murder and rape of a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Pueblo, Colorado. He confessed to murdering the girl and assaulting her sister. Due to the sensational nature of the crime precautions were taken to keep him from being hanged by vigilante justice. His sentence was executed after multiple stays on January 6, 1939, in the Colorado gas chamber in the state penitentiary in [[Canon City, Colorado]]. Arridy was the first Colorado prisoner posthumously pardoned in January 2011 by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a former district attorney, after research had shown that Arridy was very likely not in Pueblo when the crime happened and had been coerced into confessing. Among other things, Arridy had an IQ of 46, which was equal to the mental age of a 6-year-old. He did not even understand that he was going to be executed, and played with a toy train that the warden, Roy Best, had given to him as a present. A man named Frank Aguilar had been executed in 1937 in the Colorado gas chamber for the same crime for which Arridy ended up also being executed. Arridy's posthumous pardon in 2011 was the first such pardon in Colorado history. A press release from the governor's office stated, "[A]n overwhelming body of evidence indicates the 23-year-old Arridy was innocent, including false and coerced confessions, the likelihood that Arridy was not in Pueblo at the time of the killing, and an admission of guilt by someone else." The governor also pointed to Arridy's intellectual disabilities. The governor said, “Granting a posthumous pardon is an extraordinary remedy. But the tragic conviction of Mr. Arridy and his subsequent execution on Jan. 6, 1939, merit such relief based on the great likelihood that Mr. Arridy was, in fact, innocent of the crime for which he was executed, and his severe mental disability at the time of his trial and execution."

[[George Stinney]], a 14-year old black boy, was electrocuted in South Carolina in 1944 for the murder of Betty June Binnicker, age 11, as well as Mary Emma Thames, age 8.  The arrest occurred on March 23, 1944 in Alcolu, inside of Clarendon County, South Carolina.  Apparently, the two girls rode their bikes past Stinney’s house where they asked him and his sister a certain type of flower; after this encounter, the girls went missing and were found dead in a ditch the following morning.  After an hour of interrogation by the officers, a deputy stated that Stinney confessed to the murder.  The confession explained that Stinney wanted to have intercourse with Betty, so he wanted to kill Mary to get Betty alone; however, both girls fought back and that is when he killed both of them.  This case still remains a very controversial one due to the fact that the judicial process showed severe shortcomings.  An example can be made out of this case by  showing how the judicial system does not always properly orchestrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://murderpedia.org/male.S/s/stinney-george.htm|title=George Stinney {{!}} Murderpedia, the encyclopedia of murderers|last=Blanco|first=Juan Ignacio|website=murderpedia.org|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the youngest person executed in the United States.  More than 70 years later, a judge threw out the conviction, calling it a "great injustice."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Collins, "[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/1217/70-years-later-judge-rules-14-year-old-boy-was-wrongly-executed 70 years later, judge rules 14-year-old boy was wrongly executed]", "[[The Christian Science Monitor]]", December 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlos DeLuna]] was executed in Texas in December 1989. Subsequent investigations cast strong doubt upon DeLuna's guilt for the murder of which he had been convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cohen, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/05/yes-america-we-have-executed-an-innocent-man/257106/ Yes, America, We Have Executed an Innocent Man]", ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilkington, Ed (15 May 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/15/carlos-texas-innocent-man-death?newsfeed=true The wrong Carlos: how Texas sent an innocent man to his death] ''[[The Guardian]]'', Retrieved 15 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Deluna was executed in 1989 for stabbing a gas station clerk to death.  His execution came about six years after the crime was committed.  The trial ended up attracting local attention, but it was never suggested that an innocent man was about to be punished while the actual killer went free. Deluna was found blocks away from the crime scene with $149 in his pocket.  From that point on, it went downhill for the young Carlos Deluna.  A wrongful eyewitness testimony is what formed the case against him.  Unfortunately, Deluna’s previous criminal record was very much used against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/carlos-de-luna-execution-_n_1507003.html|title=Carlos DeLuna Execution: Texas Put To Death An Innocent Man, Columbia University Team Says|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=2012-05-15|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real killer, Carlos Hernandez, was a repeat violent offender who actually had a history of slashing women with his unique buck knife, not to mention he looked very similar to Carlos Deluna.

[[Jesse Tafero]] was convicted of murder and executed via electric chair in May 1990 in the state of Florida for the murders of two Florida Highway Patrol officers.

Aleksandr Kravchenko was executed in 1983 for the 1978 murder of nine year old Yelena Zakotnova in [[Shakhty]], a coal mining town near [[Rostov-on-Don]]. Kravchenko as a teenager, had served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl but witnesses said he was not at the scene of Zakotnova's murder at the time.  Under police pressure the witnesses altered their statements and Kravchenko was executed.  Later it was found that the girl had been murdered by [[Andrei Chikatilo]] a serial killer nicknamed "the Red Ripper" and "the Butcher of Rostov" who was executed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Ripper: Inside the Mind of Russia's Most Brutal Serial Killer|last=Conradi|first=Peter|publisher=True Crime|year=1991|isbn=978-0863696183|location=|pages=43-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirk Bloodsworth]] was the first American to be freed from death row as a result of exoneration by DNA evidence. Kirk Bloodsworth was a Marine before he became a waterman on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  At the age of 22, he was wrongly convicted of the murder of a nine-year-old girl; she had been sexually assaulted, strangled, and beaten with a rock.  An anonymous call to the police claiming that the witness had seen Bloodsworth with the girl that day, and he matched up with the description from the police sketch.  Five witnesses claiming that they saw Bloodsworth with the victim, as well a statement in his testimony where he claimed that he “had done something terrible that day that would affect his relationship with his wife”, did not help his case.  No physical evidence connected Bloodsworth to the crime, but he was still convicted of rape and murder which led to him receiving the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/kirk-bloodsworth/|title=Innocence Project: The Cases — Kirk Bloodsworth|work=Innocence Project|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Krone]] is the 100th American to have been sentenced to death and then later exonerated.  Ray Krone was convicted of the murder of Kim Ancona, thirty-six year old victim in Phoenix, Arizona.  Ancona had been found nude, fatally stabbed.  The physical evidence that the police had to rely on was bite marks on Ancona’s breasts and neck.  After Ancona had told a friend that Ray Krone, a regular customer, was going to help her close the bar the previous night, the police brought him in to make a Styrofoam impression of his teeth.  After comparing the teeth marks, Krone was arrested for the murder, kidnapping, and sexual assault of Kim Ancona on December 31, 1991. At the trial in 1992, Krone pled innocence, but the teeth mark comparison caused the jury to found him guilty and he was sentenced to death as well as a consecutive twenty-one year term of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/ray-krone/|title=Ray Krone - Innocence Project|work=Innocence Project|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krone’s family also believed that he was innocent, which led them to spend over $300,000 in order to fight for his freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forejustice.org/wc/ray_krone_JD_vol2_i9.htm|title=Twice Wrongly Convicted of Murder - Ray Krone Is Set Free After 10 Years|website=forejustice.org|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, reviews prompted by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] have resulted in one pardon and three exonerations for people that were executed between 1950 and 1953 (when the execution rate in [[England and Wales]] averaged 17 per year), with compensation being paid. [[Timothy Evans]] was granted a posthumous free pardon in 1966. [[Mahmood Hussein Mattan]] was convicted in 1952 and was the last person to be hanged in [[Cardiff]], Wales, but had his conviction quashed in 1998. George Kelly was hanged at [[Liverpool]] in 1950, but had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forejustice.org/wc/george_kelly.htm George Kelly exonerated 53 years after being executed]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derek Bentley]] had his conviction quashed in 1998 with the appeal trial judge, [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]], noting that the original trial judge, [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Goddard]], had denied the defendant "the fair trial which is the birthright of every British citizen."

[[Colin Campbell Ross]] (1892–1922) was an [[Australia]]n wine-bar owner [[capital punishment|executed]] for the murder of a child which became known as [[The Gun Alley Murder]], despite there being evidence that he was innocent. Following his execution, efforts were made to clear his name, and in the 1990s old evidence was re-examined with modern [[forensic science|forensic techniques]] which supported the view that Ross was innocent. In 2006 an appeal for mercy was made to Victoria's Chief Justice and on 27 May 2008 the Victorian government pardoned Ross in what is believed to be an Australian legal first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bcrimeb-man-cleared-of-murder-86-years-after-he-was-executed/2008/05/26/1211653938453.html?page=2 ''The Age'': Ross cleared of murder nearly 90 years ago.] Retrieved 27 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. mental health controversy==
There has been much debate about the justification of [[Capital punishment debate in the United States#Diminished capacity|imposing capital punishment on individuals who have been diagnosed with mental retardation]]. Some have argued that the execution of people with mental retardation constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as it pertains to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Charles|title=Atkins v. Virginia: Execution of Mentally Retarded Defendants Revisited.|journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|date=1 Jan 2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=101–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] interpreted cruel and unusual punishment to include those that fail to take into account the defendant's degree of criminal culpability,{{clarify|date=June 2015}} it did not determine that executing the mentally retarded constitutes cruel and unusual punishment until 2002.

This issue was first addressed in the case of ''[[Penry v. Lynaugh]]'', in which [[Johnny Paul Penry]] had filed a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petition in federal district court that claimed his death sentence should be vacated because it violated his Eighth Amendment rights. His reasoning was that he suffered from mental retardation, and numerous psychologists had confirmed this to be factual, indicating that his [[IQ]] ranged from 50 to 63 and that he possessed the mental abilities of a six-and-a-half-year-old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Penry's petition was denied by the district court, whose decision was subsequently affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Penry would later appeal to the Supreme Court, who ultimately ruled in a five-to-four decision that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution did not categorically prohibit the execution of persons with mental retardation. Following the 1989 ''Penry'' ruling, sixteen states as well as the federal government passed legislation that banned the execution of offenders with mental retardation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Penry'' was overruled in 2002 by ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', which held that the Eighth Amendment's ban on [[cruel and unusual punishment]] precluded the execution of the mentally handicapped, but the Supreme Court left the definition of mentally handicapped as something to be determined by the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Cohen| first=Andrew| title=At Last, the Supreme Court Turns to Mental Disability and the Death Penalty| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/10/at-last-the-supreme-court-turns-to-mental-disability-and-the-death-penalty/280736/| newspaper=The Atlantic| date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Hall v. Florida]]'' that states cannot rely solely on an [[IQ test]] in determining whether a borderline mentally handicapped person can be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Liptak| first=Adam| title=Court Extends Curbs on the Death Penalty in a Florida Ruling| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/us/court-rules-against-florida-iq-rule-in-death-cases.html?_r=0| newspaper=The New York Times| date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''zoo''' (short for '''zoological garden''' or '''zoological park''' and also called an '''animal park''' or '''menagerie''') is a facility in which all [[Animal|animals]] are housed within enclosures, displayed to the public, and in which they may also breed.

The term "zoological garden" refers to [[zoology]], the study of animals, a term deriving from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''zōon'' (ζῷον, 'animal') and ''lógos'' (λóγος, 'study'). The abbreviation "zoo" was first used of the [[London Zoological Gardens]], which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1857.&lt;ref name=ZSL&gt;[http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history,129,AR.html "ZSL's history"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235326/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history%2C129%2CAR.html |date=February 28, 2008 }}, Zoological Society of London.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of major animal collections open to the public around the world now exceeds 1,000 and approximately 80 percent of them are in cities.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; In the [[United States]] alone, zoos are visited by  over 180 million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visitor Demographics|url=https://www.aza.org/partnerships-visitor-demographics|website=[[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[London Zoo]], which opened in 1826, was initially known as the "Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London", and it described itself as a [[menagerie]] or "zoological forest".&lt;ref name=Blunt29&gt;Blunt 1976; Reichenbach 2002, pp. 151–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation "zoo" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the [[Bristol Zoo|Clifton Zoo]], but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the song "[[Walking in the Zoo]]" by music-hall artist [[Alfred Vance]].&lt;ref name=Blunt29/&gt; The term "zoological park" was used for more expansive facilities in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[National Zoological Park (United States)|Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Bronx Zoo|Bronx]] in New York, which opened in 1847, 1891 and 1899 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hyson 2000, p. 29; Hyson 2003, pp. 1356-1357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively new terms for zoos coined in the late 20th century are "conservation park" or "biopark". Adopting a new name is a strategy used by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Maple 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopark" was first coined and developed by the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo in Washington D.C.]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1987a, pp. 10-17; Robinson 1987b, pp. 678-682.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the New York Zoological Society changed its name to the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] and rebranded the zoos under its jurisdiction as "wildlife conservation parks".&lt;ref&gt;Conway 1995, pp. 259-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Royal menageries ===
{{further information|Menagerie}}
[[File:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Tower of London]] housed [[England]]'s royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, [[British Library]]).]]

The predecessor of the zoological garden is the [[menagerie]], which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at [[Hierakonpolis]], [[Egypt]] in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]], [[hartebeest]], [[elephant]]s, [[baboon]]s and [[wildcat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World's First Zoo - Hierakonpolis, Egypt, ''Archaeology Magazine'', http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Ashur-bel-kala]] of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese Empress]] Tanki had a "house of deer" built, and [[King Wen of Zhou]] kept a {{convert|1500|acre|km2|adj=on}} zoo called ''Ling-Yu,'' or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included [[King Solomon]] of the [[United Monarchy|Kingdom of Israel and Judah]], queen [[Semiramis]] and King [[Ashurbanipal]] of [[Assyria]], and King [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=EBZoo&gt;"Zoo," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; [[Alexander the Great]] is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena,&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century historian [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]] wrote of the [[Ludi Romani|Roman games]], first held in 366 BCE:

{{quote|At one time, a [[bear]] and a [[bull]], chained together, rolled in fierce combat across the sand ... Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under [[Caligula]] ... Under [[Nero]], four hundred [[tiger]]s fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the [[Colosseum]] by [[Titus]], five thousand animals perished. Under [[Trajan]] ... [[lion]]s, tigers, elephants, [[rhinoceros]]es, hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, W.E.H. ''History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne''. Vol. 1, Longmans, 1869, pp. 280-282.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charlemagne]] had an elephant named [[Abul-Abbas]] that was given to him by the Abbasid Caliph. [[Henry I of England]] kept a collection of animals at his palace in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;which reportedly included lions, leopards, and camels.&lt;ref name=Blunt15&gt;Blunt, Wilfred. ''The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century''. Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the [[Tower of London]], created as early as 1204 by King [[John I of England|John I]].

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4371908.stm "Big cats prowled London's tower"], BBC News, October 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.&lt;ref name=Blunt15/&gt; The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened.

[[Aztec]] emperor [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] had in his capital city of [[Tenochtitlan]] a "house of animals" with a large collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was described by several Spanish conquerors, including [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Cortés reluctantly ordered the zoo to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martín del Campo y Sánchez|first1=Rafael|title=El parque zoológico de Moctezuma en Tenochtitlán|url=http://repositorio.fciencias.unam.mx:8080/jspui/bitstream/11154/143305/1/38VParqueZool%C3%B3gico.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlightenment Era ===
[[File:Versailles M2.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] menagerie during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] in the 17th century]]
{{further information|List of zoos}}

The oldest zoo in the world still in existence is the [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn]] in [[Vienna]], Austria. It was constructed by [[Adrian van Stekhoven]] in 1752 at the order of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], to serve as an imperial [[menagerie]] as part of [[Schönbrunn Palace]]. The menagerie was initially reserved for the viewing pleasure of the imperial family and the court, but was made accessible to the public in 1765.

In 1775, a zoo was founded in Madrid, and in 1795, the zoo inside the ''[[Jardin des Plantes]]'' in Paris was founded by [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre|Jacques-Henri Bernardin]], with animals from the royal menagerie at Versailles, primarily for scientific research and education. The [[Kazan Zoo]], the first zoo in [[Russia]] was founded in 1806 by the Professor of [[Kazan State University]] [[Karl Fuchs (museum founder)|Karl Fuchs]].

=== The modern zoo ===
Until the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King [[Louis XIV]]'s [[menagerie]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The modern zoo that emerged in the early 19th century at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Dublin]], was focused on providing educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration.&lt;ref name=Zsl2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/education/the-modern-zoo/introducing-the-modern-zoo,438,AR.html |title=Introducing the Modern Zoo|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing fascination for [[natural history]] and [[zoology]], coupled with the tremendous expansion in the [[urbanization]] of [[London]], led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos.
[[File:View of the Zoological Gardens1835.jpg|thumb|[[London Zoo]], 1835]]

The [[Zoological Society of London]] was founded in 1826 by [[Stamford Raffles]] and established the [[London Zoo]] in [[Regent's Park]] two years later in 1828.&lt;ref name="science-history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.todayinsci.com/4/4_27.htm | title = April 27 | publisher = Today in Science History | accessdate =5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its founding, it was the world's first scientific zoo.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZSL-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history,129,AR.html |title=ZSL's History |publisher=[[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]] |accessdate=5 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235326/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history%2C129%2CAR.html |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to be used as a collection for [[science|scientific study]], it was eventually opened to the public in 1847.&lt;ref name="ZSL-history" /&gt; The Zoo was located in [[Regent's Park]] - then undergoing development at the hands of the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]. What set the London zoo apart from its predecessors was its focus on society at large. The zoo was established in the middle of a city for the public, and its layout was designed to cater for the large London population. The London zoo was widely copied as the archetype of the public city zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designforlife.com.sg/thesis/12history.html|title=The Role of Architectural Design in Promoting the Social Objectives of Zoos|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the Zoo opened the world's first [[public aquarium]].

[[Downs' Zoological Gardens]] created by [[Andrew Downs]] and opened to the Nova Scotia public in 1847. It was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. By the early 1860s, the zoo grounds covered 40 hectares with many fine flowers &amp; ornamental trees, picnic areas, statues, walking paths, The Glass House (which contained a greenhouse with an aviary, aquarium, &amp; museum of stuffed animals &amp; birds), a pond, a bridge over a waterfall, an artificial lake with a fountain, a wood-ornamented greenhouse, a forest area, and enclosures &amp; buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cu0SAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Andrew+Downs%22+Halifax&amp;dq=%22Andrew+Downs%22+Halifax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIhN3K06vTAhWhgVQKHdKdB1wQ6AEIMzAD|title=The Dalhousie Review|first=Herbert Leslie|last=Stewart|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-zoological-gardens-1.3207653|title=Did you know the first zoo in Canada and the U.S. was in Halifax?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saltscapes.com/people-culture-section/people-culture-category/1089-zoo-diary.html|title=Zoo Diary - Saltscapes Magazine|first=Scott|last=Noble|website=Saltscapes Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dublin Zoo]] was opened in 1831 by members of the medical profession interested in studying animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-great-zoos-who-2669960.html | work=Irish Independent | first=John | last=Costello | title=The great zoo's who | date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first zoological garden in [[Australia]] was [[Melbourne Zoo]] in 1860. In the same year, [[Central Park Zoo]], the first public zoo in the United States, opened in New York, although in 1859, the [[Philadelphia Zoo|Philadelphia Zoological Society]] had made an effort to establish a zoo, but delayed opening it until 1874 because of the [[American Civil War]].

In 1907, the [[Germany|German]] entrepreneur [[Carl Hagenbeck]] founded the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]] in Stellingen, now a quarter of [[Hamburg]]. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S. Ebersole |date=November 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906144905/http://www.audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |archivedate=2007-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.

When [[ecology]] emerged as a matter of public interest in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with [[Gerald Durrell]] of the [[Durrell Wildlife Park|Jersey Zoo]], George Rabb of [[Brookfield Zoo]], and William Conway of the [[Bronx Zoo]] ([[Wildlife Conservation Society]]) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|American Zoo Association]] soon said that conservation was its highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;See Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.): ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', Boca Raton 2001. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}; Hoage, R. J. Deiss and William A.

''A Different Nature'', Berkeley 2001. {{ISBN|0-520-21879-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The [[Detroit Zoo]], for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Jesse and Trump, Erik. ''Political Animals: Public Art in American Zoos and Aquariums''.
Lexington Books, 2007, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whipsnade Park]] in [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]], was opened in 1931 as the first safari park. It allowed visitors to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity with the animals.

The [[Wrocław Zoo]] ({{lang-pl|Ogród Zoologiczny we Wrocławiu}}), the oldest zoo in Poland opened in 1865 and was home to about 10,500 animals representing about 1,132 species (in terms of the number of animal species it is the third largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/1,35771,19502168,wielkie-liczenie-w-zoo-we-wroclawiu-zobacz-ile-zwierzat-w.html Wielkie liczenie w zoo we Wrocławiu. Zobacz, ile zwierząt w nim mieszka]&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2014 the Wrocław Zoo opened the [[Africarium]], the only themed [[oceanarium]] devoted solely to exhibiting the [[fauna of Africa]], comprehensively presenting selected ecosystems from the continent of [[Africa]]. Housing over 10 thousand animals, the facility's breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to the large mammals like the elephants on an area of over 33 [[hectare]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Isler |first1=Danuta |title=A trip to Wroclaw Afrykarium |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/6/Artykul/365527,A-trip-to-Wroclaw-Afrykarium |website=Radio Poland |publisher=Radio Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[habitat destruction|Mass destruction of wildlife habitat]] has yet to cease all over the world and many species such as [[elephants]], big cats, [[Penguin|penguins]], tropical birds, primates, [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species and see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.&lt;ref name="Masci, David 2014"&gt;Masci, David. "Zoos in the 21st Century." CQ Researcher 28 Apr. 2000: 353-76. Web. 26 Jan. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education.&lt;ref name="Masci, David 2014"/&gt;

=== Human exhibits ===
[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ota Benga]], a human exhibit in New York, 1906]]
{{further information|Human zoo|Scientific racism|Social Darwinism}}

Human beings were sometimes displayed in cages along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of [[Europe]]an and non-European origin. In September 1906, [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York&amp;mdash;with the agreement of [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]&amp;mdash;had [[Ota Benga]], a Congolese [[pygmy]], displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot. The exhibit was intended as an example of the "missing link" between the orangutan and white man. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''.

Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors. [[Nocturnal]] animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[insect]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]], and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as [[lemur]]s, [[marmoset]]s, birds, [[lizard]]s, and [[turtle]]s. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch.

=== Safari park ===
{{main article|Safari park}}
[[File:Giraffes at west midlands safari park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giraffe]]s in the [[West Midland Safari Park]]]]

Some zoos keep animals in larger, outdoor enclosures, confining them with [[moat]]s and fences, rather than in cages. [[Safari park]]s, also known as zoo parks and lion farms, allow visitors to drive through them and come in close proximity to the animals.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; Sometimes, visitors are able to feed animals through the car windows. The first safari park was [[Whipsnade Zoo|Whipsnade Park]] in Bedfordshire, England, opened by the [[Zoological Society of London]] in 1931 which today (2014) covers 600 acres (2.4&amp;nbsp;km²). Since the early 1970s, an 1,800 acre (7&amp;nbsp;km²) park in the San Pasqual Valley near San Diego has featured the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]], run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. One of two state-supported zoo parks in North Carolina is the {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[North Carolina Zoo]] in Asheboro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferral |first=Katelyn |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/15/582114/nc-zoo-bucking-a-trend-sets-an.html |title=N.C.

=== Aquaria ===
{{further|Public aquarium}}
[[File:Seals@melb zoo.jpg|thumb|right|Sea lions at the [[Melbourne Zoo]]]]

The first [[public aquarium]] was opened at the London Zoo in 1853. This was followed by the opening of public aquaria in continental Europe (e.g. Paris in 1859, Hamburg in 1864, Berlin in 1869, and Brighton in 1872) and the United States (e.g. Boston in 1859, Washington in 1873, San Francisco Woodward's Garden in 1873, and the New York Aquarium at [[Battery Park]] in 1896).

=== Roadside zoos ===
Roadside zoos are found throughout [[North America]], particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit zoos, often intended to attract visitors to some other facility, such as a gas station. The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html Guzoo Animal Farm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510051708/http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html |date=May 10, 2008 }}, website about Canadian roadside zoos, accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Since they are sometimes less regulated, roadside zoos are often subject to accusations of [[neglect]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KeoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0AcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2373,1804633&amp;dq=roadside-zoo&amp;hl=en Roadside zoo animals starving.] ''Free Lance-Star.'' 11 Jan. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Jennifer.

In June 2014 the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] filed a lawsuit against the Iowa-based roadside Cricket Hollow Zoo for violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to provide proper care for its animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/animal-legal-defense-fund-sues-iowa-zoo-over-endangered-species-act-violations/Animal|title=Animal Abandonment is a Crime - Animal Legal Defense Fund|date=8 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since filing the lawsuit, ALDF has obtained records from investigations conducted by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services; these records show that the zoo is also violating the Animal Welfare Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/237127240/USDA-APHIS-Inspection-Report-of-Cricket-Hollow-Zoo-May-21-2014/USDA|title=- APHIS Inspection Report of Cricket Hollow Zoo, May 21 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petting zoos ===
{{main article|Petting zoo}}

A petting zoo, also called petting farms or children's zoos, features a combination of [[domestic animal]]s and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby.

=== Animal theme parks ===
{{main article|Animal theme park}}

An animal theme park is a combination of an [[amusement park]] and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. [[Marine mammal park]]s such as [[SeaWorld|Sea World]] and [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] are more elaborate [[dolphinarium]]s keeping [[whale]]s, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as a stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] and [[Gatorland]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[Flamingo Land]] in [[North Yorkshire, England]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] in [[Vallejo, California]].

== Sources of animals ==
By the year 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals.  This trend, however was and still is somewhat species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures. Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the ''International Zoo Yearbook''.&lt;ref name=EBProcurement&gt;"Zoo: Procurement and care of animals," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justification ==

=== Conservation and research ===
[[File:NCZooelephants.jpg|thumb|right|The African plains exhibit at [[North Carolina Zoo]] illustrates the dimension of an open-range zoo.]]

The position of most modern zoos in [[Australasia]], Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly those with scientific societies, is that they display wild animals primarily for the [[conservation biology|conservation]] of endangered [[species]], as well as for [[Animal testing|research purposes]] and education, and secondarily for the entertainment of visitors,&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, Colin. ''Last Animals in the Zoo: How Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped'', London 1991. {{ISBN|1-55963-157-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/MANIFESTO.pdf "Manifesto for Zoos"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823075916/http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/MANIFESTO.pdf |date=August 23, 2006 }}, John Regan Associates, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; an argument disputed by critics. The Zoological Society of London states in its charter that its aim is "the advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom." It maintains two research institutes, the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. In the U.S., the Penrose Research Laboratory of the Philadelphia Zoo focuses on the study of comparative [[pathology]].&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums produced its first conservation strategy in 1993, and in November 2004, it adopted a new strategy that sets out the aims and mission of zoological gardens of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waza.org/conservation/wzacs.php "World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy"], World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programmes containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective, and there are regional programmes all over the world for the conservation of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;In Africa, conservation is handled by the African Preservation Program APP (African Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquaria; in the U.S. and Canada by Species Survival Plans ([http://www.aza.org/ American Zoo and Aquarium Association]), and the [http://www.caza.ca/ Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums]); in Australasia, by the Australasian Species Management Program ([http://www.arazpa.org.au/ASMP_Committee.htm Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202150900/http://arazpa.org.au/ASMP_Committee.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}); in Europe, by the European Endangered Species Program ([http://www.eaza.net/ European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]); and in Japan, South Asia, and South East Asia, by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation, and the South East Asian Zoo Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides conservation of captive species, large zoos may form a suitable environment for wild native animals such as [[heron]]s to live in or visit. A colony of [[black-crowned night heron]]s has regularly summered at the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for more than a century.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian's mystery of the black-crowned night herons solved by satellites"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akpan|first1=Nsikan|title=Smithsonian's mystery of the black-crowned night herons solved by satellites|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/sciencescope-smithsonians-mystery-black-crowned-night-herons-solved-satellites/|website=PBS News Hour|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoos may provide information to visitors on wild animals visiting or living in the zoo, or encourage them by directing them to specific feeding or breeding platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birdworld Animals|url=http://birdworld.co.uk/animals/|website=Birdworld|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tiergarten&gt;{{cite web |title=Graureiher |url=https://www.zoovienna.at/tiere/voegel/graureiher/ |publisher=Tiergarten Schoenbrunn |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roadside zoos ==
In modern, well-regulated zoos, breeding is controlled to maintain a self-sustaining, global captive population.  This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions. Overall "stock turnover" of animals during a year in a select group of poor zoos was reported as 20%-25% with 75% of wild caught apes dying in captivity within the first 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick and Tweedy-Holmes Karen. ''Thought to exist in the wild: awakening from the nightmare of zoos''. No Voice Unheard, 2007, p. 21; Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth. ''Zoo: A History of the Zoological Gardens of the West''. Reaktion, London. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the report stated that before successful breeding programs, the high mortality rate was the reason for the "massive scale of importations."

One 2-year study indicated that of 19,361 mammals that left accredited zoos in the U.S. between 1992 and 1998, 7,420 (38%) went to dealers, auctions, hunting ranches, unaccredited zoos and individuals, and game farms.&lt;ref&gt;Goldston, Linda. February 11, 1999, cited in Scully, Matthew. ''Dominion''. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004 (paperback), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal welfare concerns ==
{{further information|Captivity (animal)|Behavioral enrichment}}
[[File:Dalian zoo bear cages, 1997.jpg|right|thumb|Bear cages, one square meter in size, in Dalian zoo, Port Arthur, Liaoning Province, China, in 1997]]

The welfare of zoo animals varies widely. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Bryan G.; Hutchins, Michael; Stevens, Elizabeth F.; Maple, Terry L. (ed.): ''Ethics on the Ark. Zoos, Animal Welfare, and Wildlife Conservation''. Washington, D.C., 1995. {{ISBN|1-56098-515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malmud, Randy. ''Reading Zoos. Representations of Animals and Captivity''. New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8147-5602-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study examining data collected over four decades found that [[polar bear]]s, lions, tigers and [[cheetah]]s show evidence of stress in captivity.&lt;ref name=MarkNYT2003&gt;Derr, Mark. "Big Beasts, Tight Space and a Call for Change in Journal Report," ''The New York Times'', October 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoos can be internment camps for animals, but also a place of refuge. A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in.  When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382).  However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50).

=== Moral concerns ===
Some critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}

=== Behavioural restriction ===
Many modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and [[behavioural enrichment]]s.  This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages.&lt;ref name=Masci2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masci, D.|title=Zoos in the 21st century.|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2000|pages=353–76|url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Zoos-in-the-21st-Century.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviors in zoo enclosures. For example, elephants usually travel approximately {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day.&lt;ref name="Are zoos good"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Zoos good or bad for animals?|url=http://animal.discovery.com/animal-facts/zoos-good-or-bad.htm|accessdate=28 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030041017/http://animal.discovery.com/animal-facts/zoos-good-or-bad.htm|archive-date=30 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abnormal behaviour ===
{{further information|List of abnormal behaviours in animals}}

Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their [[Ethogram|behavioural repertoire]]. These are usually indicative of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perspective On Zoos |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/the-perspective-on-zoos/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=27 September 2017 |accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers.&lt;ref name="Are zoos good" /&gt; Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals.&lt;ref name=Sterm2005&gt;{{cite web|author=Sterm, A.|date=28 February 2005|title=Elephant deaths at zoos reignite animal debate: Zoo supporters cite conservation, activists cite confined spaces|publisher=MSNBC/Reuters|url=http://www.elephants.com/media/MSNBC_2_28_05.htm|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants have been recorded displaying [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypical behaviours]] in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.&lt;ref name=Harrisetal.2008&gt;{{cite web|author1=Harris, M. |author2=Sherwin, C. |author3=Harris, S. |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf|title=Defra Final Report on Elephant Welfare|publisher=University of Bristol|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shortened longevity ===
Elephants in Japanese zoos have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long as those in the wild.&lt;ref name=Mott2008&gt;{{cite web|author=Mott, M.|date=11 December 2008|title=Wild elephants live longer than their zoo counterparts|publisher=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-zoo-elephants.html|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many other animals, such as reptiles, can live much longer than they would in the wild.

=== Climate concerns ===
Climatic conditions can make it difficult to keep some animals in zoos in some locations. For example, [[Alaska Zoo]] had an elephant named Maggie. She was housed in a small, indoor enclosure because the outdoor temperature was too low.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershaw|first1=Sarah|title=Alaska's lone zoo elephant heats up national debate|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-01-10/news/0501100102_1_elephant-experts-alaska-zoo-asian-elephant|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=10 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pemberton|first1=Mary|title=Alaska's only elephant heads to California|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21587690/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/alaskas-only-elephant-heads-california/#.VqLQkVN95Fw|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=NBC|date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surplus animals ==
Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos. As a consequence, various management tools are used to preserve the space for the most "valuable" individuals and reduce the risk of [[inbreeding]]. Management of animal populations is typically through international organizations such as [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] and [[EAZA]].&lt;ref name=PQA/&gt; Zoos have several different ways of managing the animal populations, such as moves between zoos, [[Wildlife contraceptive|contraception]], sale of excess animals and euthanization (culling).&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;

Contraception can be effective, but may also have health repercussions and can be difficult (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when zoo contraceptives work too well?|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/what-happens-when-zoo-contraceptives-work-too-well/article_8e71a4c4-2cd1-58d7-b8af-8fe8eb1be30c.html|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|author=Hunn, D.|date=February 16, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject.&lt;ref name=PQA&gt;{{cite journal|title=Population Q&amp;A|journal=Zooquaria|publisher=EAZA|volume=Autumn 2016|issue=94|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common and in some cases animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined.&lt;ref name=WMC&gt;{{cite book|title=Wild Mammals in Captivity|year=2010|author=Kleiman, Thompson and Baer|pages=265–266|isbn=978-0-226-44009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial.&lt;ref name=HPMG&gt;{{cite web|title=Marius The Giraffe Was Not Alone: Zoos in Europe Kill 5,000 Healthy Animals Annually|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/27/marius-giraffe-zoos-cull_n_4865542.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of [[Marius (giraffe)|a healthy giraffe]] at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copenhagen Zoo kills 'surplus' young giraffe Marius despite online petition.|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/copenhagen-zoo-kills-surplus-young-giraffe-marius-despite-online-petition-9117317.html|publisher=The Independent|author=Johnston, I.|date=February 9, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt; This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt; Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;&lt;ref name=HPMG/&gt;

== Live feeding and "baiting" ==

In many countries, feeding live vertebrates to zoo animals is illegal, except in exceptional circumstances.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  For example, some snakes refuse to eat dead prey. However, in the Badaltearing Safari Park in [[China]], visitors can throw live goats into the lion enclosure and watch them being eaten, or can purchase live [[chicken]]s tied to [[bamboo]] rods for the equivalent of 2 [[dollars]]/[[euros]] to dangle into lion pens.  Visitors can drive through the lion compound in buses with specially designed chutes which they can use to push live chickens into the enclosure. In the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors.&lt;ref name=Penman&gt;{{cite news|author=Penman, D|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-506153/Animals-torn-pieces-lions-baying-crowds-spectator-sport-China-DOESNT-want-see.html|title=Animals torn to pieces by lions in front of baying crowds: The spectator sport China DOESN'T want you to see.|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lairweb1999&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/release7.html|title=Ferocity training|publisher=Sunday Morning Post, Hong Kong|date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Qingdao zoo (Eastern China), visitors can engage in "tortoise baiting", where tortoises are kept inside small rooms with elastic bands around their necks so that they are unable to retract their heads. Visitors are allowed to throw coins at them. The marketing claim is that if a person hits one of the tortoises on the head and makes a wish, it will be fulfilled.&lt;ref name=Penman/&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[File:WPA Zoo Poster (Elephant).jpg|thumb|upright|WPA 1937 poster promoting visits to American zoos]]

=== United States ===
In the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the [[Endangered Species Act]], the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]], the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] and others.&lt;ref  name=Grech&gt;Grech, Kali S. [http://www.animallaw.info/articles/ovuszoos.htm "Overview of the Laws Affecting Zoos"], Michigan State University College of Law, Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA). To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aza.org/Accreditation/AccreditationIntro/ AZA Accreditation Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102132956/http://www.aza.org/Accreditation/AccreditationIntro/ |date=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In April 1999, the [[European Union]] introduced a directive to strengthen the conservation role of zoos, making it a statutory requirement that they participate in conservation and education, and requiring all member states to set up systems for their licensing and inspection.&lt;ref name=Defra/&gt; Zoos are regulated in the UK by the Zoo Licensing Act of 1981, which came into effect in 1984. A zoo is defined as any "establishment where wild animals are kept for exhibition ... to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, seven or more days in any period of twelve consecutive months", excluding circuses and pet shops. The Act requires that all zoos be inspected and licensed, and that animals kept in enclosures are provided with a suitable environment in which they can express most normal behavior.&lt;ref name=Defra&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/zoo.htm "The Zoo Licensing Act 1981"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504172909/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/zoo.htm |date=May 4, 2008 }}, Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;
