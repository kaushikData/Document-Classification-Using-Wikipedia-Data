'''''7th Cavalry''''' is a 1956 American [[Technicolor]] [[Western (genre)|Western film]] directed by [[Joseph H. Lewis (director)|Joseph H. Lewis]] based on a story, "A Horse for Mrs. Custer," by [[Glendon Swarthout]] set after the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]]. Filmed in Mexico, the picture stars [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Barbara Hale]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/43867/Seventh-Cavalry/overview |title=New York Times: 7th Cavalry |accessdate=July 19, 2008|work=NY Times | first=A. O. | last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Captain Tom Benson ([[Randolph Scott]]) has been granted a furlough to bring his bride-to-be Martha back to [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] and his Regiment, the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]]. Benson is mystified when he sees the fort apparently deserted with the colors not flying. Exploring the vacant post he is met by the hysterical Charlotte Reynolds ([[Jeanette Nolan]]) whose husband replaced Benson as commander of his "C" Company and was killed at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]]. Only a small group of misfits and [[military prison|guardhouse]] prisoners led by an old sergeant remain who have held a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] by drinking themselves into oblivion.

Once the commands of Major [[Marcus Reno]] ([[Frank Wilcox]]) and Captain [[Frederick Benteen]] ([[Michael Pate]]) have returned, they and the widows hold Benson in contempt, not only for not being at the battle in command of his men, but what they perceived as [[George Custer]]'s liking for him, Benson's non-[[West Point]] background, and his career as a gambler until commissioned into the Regiment.

Martha's father Colonel Kellogg ([[Russell Hicks (actor)|Russell Hicks]]) comes to the post to conduct a Board of Inquiry into Custer's actions that Benson sees as a smear against a man he admires who can not defend himself.

Held in contempt by his Regiment, when the [[Ulysses S. Grant|President of the United States]] orders the recovery of the slain officers and the burial of the cavalrymen who fell in the battle, Benson takes his misfits and military prisoners into Indian territory to perform the task.

The Indians have made the land sacred ground and do not want to see the enemies they respected taken away from their burial site. A standoff develops as the cavalry insist on leaving the battleground with the dead officers' bodies. As the situation becomes tense a cavalryman is shot dead with an arrow whilst trying to escape. Then Custer's second horse (Dandy) appears - having been ridden out by a messenger who is unhorsed by an Indian scout away from the action - and is mistaken for Custer's dead horse (Vic) by the Indians. The bugler blows the call to charge and the horse gallops towards the cavalry's position. The Indians are said to believe that Custer's spirit has returned and allow the cavalry to leave the field. Back at the camp Captain Benson is reconciled with his father-in-law, and salutes as a [[Flag of the United States|48-star American flag]] is raised.

While the initial plan was that Ali would direct the play, as the rehearsals began, three directors joined in, each directing the monologues. The lack of any props, apart from a single chair and central spotlight, is compensated by an intense script. While the it is comic, the play sends across a message loud and clear - women need to understand and respect a man's emotional needs.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;[http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/lounge/Words-of-wisdom-from-down-there/articleshow/40129445.cms Words of wisdom from down there] The Penis Monologues on [[Bangalore Mirror]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Chutzpah'''''  premiered on 17 April 2015, at [[Chowdiah Memorial Hall]], Bangalore. The play is titled ‘Chutzpah’ (Hebrewish word). ‘Chutzpah’ refers to audacity, indignance and the power to do something unconventional. The characters are based on women who have broken free from their inhibitions and defied the stereotype. The play celebrates the latent power of all women in a 90-minute musical satire written by [[Sharmin Ali]] herself, in a time when gender issues are being addressed more frequently in India.&lt;ref name=":09"&gt;[http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/Narratives-of-Power-and-Selfhood/2015/04/15/article2764259.ece Narratives of Power and Selfhood] [[The New Indian Express]] on Chutzpah&lt;/ref&gt; A group of activists took offence to the play's title, ‘[[Chutzpah]]’, a Hebrew word meaning audacity.

'''Bachatón''' is a [[fusion genre]] from [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] which combines [[bachata (music)|bachata]] melodies and [[reggaeton]] style beats, lyrics, rapping, and [[disc jockey]]ing. The word "bachatón" is a combination of "bachata" and "reggaeton". "Bachatón" was coined and widely accepted in 2005. It is a subgenre of [[reggaeton]] and [[bachata (music)|bachata]].

==Background==
{{main|Bachata (music)}}
[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]] is a genre of [[music]] that originated in the [[Dominican Republic]] in the early parts of the 20th century and spread to other parts of Latin America and Mediterranean Europe. It became popular in the countryside and the rural neighborhoods of the [[Dominican Republic]]. Its subjects are often [[Romance (love)|romantic]]; especially prevalent are tales of [[Broken heart|heartbreak]] and sadness. In fact, the original term used to name the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness" or "bitter music"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. The form of [[dance]], [[Bachata (dance)|bachata]], also developed with the music.&lt;ref name="pacini1"&gt;Pacini Hernandez, Deborah. [http://home-3.tiscali.nl/~pjetax/historias/history_bachata.html "Brief history of Bachata"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910010448/http://home-3.tiscali.nl/~pjetax/historias/history_bachata.html |date=September 10, 2004 }}, ''Bachata, A social history of a Dominican popular music'', 1995, Temple University Press. Retrieved on 2008-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest bachata was originally developed in the Dominican Republic around the early part of the 20th century, with mixed Cuban boleros and, which originated from Son. with African elements, combined with traditional Latin/Caribbean rhythms. During much of its history, bachata music was denigrated by Latino/Caribbean society and associated with rural backwardness and delinquency. The typical bachata group consists of five instruments: lead [[guitar]], rhythm guitar, [[electric bass guitar]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and [[güira]].The rhythm guitar is also known as a ''segunda'' and serves the purpose of adding [[syncopation]] to the music. Bachata groups mainly play a simple style of [[bolero]] (lead guitar instrumentation using [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] repetitive chords is a distinctive characteristic of bachata), but when they change to [[Merengue music|merengue]] based bachata, the [[percussion]]ist will switch from bongo to a [[Tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]] drum. In the 1960s and 1970s, [[maracas]] were used instead of güira. The change in the 1980s from maracas to the more versatile güira was made as bachata was becoming more dance oriented.&lt;ref name="pacini1"/&gt;

{{main|Reggaeton}}
[[Reggaetón]] is an urban form of music which has its roots in [[Latin American music|Latin and Caribbean music]].&lt;ref name="dukeupress.edu"&gt;[http://www.dukeupress.edu/books.php3?isbn=8223-4383-7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519041627/http://www.dukeupress.edu/books.php3?isbn=8223-4383-7 |date=2009-05-19 }}.

Reggaeton blends [[Jamaica]]n musical influences of [[dancehall]], with those of [[Latin America]], such as [[salsa music|salsa]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], [[Latin hip hop]], and [[electronica]]. Vocals include [[rapping]] and [[singing]], typically in Spanish. Lyrics tend to be derived from [[hip hop music|hip hop]] rather than from dancehall. Like hip hop, reggaeton has caused some controversy, albeit less, due to alleged exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4304185.stm BBC News – "Puerto Rico shakes to a new beat"]&lt;/ref&gt; While it takes influences from hip hop and Jamaican dancehall, reggaeton is not precisely the [[Hispanic]] or Latin American version of either of these genres; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU_bZ6dAMGY Pistas de Reggaeton Famosas / Official Reggaeton Beats]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Latin hip hop is simply hip hop recorded by artists of [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] descent. The specific "[[riddim]]" that characterizes reggaeton is referred to as "Dem Bow".&lt;ref name="phoenix"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/1595-rise-of-reggaeton/ | publisher=The Phoenix | title=Rise of Reggaetón | date=2006-01-19 | accessdate=2006-07-24 | author=Wayne Marshall }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villagevoice"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-01-10/music/grow-dem-bow/ | publisher=Village Voice | title=Grow Dem Bow | accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is taken from the dancehall song by [[Shabba Ranks]] that first popularized the beat in the early 1990s which appears on his album ''[[Just Reality]]''.

==History==

===2000–2003: The arrival of Dominican styles of music===
The appearance of Dominican styles of music such as bachata and merengue in reggaetón coincided with the arrival in [[Puerto Rico]] of the Dominican-born production team of [[Luny Tunes]]—although they are not solely credited for this development.&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=koaINmF8l5kC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=La+Mala+Ivy+Queen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-tblUNDDBaSQ2gWpm4GgDQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=La%20Mala%20Ivy%20Queen&amp;f=false Raquel Z. Rivera, Wayne Marshall and Deborah Pacini Hernandez. "Reggaeton". [[Duke University Press]]. 2009. pg. 143-]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, they received an opportunity to work in the reggaeton studio of [[DJ Nelson]]. They began to produce a string of successful releases for reggaeton artists including [[Ivy Queen]], [[Tego Calderón]] and [[Daddy Yankee]].&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"/&gt; "Pa' Que Retozen", one of the first songs to combine bachata and reggaeton appeared on Tego Calderón's highly acclaimed ''[[El Abayarde]]'' (2002). It features the unmistakable guitar sounds of Dominican bachata—although, it was not produced by Luny Tunes but by DJ Joe.&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"/&gt; Luny Tunes however, on their debut studio album, ''[[Mas Flow]]'' (2003) included a hit by Calderón, "Métele Sazón". It exhibited bachata's signature guitar arpeggios as well as merengue's characteristic piano riffs.&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"/&gt;

===2004–2005: "Bachatón"===
After the success of these songs, other artists began to incorporate bachata with reggaeton. Artists such as Ivy Queen began releasing singles that featured bachata's signature guitar sound and slower romantic rhythm as well as bachata's exaggerate emotional singing style.&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"/&gt; This is reflected in the hits "[[Te He Querido, Te He Llorado]]" and "La Mala".&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"/&gt; Daddy Yankee's "[[Lo Que Paso, Paso]]" and [[Don Omar]]'s "[[Dile (Don Omar song)|Dile]]" also reflect this. A further use of bachata occurred in 2005 when producers began remixing existing reggaeton with bachata's characteristic guitar sounds marketing it as ''bachatón'' defining it as "bachata, Puerto Rican style".&lt;ref name="ReggaetonBook"/&gt;

The single-player aspect features missions that involve clashes between U.S. Marines, China and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition. The multiplayer aspect of the game allows players to organize into squads that come under the leadership of a single commander to promote teamwork.&lt;ref name="gspot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ocampo |first=Jason |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews|title=Battlefield 2 Review for the PC|publisher=GameSpot|date=June 21, 2005|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place in the early 21st&amp;nbsp;century during a fictional world war between various power blocs: [[China]], the [[European Union]], the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC), [[Russia]] and the [[United States]]. The game takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces. A sequel, ''[[Battlefield 3]]'', was released in October 2011.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Bf2 ingame screen.jpg|left|thumb|''Battlefield 2'' screenshot showing a USMC Spec Ops player capturing a MEC control point]]
''Battlefield 2'' is a sequel to ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'', with many changes to the popular gameplay of the original. Many of these new gameplay features were added to the game with teamwork and collaboration in mind. The new game engine includes improved physics, dynamic lighting, and more realistic material penetration.

''Battlefield 2'' is a [[multiplayer game]] played via the [[Internet]] or on a [[local area network]]. A [[single-player]] mode with three difficulty levels is included. Both player modes use the same maps and use ''Battlefield''{{'}}s [[Conquest (gametype)|conquest]] game mode. Single-player mode allows 16 [[computer game bot|computer-controlled players]]&lt;ref name="Gamespy review page 4"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Kosak|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/battlefield-2/626911p4.html |title=GameSpy: Battlefield 2 – Page 4|publisher=GameSpy|date=June 17, 2005|accessdate=May 19, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060613130520/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/battlefield-2/626911p4.html| archivedate=June 13, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Internet mode allows up to 64 players. Players can choose to play as the [[United States Marine Corps]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], or the "Middle Eastern Coalition". Additional factions are playable through the [[Battlefield 2#Official Expansion Pack|expansion packs]], such as the [[European Union]]. Progress in the game is made via promotions which allow additional weapons to be unlocked. By playing the game on ranked servers, players are able to add to their [[Battlefield 2#Global ranking|global player statistics]]. These statistics are used to award promotions and other achievements.

In ''Battlefield 2'', players are divided into two opposing teams (which factions they represent is dependent upon the map). The key objective in ''Battlefield 2'' is to reduce the opposing teams tickets. Tickets represent an army's ability to reinforce their position on the battlefield; each team has only a limited supply of tickets, and each casualty on the battlefield reduces the number of available tickets. Control points represent key points on the map, and are represented by flags. Control points are ''Battlefield 2''{{'}}s [[spawn point]]s, and one team possessing a significant majority of the control points causes the other teams tickets to gradually decrease, regardless of casualties. A round ends when one team's tickets gone, the round's timer ends, or if at any point a team holds no control points, and has no soldiers alive on the battlefield (meaning they are not present in any way on the battlefield).

''Battlefield 2''{{'}}s two game modes are Conquest and Cooperative. The only difference between the two modes is that Cooperative includes [[computer game bot|computer-controlled players]], whilst Conquest allows only human players. Results from Cooperative mode do not count toward [[Battlefield 2#Global ranking|global player statistics]].

=== Infantry classes ===
In ''Battlefield 2'', as with previous ''Battlefield'' titles, players are able to select from a variety of infantry classes. Each class of soldier is equipped with different weaponry appropriate to their role in the battle. Assault soldiers, for example, are general-purpose infantry with grenade-launcher equipped assault-rifles and extra armor, Medics carry first-aid equipment such as a field defibrillator, and Anti-Tank troopers are equipped with missiles which are effective against heavy armor.

Players are able to choose a class at the start of a match, or between dying and [[respawning|respawn]]. Players can also change their class by picking up a "kit" from the body of an incapacitated soldier, friendly or otherwise. Hence, an Assault soldier can become a Medic if they come across a fallen Medic. Player classes are divided in 'Heavy' (with reduced damage done to the torso, but lower stamina) and 'Light' (with standard multipliers, but higher stamina, thus able to sprint for a longer time).

Within the infantry class, there are four support classes with special abilities. The Engineer can repair with his wrench, the Medic can revive with his defibrillator paddles and heal, the Support can resupply ammunition with his ammunition bags and the sniper can place claymores and engage long distance targets. When one of these three classes occupies a vehicle(with the exception of the recon), nearby personnel and vehicles can be replenished, repaired or healed by being in close proximity.

* '''Assault''' - Primary role is to engage in combat with enemies at medium range.

* '''Medic''' - Primary role is to revive and heal teammates

* '''Anti-Tank''' - Primary role is to undertake anti-tank warfare

* '''Engineer''' - Primary role is to repair or destroy vehicles

* '''Support''' - Primary role is to provide suppressive fire against enemies and resupply teammates

* '''Special Forces''' - Primary role is carry out stealth and sabotage missions

* '''Sniper''' - Primary role is to engage targets at long distances.

=== Vehicles ===
The various forces still use the trademark feature of the ''Battlefield'' series – the large stable of vehicles that any player can climb into and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield 2 Profile Preview – The Vehicles of Battlefield 2|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2/news.html?sid=6119131&amp;mode=recent&amp;page=1|publisher=GameSpot|date=February 24, 2005|accessdate=June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of vehicles playable in ''Battlefield 2'', all based on real-life vehicles used by the militaries of different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield 2 Developer Interview (video)|url=http://www.gamespot.com/video/920407/6102890/battlefield-2-developer-interview|publisher=GameSpot|date=July 16, 2004|accessdate=June 28, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070619073559/http://www.gamespot.com/video/920407/6102890/battlefield-2-developer-interview| archivedate=June 19, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to ''Battlefield 1942'', ''Battlefield 2'' has only one purely water-based vehicle, the [[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat|rigid-inflatable boat]]; however, the [[BTR-90]], the MEC [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]], can travel in water as well as the [[LAV-25]] and the [[WZ551|WZ 551]], the USMC and PLA equivalents, respectively. The developers tried to design the game so that every vehicle would be weak to another type of vehicle, intending to create a situation similar to a game of [[rock, paper, scissors|rock-paper-scissors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/battlefield-2/507635p1.html | title = Battlefield 2 Interview | accessdate = December 12, 2007 | last = Accardo | first = Sal | date = April 20, 2007 | publisher = GameSpy| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080105112126/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/battlefield-2/507635p1.html| archivedate=January 5, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, mobile anti-air was intended to effectively destroy helicopters, but are vulnerable against opposing tanks. Included within this relationship are stationary defenses such as light machine guns and anti-aircraft/TOW emplacements. The availability and number of certain vehicles are dependent on the map and its size as well as control points captured. Also, more vehicles become available to be used on the maps of expansion/booster packs. (see [[Battlefield 2#Maps|Maps]]). The [[USS Essex (LHD-2)|USS Essex]] is the only naval ship featured in BF2, featuring two spawn points and aircraft spawn points, and is not drivable or destroyable, except for its [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] turrets.

=== Squads ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bf2 squad screen.jpg|thumb|right|175px|In-game screen of the squad menu]] --&gt;
Players are able to form squads of up to six soldiers in order to more effectively work as a team. Up to nine squads are permitted per team; each squad has a number (automatically assigned) and name (usually a [[NATO Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] letter) for identification. Members of a squad have the ability to communicate with one another via ''Battlefield 2''{{'}}s integrated [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) system.

Squad leaders may assign their squad a variety of objectives (for example, moving to or attacking a specific location). Orders may also be given by the team's commander. Squad leaders are able to issue requests for commander assets (such as artillery fire) and have a direct VoIP channel to the commander.

Members of a squad may [[spawning (computer gaming)|spawn]] near their squad leader, provided that the leader is not dead (or incapacitated), and that the team holds at least one control point. This feature allows squads to more quickly regroup after taking casualties.

{{Clear}}

=== Commander ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:commandermode.png|thumb|left|175px|Screenshot of the commander screen]] --&gt;
The [[commander]] position is an exclusive role played by one member of each team. Any member of a team may apply for the position, but priority is given to players of higher [[United States Marine Corps rank insignia|rank]].

The commander alone has access to the "commander screen", an interface similar to that of a [[real-time strategy]] game. This allows the commander an overview of the battlefield as a whole, or zoom in and view parts of the map in real-time. The commander also has control of the various commander assets, which include artillery strikes, vehicle and supply drops, and UAV's. They can deploy them to assist their team. The commander can communicate with squads either by sending orders, or via [[VoIP]] voice communication. These tools allow the commander to strategically coordinate their forces on the battlefield.

A commander may resign at any point, freeing the position for other members of their team; they may also be forcibly removed by a successful [[mutiny]] vote conducted by their team (provided the [[game server|server]] allows mutiny votes). Although the commander does not gain points by normal methods (kills, flag captures, etc.), their score is doubled at the end of the round if their team wins.

The commander position would be seen again in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'' and ''[[Battlefield 4]]''.

=== Awards and unlockable weapons ===
Players can earn awards (ribbons, badges, and medals) for certain in-game accomplishments. [[Badge]]s and [[Ribbon bar|ribbons]] are the easiest to obtain, while [[medal]]s are usually much harder, requiring more extensive play. As players ascend through the ranks they will gain the ability to unlock certain weapons. Each time a player is promoted to an eligible rank, they are given the opportunity to unlock one of seven unlockable weapons, one for each class, which they may subsequently use in place of the standard weapon for the given class.

=== Battlefield recorder ===
A built-in game recorder records battles for subsequent replay. These files can be downloaded from a server which supports BattleRecorder directly after their respective game. Recorded battle files are around 1 to 8 megabytes in size and are played within the ''Battlefield 2'' engine. Camera angles can be changed (free roaming &amp; selected player), as well as the speed, though there is no rewind capability. Files can be exported to [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Community Update (6/10/05) on BattleRecorder | url = http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/editorial.jsp?src=communityupdate_061005 | publisher = EA Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battlefield Recorder has facilitated the creation of various [[machinima]]. Usage of the [[PunkBuster]] service is mandatory for all official ranked ''Battlefield 2'' servers, but optional for unranked servers.&lt;ref name="EA Community Update 06-03-05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evenbalance.com/publications/bf2-pl/index.htm|title=EA Community Update "To Play (Ranked) or Not to Play (Ranked)"|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=September 27, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028054129/http://www.evenbalance.com/publications/bf2-pl/index.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA Official Ranked Server Settings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evenbalance.com/publications/bf2-pl/index.htm|title=EA Official Ranked Server Settings|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=September 27, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028054129/http://www.evenbalance.com/publications/bf2-pl/index.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maps ===
[[File:MapScaleFeature.jpg|thumb|400px|right|3 variations for the Gulf of Oman map]]
''Battlefield 2'' offers 15 maps for the players to play but shipped with 12.&lt;ref name="Gamespot review page 2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Ocampo|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2/review.html?page=2|title=Battlefield 2 Review|publisher=GameSpot|date=June 21, 2005|accessdate=March 11, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070218125232/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2/review.html?&amp;page=2| archivedate=February 18, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maps are diverse, ranging from swamps such as Songhua Stalemate, to urban areas such as Strike at Karkand, to an unfinished dam known as Kubra Dam. The USMC is present in all maps and faces against either the MEC or the PLA depending on the map. The PLA is present in Far East theaters such as Dragon Valley and [[Daqing Field|Daqing Oilfields]]. MEC is present in Middle East theaters such as [[Gulf of Oman]] and Zatar Wetlands. The BF2 series including the expansion and booster packs puts the map count at 29 maps.

''Battlefield 2'' maps have 3 variations, each suited for a certain number of players. Each map has 16, 32, and 64 player-suggested variations in which the area of battlefield or playing field is relatively small, medium, and large, respectively. The only exceptions to this are [[Wake Island]] 2007, which is locked at 64-player size and the ''Euro Force'' maps, Operation Smokescreen, [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], and Taraba Quarry, which have no 64-player size. 32 and 64 player maps are unavailable to offline players from retailers, but an option is given to download 64 Single player AI bot mods. Other contrasts between these variations other than the size are the number and position of control points and availability of vehicles. As a result, the gameplay of the map is different depending on the variation.&lt;ref name="Gamespot review page 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Battlefield 2 Map Information"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Kosak|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/battlefield-2/625274p6.html|title=The Maps of Battlefield: Part 2|publisher=GameSpy|date=June 14, 2005|accessdate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The game is set in 2007 during a [[world war]] between various power blocs: the [[United States]] aided by the [[European Union]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Chechens|Chechen]] resistance are at war against [[Russia]], [[China]] and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC) aided by various insurgent groups.

There is no given reason as to how or why the war broke out, though one likely theory is for control of [[oil reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;The description of Gulf of Oman states that, should the MEC lose control of the territory, vital oilfields would fall into US hands.&lt;/ref&gt; In-game, the European Union and the United States fight China and the MEC. It is mentioned in-game that the US and EU are allies and the EU has negotiated a truce with Russia, but it is unknown if China and the MEC are allies. The game also takes place in different [[Front (military)|fronts]], as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces.

''Battlefield 2'''s first expansion pack, ''Special Forces'', first began its development sometime during or shortly before the release of the original ''Battlefield 2'' by DICE: ''Battlefield'' producer, Mike Doran, commented in August 2005 that "The truth is that work on ''Battlefield 2: Special Forces'' began several months ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameSpot interview on Battlefield 2: Special Forces|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2specialforces/news.html?sid=6130167|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially announced on July 14, 2005 and released on November 21 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameSpot article: Special Forces heading to Battlefield 2|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2specialforces/news.html?sid=6129037|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameSpot article: BF2's Special Forces ready for action|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2specialforces/news.html?sid=6140319|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the development was infantry-based combat as opposed to vehicle-centric combat from the original. As such, most of the additional content in the expansion pack can only be used by or for infantry.

The expansion pack provides eight maps, 6 playable factions, and ten more vehicles such as the [[AH-64D Apache]] and [[Mi-24|Mi-35 Hind]], though all jets have been removed. In addition to these new contents, players have access to new equipment such as [[night vision goggles]], [[tear gas]], [[gas mask]]s, zip lines and grappling hooks which can alter gameplay. There are eight more small arms weapons available such as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36|G36K/E]] and [[FN SCAR|FN SCAR L/H]] and several weapons from the original are replaced. The expansion offers more awards in the form of badges, ribbons, and medals that players can earn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual interface showcasing Battlefield 2: Special Forces content (Flash Player required)|url=http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/specialforces/us/armies.jsp|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=June 28, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071024183712/http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/specialforces/us/armies.jsp| archivedate=October 24, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many of the weapons from the expansion may be used in the original ''Battlefield 2''.

Booster packs are additional content released for ''Battlefield 2'' that are currently available for free download. The booster packs were later available in retail form as the ''Booster Pack Collection'', containing a DVD which features these packs, as well as being included in "The Complete Collection", containing a DVD with both the original game and all of the expansions/booster packs.

Booster packs add a significant amount of content to the game, but are different from expansion packs because they are intended to add to the original gameplay and not stand on their own (such as ''Special Forces'' does). The booster packs include new maps, vehicles, and a new [[European Union]] faction.

The two booster packs were included free of charge in the 1.50 update released on September 1, 2009.

==== ''Euro Force'' ====
''Battlefield 2: Euro Force'' is the first booster pack, and was released on March 14, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2-euro-force/pc-794310|title=Battlefield 2: Euro Force|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booster pack allows players to play as a new [[European Union]] army, armed with new weapons and vehicles from the various countries of the EU. It is available for purchase online at the [[Electronic Arts]] download service, or as part of the retail ''Booster Pack Collection''. It was scheduled for release in February, but was delayed due to a substantial number of new bugs caused by the release of [[Patch (computing)|patch]] 1.2. It features a whole new army, 4 new vehicles, 3 new maps, and 7 new weapons such as the [[L85A2]] with [[AG36]] GL, the [[FAMAS]], the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK53|HK53]], the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK21|HK21]], and the [[Benelli M4]]. Some of the vehicles for the EU military include the [[Challenger 2]], [[Eurocopter Tiger]], [[Leopard 2A6]] and the [[Eurofighter]]. The maps include 'The Great Wall of China', against the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China, where the EU army is trying to gain a strong foothold in northern China, to reinforce their American allies in the south later on. 'Operation Smoke Screen' features the EU army fighting the MEC in the Middle East for precious oil fields, and the third map, 'Taraba Quarry', where the EU army is trying to reinforce American positions in the south. Mindful of the European plans, the MEC tries to stall the EU, where the Europeans must confront their enemies because that route is the only possible path along that side of the Caspian Sea.

It was made free with patch 1.5.&lt;ref name="help.ea.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.ea.com/en/article/obtaining-the-latest-updates-for-battlefield-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923070737/http://help.ea.com/en/article/obtaining-the-latest-updates-for-battlefield-2/ |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Armored Fury'' ====
''Battlefield 2: Armored Fury'' is the second booster pack released for ''Battlefield 2'' and was released on June 6, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} It added three new maps, as well as two new vehicle classes: attack jets for close air support and [[reconnaissance]] helicopters that operate as a mobile UAV. The booster pack has the USMC defending U.S. soil from invasions from the PLA and MEC. Operation Midnight Sun features the Chinese landing at the Alaskan port [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] where they are trying to secure much needed fuel from the pipeline. Operation Road Rage is a MEC vs. USMC map, where the MEC are using US Highways to transport units to industrial areas. Operation Harvest sees the United States trying to stall the MEC en route to the capital from the northwest, being blocked in a Pennsylvania Dutch farm, while waiting for reinforcements. New vehicles include Attack or Close Air Support aircraft such as the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]], [[Su-39]] and the [[Nanchang Q-5]] as well as new light utility helicopters such as [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|MH-6 Little Bird]], [[EC-635]] and the [[Changhe Z-11|Z-11]]. As well as the addition of new helicopters and planes, DICE also added the [[Muscle Car]] and [[Semi-trailer truck|Semi Truck]]. However, the proposed [[AV-8 Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier]] was cut from the add-on due to balancing issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official EA Armored Fury website|url=http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/armoredfury.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Euro Force, it was made free with patch 1.5.&lt;ref name="help.ea.com"/&gt;

The game received widespread critical acclaim, garnering an aggregate score of 91/100 from 55 reviews on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; It received five stars out of five from publications [[Yahoo! Games]], [[GameSpy]], [[X-Play]] and [[Computer Gaming World]]. [[PC Gamer]] awarded it 94%, stating, "Its finely tuned maps and balanced gameplay prove that you ''can'' improve on perfection," and honored it as Game of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[[PC Gamer]]|page=56|date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] rated the game 9.3 out of 10 claiming that "when you experience ''Battlefield 2'' like it's meant to be played, with everyone working together and using real-time voice chat, the game quickly becomes unlike anything else that you've played before."&lt;ref name="gspot"/&gt;

Some of the lower scores were reactions to the large amount of [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es in the initial release, including crash to desktop bugs and network problems. For example, Gaming Nexus (who awarded the game an 8.7 out of 10) reported, "I’ve had many cool experiences playing it and a lot of 'did I just see that' moments but all of that is crapped on by the bugs and quirks in the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Default.aspx?Section=Article&amp;ArticleType=1&amp;OldUID=755|title=Gaming Nexus' Battlefield 2 Review|accessdate=May 20, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318203001/http://www.gamingnexus.com/Default.aspx?Section=Article&amp;ArticleType=1&amp;OldUID=755|archivedate=March 18, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]] approved of the game, awarding a 90%, but added a disclaimer that the gaming experience is best "if your machine is up to it".&lt;ref name="Battlefield 2 Review performance comment"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gamesradar.com/us/pc/game/reviews/article.jsp?articleId=20060223164229519035&amp;sectionId=1000 | title=Battlefield 2 Review | publisher = GamesRadar| accessdate=May 20, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060428215643/http://gamesradar.com/us/pc/game/reviews/article.jsp?articleId=20060223164229519035&amp;sectionId=1000| archivedate=April 28, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Battlefield 2 system requirements"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/features.jsp | title=Battlefield 2 Product Description | publisher=EA Games | accessdate=February 4, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130045957/http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/features.jsp | archivedate=January 30, 2008 | deadurl=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpot's review agreed with the high system requirements noting that "the load times are one of the biggest gripes that we have, as you will spend quite a bit of time waiting for a game to start up, even on high-end machines...also a bit demanding in the hardware department."&lt;ref name="gspot"/&gt;

''Battlefield 2'' won ''[[PC Gamer US]]''{{'}}s "Best Multiplayer Game 2005" and "Game of the Year 2005" awards. The magazine's Dan Stapleton wrote, "Few other games in the history of the medium have so effectively captured the visceral feeling of modern military combat in an urban environment".&lt;ref name=pcgamerusawards2005&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2006 | title=The Twelfth Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards | volume=13 | number=3 | pages=33–36, 38, 40–42, 44 | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | author=Stapleton, Dan }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The editors of ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' presented ''Battlefield 2'' with their 2005 awards for "Best Action Game" and "Best Multiplayer", and named it the year's second-best computer game overall.

'''Brace''' (formerly known as ''Brace For War'') was  an [[Australian]] mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion. Brace was founded in 2005 by Kya Pate. In an interview with MMA Kanvas Kya Pate detailed what it is like to be the promoter of Australian MMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmakanvas.ninemsn.com.au/articles/news/2099/an-insiders-look-whats-it-really-like-to-be-a-fight-promoter.html|title=An insider's look: what's it really like to be a fight promoter?|author=Adam Ireland|date=9 September 2014|website=Mmakanvas.ninemsn.com.au|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 Brace has staged 50 events in 9 cities over 4 [[Australian States]]. After following the standard MMA format, in 2014 Brace changed to an elimination tournament format based on the style of [[Australian Football League|AFL]], [[NRL]], [[A-League]] soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnewsaustralia.com/index.php/14-news/488-brace-announce-unique-multi-division-title-tournaments-for-2014?highlight=WyJicmFjZSJd|title=Brace announce unique multi division title tournaments commencing 2014|author=Mike|work=Australian MMA News, Reviews, Interviews &amp; Results|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8 Fighters per division compete in knock out elimination rounds all aiming to reach an end of season Grand Final event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://combatpress.com/2014/11/out-of-obscurity-center-real-fights-14-pfc-7-and-brace-31/|title=Out of Obscurity: Center Real Fights 14, PFC 7 and BRACE 31|author=Bryan Henderson|work=Combat Press|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[short title|Broadcasting Act]]''' ([[long title]]: "'''An Act respecting broadcasting and to amend certain Acts in relation thereto and in relation to radiocommunication'''") is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] regarding [[broadcasting]] of [[telecommunications|radiocommunications]].

== History ==
The Act was given [[royal assent]] on February 1, 1991. A prior version of the Broadcasting Act received royal assent on June 23, 1936; it was subsequently updated in 1958 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708082557/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/public_mikan/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&amp;lang=eng&amp;rec_nbr=274&amp;rec_nbr_list=274,2913382,102544,305908,103889 Archives Canada Online Database]. Accessed 17 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1958 Act created the [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] (BBG) to replace the CBC as the regulatory for broadcasting in Canada and in 1968 the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) was created to replace the BBG.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/canada-radio-television-and-telecommunications-commission&lt;/ref&gt;

The current federal Broadcasting Act is based on the 1968 Act with amendments in 1991. The stated goal of the Act is to maintain Canada's cultural fabric — thereby strengthening its economic, political and social structures.

== Structure ==
The Broadcasting Act covers three main sections: a broadcasting policy for Canada; the regulatory powers of the CRTC; and the operating procedures and policies for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

The Act imposes a Canadian owned and controlled system of broadcasting, and includes provisions regarding Canadian content in programming and production. It encourages the development of Canadian expression, and the use of Canadian talent and creative resources. There is also a specific emphasis on reflecting Canada's cultural diversity: section 3 states that programming and employment opportunities should serve the needs and interests of all Canadians, and reflect their various circumstances.

The Broadcasting Act emphasizes that each broadcaster is responsible for its own programs, and that a high standard of programming is expected. There is no specific reference, however, to address violent programming or hate propaganda.

The CRTC addresses issues of media violence, and hate messaging through its regulations for radio, television, specialty services and pay-television.

If a broadcaster fails to follow the Broadcasting Act policies or regulations, the CRTC may invoke a number of penalties — such as imposing fines, or limiting or denying a station's application for licence renewal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4241">Founded in 1998, '''Budhan Theatre''' is an Indian theatre group composed of members of the Chhara tribe, one of India's groups of [[Denotified Tribes|denotified]] or [[Criminal Tribes|"criminal"]] tribal people in [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charras|first=Building a New Identity|title=Budhan Theatre|url=http://charras.blogspot.com/2008/04/about-budhan-theater.html|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Budhan Theatre was founded by Prof. Ganesh Devy [[G. N. Devy]], a renown linguist and professor of English Literature and Smt. Mahasweta Devi [[Mahasweta Devi]] a noted Bangla writer and Magsaysay awardee. The style of theatre practiced by the theatre troupe is theatre for community development and theatre for social change. They perform street play, Intimate theatre and other experimental theatres to raise awareness about discrimination and violence faced by Chharas and other denotified tribal people in India. Their influences include the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]], [[Bertoldt Brecht]], and the Indian aesthetic of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Henry|title=Constructing the Criminal Tribe: Acting Like a Thief|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kk8eXdQ08oC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=constructing+the+criminal+tribe+budhan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lAY6Tj8Rt2&amp;sig=CNpfnObkWeOfoG3ZObKW5jYDfhI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qaF5UcSOPIS28wTApYD4Dw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=constructing%20the%20criminal%20tribe%20budhan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budhan Theatre takes its name from Budhan Sabar, a tribal man who was labeled a criminal, targeted, and murdered by the police in West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Association for India's Development|first=AID|title=Budhan: Actors Are Born Here|url=http://publications.aidindia.org/content/view/501/102/|publisher=AID Publications|accessdate=25 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130703165621/http://publications.aidindia.org/content/view/501/102/|archivedate=3 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the iconic plays performed by Budhan Theatre is called ''Budhan.'' During the play, actors reenact the death of Budhan Sabar and demand justice for his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=India Together|first=News in Promotion|title=Budhan|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/bhasha/bhanplay.htm|accessdate=27 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055943/http://indiatogether.org/bhasha/bhanplay.htm#|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had also conducted a one-year diploma course in journalism; a diploma in theatre arts, journalism, and media studies; and a certificate course in dramatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Budhan Theatre to offer two IGNOU-recognised courses|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1546654/report-budhan-theatre-to-offer-two-ignou-recognised-courses|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is led by the youths of Chharanagar. Some of the key people include - Dakxin Bajarange, Kalpana Gagdekar, Roxy Gagdekar, Akur Garange, Atish Indrekar, Alok Gagdekar. Many youths from the Chhara community - which was once stigmatized as the criminal tribe by the British - are living a successful life by joining Budhan Theatre. Few examples include Alok Gagdekar (the National School of Drama Graduate- 2006), Vivek Ghamande (2007- NSD), Kalpana Gagdekar, Dakxin Bajrange and few more.

The Budhan Theatre has been featured in [[Shashwati Talukdar]] and P. Kerim Friedman's documentary film ''Please Don't Beat Me, Sir.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talukdar|first=Shashwati|title=Please Don't Beat Me, Sir|url=http://fournineandahalf.com/pleasedontbeatmesir/|accessdate=25 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509091903/http://fournineandahalf.com/pleasedontbeatmesir/|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows a group of young actors and their families, telling their stories against the backdrop of the history of India's [[Denotified Tribes|denotified]] or [[Criminal Tribes|"criminal"]] tribes.

{{Nihongo|'''''Chaos Rings Omega'''''|ケイオスリングス オメガ|Keiosu Ringusu Omega}} is a [[role-playing video game]] for [[iOS]], Android, and Playstation Vita developed by [[Media.Vision]] and published by [[Square Enix]]. ''Chaos Rings Ω'' was available on the [[App Store (iOS)|AppStore]] on May 19, 2011. Effective May 31, 2016, Square Enix ended distribution of this title on the AppStore and Google Play, where it is no longer available for download now except for on Amazon App Store. It is the prequel to ''[[Chaos Rings (video game)|Chaos Rings]]''.

==Plot==
The story this time still takes place on the Ark Arena, but 10,000 years before the events of the first game. The game follows the protagonist Vieg who is partnered with his pregnant wife Vahti.  Along with them are Vahti's parents Olgar and Rachel, Ayuta and Kushina, as well as Cyllis and Yorath.  The Agent tells them the same set up that was in the original Chaos Rings and Vieg challenges him.  Olgar joins up and they try to take on the Agent and lose badly.  The Agent calls the Executioner and then Vahti and Rachel step in to help out.  The Agent relents, saying that he can't afford to lose so many of them so soon and calls off the Executioner.

Vahti goes into labor shortly after and Rachel helps.  Vieg and Olgar team up and find the first two rings.  At that point, the Agent tells them the first matches will be Ayuta/Kushina vs Cyllis/Yorath and Olgar/Rachel vs Vieg/Vahti.  Vieg and Olgar protest that Vahti is in labor and ask that the first match be held off until Vieg's child is born.  The Agent agrees, saying that their offspring is important.  Everyone chips in to help and Vahti soon gives birth to a baby boy, Ohm.  The Agent then tells everyone it's time for the matches.  Rachel stays to help Vahti recover, but everyone else leaves.  Olgar tells Vieg he has a plan, but it's a long shot.  Upon getting to the arena, Olgar tells Vieg that his plan is for them to fight to the death and see which is stronger.

Vieg reluctantly defeats Olgar, however when the Executioner shows up to finish the job, Olgar attacks.  Olgar's plan was to lure out the Executioner since it is weaker than the Agent and take it on separately.  Vieg joins up and they finish off the Executioner.

Meanwhile, Kushina has been killed by Cyllis and Yorath.  Ayuta is sobbing over her and Cyllis reveals that her target is Theia, Ayuta's original partner.  She and Yorath butcher Ayuta to death offscreen.

When Olgar and Vieg return together, the Ark is quiet.  They go to check on Vahti and Rachel and find Rachel's clothes in a gory mess in the room.  The Agent calls them and Olgar and Vieg stand off against him, thinking he killed Rachel.  The Agent denies having anything to do with it, but says that the situation has changed and it has no use for them anymore.  Olgar and Vieg fight and are losing against the Agent when Cyllis and Yorath show up.  Yorath kills the Agent in one hit and the Agent comments that it recognizes a genetic pattern in them and can't seem to contact the Master before it dies.

Cyllis and Yorath tell Vieg and Olgar that they killed Rachel and have Vahti and Ohm hostage.  They tell Olgar and Vieg that they will kill Rachel and Vahti if they can't kill 4 great beasts before 12 bells ring.  Olgar leaves Vieg alone to kill the first beast while he gives Rachel a proper burial. While Vieg is going solo, Yorath shows up and tells Vieg the whole story about the Ark arena and reveals that the monsters they are all facing are all called "Congloms" and they are all born from Cyllis.  He also reveals that he is a Conglom as well.

Olgar rejoins Vieg and they go after the next 3 beasts.  Vieg brings Olgar up to speed on what Yorath told him.  Yorath pops in and gives them Ohm back.  They have Piu Piu take care of Ohm while they continue.  Yorath later pops in and tells them that Cyllis has prepared a surprise for them with the last beast.  They find that the last beast cannot be damaged by solo attacks and they have to use Pair attacks to damage him.  After he is defeated, three more pop up.  Olgar tells Vieg that he'll hold them off while Vieg goes to get Vahti.

Vieg pursues Cyllis to the Conglom Plant where he's confronted with both her and Yorath.  Cyllis shows him Vahti and Ohm (who she's reclaimed after Yorath gave him up) suspended over lava.  Vieg fights Cyllis and Yorath and when Cyllis dies she retreats leaving Yorath to deal with Vieg.  Vieg loses the fight and when Yorath is closing in for the kill he narrowly evades a jump attack from behind by Olgar.  Olgar fights against Yorath and despite being outmatched Olgar refuses to die and eventually Yorath is hurt badly enough that he has to escape.  At that point, the final bell tolls and Yorath tells Vieg and Olgar that they are too late.  Both Vahti and Ohm drop down towards the lava.  Olgar grabs a floor panel and throws it under them, wedging it into a metal strut.  He then jumps after them and grabs them, but the floor panel gives way and they all fall into the lava.

Olgar lives, knee deep in the lava and carries Vahti and Ohm to safety.  As he's sinking into the lava, he tells Vieg that he's to take Olgar's old job and name as captain and that Olgar himself will go back to his old name Dante and then sinks the rest of the way into the lava.

We flash forward to Vieg, now Olgar, neglecting Vahti and Ohm to fight solo and make himself stronger.  He is angry that he wasn't able to do more to help.  Vahti calms him down and they agree to go together to finish the fight with Cyllis.  They go further into the Conglom Plant and eventually confront Yorath.  This time, they have gotten strong enough to defeat him and he yields to them.  They then get to Cyllis and fight and defeat her.  As a last-ditch measure, Cyllis spawns a Conglom that's a beastlike combination of Dante and Rachel.  Olgar and Vahti defeat it and Theia announces that the Original Door is now open and Cyllis promises that the conflict isn't over, but Dante/Rachel hold her back while Olgar and Vahti escape.

When Olgar and Vahti go out of the Original Door, they find that they are on the deck of the Ark, which is still going back in time.  Cyllis breaks through the deck and tells them that Theia opened the Original Door too early and that this spacetime outside the Ark will cease to exist soon.  Cyllis blocks their exit back into the Ark while Olgar and Vahti defeat her.  She still blocks their exit, though, until Yorath shows up and warps them out.  Cyllis and Yorath die together when the Ark drops back into normal spacetime.  Now, Olgar, Vahti, and Ohm are back on Earth 10,000 years in the past and are told that they will be the new Original Couple and need to rebuild a new human race capable of defeating the Qualia.  Theia tells them that their descendants will be the ones that bring about the final battle and warps off.

{{Persian arts}}
The '''Cinema of Iran''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''سینمای ایران''), also known as the '''Cinema of [[Name of Iran|Persia]]''', refers to the cinema and film industries in  [[Iran]] which produce a variety of commercial films annually. Iranian [[art film]]s have garnered international fame and now enjoy a global following.&lt;ref name="internews1"&gt;[http://www.internews.org/visavis/BTVPagesInews/Iranian_Cinema.html The Iranian Cinema] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802041712/http://www.internews.org/visavis/BTVPagesInews/Iranian_Cinema.html |date=2012-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[China]], Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/psa/events/1999-00/kiarostami/articles.utf8.html Abbas Kiarostami: Articles &amp; Interviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics now rank Iran as the world's most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to [[Italian neorealism]] and similar movements in past decades.&lt;ref name="internews1"/&gt; A range of international film festivals have honored Iranian cinema in the last twenty years. World-renowned Austrian filmmaker [[Michael Haneke]] and German filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]], along with many film critics from around the world, have praised Iranian cinema as one of the world's most important artistic cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://incolor.inebraska.com/theater/spring2000/the_iranian_cinema.html The Iranian Cinema: A Dream With No Awakening]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Visual arts in Persia===
{{See also|Persian theatre}}

The earliest examples of visual representations in [[History of Iran|Iranian history]] may be traced back to the [[bas-relief]]s in [[Persepolis]] (c. 500 B. C.). Bas relief is a method of sculpting which entails carving or etching away the surface of a flat piece of stone or metal. Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of [[Achaemenids]] and "the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language."&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh and John Fleming, ''The Visual Arts: A History''. New Jersey, Prentice Hall Inc, 1992. Page: 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian visual arts maybe said to have peaked about a thousand years later during the [[Sassanian]] reign. A [[bas-relief]] from this period in [[Taq Bostan]] (western Iran) depicts a complex hunting scene. Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see the progenitor of the cinema close-up: a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground,&lt;ref name="horschamp1"&gt;[http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/preiran.html Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; among these works of art.

After the conversion from [[Zoroastrianism]] to [[Islam]] &amp;mdash; a religion in which visual symbols were avoided &amp;mdash; Persian art continued its visual practices. Persian miniatures provide great examples of such continued attempts. The deliberate lack of perspective in Persian miniature enabled the artist to have different plots and sub-plots within the same image space. A very popular form of such art was ''Pardeh Khani''. Another type of art in the same category was ''Naqqali''.&lt;ref name="horschamp1"/&gt;

Popular dramatic performance arts in Iran, before the advent of cinema, include [[Marionette]], Saye-bazi (shadow plays), Rouhozi (comical acts), and [[Ta'zieh]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Ali Issari, Cinema in Iran: 1900-1979 pages 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Persian cinema===
Cinema was only five years old when it came to Persia at the beginning of the 20th century.  The first Persian filmmaker was [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi]], the official photographer of [[Muzaffar al-Din Shah]], the [[Qajar dynasty|King of Persia]] from 1896&amp;ndash;1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, [[Akkas Bashi]] obtained a camera and filmed the [[Shah]]'s visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, [[Khan Baba Motazedi]], another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged.&lt;ref name="massoudmehrabi1"&gt;[http://www.massoudmehrabi.com/articles.asp?id=1414606616 The history of Iranian cinema, Part I by Masoud Mehrabi]&lt;/ref&gt; He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] to the [[Pahlavi dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;M. A Issari, Cinema in Iran, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital.
In 1909, with [[Triumph of Tehran|fall]] of the [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar]] heir of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar]] and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan an Armenian -Iranian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://offscreen.com/view/iran2 Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, [[Ovanes Ohanian]] decided to establish the first film school in Iran.
In 1904, [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi]] opened the first movie theater in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="massoudmehrabi1"/&gt; The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.&lt;ref name="horschamp1"/&gt; In 1925, [[Ovanes Ohanian]], decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name  "Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema".&lt;ref&gt;Omid, Jamal. The History of Iranian Cinema 1900-1978. Tehran: Rozaneh Publication, 1995, 1174 pgs (Persian).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and 40s===
[[File:Roohangiz Sami-Nejad01.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[Roohangiz Saminejad]] in ''[[Lor Girl]]'' (1933)]]
In 1930 the first Iranian silent film was made by Professor Ovanes Ohanian called ''[[Abi and Rabi]]''. In 1933 he made his second film titled ''[[Haji Agha, the Cinema Actor|Haji Agha]]''. Later that year, [[Abdolhossein Sepanta]] made the first Iranian [[sound film]], entitled ''[[Lor Girl]]'', which was released in 1933 in two Tehran cinemas, Mayak and Sepah. The story of the film was based on a comparison between the state of security in Iran at the end of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and during [[Reza Shah]] period. Sepanta would go on to direct movies such as ''[[Ferdowsi]]'' (the life story of the most celebrated epic poet of Iran), ''Shirin and Farhad'' (a classic Iranian love story), and ''Black Eyes'' (the story of [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion of India). In 1937, he directed ''[[Leyli o Majnun (1936 film)|Laili and Majnoon]]'', an Eastern love story similar to the English story of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.

The present day Iranian film industry owes much of its progress to two industrious personalities, [[Esmail Koushan]] and [[Farrokh Ghaffari]]. By establishing the first [[National Iranian Film Society]] in 1949 at the [[National Museum of Iran|Iran Bastan Museum]] and organizing the first Film Week during which English films were exhibited, Ghaffari laid the foundation for alternative and non-commercial films in Iran.

Early Persian directors like [[Abdolhossein Sepanta]] and [[Esmail Koushan]] took advantage of the richness of [[Persian literature]] and ancient [[Persian mythology]]. In their work, they emphasized [[ethics]] and [[Compassion|humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2006/11/061121_la-lit-adaptation-cinema.shtml Iranian filmmakers and influence of Ancient Persian literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-revolutionary cinema, 1950s-70s===
[[File:Gaav movie.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Ezzatollah Entezami]] in [[The Cow (film)|The Cow]] (1969)]]
[[File:Qeysar screenshot.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Behrouz Vossoughi]] &amp; [[Jamshid Mashayekhi]] in [[Qeysar (film)|Qeysar]] (1969)]]
The 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian cinema, with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early ‘60s, increasing to 65 by the end of the decade. The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers.
From 1937 till 1947 because of the world economic conditions and then the involvement in World War Two, the motion picture industry in Iran did not produce a single film, but the flow of foreign film to Iran did not stop. In 1947, Esmail Koushan, With the help of some of his colleagues, he established Mitra Films (1997), the first real film company in Tehran, Iran. Through their persistence, local feature film production was born and survived.
The movie that really boost the economy of Iranian cinema and initiated a new genre was ''[[Ganj-e Qarun]]'' (Croesus Treasure), made in 1965 by Syamak Yasami. Four years later [[Masoud Kimiai]] made [[Qeysar (film)|''Kaiser'']]. With ''Kaiser'' (Qeysar), Kimiai depicted the ethics and morals of the romanticized poor working class of the Ganj-e-Qarun genre through his main protagonist, the titular Qeysar. But Kimiay's film generated another genre in Iranian popular cinema: the tragic action drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/preiran.html Shahin Parhami, Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the screening of the films ''[[Qeysar (film)|Kaiser]]'' and ''[[The Cow (film)|The Cow]]'', directed by Masoud Kimiai and [[Darius Mehrjui]] respectively in 1969, alternative film established their status in the film industry.By 1970 Iranian cinema entered into its mature stage. The College of Dramatic Arts, instituted in 1963, produced its first graduates at the decade’s beginning. Many progressive film co-ops and associations came into existence and there were a few regular film festivals taking place in the country. Attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the ''Golrizan Festival'', bore fruits in the form of the ''Sepas Film Festival'' in 1969. The endeavors of  Ali Mortazavi also resulted in the formation of the ''Tehran International Film Festival'' in 1973.
From 1950 to the mid-1960 the Iranian film industry grew rapidly. Many studios were established as well as others that entered the Cycle of the film industry independently. There were 324 films produced during this period 1950 for 1965. By 1965 there were 72 movie theatres in Tehran and 192 in other Provinces. [[Ebrahim Golestan]] in 1965 directed by films of interest ''Brick and Mirror'' 1965. [[Bahram Beyzai]] is the director of one of the ground-breaking films of the Iranian New wave, 1972 ''Ragbar'' (''[[Downpour (film)|Downpour]]''). [[Sohrab Shahid-Saless]] is auteur director who embodied his original style in his 1975 film ''[[Still Life]]''. [[Abbas Kiarostami]] is now a well-known director of the 1990s who directed one of the last films that screened before the revolution in 1978, ''Gozaresh'' (''[[The Report]]'').

===Post-revolutionary cinema===
In the early 1970s, a New Iranian Cinema emerged (''cinema motefävet''). However, following the Revolution in 1979, a few filmmakers and actors went into exile as Khomeini altered the focus in features. Between 1979 and 1985, about 100 features were released.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010 608"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Kristin|last2=Bordwell|first2=David|title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|edition=3rd|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Khomeini's censorship remained, the small number of features produced focused on sexual display and European influence.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010 608"/&gt;

In 1982, the annual [[Fajr International Film Festival|Fajr Film Festival]] financed films. The [http://www.iranchamber.com/cinema/articles/farabi_cinema_foundation.php Farabi Cinema Foundation] then stepped in to try and reassemble the disorganized cinema. The following year, the government began to provide financial aid. This change in regime encouraged a whole new generation of filmmakers, which included female directors as well. With this, the focus shifted to children overcoming obstacles: true stories, lyrical, mystical drama, real-life problems, documentary footage, etc.

Post-revolutionary Iranian cinema has been celebrated in many international forums and festivals for its distinct style, themes, authors, idea of nationhood, and cultural references. Starting With [[Viva...]] by [[Khosrow Sinai]] and followed by many excellent Iranian directors who emerged in the last few decades, such as [[Abbas Kiarostami]] and [[Jafar Panahi]]. Kiarostami, who some critics regard as one of the few great directors in the history of cinema,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/people/int_Kiarostam_Abbas_000801.html  Kiarostami Will Carry Us; The Iranian Master Gives Hope]&lt;/ref&gt; planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' in 1997.

The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[Venice Film Festival]], and the [[Berlin Film Festival]] attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces [http://www.festival-cannes.fr/aide/search_film.php?langue=6002&amp;titre_film=&amp;realisateur=&amp;acteur=&amp;anneefilm=&amp;paysfilm=IRN .]. In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2006/02/060209_pm-berlin-film-festival.shtml Iran's strong presence in 2006 Berlin Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4726682.stm  Iran films return to Berlin festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important step was taken in 1998 when the Iranian government began to fund ethnic cinema. Since then [[Iranian Kurdistan]] has seen the rise of numerous filmmakers. In particular, the film industry got momentum in [[Iranian Kurdistan]] and the region has seen the emergence of filmmakers such as [[Bahman Ghobadi]], actually the entire Ghobadi family, Ali-Reza Rezai, Khosret Ressoul and many other younger filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-310/_nr-172/i.html "Kurdish Cinema Really Started out with Yilmaz Güney"]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also movie-documentary production, often critical of the society in the name of the Islamic revolution ideal, like the films directed by [[Mohammedreza Eslamloo]].

By the year 2001 the number of features produced in Iran rose to 87 (from 28, which is the number of films that were produced in 1980, after the fall of the Shah). The most popular genres were melodramas and historical pageants which seldom went to festivals. In 1997, the newly elected president, Mohammed Khatemi, would eventually come to play a role in helping filmmakers achieve a certain degree of artistic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2003|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-038429-0|pages=670–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Iranian cinema==
Today, the Iranian box office is dominated by commercial Iranian films. Western films are occasionally shown in movie theaters.  and contemporary Hollywood productions are shown on state television. Iranian art films are often not screened officially, and are viewable via unlicensed DVDs which are  available. , some of these acclaimed films were eened in Iran and had box office success. Examples include Rassul Sadr Ameli's "I’m Taraneh, 15", Rakhshan Bani-Etemad's "Under the skin of the City", Bahman Ghobadi's "Marooned in Iraq" and Manijeh Hekmat's "Women's Prison".&lt;ref name="autoref1"&gt;[http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-544/_nr-10/_p-1/i.html?PHPSESSID=5 Qantara.de - - Iranian Cinema - Beyond Festival Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial cinema in Iran===

The internationally award-winning cinema of Iran is quite different from the domestically oriented films. The latter caters to an entirely different audience, which is largely under the age of 25. This commercial Iranian cinema genre is largely unknown in the West, as the films are targeted at local audiences. There are Three categories of this type of film:
[[File:Mohammad Ali Fardin.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Mohammad Ali Fardin]]]]
*Films before the revolution.
''[[Lor Girl]]'', ''[[A Party in Hell]]'', ''[[Qeysar (film)|Qeysar]]'', ''[[Dar Emtedade Shab]]'', ''[[Amir Arsalan]]'', and ''[[Ganj-e Qarun]]''.
*Films about the victory of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the ensuing Iran–Iraq war and Action filled with strong religious and national motifs.
''[[Eagles (1984 film)|Eagles]]'', ''Barzakhiha'', ''The Viper'', ''[[Dadshah]]'', ''[[Boycott (1985 film)|Boycott]]'', ''[[Duel (2004 film)|Duel]]'', ''[[Taraj]]'', ''[[Ekhrajiha]]'', ''[[The Glass Agency]]'', ''Kani Manga'', ''Ofogh'', ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]'', ''Leily Ba Man Ast'', ''[[M for Mother|M as in Mother]]'' and ''[[The Night Bus]]''.
*Formulaic films starring popular actors. With 130 Iranian films looking for a screening each year, cinema managers tend to prefer crowd-pleasing comedies, romantic melodramas, and family comedies over the other genres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060815/115565515500.html Yahoo!

For many years, the most visible face of [[Iran]]ian commercial cinema was [[Mohammad Ali Fardin]], who starred in a number of popular successful films. In the more conservative social climate of Iran after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, however, he came to be considered an embarrassment to Iranian national identity and his films &amp;mdash; which depicted romance, alcohol, vulgarity, objectification of women, scantily-dressed  men and women, nightclubs, and a vulgar lifestyle now condemned by the Islamic government &amp;mdash; were [[ban (law)|banned]].  Although this would effectively prevent Fardin from making films for the remainder of his life, the ban did little to diminish his broad popularity with Iranian moviegoers: His funeral in [[Tehran]] was attended by 20,000 mourners.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. (2000).  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/707442.stm "Iranian 'King of Hearts' dies"].  ''BBC News''.  Retrieved November 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Fardin, one could argue, Iran simply did not have a commercial cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranian.com/Arts/2000/April/Fardin/ Farewell to Fardin: Death of legendary actor marks end of an era]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war years, crime thrillers such as ''Senator'', ''The Eagles'', ''Boycott'', ''The Tenants'', and ''Kani Manga'' occupied the first position on the sales charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offscreen.com/biblio/essays/women_of_iran/&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, the Iranian government disdains American cinema: in 2007 President Ahmadinejad's media adviser told the Fars news agency, "We believe that the American cinema system is devoid of all culture and art and is only used as a device."&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2116243,00.html "Ahmadinejad turns down chance to star in Oliver Stone film"], ''The Guardian'', July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, numerous Western commercial films such as ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]'', ''[[Passion of the Christ]]'', ''[[House of Sand and Fog (film)|House of Sand and Fog]]'', ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'', ''[[Alpha and Omega (film)|Alpha and Omega]]'', ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', ''[[The Mechanic (2011 film)|The Mechanic]]'', and ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' have been screened in Iranian cinemas and Iranian film festivals since the revolution. Despite great pride in the country's more than 100-year film history, Western cinema is enormously popular among Iran's young people, and practically every recent Hollywood film is available on CD, DVD, or video.&lt;ref name="autoref1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/07/jan/1240.html Sixteen foreign films to compete at Fajr Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2732/html/art.htm Iran Daily - Arts &amp; Culture - 12/13/06&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoref2"&gt;[http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_11928.shtml No more ‘feminist’ or pro-US films in Iran!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; State television has also broadcast more Western movies—partly because millions of Iranians have been switching to the use of banned satellite television equipment.&lt;ref name="autoref2"/&gt;

===Iranian New Wave films===
{{Main article|Iranian New Wave}}

[[File:Nasser Taghvai.jpg|120px|thumbnail|right|[[Nasser Taghvaee]]]]
[[File:Bahram Bayzai.jpg|120px|thumbnail|right|[[Bahram Bayzai]], voted the best Persian filmmaker of all time in 2002]]
Iranian New Wave refers to a new movement in [[Iranian cinema]]. According to film critic Eric Henderson, the acclaimed documentary [[The House Is Black]] (خانه سیاه است) directed by [[Forough Farrokhzad]] (famous Iranian poet and director) paved the way for the Iranian New Wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-house-is-black|author=Eric Henderson|title=The House is Black|work=[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]|date=February 22, 2005|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement started in 1964 with [[Hajir Darioush]]'s second film ''Serpent's Skin'', which was based on [[D.H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' featuring Fakhri Khorvash and [[Jamshid Mashayekhi]]. Darioush's two important early social documentaries ''But Problems Arose'' in 1965, dealing with the cultural alienation of the Iranian youth, and ''Face 75'', a critical look at the westernization of the rural culture, which was a prizewinner at the 1965 [[Berlin Film Festival]], were also contributing significantly to the establishment of the New Wave.

In 1969, after the release of ''[[Gaav|The Cow]]'' directed by [[Darius Mehrjui]] followed by [[Masoud Kimiai]]'s ''[[Qeysar (film)|Qeysar]]'', and [[Nasser Taqvai]]'s ''Calm in Front of Others'', the New Wave became well established as a prominent cultural, dynamic and intellectual trend. The Iranian viewer became discriminating, encouraging the new trend to prosper and develop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/pe2.htm Al-Ahram Weekly | People | Limelight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1960s, there were 'New Wave' movements in the cinema of numerous countries. The pioneers of the Iranian New Wave were directors like [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Sohrab Shahid Saless]], [[Bahram Beizai]], and [[Parviz Kimiavi]]. They made innovative art films with highly political and philosophical tones and poetic language. Subsequent films of this type have become known as the New Iranian cinema to distinguish them from their earlier roots. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Jafar Panahi]], [[Majid Majidi]], [[Bahram Beizai]], [[Darius Mehrjui]], [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]], [[Khosrow Sinai]], [[Sohrab Shahid-Saless]], [[Parviz Kimiavi]], [[Samira Makhmalbaf]], [[Amir Naderi]], and [[Abolfazl Jalili]].

The factors leading to the rise of the New Wave in Iran were, in part, due to the intellectual and political movements of the time. A romantic climate was developing after the 19 August 1953 coup in the sphere of arts. Alongside this, a socially committed literature took shape in the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1960s, which may consider as the golden era of contemporary [[Persian literature]].&lt;ref name="parstimes1"&gt;[http://www.parstimes.com/film/new_wave.html The New Wave in Iranian Cinema - From Past to Present]&lt;/ref&gt;

Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of legendary [[Abbas Kiarostami]], can be classified as [[postmodern]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/32abbas.htm Abbas Kiarostami ? The Truth Behind Reality]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian New Wave films shared some characteristics with the European art films of the period, in particular [[Italian Neorealism]]. However, in her article 'Real Fictions', Rose Issa argues that Iranian films have a distinctively Iranian cinematic language
:"that champions the poetry in everyday life and the ordinary person by blurring the boundaries between [[fiction]] and reality, feature film with documentary." She also argues that this unique approach has inspired European cinema directors to emulate this style, citing [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s award winning ''[[In This World]]'' (2002) as an homage to contemporary Iranian cinema. Issa claims that "This new, humanistic aesthetic language, determined by the film-makers’ individual and national identity, rather than the forces of globalism, has a strong creative dialogue not only on home ground but with audiences around the world."&lt;ref name="autoref3"&gt;[http://archiv.hkw.de/en/dossiers/iran_dossierroseissa/kapitel2.html Real Fictions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future'' (2001) [[Hamid Dabashi#Close Up: Iranian Cinema|Hamid Dabashi]] describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [''Iranian''] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, "the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur'anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity."&lt;!---This is very difficult to understand and needs contexctualizing--&gt;

While [[Bahram Beyzai|Beyzai]] and [[Nasser Taghvai|Taghvai]] represent the first generation and [[Varuzh Karim-Masihi|Karim-Masihi]] and [[Abbas Kiarostami|Kiarostami]] represent the second generation of New wave filmmakers, the third generation is represented by [[Rafi Pitts]], [[Bahman Ghobadi]], [[Maziar Miri]], [[Asghar Farhadi]], [[Mani Haghighi]], and [[Babak Payami]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117959150.html?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1 Rising talent on Iranian Scene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/ots/onthescene_031105worl.html To Kiarostami or Not To Kiarostami]&lt;/ref&gt; along with newly emerged filmmakers such as [[Saman Salur]] and [[Abdolreza Kahani]].

===Iranian popular art films===
Parallel to the Iranian New Wave, with its [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]] and [[minimalist]] art cinema, there exists a so-called "popular art cinema" in Iran. Filmmakers who belong to this circle make films with a broader range of audience than the narrow spectrum of highly educated people who admire the New Wave, but believe that their movies are also artistically sound. Filmmakers such as [[Nasser Taghvaee]] and [[Ali Hatami]] are the best examples of this cinematic movement (some of these filmmakers also make new wave films e.g. ''[[Mum's Guest (film)|Mum's Guest]]'' by [[Darius Mehrjui]]).&lt;ref name="parstimes1"/&gt; The Demon and the Bald Hassan, Adam and Eve, The Fisherman's Story, City of Oranges, and Talisman are some of Hatami's works.

===Iranian women's cinema===
Following the rise of the Iranian New Wave, there are now record numbers of film school graduates in Iran and each year more than 20 new directors make their debut films, many of them women. In the last two decades, there have been a higher percentage of women directors in Iran than in most countries in the West.&lt;ref name="autoref3"/&gt;
Samira Makhmalbaf directed her first film, ''[[The Apple (Iranian film)|The Apple]]'', when she was only 17 years old and won the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] Jury Prize in 2000 for her following film ''The Blackboard''.

The success and hard work of the pioneering [[Rakhshan Bani-Etemad]] is an example that many women directors in Iran were following much before [[Samira Makhmalbaf]] made the headlines And the current [[Tahmineh Milani]], [[Niki Karimi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1311069.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iranian women tell their own story | date=May 4, 2001 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally recognized figures in [[Women's cinema|Iranian women's cinema]] are:

===Iranian war films===
[[File:Ebrahim Hatamikia in Ghoghnos Film Festival.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Ebrahim Hatamikia]]]]
War cinema in Iran was born simultaneously with the beginning of [[Iran–Iraq War]]. However, it took many years until it found its way and identity by defining characteristics of ''Iranian war cinema''.
Shows the most poematic view on the Iran Iraq war and still after years, is one of the leading films about this historical event from a humanistic aspect, although unlike other Iranian war cinema which are fully supported by the [[Iranian government]] this film was made with numerous difficulties.
In the past decades, the Iranian film industry has produced many war films. In the Iranian war film genre, war has often been portrayed as glorious and "holy", bringing out the good in the protagonist and pandering to nationalist sentiments with [[Propaganda film|propagandistic messaging]]. ''Tears of Cold'' and ''Duel'' were two films that have gone beyond the traditional view of war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehranavenue.com/article.php?id=330 Tehran Avenue | Film | War Cinema and Two New Iranian Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian animations===

==Influence of Iranians on Other's New Wave==
Amongst the pioneers of [[French New Wave]] were [[François Truffaut]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Eric Rohmer]] or [[Barbet Schroeder]] (born in [[Tehran]], Iran in 1941 where his German geologist Father was on assignment).

During the first half of the 20th century, France was the major destination for Iranian students who wished to study abroad. Iranian Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] [[Fereydoun Hoveyda]] was one of them. Fereydoun Hoveyda played a major role in French cultural scene and especially in the field of Cinema, for he was the protégé of [[François Truffaut]] whom he befriended and with whom he helped create the well-known film magazine ''[[Les Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' that spearheaded the French Nouvelle Vague or [[French New Wave|New Wave]] Cinema. He also worked closely with Italian film director [[Roberto Rossellini]] on several film scripts during that period. Fereydoun Hoveyda was not the only Iranian of his generation to play an active role in promoting the French Cinéma d'Auteur. [[Youssef Ishaghpour]] is another example.&lt;ref name="persianmirror1"&gt;[http://www.persianmirror.com/community/writers/DariusKadivar/2006/IranianFilmPioneers.cfm The Modern Magazine for Persian Celebrations, Cuisine, Culture &amp; Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Iranian figure in French New Wave was [[Shusha Guppy]] a singer, writer and filmmaker who was [[Jacques Prévert]]'s girlfriend. However, the most important contribution to the French New Wave cinema is that of [[Serge Rezvani]] an Iranian poet born in Tehran in 1928. He played a major role as music composer of both [[François Truffaut]] ''Jules et Jim'' and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] ''Pierrot le Fou'', considered as landmarks of French New Wave Cinema.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Apocalypto teaser.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Golden Globe nominated ''[[Apocalypto]]'' co-produced by [[Farhad Safinia]] was an Academy Award nominee for sound editing done by [[Kami Asgar]].]] --&gt;
[[Farah Diba]] studied at the Beaux Arts and became the focus of attention and the French press was to see her as the new Persian Cinderella. Farah Diba was one of the rare foreign dignitaries to become a permanent member of the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]].

Iranian [[Robert Hossein]] (son of legendary musician [[Aminollah Hossein]]) started his acting career with his French Armenian friend Chahnour Varinag Aznavourian (known as the famed crooner [[Charles Aznavour]]) in the mid fifties essentially type cast as "Mr. Tough Guy". However he got international acclaim in the early Sixties particularly in Europe, Russia and Asia as the mysterious "Jeoffrey, Comte de Peyrac" lover of the lovely Michèle Mercier in the soft erotic-adventure film series of ''Angélique Marquise des Anges''. In the seventies and eighties he was to play opposite [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] in police thrillers like ''The Professional''. Hossein became known for being a talented theater director and his taste for popular historical vehicles involving large sets and numerous actors.&lt;ref name="persianmirror1"/&gt;

After the resignation of French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], Iranian [[Anicée Shahmanesh]] became known under the screen name Anicée Alvina, playing a French girl in a British film hit called ''Friends'', the [[Film score|music score]] of which propelled British pop star [[Elton John]]. She was also to take on a courageous [[lesbian]] role in the screen adaptation of Françoise Mallet-Joris' novel ''Le Rempart des Béguines''.

Two major documentaries were produced in these years by respectively [[Agnès Varda]] and the duo Claude Lelouch-Claude Pinoteau.

[[Agnès Varda]], first to be discovered to young actor [[Gérard Depardieu]] in her 1970 film ''Nausicaa'', directed a love story set in [[Isfahan]] (1976) between a French woman (Valérie Mairesse) visiting Iran as a tourist and her guide an Iranian Man (Ali Raffi). The film was entitled ''Plaisir D'Amour en Iran''. The romantic film was shot on location in ''The Masjed Shah''.

[[Claude Pinoteau]] and [[Claude Lelouch]] on the other hand shot their documentary just after the [[Persepolis]] Celebrations in 1971. They decided to address the urban transformations and cultural emancipation that the country was subject to by the early seventies.

Several Iranian expats such as [[Philippe Khorsand]] or Persian play writer/actor [[Yasmina Reza]] have also gained notice in recent years. The latter is particularly known for her highly intellectual introspections in such plays like ''Art'' (Sean Connery bought the film rights advised by his French wife).&lt;ref name="persianmirror1"/&gt;

==Music in Iranian cinema==
Although Iranian composers usually have their own special style and music structure, they all share one thing: melodic, lively rhythms. That might be because they often begin with folkloric songs and shift to film music. In the past few decades, a few composers have emerged in the Iranian cinema with highly appraised works. Composers like [[Hormoz Farhat]], [[Morteza Hannaneh]], [[Fariborz Lachini]], [[Ahmad Pejman]], [[Majid Entezami]], Babak Bayat, Karen Homayounfar, Naser Cheshmazar and [[Hossein Alizadeh]] were some of the most successful score composers for Iranian films in the past decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/music/articles/iranian_film_music.php Music in Iranian cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian international film festivals==
Film festivals have a rather long history in Iran that goes back to the 1950s. The first ''Tehran International Film Festival'' opened in April 1973. Although the festival never reached the level of Cannes and Venice, however, it managed to become well known as a class A festival. It was a highly reputable festival and many well-known filmmakers took part in it with their films. Great filmmakers such as [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] [[Grigori Kozintsev]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Pietro Germi]], [[Nikita Mikhalkov]], [[Krzysztof Zanussi]], [[Martin Ritt]] won the festival's awards.&lt;ref name="massoudmehrabi2"&gt;[http://www.massoudmehrabi.com/articles.asp?id=1137857131 F for Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
{{Main article|Censorship in Iran}}
Although the Iranian film industry is flourishing, its filmmakers have operated under censorship rules, both before and after the revolution. Some Iranian films that have been internationally acclaimed are banned in Iran itself. Conversely, some Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility in other countries.

===Censorship within Iran===
Dariush Mehrjui's seminal film ''[[Gaav]]'' (''The Cow'', 1969) is now considered a pioneering work of the [[Iranian New Wave]]. The film was sponsored by the state, but they promptly banned it upon completion because its vision of rural life clashed with the progressive image of Iran that the Shah wished to project, while its prominence at international film festivals annoyed the regime.&lt;ref name="compuserve1"&gt;[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Stephen_Nottingham/cintxtIran.htm Steve Nottingham: Early Soviet Cinema&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015205738/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Stephen_Nottingham/cintxtIran.htm |date=October 15, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Iranian revolution]], filmmakers experienced more restrictions. Since the mid-1980s, Iran's policy on film censorship has been changed in order to promote domestic film production: the strict censorship eased after December 1987. Old directors resurfaced and new ones emerged.&lt;ref name="compuserve1"/&gt; However, the application of the rules is often inconsistent. Several films have been refused release inside Iran, but have been given export permits to enter international film festivals. Even here, the censorship is inconsistent: ''May Lady'' by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad (1998) got through but her contribution to ''Stories of Kish'' (1999) did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-bulletin.org/IBMEF_1_word%206%20files/The%20new%20Iranian%20Cinema.htm The new Iranian Cinema&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Jafar Panahi's films&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901060529-1196395,00.html Blowing the Whistle]&lt;/ref&gt; have been banned from public theaters in Iran.&lt;ref name="autoref5"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901060529-1196395,00.html | work=Time | title=Blowing The Whistle | date=May 21, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | first=Jumana | last=Farouky}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Offside'' was relegated to "a guest slot" at the [[International Fajr Film Festival]]. "It was not shown as an important film", says Panahi. "They didn't give any value to it."&lt;ref name="autoref5"/&gt; Several of Mohsen Makhmalbaf's films are also banned in Iran. For example, ''[[Time of Love]]'' and ''The night of Zaiandeh-rood'' were banned for dealing with physical love and for raising doubts about the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/cinema/mmakhmalbaf/mohsen_makhmalbaf.php Iran Chamber Society: Iranian Cinema: Mohsen Makhmalbaf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iranian National Day of Cinema 2016 139506220347049468635216.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Tahmineh Milani]]]]
In 2001, feminist filmmaker [[Tahmineh Milani]] who made [[The Hidden Half]] was jailed because her movie was presumed anti-revolution (against the 1979 Islamic revolution). Many Iranian and international artists and filmmakers demanded her release. After 8 days of Imprisonment, Eventually [[President Khatami]] and the Minister of Culture were able to secure her release. In ''Nargess'', Rakhshan Bani-Etemad who is a pioneer among female Iranian film directors, pushes censorship codes to the limits, questioning the morals of society, showing desperate people overwhelmed by social conditions and a couple living together without being married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestival.gr/2001/uk/nh3x3_etemad.php Filmfestival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas Kiarostami was significantly acclaimed in Europe but the Islamic government has refused screening of his films in his own country. Kiarostami's films have been banned in his country for more than 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4495249.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iran unyielding over director ban | date=April 28, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are only accessible there through unauthorized DVDs and private screenings. Kiarostami is uncertain what the government dislikes about his films, saying "I think they don't understand my films and so they prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don't want to get out."[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1653441,00.html]. Despite this, Kiarostami has displayed an extraordinarily benign perspective, at least in recorded interviews: "The government is not in my way, but it is not assisting me either. We lead our separate lives."&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1460813,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Landscapes of the mind | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=April 16, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the censorship, Kiarostami insists on working in Iran, saying "I think I really produce my best work in Iran."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; He believes that throughout the ages and all over the world censorship has existed in one form or another and artists have managed to live with this, saying "Today, the most important thing is that, although there is censorship, Iranian filmmakers are doing their job and they surpass the difficulties of censorship showing and discussing many things. So why ask me about what's not in the films? It has happened many times that a filmmaker hides a weakness under the excuse of censorship but difficulties have always existed in our lifestyle and our role is to surpass them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/cu1.htm Al-Ahram Weekly | Culture | Strategic lies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217222234/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/cu1.htm |date=February 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The director Mohammed Rasoulof, was convicted of charges relating to state security and anti-government propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/002/2012/en/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 and 2013 the number of political films and drama like ''Khers'', ''[[Guidance Patrol]]'', ''[[The Wooden Bridge]]'', ''[[I am a Mother]]'' and ''Private Life'' (Zendegi Khosoosi) were Sanctioned.

===House of Cinema temporary closure ===
In December 2011, Iran’s Council of Public Culture declared its ‘House of Cinema’, the country’s largest professional organisation for film makers, illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irandailybrief.com/?p=5695 "House of Cinema Declared Illegal"], Iran Daily Brief, 29 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities state the organization was shut down because of secret amendments to its charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsehsevom.net/2011/12/dec-irans-house-of-cinema-declared-illegal/ "DEC - Iran's House of Cinema Declared Illegal"], "Arseh Sevom, Peace, Democracy, Human Rights", 28 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; House of Cinema came under pressure when it challenged the detention of filmmakers accused of selling films to the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsehsevom.net/2011/12/dec-irans-house-of-cinema-declared-illegal/ "DEC - Iran's House of Cinema Declared Illegal"], "Arseh Sevom Peace, Democracy, Human Rights", 28 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, House of Cinema has been reopened by the new government.&lt;ref&gt;http://tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/110675-iranian-house-of-cinema-to-reopen-today&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011,  House of Cinema issued a statement in support of several filmmakers detained for contact with the BBC. They questioned the legal basis for the arrests, pointing out that the government itself has contact with international news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khanehcinema.ir/en/indexen.aspx?mid=1&amp;NewsID=1521&amp;type=1 "Statement of the Association of Film Trades on the detained documentary Filmmakers"], House of Cinema, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they received an official rebuke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enduringamerica.com/home/2011/9/28/the-latest-from-iran-28-september-and-now-to-the-real-news.html "The Latest from Iran (28 September): And Now to the Real News...."] Enduring America&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1419110 "علامت سئوال جدی درباره قانونی بودن تشکل خانه سینما وجود دارد"]  "Mehr News" 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostility outside Iran===
Given the tense relationship between Iran and the United States, Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility there, even if they have also been banned in their own country. Abbas Kiarostami was refused a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to attend the [[New York Film Festival]], [[Ohio University]] and [[Harvard University]] in 2002, in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web

Given the whole thing with Iran—I refuse to approach it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressive.org/mag_apb030807 U.S. Visa Policy Inhumane and Counterproductive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other Iranian filmmakers have experienced hostilities from other countries. In November 2001 in [[Afghanistan]], Taliban officials, who banned movies and most filmmaking, arrested three of [[Majid Majidi]]'s crew members who were helping him secretly shoot [[Barefoot to Herat (film)|Barefoot to Herat]], a documentary on the country's internal refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/07/09/DD111035.DTL&amp;hw=Majid+Majidi&amp;sn=002&amp;sc=637 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Iranian filmmaker stays true to his social conscience / New 'Baran' shows the miserable plight of Afghan refugees | first=Jonathan | last=Curiel | date=July 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samira Makhmalbaf]] also survived a kidnapping in Afghanistan. {West, Dennis and Makhmalbaf, Mohsen.

In March 2007, a bomb explosion severely injuring several actors and crew members halted production in Afghanistan of ''Two Legged Horse'', the film by Iranian helmer [[Samira Makhmalbaf]]. Mohsen Makhmalbaf was the target of two unsuccessful murder attempts when he shot ''[[Kandahar (2001 film)|Kandahar]]'' in Iran near the Afghan border in 2000, and his daughter Hana was twice the victim of a failed abduction attempt during the shooting of Samira's last film ''At Five in the Afternoon'' in the Afghan capital Kabul in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962212.html?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1 Bomber targets Makhmalbaf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arresting filmmakers ===
On 1 March 2010, [[Jafar Panahi]] was arrested. He was taken from his home along with his wife Tahereh Saidi, daughter Solmaz Panahi, and 15 of his friends by plain-clothes officers to [[Evin Prison]]. Most were released 48 hours later, [[Mohammad Rasoulof]] and Mehdi Pourmoussa on 17 March 2010, but Panahi remained in [[Prison 209|section 209]] inside [[Evin Prison]]. Panahi's arrest was confirmed by the government, but the charges were not specified.On April 14, 2010, Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said that Panahi was arrested because he "tried to make a documentary about the unrest that followed the disputed [[2009 Iranian election protests|2009 re-election]] of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]."On 18 May, Panahi sent a message to Abbas Baktiari, director of the Pouya Cultural Center, an Iranian-French cultural organization in Paris, stating that he was being mistreated in prison and his family threatened and as a result had begun a hunger strike. On 25 May, he was released on [[United States dollar|$]]200,000 bail while awaiting trial.On 20 December 2010, Panahi, after being convicted for "assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country’s national security and propaganda against the Islamic Republic," the [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]] sentenced Panahi to six years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on making or directing any movies, writing screenplays, giving any form of interview with Iranian or foreign media as well as leaving the country except for Hajj holy pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] or [[medical treatment]]. Panahi's colleague, [[Mohammad Rasoulof]] also received six years imprisonment but was later reduced to one year on appeal.On October 15, 2011, a court in Tehran upheld Panahi's sentence and ban. Following the courts decision, Panahi was placed under [[house arrest]]. He has since been allowed to move more freely but he cannot travel outside Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/world/middleeast/03iran.html|title=Iran Arrests Filmmaker Who Backed Opposition|last=Fathi|first=Nazila|date=2010-03-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/world/middleeast/03iran.html|title=Iran Arrests Filmmaker Who Backed Opposition|last=Fathi|first=Nazila|date=2010-03-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/666425|title=Iranian court upholds sentence against filmmaker Jafar Panahi|last=AFP|date=2011-10-15|website=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hossein Rajabian]], an Iranian independent filmmaker, After finishing his first feature film, was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 outside his office [in [[Sari, Iran|Sari]]] alongside two musicians, and was transferred to Ward 2-A of [[Evin Prison]] where all three of them were held in solitary confinement for more than two months and were threatened with televised confessions. He was released on bail (around $66,000) in mid-December, pending trial. Two years later, his case was heard at Branch 28 of Tehran Revolutionary Court which was presided over by Judge Moghisseh (Summer 2015). He was sentenced to six years in prison and fines for pursuing illegal cinematic activities, launching propaganda against the establishment and hurling insults at sanctities. On appeal, his sentence was changed to three years imprisonment and three years of suspended jail and Fines.Hossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of Evin Prison in Tehran. After spending one third of his total period of imprisonment (that is 11 months), he went on [[hunger strike]] to protest against unjust trial, lack of medical facilities, and transfer of his brother to another ward called section 8 of the same prison. During the first hunger strike period, which lasted 14 days, he was transferred to hospital because of pulmonary infection and he could not continue his hunger strike because of the interference of the representative of the prosecutor who was sent as an intermediary. After some time, he sent an open letter to the judicial authorities of Iran and went again on strike which brought him the supports of international artists. After 36 days of hunger strike, he could convince the judicial authorities of Iran to review his case and grant him medical leave for the treatment of his left kidney suffered from infections and blood arising out of hunger strike. he, after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/get-involved/take-action-now/urgent-action-update-gravely-ill-musician-returned-to-prison-iran-ua-4116|title=Urgent Action Update: Gravely Ill Musician Returned To Prison (Iran: UA 41/16) – Amnesty International USA|work=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.iranwire.com/features/6959/|title=Artists Sentenced to Prison|work=IranWire {{!}} خانه|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsfreedom.org/|title=Artsfreedom|website=Artsfreedom|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/dec/01/iranian-musician-hospitalised-after-one-month-hunger-strike|title=Iranian musician hospitalised after one-month hunger strike|last=correspondent|first=Saeed Kamali Dehghan Iran|date=2016-12-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amnesty.or.jp/en/get-involved/ua/ua/2016ua041.html|title=GRAVELY ILL IRANIAN MUSICIAN RETURNED TO PRISON: AMNESTY JAPAN|work=AMNESTY JAPAN|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cinema of Vietnam''' originates in the 1920s, and has largely been shaped by wars that have been fought in the country from the 1940s to the 1970s. Better known [[Vietnamese language]] films include ''[[Cyclo (film)|Cyclo]]'', ''[[The Scent of Green Papaya]]'' and ''[[Vertical Ray of the Sun]]'', all by French-trained [[Việt Kiều]] director [[Tran Anh Hung]]. In recent years, as Vietnam's film industry has modernized and moved beyond government-backed propaganda films, contemporary Vietnamese filmmakers have gained a wider audience with films such as ''[[The Buffalo Boy|Buffalo Boy]]'', ''Bar Girls'', and ''[[The White Silk Dress]]''.

==History==
===Early films===
In the 1920s, a group of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] intellectuals formed the Huong Ky Film Company in [[Hanoi]]. It produced documentaries on the funeral of Emperor [[Khải Định]] and the enthronement of [[Bảo Đại]]. There was also the silent feature, ''Một đồng kẽm tậu được ngựa'' (''A Penny for a Horse'').
The first sound films were produced from 1937 to 1940, with ''Trọn với tình'' (''True to Love''), ''Khúc khải hoàn'' (''The Song of Triumph'') and ''Toét sợ ma'' (''Toét's Scared of Ghosts'') by the Asia Film Group studio in Hanoi with the participation of artist [[Tám Danh]]. The Vietnam Film Group, led by [[Trần Tấn Giàu]] produced ''Một buổi chiều trên sông Cửu Long'' (''An Evening on the Mekong River'') and ''Thầy Pháp râu đỏ'' (''The Red-Bearded Sorcerer'').

Two other films, ''Cánh đồng ma'' (''The Ghost Field'') and ''Trận phong ba'' (''The Storm''), were made in 1937 and 1938 in Hong Kong with Vietnamese actors and dialogue, but both were financial failures.

The government's Ministry of Information and Propaganda formed a film department around 1945 and documented battles in the [[First Indochina War]] in the documentaries ''Trận Mộc Hóa'' (''Mộc Hóa Battle'') in 1948, ''Trận Đông Khê'' (''Đông Khê Battle'') in 1950 ''Chiến thắng Tây Bắc'' (''North West Victory'') in 1952, ''Việt Nam trên đường thắng lợi'' (''Việt Nam on the Road to Victory'') in 1953 and ''Dien Bien Phu'' (1954).

===The war years===
With the end of the First Indochina War and the creation of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]], there were two Vietnamese film industries, with the Hanoi industry focusing on documentary and drama films and Saigon on war or comedy films.

Hanoi's Vietnam Film Studio was established in 1956 and the Hanoi Film School opened in 1959. The first feature film produced in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was a nationalistic work directed by Nguyễn Hồng Nghị, ''Chung một giòng sông'' (''Together on the Same River''). There was even an animated feature, ''Đáng đời Thằng Cáo'' (''A Just Punishment for the Fox'') in 1960.

Documentaries and feature films from Hanoi attracted attention at film festivals in [[Eastern Europe]] at the time. The documentary ''Nước về Bắc Hưng Hải'' (''Water Returns to Bắc Hưng Hải'') won the Golden Award at the 1959 [[Moscow Film Festival]], and the 1963 feature by Phạm Kỳ Nam, ''Chị Tư Hậu'' (''Sister Tư Hậu'') won the Silver Award at Moscow. It starred lead actress [[Trà Giang]].

But mostly the Hanoi-based industry focused on documenting the [[Vietnam War]]. Between 1965 and 1973, 463 newsreels, 307 documentaries and 141 scientific films were produced, in contrast to just 36 feature films and 27 cartoons. Films during this period include the documentaries ''Du kích Củ Chi'' (''Củ Chi Guerillas'') in 1967 and ''Lũy thép Vĩnh Linh'' (''Vĩnh Linh Steel Rampart'') in 1970, which included footage from battles. Other films, such as ''Đường ra phía trước'' (''The Road to the Front'') in 1969 and ''Những người săn thú trên núi Dak-sao'' (''Hunters on Dak-sao Mountain'') in 1971 were docudramas.

Feature films from this time include ''Nguyễn Văn Trỗi'' (1966), ''Đường về quê mẹ'' (''Road Back to Mother'') (1971), ''Truyện vợ chồng Anh Lực'' (''The Story of Anh Lực and his Wife'') in 1971, and ''[[Girl from Hanoi|Em bé Hà Nội]]'' (''Girl from Hanoi'') in 1975.

Saigon produced numerous documentary and [[public information film]]s, as well as feature films. The most well known feature film of the late 1950s was ''Chúng Tôi Muốn Sống'' (We Want To Live), a realistic depiction of the bloody land reform campaign in North Vietnam under Communist-dominated [[Vietminh]].  Some mid-1960s black-and-white features dealt with war themes, with actors such as Đoàn Châu Mậu and La Thoại Tân.  Some later popular color features revolved around the theme of family or personal tragedy in a war-torn society, such as ''Người Tình Không Chân Dung'' (The Faceless Lover) starring [[Kieu Chinh|Kiều Chinh]], ''Xa Lộ Không Đèn'' (Dark Highway) starring Thanh Nga, ''Chiếc Bóng Bên Đường'' (A Silhouette by the Road) starring Kim Cương and Thành Được.  Comedy movies were usually released around [[Tết]], the Vietnamese New Year; most notable was ''Triệu Phú Bất Đắc Dĩ'' (The Reluctant Millionaire) starring the well-loved comedian Thanh Việt.

[[Joseph Mankiewicz]]'s adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Quiet American]]'' was filmed in and around Saigon in 1957. American actor [[Marshall Thompson]] directed and starred in ''[[A Yank in Vietnam]]'', or ''[[Year of the Tiger (film)|Year of the Tiger]]'' in 1964.

===Reunification===
After [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]] of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]], studios in the former South Vietnam turned to making [[Socialist Realism]] films. Vietnamese feature film output increased and by 1978 the number of feature films made each year was boosted from around three annually during the war years to 20.

Films from the years following the war focused on heroic efforts in the revolution, human suffering created by the war and social problems of post-war reconstruction. Films from this time include ''Mùa gió chướng'' (''Season of the Whirlwind'') in 1978 and ''Cánh đồng hoang'' (''The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone'') in 1979.

===Contemporary cinema===

The shift to a [[Economy of Vietnam|market economy]] in 1986 dealt a blow to Vietnamese filmmaking, which struggled to compete with video and television. The number of films produced in Vietnam has dropped off sharply since 1987.

Still, a number of filmmakers continued to produce film that would be seen on the arthouse circuit. These include [[Trần Văn Thủy]]'s ''Hà Nội trong mắt ai?'' (''Hanoi Through Whose Eyes?'', 1983) and ''Chuyện tử tế'' (''Story of Good Behavior'', 1987) and Trần Anh Trà's ''Người công giáo huyện Thống Nhất'' (''A Catholic in Thống Nhất District'', 1985), Trần Vũ's ''Anh và em'' (''Siblings'', 1986), Ðặng Nhật Minh's ''Cô gái trên sông'' (''Girl on the River'', 1987), Nguyển Khắc Lợi's ''Tướng về hưu'' (''The Retired General'') and Ðặng Nhật Minh's ''Mùa ổi'' (''Guava Season'', 2001).

Tony Bui's ''Ba mùa'' (''[[Three Seasons]]'', 1998) won prizes at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1998. Trần Văn Thủy's ''[[Tiếng vĩ cầm ở Mỹ Lai]]'' (''The Sound of the Violin at My Lai'') won Best Short Film prize at the 43rd [[Asia Pacific Film Festival]] in 1999. ''Đời cát'' (''Sandy Life'') by Nguyễn Thanh won best picture at the same festival the following year. Bùi Thạc Chuyên's ''Cuốc xe đêm'' (''Night Cyclo Trip'') won third prize in the short film category at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2000.

Better known, however, are European productions in Vietnam, such as ''[[The Lover (film)|The Lover]]'' and ''[[Indochine (film)|Indochine]]'', as well as films by [[Việt Kiều]] directors [[Tran Anh Hung]] and [[Tony Bui]]. Tran's first feature, ''The Scent of the Green Papaya'' won the Golden Camera at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1993 and was the first Vietnamese film nominated for an Oscar in 1994. His other films include ''Xích lô'' (''[[Cyclo (film)|Cyclo]]'', 1995) and ''Mùa hè chiều thẳng đứng'' (''Vertical Ray of the Sun'') in 2000. Another European co-production, ''Mùa len trâu'' (''[[The Buffalo Boy]]'') by Nguyễn Võ Nghiêm Minh, has won numerous awards at film festivals, including the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] in 2004.

In recent years, Vietnamese filmmakers have moved in more commercial directions to try and regain audiences lost to television and DVDs. One of the most successful films of recent years at the Vietnamese box office has been Phi Tiến Sơn's ''Lưới trời'' (''Heaven's Net''), a film about corruption that closely mirrors the trial of Ho Chi Minh City gangster [[Nam Cam]].

An even bigger film was 2002's Lê Hoàng's ''Gai nhay'' (''Bar Girls''), which depicted Ho Chi Minh City's titillating and seedy nightlife while also warning of the dangers of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]]. Featuring the first government-approved topless scene, it spawned a sequel, ''Lọ lem hè phố'' (''Street Cinderella'') in 2004. Another film along these lines is ''[[Nữ tướng cướp]]'' (''Gangsta Girls''). There are also comedy-romance films, such as ''[[Hon Truong Ba Da Hang Thit]]'' (''Truong Ba's Soul in Butcher's Body'') in 2006 and ''Khi dan ong co bau'' (''When Men Get Pregnant'') from 2004.

[[Việt Linh]] has made several critically acclaimed films.

In 2007, ''[[Muoi]]'' (''Muoi: the Legend of a Portrait''), the first [[horror film]] in Vietnam after [[the Fall of Saigon]] (collaborated by [[Korea]]n producers) also became the first rated film with an under-16 ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tintuconline.vietnamnet.vn/vn/vanhoa/134325/ Tin Tuc Online - Vietnamnet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] false information on the VN-news, because the first Vietnamese horror released 1973  in South Vietnam ''Con ma nha ho Hua'' (The Ghost of Family Hua) and 2004 [[Oan hon]] (Spirits) from Vietnamese Americans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laodong.com.vn/Home/vanhoa/sankhauda/2007/8/52690.laodong Laodong.com.vn | Dưới 16 tuổi không được xem phim Mười - Duoi 16 tuoi khong duoc xem phim Muoi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19079">'''Cinephilia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|i|ə}}; also '''cinemaphilia''' or '''filmophilia''') is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in [[film]]s, [[film theory]], and [[film criticism]]. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[Film|cinema]] and [[philia]], one of the four ancient [[Greek words for love]].&lt;ref name="de-Valck"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Cinephilia: Movies, Love and Memory|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2005|isbn=90-5356-768-2|location=Amsterdam|editor1-first=Marijke|editor1-last=de Valck|editor2-first=Malte|editor2-last=Hagener}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with a passionate interest in cinema is called a '''cinephile''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|f|aɪ|l}}), '''cinemaphile''', '''filmophile''', or, informally, a '''film buff''' (also '''movie buff''').

In English, "cinephile" is sometimes used interchangeably with the word '''cineaste''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|i|ˌ|æ|s|t|,_|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|eɪ|-}}), though in the original French the term ''cinéaste'' ({{IPA-fr|sineast|}}) refers to a cinephile who is also a filmmaker.

==Definition==
In a review of a book on the history of cinephilia, Mas Generis writes: "Cinephilia, is the condition of a sexual attraction to movies."&lt;ref name="generis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Generis |first1=Mas |date=11 December 2006 |title=Cinephilia now: review of ''Cinephilia: movies, love and memory'' |journal=Screening the Past |issue=20 |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/20/cinephilia-movies-love-memory.html  |publisher=[[LaTrobe University]] |accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generis also introduces a quote from [[film scholar]] Annette Michelson that states that there is, "No one such thing as cinephilia, but rather forms and periods of cinephilia."&lt;ref name="generis" /&gt; As described by Antoine de Baecque and [[Thierry Frémaux]], "The definitive essence of cinephila is a culture of the discarded that prefers to find intellectual coherence where none is evident and to eulogize the non-standard and the minor."&lt;ref name="keathley"&gt;Keathley, Christian. Cinephilia and history, or, The wind in the trees. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film historian Thomas Elsaesser wrote that it "reverberates with nostalgia and dedication... more than a passion of going to the movies and only a little less than an entire attitude towards life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://filmschoolrejects.com/is-fandom-the-new-cinephilia-585391abb8b2/ "Is Fandom the New Cinephilia?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the beginning of the [[silent era]], there have been [[Film society|film clubs]] and publications in which people who felt passionately about cinema could discuss their interests and see rare and older works. At the beginning of the [[sound film|sound era]], there were more and more people interested in seeing older films, which led to the establishment of organizations such as the [[Cinémathèque Française]], the first major archive devoted to [[film preservation]].

===Post-war French cinephilia===

Perhaps the most notable cinephilic community of the 20th century was the one that developed in Paris in the decades following World War II. An influx of foreign films that had been withheld during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation]], as well as the screening programs of local [[film society|film clubs]] and the [[Cinémathèque Française]], generated interest in [[world cinema]] amongst the city's [[intellectual]] [[youth culture]]. In general, the cinephiles of the period set a template for future like-minded groups by having keen enthusiasm for both older and contemporary films.&lt;ref name="richard"&gt;Le fantôme d'Henri Langlois. Dir. Jacques Richard. DVD. Kino Video, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential film clubs of the period included Objectif 49, whose members included [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], and the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter). ''Revue du Cinéma'', a magazine published by members of the two clubs, later evolved into the influential film magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]''.

Many of the people who attended the screenings became [[film critic]]s and later [[filmmakers]], founding the film movement known as the [[French New Wave]]. [[André Bazin]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alexandre Astruc]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Luc Moullet]] and others were regulars, and several, most notably Truffaut, maintained their ties to the community after they had achieved fame.

The community fostered an interest in [[Film director|directors]] and [[film]]s that had been neglected, forgotten or simply unknown in the West, and led to the development of the [[auteur theory]]. The directors the French cinephiles of the period had strong interests in included [[F. W. Murnau]], [[Robert Flaherty]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Jean Renoir]], [[Jean Vigo]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Anthony Mann]], [[Louis Feuillade]], [[D. W. Griffith]], the [[Lumière Brothers]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Georges Méliès]], whose films would be screened from [[nitrate film|nitrate prints]] on special occasions.&lt;ref name="richard" /&gt;

===Filmgoing in the 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Federico Fellini.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The Italian director [[Federico Fellini]], a fashionable figure in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, owed part of his popularity to the support of [[film critics]] and the distribution of [[foreign films]] in order to accommodate the increasingly sophisticated public.]]

With the popular success of the [[French New Wave]], film-going became fashionable in Europe and America.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt; [[Revival house|Revival screenings]] and independently run cinemas specializing in [[foreign film]]s became increasingly common. In the United States, New York City was often seen as the center of cinephile culture,&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt; due to the wide variety of films available to see at any given time. This culture was also helped by the popularity in America of figures such like [[Pauline Kael]], [[Andrew Sarris]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name="keathley" /&gt; Certain writers and critics, including Sontag, would later come to view this as the "[[golden age]]" of film-going in the US.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keathley" /&gt; Directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the US and influenced the young generation of film enthusiasts who would become the [[New Hollywood]], including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Woody Allen]]. Due to growing public interest in [[foreign film|films from other countries]], specialty [[film distributor|distributors]] such as [[Janus Films]] and [[New Yorker Films]] began importing and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] foreign movies.

The era also saw the growth of college film societies in the US. Though some, like [[Doc Films]] at the [[University of Chicago]], had existed since the 1930s, the 1960s saw directors of all generations regularly make appearances at college campuses, whether to revisit their old films or to discuss new ones.

At the same time, the Parisian cinephilic culture became increasingly politicized. Critics, and by extension the cinephiles who followed their work, began to emphasize political aspects of films and directors. Though many of the major figures of the post-war community has been originally aligned with the [[Right (politics)|political right]]—including most of the ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' group—by the late 1960s ''Cahiers'' and the young cinephile public in general had aligned with various forms of the [[Left (politics)|Left]], with some figures, such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]], aligning with [[Maoism]]. In this very politicized climate, cinema was often seen as directly connected to [[Marxism]]. Many members of this new generation of cinephiles would become [[film critic|critics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/film/cinephobia-2129482 Cinephobia-Manohla Dargis of The LA Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[film director|directors]], including [[Serge Daney]], [[Philippe Garrel]], and [[Andre Techine]].

Though most of the world's major film festivals had existed for decades by this point—including the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Venice Film Festival]]—the period saw the establishment of festivals in nearly every major city. The [[New York Film Festival]], the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] were all started during this time. The [[Toronto International Film Festival]], often seen as second only to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in terms of importance, was founded towards the end of this period, in 1976.

===Home video and the late 20th century===
[[File:Wong Kar-wai at 2008 TIFF.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Wong Kar-wai]] (''pictured'') is a renowned [[arthouse]] film director from Hong Kong.]]

As [[VHS]] tapes and later [[DVD]]s became more common, cinephilia became less associated with filmgoing in theatres.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt;

While [[Japanese language|Japanese]] films have enjoyed worldwide distribution in the mid 20th century, the late 20th century saw an increase in interest amongst cinephiles in cinema from other Asian countries, especially China, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and, later, [[Thailand]].

===Contemporary cinephilia===
[[File:Michael Mann - French Cinematheque - 4th July 2009.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Though his films have met with mixed commercial success, American director [[Michael Mann]] (pictured above at [[Cinémathèque Française]] in 2009) is often considered to be a major figure by contemporary cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theauteurs.com/notebook/posts/828 The Auteurs' Notebook: Anticipating "Public Enemies"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2009/07/the-mann-act-public-enemies.html Glenn Kenny: The Mann Act]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Since the beginning of the 21st century, [[blogging]] has become a large part of cinephile culture. In the [[English-speaking world]], established critics and theorists like [[Dave Kehr]], [[David Bordwell]], [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], [[Glenn Kenny]], [[Wheeler Winston Dixon]] and [[Adrian Martin]], as well as non-professional cinephiles like [[Girish Shambu]] and [[Acquarello]], play key roles in building interest in films or theories amongst cinephiles by writing and communicating through blogs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/nd08/fccrisis.htm Film Comment: Film Criticism in Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211045039/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/nd08/fccrisis.htm |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Online forum|Forums]] and [[podcast]]s have become popular ways to stir discussion, allowing cinephiles from different countries and cultures to discuss ideas about film. The [[social networking]] and [[video streaming]] service [[Mubi (website)|Mubi]] caters specifically to cinephiles, allowing its members access to films that sometimes haven't been distributed theatrically or on video in their home countries. Home video distribution labels such as [[The Criterion Collection]] and [[Masters of Cinema]] cater to cinephiles, often including large amounts of supplemental and [[film criticism|critical]] material with their releases.

As was the case with the French cinephilia of the post-war era, the international cinephilic community that has developed on the Internet often emphasizes films and figures that do not have strong critical or popular recognition, including many directors who work within [[genre film]], in what is sometimes dubbed [[vulgar auteurism]]. These include [[Abel Ferrara]], [[Bela Tarr]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], [[Park Chan-wook]], [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], [[Philippe Garrel]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Lucrecia Martel]] and [[Jose Luis Guerin]].

==Cinephilia and filmmaking==
[[File:Quentin Tarantino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|140px|right|American director and cinephile [[Quentin Tarantino]] often makes references in his work to movies and directors he admires.]]

Throughout the history of cinema, there have been numerous directors who developed their understanding of cinema through filmgoing and participation in cinephile communities and organizations instead of within the formal settings of either a [[film school]] or a [[film studio]]. Directors who began as cinephiles include [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Ed Wood]], [[Andre Techine]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Brian de Palma]], [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Hal Hartley]]  and [[Aki Kaurismäki]].

The directors of the [[French New Wave]], who learned about filmmaking by attending screenings at [[film society|film clubs]] and discussing movies amongst themselves, are often seen as models for cinephiles. Their intellectual [[omnivorousness]], which equated an interest in cinema with strong understandings of [[literature]], [[art]] and sometimes [[philosophy]], has continued to have influence on cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-movies-arent-dying-theyre-not-even-sick The Movies Aren't Dying (They're Not Even Sick)-Richard Brody of The New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, many directors emphasize their lack of cinephilia or interest in movies. [[Abbas Kiarostami]], popular with cinephiles, often emphasized his disinterest in cinema when interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas Kiarostami (Contemporary Film Directors). New York: University of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinephobia===
There has also been different forms of ''cinephobia'' (fear or hatred of cinema)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0278.xml#]&lt;/ref&gt; from the current fear of "losing" celluloid film in the digital age through anxieties about moral values on the big screen to the point of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[www.lolajournal.com/5/cinephobia.html 
Cinephobia: To Wonder, To Worry]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsgso.pitt.edu/conference/cinephilia-cinephobia/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telephilia&lt;!--'Telephilia' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Telephilia'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in [[television]].

===Definition===
It was coined by ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Frank Rich, in a pejorative way, as "the pathological longing of Americans, no matter how talentless, to be on television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/print.php?id=12562&amp;type=2|title=The Namibian|website=www.namibian.com.na}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
For years, television was frowned upon as inferior to film until the advent of [[quality television]] in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/cultivating-tv-aesthetics|title=Cultivating TV aesthetics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when recording and reproduction technologies allowed the spectator to release his/her viewing from the palimpsest's rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41552408|title=Cinephilia/Telephilia|first1=Francesco|last1=Casetti|first2=Mariagrazia|last2=Fanchi|date=17 August 2017|publisher=|journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media|volume=45|issue=2|pages=38–41|doi=10.2307/41552408}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1112415581/cinephilia-telephilia] Cinephilia/Telephilia 
By Casetti, Francesco; Fanchi, Mariagrazia-Framework, Vol. 45, Issue 2, Fall 2004-Online Research Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephilia from 2000s onwards===
Anti-heroic series like ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' were cited as improving television content thus earning critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://dspace.mic.ul.ie/handle/10395/1987]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306002105_Post-network_audiences_and_cable_crime_drama|title=Post-network audiences and cable crime drama (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also rivals cinephilia for relevance as production values are higher than ever before on shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/telephilia-has-television-become-a-more-relevant-american-medium-than-art-film-38350/|title=Telephilia: Has Television Become a More Relevant American Medium Than Art Film?|first=Celluloid Liberation|last=Front|website=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this development, there are still intellectuals &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BOgUyPYw0KoC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=telephilia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w5JGf56BlM&amp;sig=0hWr8bTEGoz0xFpn7iGkOUnelyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOpZvB6sTeAhXl7YMKHTLpDDE4FBDoATADegQIBRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=telephilia&amp;f=false Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media-Robert Miklitsch-Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; who consider telephilia as inferior to cinephilia particularly in cases of obsessions for modern television programs belonging to genres such as [[melodrama]] and [[soap opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|last=Miklitsch|first=Robert|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2006|isbn=0791467333|location=New York|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also explained by the view that highlighted the unattainable nature of the cinema, which makes it more desirable and extraordinary since it features a regime of presence-yet-absence filmic image, allowing a form of cinematic stardom capable of triggering a series of psychic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema of Takeshi Kitano: Flowering Blood|last=Redmond|first=Sean|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780231163323|location=New York|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with television, which is perceived to be more present and immediate - with its stars "famous only in so far as he or she makes frequent television appearances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some observers, however, note that there is now a destabilization of traditional notions of what constitutes cinephilic tendency due to the availability of film on [[Home video|home media]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cult Media: Re-packaged, Re-released and Restored|last=Wroot|first=Jonathan|last2=Willis|first2=Andy|publisher=Pagrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=9783319636788|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TechBooth.JPG|thumb|right|A balcony level control booth. The stage is to the right.]]
The '''control booth''', '''control room''', '''lighting box''', '''technical booth''', '''tech booth''', or just '''booth'''or the  bio box
 to [[theatrical technician|theatre]] or [[television technician|television]] technicians is the area designated for the operation of technical equipment ([[stage lighting|lighting]] and [[Sound reinforcement system|sound]]), and is sometimes the location of the [[stage manager|deputy stage manager]]'s (DSM) station as well as the [[light board|lighting controls]] and [[mixing console|sound board]]. Often one or two [[followspot]]s are located in the booth as well. Generally it is an enclosed space with a large sliding window with a good view of the stage. In a [[proscenium]] [[theater]], it is centered in the back of the [[Front of House|house]]. It might be on the ground floor, but is sometimes placed at the balcony level.

It is designed to allow lighting and sound operators to be able to see the performance, without being in the auditorium itself. This means that they are free to talk to their colleagues in the booth, and also the [[Stage management]] team and other crew members via the communications [[Headset (audio)|headset]]. A booth that is sealed to the auditorium also allows for noisier equipment to be used, in particular computers and computer-based [[Lighting control console|lighting desks]], which require built-in fans in order to work properly. The downside to having a sealed booth is that it can be difficult for the sound engineer to mix without being able to hear what is happening on stage. In this situation a separate table may be set up in the house for the sound engineer.

In some smaller theatres, and school halls control booths can sometimes be found above or at the side of the stage. This allows space at the back of the auditorium for more seating, or a better/larger foyer area.
In older theatres, this is because before the advent of thyristor dimming and compact electronic control desks, there was a limit on the distance that lighting controls could be placed away from the dimmers.

In some theatres, the control booth is divided into a suite of rooms, allowing each of the technical elements of a production its own customized space. This is especially likely to be the case where a theatre produces performances which require [[live sound mixing]] rather than just pre-recorded effects, as a sound operator needs to be able to hear the sound in the auditorium, and so not be sealed from it as a lighting operator, followspot operator or projectionist might be. In some theatres with one or more balconies, the followspots may be given their own room above the highest balcony, with the lighting booth typically lower down at the rear of the stalls or the first balcony.

In rare cases; such as low budget theatres or ones at small or older schools, the control booth is not enclosed as its own space, rather it is part of the seating house. This however, is a setup that is almost never used because it hinders the possibility of the technician team to effectively communicate to the backstage area without disrupting the performance.

==Contents==
The booth contains a variety of equipment used in the production of theatrical performances. Although booths vary greatly from venue to venue, most booths contain a [[light board]], and sometimes a [[mixing console|sound board]]. Most control booths have at least one intercom headset used for communication with the backstage crew during performances. The booth may have equipment racks for the lighting and audio equipment.

The '''Cultural Centre of Belém''' ({{lang-pt|Centro Cultural de Belém (CCB)}}), located in the civil parish of [[Santa Maria de Belém]] (in the municipality of [[Lisbon]]), is the largest building with cultural facilities in [[Portugal]]. The CCB's 140,000 m² spaces was initially built to accommodate the European Presidency, but adapted to provide spaces for conferences, exhibitions and artistic venues (such as opera, ballet and symphony concerts), in addition to political and research congresses, high security meeting halls, and a 7,000 m² exhibition area.

==History==
[[File:Cc belem 3.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The main entrance to the Belém Cultural Centre]]
[[File:Belém Cultural Center.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The largest cultural centre in Portugal]]
[[File:Belém Cultural Center 2.jpg|thumb|235px|left|A sculpture near one of the patios/entranceways to the cultural centre]]
The decision to construct the Cultural Centre of Belém occurred in January 1988, as part of the Portuguese government's need to construct a building to welcome and accommodate the people involved in Portugal's European Union Presidency (in 1992).&lt;ref name="FerreiraCabello"&gt;E. Ferreira and J. Cabello (2008), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SantanaMatos"&gt;Cátia Santana and Madalena Cunha Matos (2010), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The facility would also serve as a core facility for cultural and leisure activities after its term, and serve as a venue for conferences and exhibitions.

An international architectural competition was held and six proposals were invited to submit a preliminary project, out of the 57 submissions.&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos/&gt; The final proposal, submitted by the architectural consortium of Vittorio Gregotti (Italy) and Atelier Risco at the time led by Manuel Salgado (Portugal), was designed to include five modules: a Conference Centre, a Performing Arts Centre, an Exhibition Centre, Hotel and complementary equipment zone, but only the Conference Centre, the Performing Arts Centre and the Exhibition Centre were initially constructed.&lt;ref name=FerreiraCabello/&gt;&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos/&gt;&lt;ref name="SantanaMatos2"&gt;Cátia Santana and Madalena Cunha Matos (2010), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in July 1989, the buildings along the waterfront were demolished and many of the infrastructures were reestablished. By January 1992, modules 1, 2 and 3 were completed and ready to accommodate the institutions, administration, communication centre and security of the European Union Presidency. A year later the Conference Centre and small auditorium (March) and later the Exhibition Centre were opened to the public. By fall of the same year (September), the main auditorium was inaugurated.

==Architecture==
The building is located in [[Santa Maria de Belém]], near the riverfront west of Lisbon, between the dual Avenida da Índia-Avenida de Brasília motorway and ''Rua Bartolomeu Dias''.&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos2/&gt; Apart from fronting the ''Praça do Império'' (''Imperial Square''), it juxtopositions the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], and is surrounded by many historical buildings, such as the [[Belém Palace|Palace]] and the 
[[Belém Tower|Tower of Belém]], the [[National Archaeology Museum (Lisbon)|Museum of Archaeology]], the Planetarium, the [[Padrão dos Descobrimentos|Monument to the Discoveries]].&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos2/&gt;

The Belém Cultural Centre has 140,000 m² of construction area and was prepared in a very short period (1989–1992). The client of the project was the Portuguese State through the ''Secretaria de Estado da Cultura'' (State Agency for Culture). Completed in 1992, it occupies a total of 100,000 m² and is the work of architects [[Vittorio Gregotti]] and Manuel Salgado; the interior was planned by Daciano Costa.

Its designed, aligned with the Jerónimos' Monastery, intentionally fronts the Império Square, and consists of structural blocks with courtyards and ''"patio-squares"'' that interconnect the three principal structures.&lt;ref name="SantanaMatos3"&gt;Cátia Santana and Madalena Cunha Matos (2010), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Each centre is separated by transversal "streets", that link the building's interiors which are extensions of the city of Lisbon's historical urban structure.&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos3/&gt; The centrality of the main building extends the urban fabric to the interior creating a public space.&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos3/&gt; This architectural style can best be interpreted by Santana and Matos (2010) who refer to as the ''"patios-squares" versus the "narrow streets"'' a conflicting dynamic structure.&lt;ref name=SantanaMatos3/&gt;

With highly sophisticated equipment and a wide variety of installed services, it has several areas with different roles:
* The '''Conference Centre''', provides a close link with the most varied business and professional sectors; conceived in order to support conferences and meetings, as well as the CCB operational services, stores, a restaurant, two bars, parking areas and the [[Jacques Delors]] European Information Centre;&lt;ref name=FerreiraCabello/&gt;
* The '''Performing Arts Centre''', the core of the site's cultural and artistic activities, it includes two auditoriums (the larger holding 1429 seats and the smaller with 348 seats), rehearsal hall with 72 seats, in order to support film, opera, ballet, theatre and music events;&lt;ref name=FerreiraCabello/&gt;
* The '''Exhibition Centre''', which includes four galleries for exhibitions of modern art, architecture, design and photography, in addition to coffee and concessionary shops; it also, since June 2007, has been the venue for the Foundation of Modern and Contemporary Art (the Berardo Museum Collection);&lt;ref name=FerreiraCabello/&gt;
* The Educational Area provides a close link between the Foundation and schools of various levels as well as other institutions;
* The Formation Area is a service of the Belém Cultural Centre Foundation; courses, seminars and Conferences are directed towards teaching and learning, as well as the acquisition of further knowledge, skills and specialisation in the different areas of the arts, and culture.

The Cultural Centre of Belém won the International Stone Architecture Award at the Verona Fair in 1993.

It has already hosted important events like the summit meeting of the Heads of State of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).

'''''Dark Reign: The Future of War''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed by [[Auran]] and published by [[Activision]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/31005.html|title=Dark Reign: The Future of War release information|publisher=gamefaqs.com|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of a large single-player campaign but also supports [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] online games. A mission construction kit is included with the game, that allows players to create new maps for multiplayer game and create entire missions and campaigns.

An expansion pack, ''[[Dark Reign: Rise of the Shadowhand]]'', was released on March 31, 1998, which added new missions and new units to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/56597.html|title=Dark Reign Expansion: Rise of the Shadowhand release information.|publisher=gamefaqs.com|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prequel, ''[[Dark Reign 2]]'', was released on June 30, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/258051.html|title=Dark Reign 2 release information|publisher=gamefaqs.com|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==

The game takes place in the distant future. The player takes the role of a survivor of a faction of humans known as the Tograns, whose society was decimated after their homeworld became engulfed in the civil war between the Freedom Guard and the Imperium (who were once both the Sprawlers and the Jovian Detention Authority (JDA) from ''Dark Reign 2'' respectively). As one of the last remaining Tograns that set off in hopes they might find a new refuge to rebuild and carry on the words of Alpheus Togra (a famous research scientist and philosopher), the player is presented with an opportunity to go back through time and prevent the death of the founder, Togra, using an advanced probe launched by him just prior to the destruction of the planet Strata-7. To use the device, the player must first demonstrate their worth by achieving victory in simulations of famous battles between the Imperium and the Freedom Guard.

The thirteen missions play out the events from the first skirmish between the Imperium and Freedom Guard up to the battle for and destruction of Strata-7. The missions may freely be played from the perspective of the Imperium or the Freedom Guard. In the thirteenth and final mission, the last Togran, the player, is sent back in time using the Chronomachine to Strata-7, and must use the weapons and technology of both the Imperium and the Freedom Guard to combine a force that will defeat both sides and prevent the complete destruction of Strata-7 and the death of Togra.

In the expansion, ''Rise of the Shadowhand'', the story depicts the increasing desperation and despotism of the Imperium after the emergence of the Tograns as a third credible faction. After a massive Imperium assault on Freedom Guard space, a fleeing transport stumbles upon a planet, at the other side of the galaxy, where the Imperium secret police, the Shadowhand, have conducted major research. By coincidence, the Shadowhand simultaneously is faced with losing control of its advanced units due to the malfunction of their guiding AI, Osiris.

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay is that of a sci-fi [[real-time strategy]], similar to that of ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (series)|Command &amp; Conquer]]''. In any given scenario, the player first constructs buildings for unit production, resource gathering, power generation and base defense. The production of units and buildings represent an [[opportunity cost]] as they all have an associated cost in terms of credits (the currency used by the game). Additional credits are earned by collecting shipments of water from fresh springs, while additional power can be generated by harvesting Taleon. Water and Taleon are the only two resources collected during gameplay. These resource deposits continuously regenerate and can never be completely exhausted, however, when depletion occurs, resource accumulation from these sources takes longer. In a special case, the complete destruction of water sources can be forced through the use of the Water Contamination Unit as part of resource-denial strategy. During short games, it is advised to assert control over as many water deposits as possible to ensure a strong income in financing attacks and base defenses. In longer games, this strategy is extended to protecting and maintaining supply routes as it takes longer to derive the same amount of profit.

The two sides have completely unique units and strategies, unlike many contemporary games. Freedom Guard units are characterized as being weaker but more mobile, being faster and better able to handle difficult terrain. As such, these units specialize in lightning strikes and ambushes and are useful in harassing enemy units and supply lines. Imperium units rely on strength and numbers to overwhelm their enemies. Although their units are usually slower when compared to Freedom Guard counterparts, they are able to outmatch Freedom Guard units with increased armor and firepower. Furthermore, Imperium units have a greater reliance on hover technology, which limits their use in extreme terrain but allows them to easily cross natural water barriers. Freedom Guard technology relies on hiding their units through use of technology called phasing. Phasing allows units to quickly hide underground, making them effective for close-quarters ambushes. The Imperium are directed more towards a blitzkrieg style of play, with units focused on supremacy in combat ahead of tactical flexibility. Freedom Guard units are geared more towards an anti-armor role, especially to counter Imperium armor superiority, while the Imperium utilize more anti-infantry weapons to negate Freedom Guard infantry advantages.

Players can steal technology from other players, thus negating specific unit advantages and specialty. In order to do this, the player uses an espionage unit called the Infiltrator to steal weapon designs from an enemy Headquarters, the building tasked with producing construction rigs. Once the plans have been successfully stolen, the infiltrator unit is then directed back to the player's HQ to incorporate the new technology in their production options. The Infiltrator may steal as many weapon designs as possible while in the enemy headquarters but risks being exposed the longer the unit stays.

In the campaign missions, the player is given a number of objectives that must be met before victory can be achieved. These victory conditions follow the historical scenario being replayed - for example, a given mission might require the player, as the Freedom Guard, to evacuate or protect a particular unit or structure, or as the Imperium, to destroy those units or prevent their escape.

''Dark Reign'' possesses a complex fog-of-war where line of sight is affected by varying terrain height and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=NG Alphas: Dark Reign |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=24 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1996|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the use of forests for ambushes and limits the effectiveness of recon in densely forested or mountainous areas. Like many RTS titles, structures in the game consume power and do not function if sufficient power is unavailable. Players can 'power down' buildings to keep their bases online, giving greater flexibility in base management. The game also features production queues, and where multiple production facilities of the same type exist, they automatically divide up production, or can be ordered to each focus on particular production queues.

A player can place any number of paths, each with any number of points, and save each one with a unique name. Units on a path can be assigned to patrol it, loop, or travel it once, and units automatically carry out behaviours at each point - for example, a resource collector can be given a path to take it around an enemy base to a water deposit and it will treat this route as its standard resource gathering path. Separate from waypoints, units can be given individual orders such as "search and destroy", "harass", or "scout", allowing them to choose their own targets, engaging and occupying the enemy while freeing up the player to work on more significant strategies or development. These tactics can be controlled further with the use of individually customisable AI settings for every unit, allowing the player to set unit pursuit range, damage tolerance (how quickly the unit will seek healing / repairs and flee combat), and independence (how far the unit will stray from orders in order to engage attackers or targets of opportunity). These can be set individually for every unit, and the default setting can be changed, eliminating the need to change every unit if a unified strategy calls for particular settings.

== Development history ==

''Dark Reign'' began life as a game called ''Corporation: Offworld''. Developed by Auran's co-founder Greg Lane, ''Corporation: Offworld'' and its sister game entitled ''Wild West'' were demonstrated to Activision in June 1996 and a deal signed shortly thereafter. Auran continued development of the Tactics Engine under Greg Lane while Activision layered a new story on top of ''Corporation: Offworld'' and ''Dark Reign'' was born. Many of the units, and the unit AI, innovative tile-blending system, map systems, production systems and real time line of sight were already present in ''Corporation: Offworld'' when it was first demonstrated to Activision in 1996.

On January 23, 2013, Magnetar Games released ''Dark Reign Redux'', an adapted port of the original ''Dark Reign'', on [[Xbox Live Indie Games]]. The projected originally started as a fan remake, until it got licensed and approved by Activison. The game contains all twelve missions of the main game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Activision Goes Indie with Dark Reign on Xbox Live [Update]|url=http://kotaku.com/5880157/activision-goes-indie-with-dark-reign-on-xbox-live|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiegamemag.com/activision-approve-fan-release-of-dark-reign-redux/&lt;/ref&gt;
It looks to be later taken down by Magnetar Games as the result of licensing negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;http://xboxforums.create.msdn.com/forums/t/111847.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== User-created content ==

The Construction Kit shipped with the game allows the creation of anything from multiplayer / skirmish maps to full-fledged campaigns. Tools supplied with it allow for custom-created AI profiles to be created easily and scripted events to be implemented. As a result, there was a large community and several mods, including total conversions such as 'Edge Of Darkness', which added two new races and a host of new units and strategies.

== Expansion packs ==
[[File:DR RotS Boxart.jpg|thumb|right|''Rise of the Shadowhand'' cover art.]]
''Dark Reign: Rise of the Shadowhand'' was released on March 31, 1998. The expansion includes a new campaign, along with new maps and terrains. It also features two new sides, Xenite and Shadowhand, resulting in a total of four playable factions. Each of the new factions contain its own unique units and buildings which expand upon what was available via the original factions, with the Shadowhand including and expanding upon Imperium units and buildings from the original game, and with the Xenite do the same for the Freedom Guard.

''Battles of the Outer Rim'' was released in 1998. It was developed by Macmillan Digital Publishing USA.

Edizione e commento|publisher=Longo|year=2014|isbn=978-88-8063-791-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian [[Renaissance dance|Renaissance]] dancing master. He became a very popular teacher with his students – most notably [[Antonio Cornazzano]] and [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] – who both later became successful dance masters. At a time between 
1452 and 1463 he received the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].

==Biography==
Piacenza was born in [[Piacenza]], Northern Italy in around 1400,&lt;ref name="oxref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095725664|title=Domenico da Piacenza|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first dancing master.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Western-dance/Court-dances-and-spectacles#ref384795|title=Court dances and spectacles|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching dance in around 1440 and is believed to have taught elements of dramatic mime and elaborate dance.&lt;ref name="oxref"/&gt; He taught future dance masters Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro.&lt;ref name="dancemaster"/&gt; 

He moved from Piacenza to [[Ferrara]] during [[Leonello d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Leonello d'Este]]'s tenure as marquis of the city between 1441 and 1450.&lt;ref name="treccani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/domenico-da-piacenza_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Domineco da Piacenza|language=Italian|publisher=Treccani, Italian culture|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1452 and 1463 Piacenza  received the [[Order of the Golden Spur]], and is believed to have been knighted by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. In April 1455 he composed a dance for the wedding between Tristano

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33343">[[File:EMI 2001.jpg|thumb|EMI 2001s on their last day in [[British National Studios|BBC Elstree]] Studio C in July 1991. The last programme in the world to use EMI 2001s to record images was ''[[EastEnders]]'']]

The '''[[EMI]] 2001 Broadcast studio camera''' was an early, very successful British made [[Video camera tube#Plumbicon|Plumbicon]] [[television studio|studio]] [[camera]] that included the [[photographic lens|lens]] within the body of the camera. Four 30&amp;nbsp;mm tubes allowed one tube to be dedicated solely to producing a relatively high resolution monochrome signal, with the other three tubes each providing red, green or blue signals. Even though [[semiconductor]]s were used in most of the camera, the highly sensitive head amplifiers still used [[Vacuum tube|thermionic valve]]s in the first generation of the design.

== Background ==
Integrating the lens within the body of the camera had both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, it meant the optical [[nodal point]] of the camera was close to the centre of gravity, which could make operation easier and more instinctive when used on movable camera mounts such as pedestals. The downside was that lens manufacturers were limited to which lenses they could adapt to fit to the camera. This made the 2001 less attractive for outside broadcasts.

The 2001 was both heavy and large. The pull-out handles at each corner needed four people to safely move the camera with the lens in place. It also required a separate remote camera control unit and the cable connecting the two was over 2&amp;nbsp;inches thick. The standard [[servomechanism|servo]]-controlled studio [[zoom lens]] had a 5 to 50° horizontal angle of view, with a minimum focus distance of either 36&amp;nbsp;inches (J type) or 18&amp;nbsp;inches (K type).

== Production ==
First produced in 1966, by the early 1970s almost all of [[BBC Television]]'s studios and many [[outside broadcast]] (OB) units were equipped with the 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Ellis,|last2=Nick|first2=Hall,|date=2018-04-11|title=ADAPT|url=https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v2|journal=figshare|language=en-US|doi=10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several ITV companies purchased or leased the camera including [[Thames Television]], [[Yorkshire Television]], [[Associated Television]]/[[Central Independent Television]], [[Granada Television|Granada]], [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]], [[Anglia Television|Anglia]] and [[London Weekend Television]]. Independent outfits such as the early [[cable television]] stations [[Rediffusion|Rediffusion Cablevision]], [[Sheffield Cablevision]] and the educational television arm of the [[Inner London Education Authority]] also purchased the camera.

Although there was no predicted lifespan for the camera, the heavy hot-running four-tube design was considered somewhat outdated even when it was new, which contributed to the camera's near-total failure to sell to broadcasters outside the UK. Furthermore, when EMI closed-down the Broadcast Equipment Division in the late 1970s, studios were deprived of technical and spares support for their cameras.   Consequently, several ITV companies began replacing them in the late-1970s with the last commercial operators (Thames &amp; Central) both phasing them out in 1986 (in the main, Central had disposed of them in 1984, however they were used for continuity and presentation from their Birmingham operation until 1986). However the BBC kept a number of such cameras in operation at [[BBC Television Centre]], their various regional outposts and their [[BBC Elstree Centre]] for some years afterwards, the last being at Elstree until July 1991; they were kept running by "cannibalising" identical cameras left behind by Central when the BBC purchased Elstree from them in 1984 as well as BBC EMI 2001s disposed of in previous years.

In 1963, prior to the development of the 2001, an experimental four tube camera&lt;ref&gt;Summers B., “European and American Television Cameras”, http://www.tvcameramuseum.org – EMI experimental Colour Camera 1963, data sheet&lt;/ref&gt; was constructed  by EMI engineers.  This experimental camera had been inspired by RCA's new four tube camera, the [[RCA TK-42|TK-42]],&lt;ref&gt;”RCA unveils new four-color tv camera”, Broadcasting March 19th 1962, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; and used the same tube arrangement, i.e. a 4½&amp;nbsp;inch image [[Orthicon]] tube in the [[luminance (video)|luminance channel]] and three 1” [[Vidicon]] tubes in the colour channels. In addition, the experimental camera had an integrally mounted Varotal III [[zoom lens]]. It was demonstrated to the BBC in 1964&lt;ref name = Wood&gt;Wood C.B.B., “Comparison Between Three Colour Television Cameras”, BBC Tech Rep T-132, (1964/53).&lt;/ref&gt; where it received a mixed reception. Pictures from the camera had disappointing [[colorimetry]], but sharp luminance detail.

A production version of this camera was planned, the EMI 2000, but this camera was never built. Instead, EMI opted to use the newly available Plumbicon tubes&lt;ref&gt;Stupp E.H., Levitt R.S., “the Plumbicon”, Chapter 14, Photoelectronic Imaging Devices, ed. Biberman &amp; Nudelman, Plenum Press, N.Y., 1971, pp. 275 – 300&lt;/ref&gt; supplied by Philips, in its new camera, the EMI 2001.&lt;ref name = James1&gt;James I.J.P. James, Perkins D.G.., Pyke P.J., Taylor E.W., Kent D.E., Fairbairn I.A., “The EMI Four-Tube Colour Television Camera”, Radio and Electronic Engineer, Vol 39, No. 5, May 1970, pp.249 – 270.&lt;/ref&gt;   After successful trials, production quantities of this camera became available only just in time for the launch of the BBC's colour television service, in 1967. (The BBC also purchased cameras from other suppliers, namely the Marconi Mk VII four-tube cameras,&lt;ref name = 4-Plumbicon&gt;”Four Plumbicon Colour Camera”, Wireless World, Feb. 1966, pp.58-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill W.T., “Color Television Cameras having a Luminance Tube and Color Tubes”, US Patent 3,495,029, Feb 1970, first filed Feb 1966&lt;/ref&gt; which were used in the weather, news and presentation studios in Television Centre, and Philips' LDK3 three-tube cameras&lt;ref&gt;Breimer H., Holm W., Tan S.L., “A television camera with “Plumbicon” camera tubes”, Philips Tech. Rev. Vol. 28, No. 11,1967, pp. 336 – 351&lt;/ref&gt; mainly used for outside broadcasts).
 
When sold abroad, the EMI 2001 was carried under the [[Thomson SA]] brand – hence "Thomson TH.T 2001". How this came about is unknown as EMI and Thomson SA did not have business links.

The Thomson 2001's, like the EMI's, also used Plumbicons; however, due to a brochure which was printed in [[French language|French]], it was presumed that they used [[Vidicon]] tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcasting101.ws/france-thomson20.jpg Cover brochure for Thomson TH.T 2001, which indicated use of "Vidicon à oxyde de plomb" - French for "lead oxide Vidicon" which was technically what Plumbicons were] (from Broadcasting101.ws site)&lt;/ref&gt; But, apart from the silver viewfinder squares (instead of white) and the brand name change on the front and sides, the cameras &lt;!--which? The EMI 2001 and the Thomson? Or the 2000 and the Thomson? or all three? --&gt; were the same.

In the [[United States]], the cameras were marketed by [[International Video Corporation]] as the IVC/EMI 2001-B (four tubes), with another version, the IVC/EMI 2001-C, consisting of three tubes.&lt;ref&gt;”IVC displays recorders and EMI color camera”, Broadcasting, Feb 24, 1969, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Broadcast Engineering]]'' magazine, May 1969, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvcameramuseum.org/ivc/ivc_thumbnails.htm  Museum of the Broadcast Television Camera] (IVC page).&lt;/ref&gt;  Only one U.S. station is known to have purchased the 2001: [[WSNS-TV]] in [[Chicago]], in the early years of its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/index.php?c=3926  WSNS Channel 44 - ''Al Lerner Sports'' - "So Long..." (Part 1, 1971)]. From [[The Museum of Classic Chicago Television]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==

=== EMI's experimental 4-tube camera ===

EMI engineers visited the United States in 1963, in order to view RCA's new four-tube colour camera, the TK42.&lt;ref name = Hirsch &gt;Hirsch C.J., “Four Tube, Separate Luminance Color Television Camera”, RCA Broadcast News, Vol. 133, April 1967, pp. 30-47&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following this visit, EMI Research Labs. embarked on a program to build an experimental camera using the same format. The construction took only six weeks of intensive effort, aided by the cannibalization of parts from existing EMI cameras. Items were taken from an EMI Type 203 image [[Orthicon]] monochrome studio camera,&lt;ref&gt;Summers B., “European and American Television cameras”, http://www.tvcameramuseum.org  - EMI 203 data&lt;/ref&gt; for the luminance channel, and a Type 204 industrial colour camera,&lt;ref&gt;Summers B., European and American Television Cameras”,  http://www.tvcameramuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James I.J.P., “A Vidicon Camera for Industrial Colour Television”, Jour. Brit IRE, Mar 1959&lt;/ref&gt; for the colour channels.   This camera contained 3 [[Vidicon]] tubes and a colour-splitting system using plate glass [[dichroic]] mirrors. In addition, a Varotal III zoom lens was integrated into the body of the experimental camera.  The camera was housed in a simple box-shaped structure with  ribs of extruded aluminium and with plain side panels.&lt;ref&gt;Summers B.,”The Museum of the Broadcast TV Camera”, http://www.tvcameramuseum.org - EMI Experimental Colour Camera 1963&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The experimental camera was demonstrated to the BBC in 1963 where it received a mixed reception. At that time, the BBC was evaluating an early Philips 3-tube camera which used some newly available [[Plumbicon]] pick-up tubes.&lt;ref&gt;de Haan E.F., Schampers P.P.M., von Vucht J.H.N., “Method of Manufacturing a Photoresponsive Device Comprising a Photoresponsive PbO Layer”, US Patent 3,372,056, Mar. 5, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breimer H. 1967, p.336"&gt;Breimer H., Holm W., Tan S.L., “A colour television camera with “Plumbicon” camera tubes”, Philips Technical Review, 1967, Vol. 28 No. 11, p.336&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|The Plumbicon tube gave softer, less sharp, pictures than the image orthicon, but it was much smaller. To give acceptable results, this early Philip's camera used a low-pass filter in each channel, to reduce noise, together with crispening circuits&lt;ref&gt;Brown E.F. “A New Crispener Circuit for TV Images”, Jour SMPTE, Vol. 72, Nov. 1963, pp' 849-853&lt;/ref&gt; to improve apparent sharpness.}} It had been set up by BBC engineers to give highly saturated colour pictures and they were unimpressed by the 'tinted' pictures of the EMI camera.  
 
In order to better judge the performance of the then existing cameras, the BBC organized comparison tests between the experimental EMI camera, a Philips camera, and a Marconi three I.O. camera.&lt;ref name = Wood /&gt; In these tests, the [[colorimetry]] of the pictures from the EMI camera compared unfavourably with the other two, but it did give the sharpest pictures.

=== The development of the EMI 2001 ===

In spite of the BBC’s lukewarm reception of the experimental camera EMI persisted with the 4-tube concept, but now using Plumbicon tubes, as suggested by Wood&lt;ref name = Wood /&gt; although there was some delay before the work started. There were several reasons for the delay. Firstly, EMI’s board hesitated to provide the financial investment needed for the project. Secondly, there was indecision regarding where to place the work  but, eventually, the Colour TV Department of the Research Labs. was chosen in preference to the Broadcast Equipment Division (the existing supplier of EMI's monochrome cameras and studio equipment). Thirdly, there was concern regarding the reliability of supply of Plumbicon tubes, as Philips was the only supplier.{{efn-lr|A concern that had some merit because, originally, Philips' management planned to restrict the supply of Plumbicons solely to Philip’s own camera group.&lt;ref&gt;de Vries M.J., “80 Years of Research at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium 1914-1994”, p.171, Pallas Publications, Amsterdam 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}} Fourthly, there were concerns regarding the variable quality standards of the early Plumbicon pick-up tubes, as some tubes were found to produce unstable pictures.&lt;ref name = Wood /&gt; Although most issues with tube quality were quickly resolved by Philips, there remained concerns regarding '[[#Comet tails|comet tails]]' and 'blooming'.

After the  EMI board granted approval for the new camera, in late 1964, work on  it progressed rapidly. The camera was to use four Plumbicon pick-up tubes, to use solid state circuitry, include a zoom lens as standard and to use prism optics. After the late start, the first fully operational prototype was shown to the BBC and others in 1966, only just in time to meet BBC time-scales for the introduction of their new colour service.

Early cameras used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) in the first stages of the head amplifiers but later [[Field-effect transistor|FET]] amplifiers were introduced, such cameras being designated type 2001/1. All other circuitry in the cameras, apart from the pick-up tubes, was solid state.

Sales of the Type 2001 were very successful in the UK. The BBC and many of the independent TV companies installed the cameras in their studios during the rapid expansion of the UK colour services after 1967. However, by the time EMI had fulfilled its UK orders (towards the end of the decade), the boom in the US market had been missed and the European market had yet to fully develop or was already dominated by Philips cameras. In addition, rival companies were already bringing out new designs and EMI now found only a limited market for a camera with a 4-tube configuration.

== 4-tube prism optics ==
[[File:Concept-Proving_4-Tube_Prism.png|thumb|left|Early 'concept prism assembly', where the individual prisms were machined from [[Perspex]]]]
[[File:4-tube_prism,_R-B_plane.png|thumb|Plan view of the system in the plane of the Red-Blue channels]]
[[File:4-tube_prism,_Y-G_plane.png|thumb|Plan view of the system in the plane of the Luminance-Green channels]]

The EMI 2001 used a 4-way prism assembly to split the light into its components, using  the same novel principles that had been developed by Philips for their 3-way splitter.   These new assemblies used the property of total internal reflection, within the prisms, to direct the light to the pick-up tubes.   The techniques were described in a patent first filed in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;de Lang H., Bouwhuis B., “Optical System for a Colour Television Camera”, US Patent 3,202,039, Aug. 24, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; The 3-way prism was also described in a description of the LDE3 camera.&lt;ref name="Breimer H. 1967, p.336"/&gt;

The technique of using a prism assembly in this way was far superior to the earlier light-splitting arrangements, since the prism assembly was neat and compact and reproducibility in manufacture was much improved.   The problems previously experienced with double imaging (common with plate glass dichroic mirrors) were also eliminated.   Furthermore, because of the near-normal incidence of light onto the dichroic surfaces, sensitivity to polarised light was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;de Lang H. &amp; Bouwhuis G.,”Optical System for a Colour Television Camera”, US Patent 3,202,039, Aug 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, EMI chose to use a 4-tube version of the prism splitter for their new colour camera,&lt;ref name = James1 /&gt; in order to retain all the advantages of the method.  However, devising a single prism arrangement for four tubes was less easy than for three and several alternatives were initially considered.

In an early configuration of the prism block, shown in the thumbnail, three of the pick-up tubes were envisaged to be in a common plane, but with the fourth (red) tube sticking up, nearly at right angles to the other three. (This configuration was to be used in the Russian 4-tube camera type KT-116M.&lt;ref&gt;Summers B. “Museum of the Broadcast Television Camera”, Soviet Television Cameras&lt;/ref&gt;)

For the final optical arrangement in the EMI 2001, the 'green' prism was changed to have a fully silvered mirror at about 45 degrees, to deflect the green light sideways, resulting in the final 4-spoke arrangement. (When viewed from the back of a camera the four tubes were seen as a diagonal cross). This optical arrangement defined the cross-section dimensions of the camera (which was not small – 380 x 380&amp;nbsp;mm), but it did allow the zoom lens to be located within the camera body. Also the removal of individual pick-up tubes was possible without any need to remove the scanning coils, as the tube bases were easily accessible at the outer corners

{{-}}

== Zoom lenses for the 2001 ==

Rank [[Taylor Hobson]] declined to offer a [[zoom lens]] for EMI's new camera, claiming they were fully committed elsewhere, but the Angenieux Company (see [[Pierre Angenieux]]) expressed their interest in supplying zoom lenses for the project.   The French company offered two zoom lenses for the camera; the first was a 10:1 zoom for studio use and the second a larger unit for outside broadcasts.   Both could be accommodated within the body of the camera, although the O.B. lens did protrude a little. 
 
To accommodate a 4-way prism splitter, extra distance was needed, from the back of the lens to the image focal plane, when compared to a 3-tube splitter.  This set severe demands for the lens designer, but Angenieux were able to achieve EMI's requirements, provided that field flattening lenses were fitted in front of each pick-up tube.   Early cameras used this arrangement, but with later zoom designs these lenses became unnecessary.

The servo motors and the servo amplifiers were supplied by Evershed Power Optics.&lt;ref&gt;Summers B.,www.tvcameramuseum.org – Evershed&lt;/ref&gt;   The driver amplifiers for the  servo motors were mounted in the camera body alongside the lens.   The servo-driven zoom lens and the associated amplifier circuitry added considerably to the weight of the camera.  In addition, incorporating the servo drivers within the camera body precluded the use of other makes of zoom lens.

=== Benefits of an integral zoom lens ===

The integral zoom lens was a popular feature of the EMI 2001, which was liked by cameramen, and it was sometimes referred to as "the cameraman’s camera".&lt;ref&gt;
“The EMI 2001s were one of the most popular colour cameras for studio and OB use in the UK”,  http://www.vintageradio.co.uk/htm/TVcollection.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”The EMI 2001 Color 4 Tube Camera”, Tech and Trouble, http://techandtrouble.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/the-emi-2001-color-4-tube-camera.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”EMI 2001 'liked by cameramen'”; http://www.golden-agetv.co.uk/equipment.php?TypeID=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Cameraman Malcolm Carr demonstrates the EMI 2001 camera”,  https://vimeo.com/56213499&lt;/ref&gt; With no protruding zoom lens, the studio camera was only 537mm long enabling it to be used in small spaces and to be panned very easily (it had a low moment of inertia).   In addition, pictures produced while panning had a more natural look.  The operational flexibility of the camera was demonstrated in training videos.&lt;ref&gt;David Jones: “EMI 2001 Broadcast Camera Training Video (BBC) Parts 1 &amp; 2”, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGvO29NQ8xs&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the integral zoom lens camera was a popular within the UK, this concept had little influence on designs or sales of cameras elsewhere.   Only Marconi with their small neat Mk VIII&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Most camera manufacturers claimed that a format where the lens protrudes out  in front of the camera gave greater choice of lens supplier and, of course, it was a format that made life easier for camera designers, so the enthusiasm of cameramen for the integral zoom concept was found to have little long term influence on camera designers.   Even EMI abandoned the notion of having an integral zoom lens, with its new camera, the Type 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Summers B.,”Museum of the Broadcast Television Camera/EMI 2005, Brochure”, http://www.tvcameramuseum.org/emi/2005brocissue1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which had a format reminiscent of the very earliest Philip’s experimental camera (with its three horizontally configured tubes)&lt;ref&gt;Summers B.,”Philips 1963 experimental colour television camera”, Museum of the Broadcast Television Camera,  http://www.tvcameramuseum.org/philips/expcol-1963/p1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transistor circuits – the ring-of-three ==
[[File:Ring_of_Three_circuit.png|thumb|Ring-of-three amplifier circuit]]

The circuitry in the 2001 was all solid state apart from the pick-up tubes and, in the early cameras, the first stage of the head amplifiers.   The circuitry made extensive use of the 'ring-of-three' amplifier configuration, shown simplified in the figure. This circuit was easily adapted for various uses.

In the normal, non-inverting mode, the bottom of resistor R2 is grounded and the input is via V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;(1). In this mode, the amplifier behaves somewhat like a 'current feedback amplifier'.&lt;ref&gt;Analog Devices, MT-034 Tutorial, “AD846 Current Feedback Op Amp”, (1988), http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/tutorials/MT-034.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The circuit maintains its bandwidth as the gain is increased (by reducing R2), unlike a conventional voltage feedback op. amp.&lt;ref&gt;Karki J., “Voltage Feedback Vs Current Feedback Op Amps, Application Report”, Texas Instr., Dallas, Texas, Lecture Number SLVA051, Nov. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit has a '[[virtual ground|virtual earth]]' point at 'A' so that inverting or summing amplifiers are possible. In this mode, the base of TR1 is grounded and the input is via V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;(2) and the series resistor R2.

== Band defining linear phase filters ==
[[File:Camera_LPFs.png|thumb|Band defining filter circuits]]
The EMI 2001 used band defining filters in all four channels. For the colour channels and narrow-band luminance, the low-pass filters had a Gaussian shaped pass-band&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg L., “Network Analysis and Synthesis”, McGraw-Hill, N.Y. 1962, pp. 499, 619&lt;/ref&gt; and, although such filters were not ‘sharp-cut’, they were linear phase and gave negligible overshoots on transients. The wide-band luminance channel had its bandwidth defined by a linear phase low pass filter with a 3&amp;nbsp;dB cut-off at 6.8&amp;nbsp;MHz.   Its design follows the [[lattice filter]] methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillemin E.A., “Communication Networks, Vol. 2”, Wiley, N.Y., 1935, p.412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camera_LPFs_-_Responses.png|thumb|Band defining filter responses]]
The amplitude responses of the two filters are shown below.   Also shown are the phase deviations of the two filters from the linear phase/frequency characteristic, given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi (f) = -6.36 \times 10^{-5} \times f &lt;/math&gt; 
where ‘f’ is the frequency in Hz and {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}(f) is in degrees.   At low frequencies, the propagation delays of the two filters are both the same (177 ns, approximately).

==Generating the image==
The composite signals of the [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems are made up of a wideband luminance signal and two narrow-band colour difference signals containing B-Y and R-Y. If a band-limited version of the signal from the luminance tube is used to derive the colour difference signals, without modification, then colour errors would occur. This is because the luminance characteristic expected by the colour processing must be made up in a particular way, using specific proportions of red, green and blue, whereas the signal form the luminance tube has a more general monochromatic characteristic akin to that from a conventional black and white camera. In addition, the application of gamma correction to the signals further complicates the situation (display tubes have, approximately, a square law characteristic with γ ≈ 2.2).

As shown below, it is beneficial, but not sufficient, to shape the luminance response to simulate that of the NTSC (PAL or SECAM) luminance characteristic (by, for example, placing an optical filter in front of the luminance tube to pass light with the required luminosity function,&lt;ref name = Hirsch /&gt; or by a special dichroic surface which reflects light to the luminance tube with the required luminosity function&lt;ref name = 4-Plumbicon /&gt;).

For a basic 3-colour system the wideband luminance signal (Y'), for NTSC, PAL and SECAM, is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Fink D.G., “Television Standards”, Television Engineering Handbook, (Ed. Fink D.J.), Chapter 2, McGraw Hill 1957, pp. 2-1 to 2-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazda F.F.(ed.) “Colour Television Principles”, Butterworths, 1989, Section 53.9.2, pp.53/10 to 53/12&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;Y' = 0.3R^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} + 0.59G^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} + 0.11B^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a separate luminance tube, with appropriate spectral shaping, the output signal (Y) is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;Y = 0.3R + 0.59G + 0.11B &lt;/math&gt;

which when gamma-corrected gives:
: &lt;math&gt;Y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} = (0.3R +0.59G + 0.11B)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;  does not equal &lt;math&gt; Y' &lt;/math&gt; except when R = G =  B, which corresponds to neutral (grey) tones.

When deriving the two narrowband colour difference signals containing R&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and  B&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; , a bandlimited version of the luminance signal (y') is required, namely:
: &lt;math&gt;y' = 0.3R_N^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} + 0.59G_N^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} + 0.11B_N^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;

but the band limited signal from the luminance tube is:
: &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} = (0.3R_N +0.59G_N + 0.11B_N)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;

As before, &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;  does not equal &lt;math&gt; y' &lt;/math&gt;.   If the gamma corrected luminance signal &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt; is simply used instead of y'  then colour errors result which can be appreciable for saturated colours.

In the EMI 2001 a process known as Delta-L Correction&lt;ref name = James1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sproson W.N., Colorimetric Aspects of 3- and 4-Tube Colour Television Cameras”, Jour. Colour Group No.10, July 1967, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; is used to overcome this problem.

A band-limited luminance difference correction signal, ΔL is formed, where:
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta L = y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}- y'&lt;/math&gt;
 
This narrowband signal is used to correct the wideband luminance channel at low frequencies, so the monchrome signal transmitted becomes:
: &lt;math&gt;Y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} - \Delta L = Y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} - (y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}- y')&lt;/math&gt;

With this corrected luminance signal, the correct colour rendition is obtained,  whilst still retaining the sharp luminance detail of a 4-tube camera.   The narrowband R, G and B signals are gamma corrected and applied to a suitable matrixing circuit, to derive the correction.   With grey scale scenes &lt;math&gt;y^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; y' &lt;/math&gt; and the signal reverts to that of the luminance tube only.

==Comet tails==
=== Comet tails and blooming ===

“Blooming” refers to the situation where bright areas in a picture 'bleed' into adjacent dark areas, with a consequential loss of picture sharpness and detail.&lt;ref name = Lent&gt;Lent S.J., “Pickup Tubes and Solid-state Cameras”, TV &amp; Video Engineers Reference Book, ed. Jackson K.G. and Townsend G.B., Butterworth-Heinmann Ltd., 1991, p. 10/3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon D., “Machine Vision”, Chapter 2, Prentice Hall 1991, pp. 25-26, http://homepage.inf/ed.ac.uk/rbf/BOOKS/VERNON/Chap002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Bloom”, Unity Manual,   https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Bloom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The condition leads to “comet-tails”&lt;ref name = Lent /&gt; which streak across a picture, following moving highlights.

The pictures from early Plumbicon cameras were susceptible to comet tails and blooming and, although these effects had not been a major concern in the previous generation of cameras, which employed vidicon or image orthicon tubes, they were an annoying feature of Plumbicon tubes.

The problems arose when the beam current of a pick-up tube was insufficient to fully discharge the target in very bright areas of an image. Reducing the target voltage and increasing the beam current of the pick-up tube helped to mitigate the problem but, with early Plumbicons, this resulted in loss of resolution and increased lag.&lt;ref name  = Wood /&gt;

This problem with Plumbicon tubes was already of concern in the early 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Redmond J., Morse D.R., Wood C.B.B, “The Plumbicon Camera Tube”, BBC Report T-148, (1965/21)&lt;/ref&gt; and all the early plumbicon cameras suffered from it,&lt;ref&gt;Summers B.,www.tvcameramuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt; including the EMI 2001.&lt;ref&gt;”Tech and Trouble, the EMI Color 4 Tube Camera” http://techandtrouble.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/the-emi-2001-color-4-tube-camera.html        
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”EMI 2001”  http://www.vintageradio.co.uk/htm/TVcollection.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With separate mesh tubes there was some improvement, because higher beam currents could be used without loss of resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Lubszynski H.C. And Wardley j, “Some Problems of Resolution in Low-Velocity Camera Tubes”, IEE Conf. Report, Series No. 5, Paper 4006-E, June 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Some cameras introduced anti comet-tail circuits to provide dynamic correction, when an overload was sensed (ACT circuits), but these were not used in the EMI 2001.

The problem was not satisfactorily resolved until the late 1960s when an extra ‘anti-comet-tail’ gun was introduced into plumbicon tubes.&lt;ref&gt;van Roosmalen J.H.T.   “Suppression of Comettail Effect, US patent 3,548,250, 1970, first filed in Netherlands 6802062, Feb. 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Roosmalen J.H.T., “Adjustable Saturation in a Pick-up Tube with Linear Light Transfer Characteristic”, Advances in Electronics and Electron Physics, Vol. 28, Part A, 1969, pp.281-288&lt;/ref&gt; New camera designs, produced in the 1970s, were able to include the new improved tubes, and usually did so.    Some 2001 cameras were modified to take the new tubes, but it was a difficult retrofit procedure, because of the complexity of the additional circuitry.

=== ACT and the EMI 2001/1 ===

As supplied by EMI, the 2001 and the later 2001/1, did not have any form of ACT (anti-comet tail) or HOP (highlight overload protection). This is why its performance was poor, in this respect, when compared with the next generation of cameras supplied in the 1970s. None of the first generation of true broadcast cameras in the middle to late 1960s had ACT, so the EMI 2001 was not unusual.

When observing old programmes, such as those from the 2001, it is very easy to tell if a programme used EMI 2001s (or any other first-generation PAL colour camera) to capture the images as the comet tails would often be coloured "blobs" or "splodges" (usually caused by a light source or light reflecting off a highly reflective or polished surface) simply because the camera did not have ACT circuits.

Some broadcasters modified their cameras to have ACT, but retro fitting ACT/HOP was not an easy modification as 4 new HOP camera tubes would be needed, the tube bases, wiring harness, 4 head amplifiers and 4 video amplifiers and the tube beam current boards would all have needed work done to them. ACT and HOP works by using an extra electrode in the tube to 'flood discharge' the target during the flyback period. Great care was needed in setting up the HOP voltages as damage to the tube’s emission could occur. Once fitted, the ACT circuits were adjusted so that the Comet Tail doesn't appear as a "blob". &lt;br&gt;
Even when ACT circuits had been retro-fitted, comet tails would sometimes occur, consisting of either a mix of two separate colours, one colour inside the other (e.g. a comet tail that is red with a smaller comet tail inside that one that may be green), or the comet tail may be a non primary colour, such as pink.  The problems occurred when the settings of the ACT circuits were not well matched.

==Gameplay==
Players assume the role of an [[air traffic controller]] at an extremely busy airport. The airport features a runway for large red jets, a runway for small yellow planes and a helipad for blue helicopters.  Players draw paths along the field to direct each aircraft to its designated landing zone. Each successfully landed aircraft scores the player one point, and as the player's score increases, so does the number of aircraft that will appear on the screen simultaneously. The game ends when two or more aircraft collide. Players receive a high score for the most planes landed, which can be uploaded to online leaderboards using Firemint's cloudcell technology as well as to those in the iOS [[Game Center]].  The 1.2 version update includes four additional types of aircraft and two new stages (a beach and an aircraft carrier).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdgreen.co.uk/blog/?p=51 Coastal or Carrier: Flight Control 1.2 Update]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.3 version update includes the use of [[Bluetooth]] to enable multiplayer via a second device. The 1.5 update includes a new [[Outback|Australian Outback]] map which includes airplanes from the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]] that cannot be redirected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justanothermobilemonday.com/Wordpress/2009/09/11/firemint-honors-australias-royal-flying-doctor-service-with-flight-control-update/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Update 1.7, released on May 11, 2010, completely overhauls the graphical engine to add higher quality animations and more vibrant detail to the game.  For fans of the Flight Control theme song, the 1.7 update extends the length of the title screen melody.  A new fast forward feature called 'Safe Fast Forward' has also been included.  Safe Fast Forward slows the game down to normal speed when a plane crash is imminent, allowing the player more time to prevent it.  'Windy Airfield' is a newly added airfield which only allows the player to land planes on runways that face into the wind.  Runways that face the same direction as the wind are closed until the wind changes.  A windsock indicates which direction the wind is coming from.  The latest update brings the playable runway total to five.

==Sales==
''Flight Control'' has been the number one downloaded paid application in over 20 countries. It has sold over 3.8 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://firemint.com/2011/flight-control-in-all-time-top-paid-iphone-apps-list/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Flight Control'' has received generally positive reviews. [[IGN]] gave the game 8 out of 10, praising its long lasting gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/968/968376p1.html IGN Review]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pocket Gamer]] also gave the game 8 out of 10, complimenting, "if you could put Flight Control in a needle, it'd be considered a Class A drug. That's how simple and addictive it is."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Flight+Control/review.asp?c=12348 Pocket Gamer Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
On March 15, 2012, Firemint, now a part of [[EA]], released ''[[Flight Control Rocket]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flight-control-rocket/id498136115?mt=8 App Store - Flight Control Rocket]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gibraltar Regulatory Authority''' (GRA) was established by the [[Gibraltar]] Regulatory Act in October 2000. The GRA is the statutory body in Gibraltar responsible for regulating electronic communications. This includes [[telecommunications]], [[radio]] communications and [[broadcasting]] transmissions. The GRA serves as both the national supervisory and regulatory authority for these sectors. The supervision and regulation of these sectors is done in accordance with [[European Union|EU]] [[law]] that has been rendered into national law.&lt;ref name="GRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gra.gi/index.php?site=communications|title=Foreword from the Chief Executive Officer|publisher=GRA|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inception the GRA has seen its responsibilities extended to [[data protection]] and, for a time, [[gambling]].

== Electronic Communication ==

The GRA attempts to enhance competition in the communications sector by regulating network access to develop effective choice for business and residential consumers alike and by helping the facilitate entry to the communications market through authorisations and licences.&lt;ref name="GRA" /&gt;

The GRA policy is designed to make Gibraltar recognizable as a world-class telecommunications centre to do business. As well as ensuring that Gibraltar has a high quality telecommunications service that offers consumers a better deal by providing high performance and standards, as well as competitive prices.&lt;ref name="GRA" /&gt;

The Communications remit of the GRA includes: traditional [[telephone wire]], dial up and [[ADSL]] [[internet]], [[mobile operators]] providing voice and data services, [[VOIP]] services, [[television]] and radio, radio communications including fixed wireless services, and licensing frameworks for [[satellite]] services.&lt;ref name="GRA" /&gt;

== Data Protection ==

The Gibraltar [[Government]] nominated the GRA as the Supervisory Authority for the enforcement of the Data Protection Act 2004. With the powers imbued upon the Data Protection Commissioner, the GRA has made assurances that a system is in place to monitior the executory function of the Data Protection Act. The GRA works closely with foreign regulatory authorities tasked with a similar role. The GRA also continuously develops a comprehensive online guide that is designed to encompass the wealth of information available about Data Protection.&lt;ref name="GRADP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gra.gi/index.php?site=dataprotection |title=Data Protection|publisher=GRA|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Ginger Kids'''" is the eleventh episode in the [[South Park (season 9)|ninth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 136th episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 9, 2005. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/103676/ |title=Ginger Kids (Season 9, Episode 11) - Full Episode Player |publisher=South Park Studios |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It caused controversy after its ironic premise was misunderstood by people who acted violently against redheads.

In the episode, Cartman suffers from a mysterious and sudden onset of Gingervitus. Sick and tired of being ridiculed for his red hair, light skin and freckles, he rallies all the ginger kids everywhere to fight against discrimination and rise up and become the master race they are intended to be.

==Plot==
For a class presentation, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] delivers a [[hate speech]], against what he calls "gingers": people with [[red hair]], [[freckle]]s, and pale skin due to a disease called "Gingervitis". He describes them as being disgusting, inhuman, unable to survive in sunlight, and having no souls. When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] points out that he too has red hair, Cartman says that there is a second class of redheads, the "[[Blade (comics)#Daywalker|daywalkers]]", who have red hair but not pale skin and freckles.

In Kyle's attempt to prove Cartman wrong, he decides to do a presentation countering Cartman's facts, arguing that being a "ginger kid" is an inheritable trait. To prove this, Kyle and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] visit a family who have redhead children. To their shock, the parents of the Ginger kids, who each carry a recessive gene that has caused them to have Ginger kids, possess the same prejudice towards Ginger kids as Cartman. The father of the Ginger kids informs Kyle that marrying an Asian woman ensures that the recessive gene is not passed down, and mentions a friend who is marrying an Asian woman for that reason. When Kyle makes his presentation, Cartman stands up for his claims and uses Biblical references, alleging that [[Judas Iscariot]] was a Ginger. As a result, Cartman's speech causes a new-found prejudice towards Ginger kids in the school. The gingers are treated as outcasts and forced to eat in the hallway rather than the cafeteria. Stan, Kyle, and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] agree that they need to teach Cartman a lesson.

At night, the three sneak into Cartman's room and use skin bleach to make his skin pale, dye his hair red, and put [[Henna]] tattoos of freckles on his face. Cartman wakes up in the morning to discover that he now has the disease "gingervitis" and has become a Ginger himself. Cartman is taken to the doctor, who turns out to be prejudiced himself and soon insults him, even suggesting that Mrs. Cartman have him [[Euthanasia|put down]], which she considers. At school, Cartman is laughed at by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and faces discrimination from the very people he himself convinced to despise Gingers. He is forced to join the gingers in eating in the hallway despite his attempts to convince them that he is still who he was. In response to this, Cartman establishes the "Ginger Separatist Movement" to promote the better aspects of being ginger.

Initially peaceful, Cartman's movement quickly becomes violent and [[Nazi]]-esque in tone, arguing that Gingers are a "great race", though when he tries to name a successful "ginger", the gingers are forced to simply declare themselves as being like "[[Ron Howard]]… and others." He and his organization start holding protests, including beating up a brunette who played [[Little Orphan Annie|Annie]], for playing a redhead but not actually being one. Eventually, Cartman convinces the Ginger kids to decide to kill all the town's non-gingers by telling them "The only way to fight hate… is with MORE hate!"

An hour before dawn, the boys decide to sneak into Cartman's room and change him back to his original appearance. However, on their way over to his house, Ginger kids start to creep out of seemingly nowhere and follow them. At first, though terrified, the boys try to ignore them and decide to go home. Kenny is suddenly snatched away, prompting Kyle and Stan to break into a run. Meanwhile, children across the town are abducted from their homes by the Ginger kids. Eventually, Stan and Kyle are the only ones left. They lock themselves in a barn for protection but the Ginger kids break in and capture them both.

All the non-gingers are taken to the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton Hotel, complete with a lava pit and refreshment buffet. They are all imprisoned in cages and will be chosen for sacrifice one by one.

"Daywalker" Kyle is chosen as the first. Cartman states a "half-ginger" is much worse than one with no such trait. However, he asks that before he dies, he say something private to Cartman. Kyle whispers in Cartman's ear that he is not in fact a "ginger". Now thinking only of self-preservation, he realizes that if his own cult were to learn of his true physical identity he too would die with every other non-"ginger kid" of the town. Cartman pretends to have had an epiphany that everyone should live in harmony and peace since Kyle's speech, then gets everyone to sing a song about how the different races should live together in peace. As the non-gingers are freed, an annoyed Kyle calls Cartman a "manipulative asshole" for his hypocrisy. Cartman gleefully responds "Yes, but I'm not going to die".

==Production==
On the DVD commentary for "Ginger Kids", [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] said that they had wanted to do an episode about ginger kids for a long time, though did not initially know what to do for it. Parker and Stone were inspired to create the episode by a billboard that they saw in England while promoting the show. The billboard read "Only you can prevent ginger" and had a picture of a redheaded girl. Parker and Stone did a lot of research to ensure that there was some truth to the whole story, rather than it being purely fictional.&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] DVD commentary for "Ginger Kids".&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Kyle has red hair introduced some difficulties during production. Parker and Stone felt that they needed to distinguish Kyle from the other redheaded kids because the character does not associate with them. Also, it had already been established that Kyle did indeed have red hair, thus making it more necessary to give an explanation as to why he was not like the other gingers. They eventually settled on the idea that there were true redheaded gingers, like the ones Cartman starts associating with, and "daywalkers", people like Kyle with red hair but no freckles or light skin.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;

In the episode, a man tells Stan and Kyle "If you really don't want to have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene. I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason." This is an intentional reference to Parker doing the same thing in real life. He once had a girlfriend whose mother had red hair, and ended the relationship to avoid having redheaded children, and even admitted to harboring what he described as racial prejudice against gingers. He later married Emma Sugiyama, a Japanese woman.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eames, Tom (March 22, 2013). [http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a467749/south-parks-trey-parker-to-become-a-dad-for-first-time.html "'South Park's Trey Parker to become a dad for first time"].

''[[New York Magazine]]''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The episode supposedly inspired "Kick a Ginger Day" in 2013 at [[Wingfield Academy]] in Rotherham, Yorkshire, where red-headed students faced discrimination based on their hair color. Parents of the discriminated students launched a Facebook group protesting the offending students in an attempt to end the bullying. One mother pulled her 13-year-old son from the school until she could be assured that the discrimination would stop, saying "My son rang me and said kids were kicking him, saying it was National Kick a Ginger Kid Day. He was scared so I went to get him out of school." One father was disgusted with the way students treated his 13-year-old daughter based on her hair color, and reported that she received bruised legs from beatings, stating "She should be able to go to school without having to worry about being kicked in the corridor." School staff "strongly reprimanded" the offending students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forte|first=Daniela|title='Kick a Ginger Day' inspired by 'South Park' becomes reality at Litchfield High School|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10387636/Kick-a-Ginger-Kid-Day-leads-to-attacks-on-schoolchildren.html|accessdate=March 29, 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school spokesperson declared the incidents "deplorable acts" and stated that the entire institution was warned that students who continued such discrimination would also be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter|title=Police called in to school over 'kick a ginger kid day'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/18/police-called-school-kick-ginger-day|accessdate=December 8, 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schoenberg - Fourth String Quartet - Hauptstimme &amp; nebenstimme mm.27-31.png|thumb|350px|{{Lang|de|Hauptstimme}} (first violin) and {{Lang|de|Nebenstimme}} (viola) marked in Arnold Schoenberg's [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|Fourth String Quartet]], [[Bar (music)|mm.]]&amp;nbsp;27–31.&lt;ref&gt;Haimo, Ethan (1990). ''Schoenberg's Serial Odyssey'', p. 38. {{ISBN|0-19-816352-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Schoenberg - Fourth String Quartet - Hauptstimme &amp; nebenstimme mm.27-31.mid|Play}}]]

In [[music]], '''{{Lang|de|Hauptstimme}}''' (German for ''primary voice'') or '''{{Lang|de|Hauptsatz}}''' is the main [[melody|voice]], chief [[part (music)|part]]; i.e., the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] or [[melodic]] line of primary importance, in opposition to '''{{Lang|de|Nebenstimme}}'''. {{Lang|de|Nebenstimme}} (German for ''secondary voice'') or '''{{Lang|de|Seitensatz}}''' is the secondary part; i.e., a secondary contrapuntal or melodic part, always occurring simultaneously with, and subsidiary to, the {{Lang|de|Hauptstimme}}. The practice of marking the primary voice within the musical score/parts was invented by [[Arnold Schoenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read]] (1979). "Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice" 2nd ed., p. 282-283. {{ISBN|0-8008-5459-4}}, 0-8008-5453-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms are used primarily by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Alban Berg]], and [[Anton Webern]], but are not uncommon in scores for string quartet. They are commonly indicated in [[Sheet music|musical score]]s with the marks "H" and "N".&lt;ref&gt;Bryn-Julson, Phyllis and Mathews, Paul (2009). ''Inside [[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', p. 24. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-6205-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the "primary voice" ends in one instrument/staff/part, it may be marked with a closing bracket (such as  ¬ ) at the point where it passes to another instrument/staff/part.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner Read (1979). "Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice" 2nd ed., p. 283. {{ISBN|0-8008-5459-4}}, 0-8008-5453-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further contrapuntal lines or material may be considered [[accompaniment]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno, Theodor W.]]; Brand, Juliane; and Hailey, Christopher (1991). ''Alban Berg, Master of the Smallest Link'', p. 97. {{ISBN|978-0-521-33884-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of the terms' use include [[lead vocals|lead]] and [[back up vocals]], melody and counter-melody.

In a footnote to a musical score, Schoenberg wrote, "The human [[singing|voice]] is always {{Lang|de|Hauptstimme}} [when present]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Leinsdorf|Leinsdorf, Erich]] (1982). ''The Composer's Advocate'', p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0-300-02887-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter-melody==
[[Image:Primary and secondary melody BWV 1079, m.1-3.png|300px|thumb|Primary and secondary melody in Bach's [[BWV 1079]]&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce, and Marilyn Nadine Saker (2009). ''Music in Theory and Practice'' Vol. 1, p.138. Seventh edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Primary and secondary melody BWV 1079, m.1-3.mid|Play}}]]

In [[music]], a '''counter-melody''' (often '''countermelody''') is a sequence of [[Musical note|note]]s, perceived as a melody, written to be played simultaneously with a more prominent lead [[melody]]: a secondary melody played in [[counterpoint]] with the primary melody. A counter-melody performs a subordinate role, and is typically heard in a [[musical texture|texture]] consisting of a melody plus [[accompaniment]].

In marches, the counter melody is often given to the [[trombone]]s  or [[french horn|horns]] (American composer [[David Wallis Reeves]] is credited with this innovation in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://bands.army.mil/history/default.asp?chapter=12

|archivedate=July 21, 2007
|title= U.S. Army Bands in History: Civilian Bands Replace Military Bands
}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  The more formal term [[countersubject]] applies to a secondary or subordinate melodic idea in a [[fugue]]. A countermelody differs from a [[Barbershop music|barbershop quartet-style harmony part]] sung by a [[backup singer]] in that whereas the harmony part typically lacks its own independent musical line, a countermelody is a distinct melodic line.

==Hauptrhythmus&lt;!--[[Hauptrhythmus]] &amp; [[Hauptrhythmen]] redirect directly here--&gt;==

A '''{{Lang|de|Hauptrhythmus}}''' (plural '''{{Lang|de|Hauptrhythmen}}''') is a [[rhythm]]ic [[motif (music)|motif]] or [[cell (music)|cell]].

The ''Hauptrhythmus'' of [[Alban Berg]]'s [[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]] is:&lt;ref&gt;Hailey, Christopher (2010). ''Alban Berg and His World'', p.213-14. {{ISBN|9781400836475}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company''' is a privately held corporation based in [[Pennsylvania]]. [[Milton S. Hershey]] established HE&amp;R in 1927 to distinguish and separate his chocolate manufacturing company from his other business ventures. All of his non-chocolate producing businesses were established as Hershey Estates, renamed Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company in 1980.

== History ==

===Predecessors===
In 1894, Milton S. Hershey founded the Hershey Chocolate Company as a subsidiary of his [[Lancaster Caramel Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hersheyarchives.org/essay/details.aspx?EssayId=43|title=Hershey Community Archives {{!}} Lancaster Caramel Company|website=www.hersheyarchives.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, the American Caramel Company offered to purchase the Lancaster Caramel Company for $1 million. Hershey accepted the offer, maintaining ownership of the Hershey Chocolate Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wq3tvL_uIHcC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=In+1900,+the+American+Caramel+Company+offered+to+purchase+the+Lancaster+Caramel+Company+for+$1+million&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M0jtKSfjEZ&amp;sig=1UCa4ycqP8msZ1ZYsuVra6GuCyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS86CKwcncAhVDi1kKHbHiA3EQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=american%20caramel%20company&amp;f=false|title=Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat [2 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|date=2011-12-02|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313393945|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Hershey began purchasing land in [[Derry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Derry Township, Pennsylvania]], not far from the family homestead he owned, to create a company town for his proposed chocolate factory.&lt;ref name="The Hershey Company"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehersheycompany.com/about-hershey.aspx|publisher=The Hershey Company|title=The Hershey Company|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build the structures of the town, Hershey created a subsidiary company called the Hershey Improvement Company. This company was the predecessor to Hershey Entertainment and Resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Wallace Research Collection |publisher=Hershey Community Archives |url=http://media.hersheyarchives.org/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=415&amp;rootcontentid=2798&amp;q=Hershey+Improvement+Company#id3839 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the factory was completed and put in operation in 1904, the Hershey Improvement Company turned toward building the town, which included homes, stores and parks. [[Hersheypark|Hershey Park]] was opened on May 30, 1906, with a dance hall pavilion, band shell for shows, tennis courts and a baseball field with a grand stand available for sporting events.&lt;ref name="Sun 525"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Opening of Hershey Park |newspaper=The Hummelstown Sun |date=25 May 1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier report"&gt;{{cite news |title=Opening of Hershey Park |newspaper=Lebanon Courier and Semi-Weekly Report |date=May 30, 1906 |page=5 |quote="Hershey Park will be formally opened to the public on Memorial Day, May 30th. }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the park gained popularity, further improvements were made, such as a grand entrance for the park in 1916.&lt;ref name="Sweetness"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hersheypark: The Sweetness of Success  |last=Jacques |first=Charles J. |year=1996 |publisher=Amusement Park Journal  |location=Pennsylvania |isbn=0-9614392-2-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Hershey created the Hershey Trust Company to provide banking to the town of Hershey. In 1909, Hershey and his wife Catherine, who were unable to have children, established the Hershey Industrial School for orphan boys (renamed the [[Milton Hershey School]] in 1951). Hershey created a deed of trust establishing a trust fund for the school. He named the Hershey Trust Company as administrator of the school trust. In 1918, three years after Catherine Hershey died, Hershey transferred nearly all of his assets, including his control of the chocolate company, and various other entities, to the school. This made the Hershey Trust Company owner of the Hershey Improvement Company.

In 1920, Hershey experienced financial difficulty following the collapse in sugar futures. Hershey was forced to sign a promissory note from National City Bank to keep the chocolate company in business. Under the terms of the note, National City Bank sent R.J. DeCamp to be on the board of managers, to assume management of the company. DeCamp remained on the board until 1922, when the company settled the debt.&lt;ref name="Sweetness" /&gt; During that time period, DeCamp prevented substantial improvements to the park or the town, as it was considered too costly an investment. Once Hershey regained control of the company, this made him realize that he should split his operations such that if the chocolate company ever failed again as it had, it wouldn't directly impact the town as the DeCamp period had.

===Hershey Estates===
In 1927, the Hershey Chocolate Company was incorporated, became a publicly traded company on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and became the Hershey Chocolate Corporation. The Cuban businesses held within the chocolate company were spun out into a privately owned company called Hershey Corporation. All of Hershey’s other non-chocolate business endeavors were incorporated into a separate entity known as '''Hershey Estates'''. All three entities were owned by the Hershey Trust Company - under public majority share or privately held ownership. This meant that the Hershey Estates was a distinctly separate company from the chocolate corporation.

In 1933, [[The Hotel Hershey]] opened, becoming Hershey Estate's second hotel in Hershey. Hershey Estates was a conglomeration, having ownership of such things as a bakery, electric company, creamery, sports arena, air park, amusement park, and lumber yard. The Estates company maintained this kind of control until the 1960s, when they began selling off public works companies such as the electric company, gave control of the roads they owned to Derry Township, and began closing poor performing divisions. In 1971, Hershey Estates began a large renovation project for Hershey Park, involving new rides, a gate around the park, live acts, and other kinds of entertainment. The park was also renamed Hersheypark.&lt;ref name="Sweetness" /&gt;

===HERCO / Hershey Entertainment &amp; Resorts===
In 1976, the company changed its name from Hershey Estates to HERCO, Inc., because public perception led many to believe that Hershey Estates referred to land that Milton Hershey once owned. In 1980, the name was changed to the current name: Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company (HE&amp;R), a [[backronym]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;[http://www.hersheyarchives.org/Default.aspx?Page=Resorts The Hershey Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hershey Entertainment &amp; Resorts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hersheypa.com/about_hershey/mission_statement.php|publisher=Hershey Entertainment and Resorts|title= The Hershey Company|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1987, HE&amp;R began expanding their presence to hotels in the [[Pocono Mountains]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], as well as purchasing [[Lake Compounce]] in [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]] and [[Southington, Connecticut]]. However, economic and political circumstances caused the Philadelphia and Corpus Christi hotels to struggle substantially. This caused HE&amp;R to experience severe financial difficulties, leading to the promotion of [[J. Bruce McKinney]] as CEO of the company. One of his first significant decisions was the controversial move to sell Hershey Lake Compounce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bristol Fights Park Closing |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/nyregion/bristol-fights-park-closing.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |pages=1, 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, McKinney successfully led the company back to financial stability, which led to substantial growth within Hersheypark and at the Hershey Lodge in the mid and late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Congressional Record - Extension of Remarks |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]] |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-01/pdf/CREC-2000-03-01-pt1-PgE206.pdf |type=PDF |date=March 1, 2000 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |page=E206 |quote=Mr. McKinney is remembered chiefly for leading the team that brought the corporation out of near financial ruin to an extremely high level of prosperity, saving the company from certain failure. Because of his honorable services, a year later, on March 1, 1986, Mr. McKinney became the chief operating officer at HERCO, later assuming the role as chief executive officer on August 10, 1987, and then taking the position of chairman of the board on October 24, 1989. Mr. McKinney remained at HERCO for another eleven years, eventually becoming chief executive officer and chairman of the board. On September 22, 1999, after seven consecutive record-breaking years from 1993–2000, Mr. McKinney decided to respectfully retire from HERCO. }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinney retired in 2000 and was replaced by Scott Newkam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Congressional Record - Extension of Remarks |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]] |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-01/pdf/CREC-2000-03-01-pt1-PgE206.pdf |type=PDF |date=March 1, 2000 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |page=E206 |quote=Assuming Mr. McKinney’s responsibilities is Mr. Scott J. Newkam, who was named president and chief executive officer. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newkam served as CEO of HE&amp;R until 2006, when Newkam was replaced by [[Ted J. Kleisner|Ted Kleisner]]. On January 1, 2013, [[William F. Simpson Jr.]] replaced Kleisner as the CEO of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts.&lt;ref name="New CEO"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleiter|first=Sue|title=Hershey Entertainment's new CEO expects updates at Hersheypark, restaurants|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/11/hershey_entertainments_new_ceo.html|publisher=[[The Patriot-News]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|date=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The "Hershey Dairy" in that listing should not be confused with [[Hershey Creamery Company|Hershey Creamery]], the manufacturers of Hershey Ice Cream. The creamery was founded in 1894 by Jacob N. Hershey, whose family was unrelated to Milton Hershey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hershey Creamery, a multibagger or mediocre?|url=http://www.oddballstocks.com/2012/04/hershey-creamery-multibagger-or.html|website=Oddballstocks.com|publisher=Oddball Stocks|accessdate=20 January 2015|date=4 April 2012|quote=Hershey Creamery is a completely separate company and has no relation to Hershey the candy company located in Hershey PA which is just down the road from Harrisburg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''''Iron Man 2''''' is a 2010 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Iron Man]], produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} It is the sequel to 2008's ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the third film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Tony Stark / Iron Man, alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after the events of ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process joining forces with Stark's business rival, [[Justin Hammer]].

Following the successful release of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same year Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell and Johansson filled out the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor the film was shot mostly in [[California]], except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]].

''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, 2010. The film received generally positive reviews and was commercially successful, grossing over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2010]], and receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The third installment of the ''Iron Man'' series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.

In Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]] has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.&lt;ref name="Phase1Timeline" /&gt;}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.

The [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.

[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing "Rushman" to be Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.

At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.

At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}

* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: {{Cast list break|A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands. Downey and Favreau, who had been handed a script and worked from it on the first movie, conceived part of the film's story themselves.&lt;ref name="RDJAugust2008" /&gt; On Stark being a hero, Downey said "It's kind of heroic, but really kind of on his own behalf. So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man &amp;ndash;' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay."&lt;ref name="DowneyComicCon" /&gt; Downey put on 20 pounds of muscle to reprise the role.&lt;ref name="DowneyMuscle" /&gt; Six-year-old Davin Ransom portrays Tony Stark as a child.&lt;ref name="RansomYoungStark" /&gt;}}
* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts]]: {{Cast list break|Stark's closest friend, budding love interest, and business partner; Pepper is promoted to CEO of Stark Industries.&lt;ref name="ew-cover" /&gt; On her character's promotion, Paltrow opined "When we start ''Iron Man 2'' Pepper and Tony are very much in the same vibe... as the movie progresses, Pepper is given more responsibility and she's promoted and it's nice to see her sort of grow up in that way. I think it really suits her, the job fits her really well."&lt;ref name="PaltrowInquirer" /&gt; Paltrow expressed excitement about working with Johansson.&lt;ref name="PaltrowJohansson" /&gt;}}
* [[Don Cheadle]] as [[War Machine|James "Rhodey" Rhodes]]: {{Cast list break|An officer in the [[U.S. Air Force]] and Tony Stark's close personal friend who later operates the [[War Machine]] armor. Cheadle replaces [[Terrence Howard]] from the first film.&lt;ref name="CheadleReplaces" /&gt; Cheadle only had a few hours to accept the role and did not even know what storyline Rhodes would undergo.&lt;ref name="CheadleAccepting" /&gt; He commented that he is a comic book fan, but had not previously participated in comics-themed films due to the scarcity of black superheroes.&lt;ref name="MTV Seijas" /&gt; Cheadle said he thought Iron Man was a robot before the first film came out.&lt;ref name="ew-cover" /&gt; On how he approached his character, Cheadle stated "I go, what's the common denominator here? And the common denominator was really his friendship with Tony, and that's what we really tried to track in this one. How is their friendship impacted once Tony comes out and owns 'I am Iron Man'?".&lt;ref name="CheadleComicCon" /&gt; Cheadle said his suit was {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of metal, and that he could not touch his face while wearing it.&lt;ref name="CheadleSuitWeight" /&gt;}}
* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff]]: {{Cast list break|An undercover spy for S.H.I.E.L.D. posing as Stark's new assistant. Johansson dyed her hair red before she landed the part, hoping that it would help convince Favreau that she was right for the role.&lt;ref name="JohanssonRedHair" /&gt; On why she chose the role, Johansson said, "the Black Widow character resonated with me... [She] is a superhero, but she's also human. She's small, but she's strong... She is dark and has faced death so many times that she has a deep perspective on the value of life... It's hard not to admire her."&lt;ref name="JohanssonFeb2015" /&gt; She stated that she had "a bit of a freak-out moment" when she first saw the cat-suit.&lt;ref name="JohanssonComicCon" /&gt; When asked about fighting in the costume, Johansson responded "a big part of me is like 'can I move in this? Can I run in it? Can I like throw myself over things with this?' And I think just the prep, you just have to put in the hours. That's what I realized is that just putting in the hours and doing the training and repetition and basically just befriending the stunt team and spending all day, every day, just over and over and over and over until you sell it."&lt;ref name="JohanssonComicCon" /&gt;}}
* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer]]: {{Cast list break|A rival weapons manufacturer. Sam Rockwell was considered for the role of Tony Stark in the first film, and he accepted the role of Hammer without reading the script.&lt;ref name="RockwellAccepts" /&gt; He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the part, and was unaware Hammer is an old Englishman in the comics.&lt;ref name="RockwellRole" /&gt; Rockwell said, "I worked with Jon Favreau on this film called ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. And Justin Theroux, who wrote the script, is an old friend of mine, they sort of cooked up this idea and pitched it to [[Kevin Feige]]. What they did, they were maybe going to do one villain like they did with [[Jeff Bridges]], but then they decided to split the villains. And really Mickey [Rourke] is the main [villain], but I come to his aid."&lt;ref name="RockwellSplitVillains" /&gt; Rockwell described his character as "plucky comic relief, but he's got a little bit of an edge".&lt;ref name="RockwellComicRelief" /&gt;}}

Rourke visited [[Butyrka prison]] to research the role,&lt;ref name="RourkePrisonResearch" /&gt; and he suggested half of the character's dialogue be in Russian.&lt;ref name="RourkeRussian" /&gt; He also suggested the addition of tattoos, gold teeth and a fondness for a pet [[cockatoo]], paying for the teeth and bird with his own money.&lt;ref name="RourkeBird" /&gt; Rourke explained that he did not want to play a "one-dimensional bad guy", and wanted to challenge the audience to see something redeemable in him.&lt;ref name="ew-cover" /&gt; Not knowing anything about computers, Rourke described pretending to be tech-savvy as the hardest part of the role.&lt;ref name="RourkeComputers" /&gt;}}
*[[Samuel L.

He's still just kind of a talker."&lt;ref name="SLJSplashPage" /&gt;}}

The director, [[Jon Favreau]], reprises his role as [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]],&lt;ref name="FavreauHappyTwitter" /&gt; Tony Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, while [[Clark Gregg]] and [[Leslie Bibb]] reprise their roles as S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Jon Favreau at Edwards Air Force Base.JPG|thumb|right|Jon Favreau meeting with members of the U.S. Air Force while filming at Edwards Air Force Base.]]
Jon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man,&lt;ref name="Eric Vespe" /&gt; with Obadiah Stane ([[Jeff Bridges]]) becoming [[Iron Monger]] during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.&lt;ref name="MarkMillar" /&gt; Favreau concurred, deciding, "I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it."&lt;ref name="FavreauStarWars" /&gt; Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt;

During development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be "the '[[Demon in a Bottle]]' version".&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the "Demon in a Bottle" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the "interim space" between the origin and the "Demon" story arc.&lt;ref name="et" /&gt; [[Shane Black]] gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who became depressed with being "the destroyer of worlds" after working on the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name="black" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
Immediately following ''Iron Man''{{'}}s release, Marvel Studios announced that they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010.&lt;ref name="MarvelAnnouncesIM2" /&gt; In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct.&lt;ref name="FavreauSignsIM2" /&gt; That same month, [[Justin Theroux]] signed to write the script, which would be based on a story written by Favreau and Downey.&lt;ref name="TherouxWriting" /&gt; Theroux co-wrote ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'', which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel.&lt;ref name="TherouxNov2008" /&gt; [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] [[storyboard]]ed the film,&lt;ref name="Tartakovsky" /&gt; and [[Adi Granov]] returned to supervise the designs for [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man's armor]].&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt;

In October 2008, Marvel Studios came to an agreement to film ''Iron Man 2'', as well as their next three films, at Raleigh Studios in [[Manhattan Beach, California]].&lt;ref name="FilmingRaleigh" /&gt; A few days later, Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard.&lt;ref name="CheadleReplaces" /&gt; On being replaced, Howard stated, "There was no explanation, apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren't worth the paper that they're printed on sometimes. Promises aren't kept, and good faith negotiations aren't always held up."&lt;ref name="HowardInterview" /&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary – Howard was the first actor hired in ''Iron Man'' and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating.&lt;ref name="EWHoward" /&gt; Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated.&lt;ref name="TherouxNov2008" /&gt; In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, "with or without you," and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey "took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out."&lt;ref name="HowardInterview2" /&gt;

In January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains.&lt;ref name="RourkeRockwell" /&gt; A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer.&lt;ref name="RockwellAccepts" /&gt; Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.&lt;ref name="BettanyJARVIS" /&gt; Marvel entered into early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play the Black Widow,&lt;ref name="BluntWidow" /&gt; though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="BluntOut" /&gt; Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson claimed that "There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury."&lt;ref name="SLJJanuaryDispute" /&gt;

In February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.&lt;ref name="SLJSignsOn" /&gt; Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with [[David Ansen]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards|2009 Golden Globes]], and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out due to Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March Rourke signed on.&lt;ref name="RourkeCast" /&gt; Later that same day Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref name="JohanssonMarch2009" /&gt; In April, Garry Shandling,&lt;ref name="Shandling" /&gt; Clark Gregg,&lt;ref name="GreggMara" /&gt; and [[Kate Mara]]&lt;ref name="GreggMara" /&gt; joined the cast.

[[Principal photography]] began April 6, 2009,&lt;ref name="July18Wrap" /&gt; at the Pasadena Masonic Temple,&lt;ref name="SHHPasadenaMT" /&gt; with the [[working title]] ''Rasputin''.&lt;ref name="Rasputin" /&gt; The bulk of the production took place at Raleigh Studios,&lt;ref name="LibatiqueASC" /&gt; though other locations were also used. Scenes were filmed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] from May 11 through May 13. The location had also been used for ''Iron Man'', and Favreau stated that he felt the "real military assets make the movie more authentic and the topography and the beauty of the desert and flightline open the movie up".&lt;ref name="FilmingEdwardsBase" /&gt; The Historic Grand Prix of Monaco action sequence was shot in the parking lot of [[Downey Studios]], with sets constructed in May&lt;ref name="OLVDowneyMay" /&gt; and filming lasting through June.&lt;ref name="OLVDowneyJune" /&gt; Permission to film in Monaco prior to the [[2009 Monaco Grand Prix]] had initially been awarded, but was later retracted by [[Bernie Ecclestone]]. The filmmakers shipped one [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls-Royce Phantom]] there, and filmed a track sequence in which race cars were later digitally added. [[Tanner Foust]] took on the role of driving Stark's racing car.&lt;ref name="MonacoDowney" /&gt; Also in June, it was reported that John Slattery had joined the film's cast as Howard Stark.&lt;ref name="SlatteryHoward" /&gt; Olivia Munn was also cast, in an unspecified role.&lt;ref name="MunnJoins" /&gt;

A massive green screen was constructed at the [[Sepulveda Dam]] to film a portion of the Stark Expo exterior, with the rest either shot at an area high school or added digitally. To construct the green screen, hundreds of shipping containers were stacked, covered in plywood and plaster, and then painted green.&lt;ref name="LibatiqueASC" /&gt; For the conclusion of that climactic scene, which the crew dubbed the "Japanese Garden" scene, a set was built inside Sony Studios in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="LibatiqueASC" /&gt; Filming lasted 71 days, and the film's production officially wrapped on July 18, 2009.&lt;ref name="July18Wrap" /&gt; A post-credits scene depicting the discovery of a large hammer was filmed on the set of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', and some of it was reused in the film.&lt;ref name=commentary /&gt; Jon Favreau revealed that the scene was filmed with [[anamorphic format|anamorphic lenses]] to match ''Thor'',&lt;ref name=commentary /&gt; and was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], the director of ''Thor''.&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2013" /&gt;

===Post-production===
In January 2010, [[IMAX Corporation]], Marvel, and Paramount announced that the film would receive a limited release on digital [[IMAX]] screens.&lt;ref name="IMAXJan2010" /&gt; It was not shot with IMAX cameras, so it was converted into the format using the [[IMAX DMR]] technology.&lt;ref name="Tartakovsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMAXJan2010" /&gt; The film underwent reshoots in February.&lt;ref name="CheadleFeb2010" /&gt; Olivia Munn's original role was cut, but she was given a new role during the reshoots.&lt;ref name="MunnChange" /&gt;

[[File:IronMan2 Suits VisualEffects.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Downey, Jr. and Don Cheadle in their suits, before and after ILM's CGI enhancements.]]
[[Janek Sirrs]] was the film's [[visual effects supervisor]],&lt;ref name="JanekSirrs" /&gt; and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] again did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film.&lt;ref name="ILMBenSnow" /&gt; ILM's visual effects supervisor on the film, [[Ben Snow]], said their work on the film was "harder" than their work on the first, stating that Favreau asked more of them this time around. Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:
{{quote|text=On the first ''Iron Man'', we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, [[Stan Winston]]'s effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the "football suits" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene. But in the rest of the film, we used the CG suit entirely. And [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] did an all-digital suit for the Monaco chase.&lt;ref name="ILMBenSnow" /&gt;}}

ILM created 527 shots for the film, using programs such as [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Autodesk" /&gt; Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film.&lt;ref name="PerceptionNYC" /&gt; They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent [[LG Corp|LG]] [[smartphone]],&lt;ref name="IM2Gadgets" /&gt; and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo as well as the computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab environment.&lt;ref name="PerceptionNYC" /&gt; In total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.&lt;ref name="JanekSirrs" /&gt;

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
&lt;!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings, you should also update the "accessdate" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. --&gt;
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 73% approval rating with an average rating of 6.5/10 based on 286 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "It isn't quite the breath of fresh air that ''Iron Man'' was, but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Man 2 (2010)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron_man_2/|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average rating of 57/100 based on 40 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="meta" /&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, "''Iron Man 2'' isn't as much fun as its predecessor, but by the time the smoke clears, it'll do".&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; Anthony Lane of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said, "To find a comic-book hero who doesn't agonize over his supergifts, and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them, is frankly a relief".&lt;ref name="NewYorkerReview" /&gt; David Edelstein of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' wrote, "It doesn't come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: ''[[Superman II]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. But ''Iron Man 2'' hums along quite nicely".&lt;ref name="NewYorkMagReview" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating that "''Iron Man 2'' is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr".&lt;ref name="EbertReview" /&gt; [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said that, "In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to ''Iron Man'' doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh."&lt;ref name="FrankLoveceReview" /&gt;

Conversely, Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated, "Everything fun and terrific about ''Iron Man'', a mere two years ago, has vanished with its sequel. In its place, ''Iron Man 2'' has substituted noise, confusion, multiple villains, irrelevant stunts and misguided story lines."&lt;ref name="THRReview" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">[[File:TurkSColes.jpg|right|thumb|Gaughan's reconstructed Turk]]'''John Gaughan''' (born 1940) is an American manufacturer of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] acts and equipment for [[Magician (illusion)|magicians]] based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. His style of work is classic, not based heavily on machinery and technology.

Great illusionists have noted his work, such as [[David Blaine]], who has several times called him "a magical genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/fashion/18magic.html |title=Magicians Ask: What’s Up His Sleeve? |work=nytimes.com |accessdate=October 8, 2009 |first=Stephanie |last=Rosenbloom |date=May 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has built for people such as [[Alan Wakeling]], [[Mark Wilson (magician)|Mark Wilson]], [[Criss Angel]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], David Blaine, [[Simon Drake]], [[Doug Henning]] and [[The Doors]], and is responsible for the construction of dozens of major acts. He also has constructed a replica of the 18th century [[chess]]-playing machine, [[The Turk]], which often tours chess conferences.

Gaughan created [[David Copperfield's flying illusion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/david-copperfield/bio |title=David Copperfield Bio |work=yuddy.com |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122093530/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/david-copperfield/bio |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is notable for its graceful motion and unencumbered appearance. Gaughan holds a patent on a method for creating the illusion of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Gaughan also created a "one-of-a-kind" prop for Mark Wilson Productions for a National Fire Prevention Week Event. Using a standard golf cart chassis, John and his team created "Snuffy". Snuffy was a "magical" boiler type [[fire engine]] that seemed to drive along without any visible driver.

The '''Koosh Kins''' were a variation on the popular [[Koosh ball]], featuring faces and hands. They were originally created as a set of six characters, then released with variant colors.

The characters were featured in a four-part [[comic book]] [[mini-series]] released by [[Archie Comics]], as well as a series of [[coloring books]]. In that series, they lived on the [[planet]] Koosh, a large Koosh ball [[planetoid]] that, in lieu of a proper [[orbit]], bounced against other planets to travel across the [[universe]]. While exploring a [[volcano]], the Koosh Kins were flung into space, where they landed on Earth, in the company of downtrodden [[everyman]] [[Zak Taylor]]. Predictably, hilarity ensued, with the Koosh Kins aiding Zak in his acquisition of a girlfriend, and the aliens discovering a taste for [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[pizza]].

==Koosh Kins Characters==
'''T.K.''' - the stereotypical cool character, this toy's molded face sported perpetual [[sunglasses]]. In the comic, he often abbreviated his long strings of [[slang]] into a series of letters standing for each word. His colors were a light blue face and hands paired with a darker blue body.

'''Scopes''' - the only character without a [[humanoid]] face, Scopes had two [[periscope]]-style eyes, similar to cartoon depictions of a [[crab]], rising from the top of the Koosh ball. In the comics, he never spoke, but featured word balloons with question marks from time to time. His eyestalks and hands were dark blue, and his ball was green.

'''Grinby''' - all yellow (hands and faces), Grinby was the down-to-earth but physically strong character.

'''Slats''' - almost the [[Reggie Mantle]] of the group, Slats was portrayed as sly. His colors were green for face and hands, and purple for his ball. He is shown in the comics as sweet on Gee Gee.

'''Gee Gee''' - the female of the group, she featured a predictable pink hue on her ball, with darker pink hands and face. In the comics, she's displayed as sweet and long-suffering.

'''Boingo''' - with a predilection for parties and pizza, Boingo was the stereotypical wacky member of the group, always ready to explode into feverish energy. His coloring was red.

'''''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa''''' is a 2008 American [[computer-animated]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. As the sequel to the 2005 film ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', it continues the adventures of Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, and Gloria the Hippo. It was directed by [[Eric Darnell]] and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], with a screenplay written by [[Etan Cohen]], Darnell, and McGrath. The voice actors [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], and [[Andy Richter]] return for the sequel, joined by [[Bernie Mac]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Sherri Shepherd]], [[Elisa Gabrielli]], and [[will.i.am]].

The film begins by showing a small part of Alex's early life, including his capture by hunters, then moves to shortly after the point where ''Madagascar'' left off, with the animals deciding to return to [[New York City]]. They board an airplane in [[Madagascar]] but crash-land in [[Africa]], where each of the central characters meets others of the same species and where Alex is reunited with his parents. Problems arise, and their resolution occupies much of the remainder of the film.

''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'' was released on November 7, 2008, by [[Paramount Pictures]].{{ref|1|1}} It grossed $603.9&amp;nbsp;million on a $150&amp;nbsp;million budget, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 2008, and won the [[2009 Kids' Choice Awards|2009 Kids' Choice Award]] for Favorite Animated Movie.&lt;ref name="BOM2008Worldwide" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nick /&gt; It was dedicated to Bernie Mac, who died before the film's release (by coincidence, another film of his, ''[[Soul Men]]'', would be released on the same date as this film.).&lt;ref name="PeopleRememberingMac" /&gt; A sequel, ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', was released in 2012.

==Plot==
In [[Africa]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Zuba|Zuba]] the [[lion]] tries to teach his son Alakay how to fight, but the cub is more interested in dancing. Rival male [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Makunga|Makunga]] challenges Zuba for the title of [[alpha (ethology)|alpha]] lion, and during their fight Alakay is captured by [[poaching|poachers]]. The crate containing Alakay falls into the ocean and drifts to [[New York City]], where he is renamed [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Alex|Alex]] and grows up at the [[Central Park Zoo]] with [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Marty|Marty]] the [[Plains zebra|zebra]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]].

Years later, following their adventure in [[Madagascar]], the zoo animals—Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, the [[Adélie penguin|penguin]]s [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Skipper|Skipper]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Kowalski|Kowalski]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rico|Rico]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Private|Private]], and [[chimpanzee]]s [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Mason and Phil]]—prepare to return to New York aboard a battered airplane piloted by the penguins, accompanied by the [[lemur]]s [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien XIII|King Julien XIII]] the [[ring-tailed lemur]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Maurice|Maurice]] the [[aye-aye]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mort|Mort]] the [[Goodman's mouse lemur|mouse lemur]]. The plane runs out of fuel and crash lands in continental Africa. The animals find themselves at a watering hole on a [[nature reserve]], and are excited to meet others of their species. Alex is reunited with his parents and impresses them with tales of his status as "the King of New York". Marty fits in with a herd of other zebras who look and sound just like him. Melman, a [[hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]], is distressed that the reserve has no doctors, so the other giraffes appoint him their [[witch doctor]]. Seeking romance, Gloria attracts the attention of the smooth-talking male hippopotamus, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Moto Moto|Moto Moto]].

Meanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane, assisted by numerous chimpanzees recruited by Mason and Phil. They steal vehicles from several groups of New Yorkers who are on [[safari]] and strip them for parts. [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Nana|Nana]], a tough old woman who beat up Alex during the events of ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', takes charge of the stranded tourists and helps them survive in the wilderness.

The zoo animals' excitement soon turns to disappointment. In a scheme to oust Zuba as alpha lion, Makunga insists that Alex complete a [[rite of passage]] which Alex mistakes for a talent contest. It is actually a fighting contest, and Makunga tricks him into choosing the strongest lion as his opponent, resulting in Alex's humiliating defeat. Faced with the duty of banishing his son, Zuba relinquishes his title as alpha and Makunga takes over. Meanwhile, Marty is dejected by the realization that the other zebras can do everything he can, believing himself no longer unique. Melman comes to believe that he is deathly ill, and Gloria's interest in Moto Moto saddens him since he has secretly loved her for a long time. The four friends argue heatedly with one another. Gloria has a date with Moto Moto, but loses interest when she realizes he is only attracted to her because of her size. After a pep talk from King Julien, Melman finally reveals his feelings for Gloria.

The next day, the animals panic when the watering hole dries up. Determined to redeem himself, Alex mends his friendship with Marty and they leave the reserve to investigate upriver. King Julien suggests that offering a sacrifice to the nearby volcano will restore the water. Melman, forlorn and believing he is dying, volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria stops him from jumping into the volcano, and realizes that he is the perfect guy for her. Alex and Marty discover that the stranded New Yorkers have built a camp and dammed up the river, and Alex is captured by them. Zuba rushes to his aid, but Alex saves them both by dancing for the tourists, who remember him fondly from the zoo. Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins, and the chimpanzees arrive in the repaired airplane and help Alex destroy the dam, restoring the water. Makunga angrily makes a stand for control, but Alex tricks him into being subdued by Nana. Zuba offers Alex the title of alpha lion, but he declines, and father and son become co-leaders.

Skipper marries a [[bobblehead]] doll from the plane, and he, the other penguins, and the chimpanzees head off to honeymoon in [[Monte Carlo]]. Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, and the lemurs happily decide to stay on the reserve for a while.

==Production==
A sequel to ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' had been in development since 2005, when the first film had been released, with a release date planned for late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first teaser trailer, which was released in March 2008, the film was subtitled with ''The Crate Escape''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciretta|first1=Peter|title=Madagascar: The Crate Escape Movie Trailer|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/madagascar-the-crate-escape-movie-trailer/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=April 22, 2015|date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2008, the film was given its final title – ''Escape 2 Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciretta|first1=Peter|title=New Photos: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/new-photos-madagascar-escape-2-africa/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=April 22, 2015|date=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 64% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 150 reviews, with the consensus view that the film was "an improvement on the original, with more fleshed-out characters, crisper animation and more consistent humor," and with an average rating of 5.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/madagascar_escape_2_africa/ | title=Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]] classified the film into the "generally favorable reviews" category with 61/100 approval rating based on 25 reviews, also a bit higher a score than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/madagascar-escape-2-africa | title=Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' stated in his review that the film "goes easy on the pop culture jokes, I should clarify: one of the smarter things in the script is how Alex, who digs his [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] dance moves, becomes the film's primary pop-cult gag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Michael|title=A tamer wild bunch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/07/entertainment/et-madagascar7|accessdate=March 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 stars and wrote "This is a brighter, more engaging film than the original ''Madagascar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081105/REVIEWS/811059991|accessdate=March 26, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven D.

The '''Melico Salazar Theatre''' is located in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. It maintains a full schedule of concerts, recitals, and plays.   

While large and built in the European Baroque style, it is far simpler than the Parisian influenced [[Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica|Teatro Nacional]] one block east.

The land was bought by Jose Raventós, who dreamed of building a theatre in which to produce zarzuelas, usually comic) Spanish operettas. The building was designed by Jose Fabio Garnier Ugalde, dramatist and architect. Construction began 8 February 1927, and was completed 7 October 1928. The inauguration featured operattas of [[:es:Esperanza Iris|Esperanza Iris]], the famous Mexican singer known as the Empress of Operetta.

In 1960 a new gallery was added that included a screen for cinemascope. Seven years later, in 1967, during the dawn of 23 April, a fire destroyed the room.

In the early 1970s, the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports decided that Costa Rica must buy the theater and renew it. In December 1981, a pre-inauguration occurred. Shortly afterwards, the building was closed to finish the restoration. There was a re-inauguration 6 March 1985, and 7 April the following year. "The Gaceta", the official newspaper of the government, announced law 7023 that gave the Melico Salazar the position of "cultural institution especializada" of the Costa Rican State.

In 2014 it was announced that a new combined gallery and waiting area at the theatre would be named in honour of [[Dinora Bolandi]] who was a Costa Rican teacher and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nacion.com/ocio/artes/Galeria-Dinorah-Bolandi-pinturas-musica_0_1415258499.html|title=La Galería Dinorah Bolandi, una caja de pinturas en una caja de música|access-date=2017-09-25|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole facility was once named the Raventós Theater, it was renamed in 1986 to honor the famous Costa Rican tenor Manuel "Melico" Salazar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''''Meng and Ecker''''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[underground comics|underground]] [[comic]] written by [[David Britton]] and illustrated by Kris Guidio.&lt;ref name="independent2003"&gt;Greenland, Colin (March 12, 2003). "The Thursday Book: A Wallow In The Sump Of The Popular Psyche". ''[[The Independent]]''. Comment; Pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1989&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/meng1.html&lt;/ref&gt; by the controversial [[Manchester]]-based company Savoy and lasted for nine issues before being banned in 1992 under [[obscenity]] laws.

==Concept==
The characters Meng and Ecker were inspired by Nazi doctor [[Josef Mengele]].&lt;ref name="indepedent1992"&gt;Foster, Jonathan (July 30, 1992). "Legal challenge on seizure of anti-Semitic fantasy". ''[[The Independent]]''. Pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities pulped thousands of copies of ''Meng &amp; Ecker'' after finding the book "obscene and likely to corrupt."&lt;ref name="observer1997"&gt;McCrum, Robert (March 16, 1997). "The Week In Reviews: Books: The Bare-Faced Cheek Of It". ''[[The Observer]]''. Pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In finding the comic obscene, the judge said, "This comic could be read - and possibly gloated over - by people who enjoyed vicousness and violence. It had pictures that would be repulsive to right-thinking people."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Guardian staff. (July 31, 1992). "Lord Horror Book Is 'Not Obscene'". ''[[The Guardian]]''. Pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Meng and Ecker also appeared in three controversial prose novels written by Britton: ''Lord Horror'' (1990), ''Motherfuckers: The Auschwitz of Oz'' (1996), and ''Baptised in the Blood of Millions'' (2001). The first novel, ''Lord Horror,'' was the first book to be banned in the United Kingdom since [[Hubert Selby]]'s ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' was banned in 1968.&lt;ref name="independent2003"/&gt;

[[Perth]], the major city in [[Western Australia]], has given rise to a number of notable performers in popular music. Some of the more famous performers include [[Kevin Parker (musician)|Kevin Parker]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[David Helfgott]], [[Luke Steele (musician)|Luke Steele]] and [[Tim Minchin]]. Notable artists in genres including [[rock and roll|rock]], [[classical music|classical]], and [[electronic music]] have lived in Perth.

==History==

Perth's isolation is problematic for many rising artists, as it increases costs associated with touring and promotion. For this reason, many artists leave Perth to improve their popularity, with varying degrees of success.

While most artists leave after achieving some popularity, some acclaimed performers only gained their fame after leaving, such as [[The Triffids]] and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].

==Current==

The [[Perth International Arts Festival]] bills itself as the largest and longest-lasting multi-arts festival in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthfestival.com.au/2003_archive/ClassicalMusic.html Perth International Arts Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211004353/http://www.perthfestival.com.au/2003_archive/ClassicalMusic.html |date=11 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music institutions include the [[West Australian Opera]], [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]], and numerous choral groups.

===Popular Music===
Perth is also home to a major local scene, which has produced nationally and internationally renowned bands such as [[Tame Impala]], [[Pond_(Australian_band)|Pond]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[John Butler Trio]], [[Gyroscope (band)|Gyroscope]], [[Birds of Tokyo]], [[End of Fashion]], [[Turnstyle (band)|Turnstyle]], [[Little Birdy]], [[Jebediah]], [[The Sleepy Jackson]], [[Karnivool]], [[Institut Polaire]], [[The Panics]], [[The Waifs]], [[Knife Party]]  and [[drum and bass]] acts like [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].

Perth's [[hip hop]] scene has produced artists such as [[Drapht]], [[Downsyde]], [[MC Layla]], [[Matty B]], [[Trooth]] and [[Lo-Key Fu]]. Many of these artists are members of the Perth hip hop crew named Syllabolix.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A majority of Perth's premier emcees are featured on the [[Obese Records]] label. This connection has seen several Perth artists feature in the recordings of other Australian acts, such as [[The Hilltop Hoods]].

Many of Australia's critically acclaimed [[hardcore bands]] originated from Perth, including Extortion, Miles Away, Break Even, Rupture and Heist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The [[Big Day Out]], [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]] and the [[West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festival]] are major popular music festivals regularly held in Perth or its suburbs.

===Classical===
Perth is home to the [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]] which performs a regular programme of orchestral music, usually from its base at the [[Perth Concert Hall, Western Australia|Perth Concert Hall]]; it also tours regional Western Australia. There are a large number of smaller professional, semi-professional and non-professional music groups and choral societies and choirs which perform in a variety of venues in and around Perth. Repertoire ranges from baroque to contemporary.

The West Australian Youth Music Association (or WAYMA), allows the youth of Perth to experience playing in a musical ensemble.  Acceptance is only granted to amateur student players under the age of 25 years and who are currently under instrumental tutelage.  The association runs a symphonic band, a flute choir, several choirs and four orchestras in total (two string orchestras and two symphony orchestras).

==Venues==

Major music venues in Perth include the [[Perth Concert Hall, Western Australia|Perth Concert Hall]], the [[Burswood Dome]], Perth Arena, [[Challenge Stadium]], the Metropolis Concert Clubs in [[Metropolis Fremantle|Fremantle]] and Perth, [[Fremantle Arts Centre]], Belvoir Amphitheatre and the Red Hill Auditorium. Large international acts often play outdoors, in stadium venues like the WACA cricket ground, [[Subiaco Oval]], [[Members Equity Stadium]] or [[Perth Oval]]. Festival events are generally held at [[Claremont Showgrounds]] or on the Perth Esplanade. The Supreme Court Gardens offer a large alternative outdoor venue, and have hosted such acts as [[David Bowie]].

Many former venues have been demolished, including wartime dancehalls such as The Tearooms and The Pagoda Ballroom. The [[Perth Entertainment Centre]] hosted many international acts until it was closed in 2002 and demolished in 2012. It has been replaced with the Perth Arena.
Other venues, such as The Bakery, The Raffles Hotel, the Hyde Park Hotel, The Grosvenor, The Stoned Crow, Fitzgerald's, The Red Parrot and The Old Melbourne Hotel, have closed as music venues but have been redeveloped as restaurants, public bars or apartments.

Current live music venues are predominantly located in the Fremantle and Perth/Northbridge entertainment districts. Many mid-sized venues host international and interstate acts. Some of these include the Fly-By-Night, The Newport Hotel, Mojos, the Rosemount Hotel, Velvet Lounge, and Amplifier/Capitol.

Many other smaller clubs and pubs present live music pop music predominantly, plus hip-hop, electronic music, cover bands and lesser-known local artists.

==Publications==

Local [[street press]] publications dedicated to the music and arts scene include X-Press Magazine and The Music (formally known as [[Drum Media]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Drum Media]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many newspapers and magazines include sections on the Perth music scene, including the Wire Magazine, [[The West Australian]]'s latest attempt at appealing to the youth market, and university publications such as [[Grok Magazine]], Pelican and Metior.
Now defunct, there were many other music publications such as: Party Fears and Vortex, which often included a free seven-inch vinyl [[flexidisc]] stapled to the front, featuring local bands.

==Radio==
Perth is serviced by commercial radio stations [[HIT 92.9 (Perth radio station)|Hit92.9]], [[Nova 937]], [[Mix 94.5]], [[96fm (Perth radio station)|96FM]] and [[6iX]], as well as public stations [[triple j]] and [[ABC Classic FM]]. Community broadcasters includes Radio Fremantle 107.9fm, [[Curtin FM]], [[Heritage FM]], [[RTRFM|RTR FM]], KCRfm 102.5fm and [[Capital 101.7FM]].

The '''nueva ola''' ({{IPA-es|'nwe βa 'o la|pron}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "new wave") was a loosely affiliated group of musicians, mainly in Spanish-speaking [[South America]], who played and introduced [[rock 'n roll]] and other American and European music of the 1950s and 1960s to their countries. Nueva ola bands usually had their names in English and rather than producing their own material they recorded [[cover song|versions]] of songs that were already popular in the United States or Europe.&lt;ref name=Nueva&gt;[http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?action=R2VuZXJvREU=&amp;var=MTg= Nueva ola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719002444/http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?action=R2VuZXJvREU=&amp;var=MTg= |date=2009-07-19 }}, Musicapopular.cl. Retrieved October 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More than an artistic movement the nueva ola was an economic and social phenomenon that marked the beginning of [[youth culture]] and [[pop music]] in South America.&lt;ref name=Nueva/&gt;

Artists associated with the nueva ola reached their peak of popularity in the 1960s. Nueva ola music was contemporaneous with [[nueva canción]], a style which, together with nueva ola, became the precursor to the [[rock en español]] scene that rose to prominence in the 1980s. During the '90s nueva ola music experienced a revival in Chile.&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;[http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?op=Artista&amp;id=26 Peter Rock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719002151/http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?op=Artista&amp;id=26 |date=2009-07-19 }}, Musicapopular.cl.

In 1960, [[RCA Victor]] general manager Ricardo Mejía discovered through a [[market research]] that there were almost no [[popular music]] stars among the youth.&lt;ref name="ArgentinaBeat"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Gaffet, Hernán (Director)|year=2006|title=Argentina Beat|medium=[[Documentary film]]|format=|language=Spanish|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|publisher=Produced by Poleri-Foligna-Gaffet.

In 1964, after [[The Beatles]]' performances in the United States, [[Beatlemania]] also reached Argentina, generating the appearance of several bands that imitated their sound and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=González|first=Yanko|year=2013|title=La construcción histórica de la juventud en América Latina: Bohemios, Rockanroleros y Revolucionarios|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fngCQAAQBAJ|language=Spanish|publisher=Cuarto Propio|page=|isbn=978-9562606400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nueva ola was overshadowed by the popularity of [[British Invasion]] bands, while at the same time a feeling nonconformity grew among the youth, which saw the phenomenon as too carefree and compliant.&lt;ref name="ArgentinaBeat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clubclan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MinutoUno"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minutouno.com/notas/46643-leyendas-ayer-el-alegre-e-inocente-club-del-clan|last=Arena|first=María Fernanda|title=Leyendas de ayer: el alegre e inocente "Club del Clan"|language=Spanish|date=September 3, 2007|publisher=MinutoUno|access-date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the dissolution of the group and "as a farewell," an ''El club del clan'' film directed by [[Enrique Carreras]] was released on March 12, 1964.&lt;ref name="MinutoUno"/&gt;

An '''Off-Broadway''' theatre is any professional venue in Manhattan in New York City with a [[seating capacity]] between 100 and 499, inclusive. These theatres are smaller than [[Broadway theatre]]s, but larger than [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatres, which seat fewer than 100.

An "Off-Broadway production" is a production of a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[musical theatre|musical]], or [[revue]] that appears in such a venue and adheres to related [[trade union]] and other contracts.&lt;ref name=League&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.offbroadway.org/OB_MBA_2001a.pdf |format=PDF|title=Off-Broadway Minimum Basic Agreement| author=League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers Inc. and The Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers| accessdate=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shows that premiere Off-Broadway are sometimes subsequently produced on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeseymour/2018/01/17/off-broadway-theater-isnt-dying-its-evolving-and-its-more-profitable-than-ever/#6303517cf6a1|title=Off-Broadway Theater Isn't Dying - It's Evolving. And It's More Profitable Than Ever|last=Seymour|first=Lee|work=Forbes|access-date=August 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally referring to the location of a venue and its productions on a street intersecting [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Theater District, New York|Theater District]], the hub of the theatre industry in New York, the term later became defined by the League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers as a professional venue in Manhattan with a [[seating capacity]] between 100 and 499 (inclusive) or a specific production that appears in such a venue and adheres to related [[trade union]] and other contracts.&lt;ref name=League/&gt;

Previously, regardless of the size of the venue, a theatre was considered a Broadway (rather than Off-Broadway) house if it was within the "Broadway Box", extending from 40th north to 54th Street and from [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] west to [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]], including [[Times Square]] and West [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. This change to the contractual definition of "Off-Broadway" benefited theatres satisfying the 499-seat criterion because of the lower minimum required salary for [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors' Equity]] performers at Off-Broadway theatres as compared with the salary requirements of the union for Broadway theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Tell Broadway from Off-Broadway from ...| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/how-to-tell-broadway-from-off-broadway-from-com-110450| publisher=Playbill Inc.|accessdate=January 28, 2017|date=January 4, 1998|quote=No matter what else you may have heard, the distinction is mainly one of contracts. There are so many theatres of so many different sizes served by so many different unions in New York that this three-tiered Broadway/Off-Broadway/Off-Off-Broadway system evolved to determine who would get paid what. ... Most "Broadway" theatres are not on Broadway, the street. A few theatres on Broadway, the street, are considered "Off-Broadway."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of the 499-seat criterion occurred after a one-day strike in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.actorsequity.org/AboutEquity/timeline/timeline_1970.html |title= Actors' Equity 1970's Timeline|publisher=Actors' Equity Association |accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of Off-Broadway theatres within the Broadway Box are the [[Laura Pels Theatre]] and [[The Theater Center]].

The Off-Broadway movement started in the 1950s as a reaction to the perceived commercialism of Broadway and provided less expensive venues for shows that have employed hundreds of future Broadway artists. According to theatre historians Ken Bloom and Frank Vlastnik, Off-Broadway offered a new outlet for "poets, playwrights, actors, songwriters, and designers. ... The first great Off-Broadway musical was the 1954 revival" of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which proved that Off-Broadway productions could be financially successful.&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;Bloom, Ken and Vlastnik, Frank. "Off Broadway, Part 1", ''Broadway Musicals: The 101 Greatest Shows of All Time'', Black Dog Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|1-57912-313-9}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theatre Row (New York City)|Theatre Row]], on West 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues in Manhattan, is a concentration of Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway theatres. It was developed in the mid-1970s and modernized in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/21/theater/upscale-march-of-theater-row-a-centerpiece-of-redevelopment.html "Upscale March of Theatre Row; A Centerpiece of Redevelopment"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 21, 2002, accessed March 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Off-Broadway shows have had subsequent runs on Broadway, including such successful musicals as ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', ''[[Grey Gardens (musical)|Grey Gardens]]'', ''[[Urinetown]]'', ''[[Avenue Q]]'', ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'', ''[[Rock of Ages (musical)|Rock of Ages]]'', ''[[In the Heights]]'', ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', ''[[Next to Normal]]'', ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'', ''[[Fun Home (musical)|Fun Home]]'', ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' and ''[[Dear Evan Hansen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://offbroadway.com/about.php|title=Off Broadway Theatre Information|accessdate=January 27, 2017|website=offbroadway.com|publisher=League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, two that became Broadway hits, ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' and ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', encouraged other producers to premiere their shows Off-Broadway.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; Plays that have moved from Off-Broadway houses to Broadway include ''[[Doubt (play)|Doubt]]'', ''[[I Am My Own Wife]]'', ''[[Bridge and Tunnel (play)|Bridge &amp; Tunnel]]'', ''[[The Normal Heart]]'', and ''[[Coastal Disturbances]]''. Other productions, such as ''[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]]'', ''[[Blue Man Group]]'', ''[[Altar Boyz]]'', ''[[Perfect Crime (play)|Perfect Crime]]'', ''[[Forbidden Broadway]]'', ''[[Nunsense]]'', ''[[Naked Boys Singing]]'', ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'', and ''[[I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change]]'' have had runs of many years Off-Broadway, never moving to Broadway. ''[[The Fantasticks]]'', the longest-running musical in theatre history, spent its original 42-year run Off-Broadway and began another long Off-Broadway run in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, David.

==Awards==
Off-Broadway shows, performers, and creative staff are eligible for the following awards: the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle Award]], the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], the [[Drama Desk Award]], the [[Obie Award]] (presented since 1956 by ''[[The Village Voice]]''), the [[Lucille Lortel Award]] (created in 1985 by the League of Off-Broadway Theatres &amp; Producers), and the [[Drama League Award]].  Although Off-Broadway shows are not eligible for [[Tony Awards]], an exception was made in 1956 (before the rules were changed), when [[Lotte Lenya]] won [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical]] for the Off-Broadway production of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threepennyopera.org/histOffBway.php Threepenny Opera Off Broadway] threepennyopera.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magic collection ==

Albo's collection of magic apparatus grew to be the largest in the world. It contained over four thousand pieces and was used to write his well regarded series of books, ''Classic Magic With Appartus''. Originally intended to be a trilogy, it eventually grew to 11 volumes. It was followed by further books focused on the magic of [[Okito]] and Thayer. In 1992, selected items from the collection were displayed over three of the terminals of [[San Francisco International Airport]]. In 1994, Albo agreed to sell the entire collection to [[David Copperfield]], though some items were not transferred to Copperfield until 2010.&lt;ref name="Linking Ring Feb 2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Walker|first1=Byron|title=Dr. Robert J.

'''Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT)''' is a [[non-profit]] professional [[theatre]] company founded in 1993, and remains at the forefront of the industry in [[Asia]]. SRT's mission is to stage performances of high artistic merit, collaborating with the best talents from [[Singapore]] and around the world. The current Artistic and [[Managing Director]] is [[Gaurav Kripalani]].

The SRT group has five divisions: 
*Main Stage
*The Little Company 
*The Young Company
*Stage Two 
*KC Arts Centre - Home of SRT

SRT also conducts regular Education and Development programmes, as well as fundraising activities.

==Main Stage==
SRT caters to different [[audience]] segments, ensuring that a variety of performances are available with each season showcasing eight to ten [[play (theatre)|play]]s and [[musicals]].

''[[Forbidden City: Portrait of An Empress]]'' is one of the most iconic and successful original musicals staged by SRT in 2002 at the [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay]] as part of its opening festival. It was restaged in 2003, 2006 and is slated for another restaging in 2017. Other original musicals by SRT include ''A Twist of Fate'' (1998).

SRT was the first to stage some of the most critically acclaimed [[Broadway musicals]] in Singapore, such as ''[[RENT]]'' (2001) and ''[[Avenue Q]]'' (2008). Past productions also include ''[[The Pillowman]]'' (2007, 2008), ''[[God of Carnage]]'' (2012) and ''[[Venus in Fur]]'' (2013).

SRT produced ''The LKY Musical'' (2015) for Metropolitan Productions, which won the ST Life! Theatre Awards Production of the Year (Readers’ Choice).

===Shakespeare in the Park===
SRT has been presenting Shakespeare in the Park as part of its theatre tradition for close to two decades at [[Fort Canning Park]]. The first staging was in 1997 with ''[[Hamlet]]''. Shakespeare in the Park subsequently became a biennial event from 2007 with ''[[A Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', and has been an annual affair since 2011. In 2016, ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was the ninth Shakespeare in the Park production, which attracted close to 30,000 attendees.

The 2009 production of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' was nominated for Production of the Year at the ST Life! Theatre Awards.

Shakespeare in the Park makes theatre accessible to the masses, and has attracted more than 250,000 audience members over nine productions.

===International Productions===
SRT is a preferred partner for international touring productions, and has brought in stellar plays with Singapore being the only stop in Asia.	Highlights include:

2007: In collaboration with Esplanade – Theatre on the Bay, SRT brought the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] to Singapore for a production of [[William Shakespeare]]’s ''[[King Lear]]'' and [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'', starring Sir [[Ian McKellen]].

2009: SRT co-commissioned The Bridge Project, a three-year trans-Atlantic project by Oscar-winning [[Sam Mendes]]. The project premiered with ''[[The Winter’s Tale]]'' (2009), starring [[Ethan Hawke]], Simon Russell Beale and Rebecca Hall. This was followed by ''[[The Tempest]]'' (2010), and ''[[Richard III]]'' (2011) starring [[Kevin Spacey]].

2013: Together with Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, SRT presented 3 Titans of Theatre: ''Shun-kin'', ''Musashi'' and ''The Suit'', directed by three legendary directors, [[Simon McBurney]], [[Yukio Ninagawa]] and [[Peter Brook]] respectively.

2014: Written and directed by [[Yaël Farber]], Mies Julie is an adaptation of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'', presented by SRT and [[Cape Town]]'s [[Baxter Theatre Centre]] at the KC Arts Centre - Home of SRT.

2015: SRT co-commissioned Peter Brook’s new play – ''Battlefield'', based on the end of the Indian epic, ''[[The Mahabharata]]''. ''Battlefield'' premiered at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord]] in [[Paris]], followed by an international tour that premiered in Singapore.

==The Little Company==
To nurture the interest of the next generation, The Little Company was founded in 2001 as a division of SRT. Three to four shows are staged annually for children aged three and above, with one being a Mandarin production. The shows reach up to 70,000 children and adults annually, making The Little Company one of the most recognised family [[edutainment]] companies in Singapore.

Productions are written, designed and performed by professionals in the industry, based on the SRT ethos that children deserve the same quality of theatre as adults. Among several commissioned works by renowned international artistes, a [[trilogy]] of musicals for children (''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'', ''[[The Three Billy Goats Gruff]]'' and ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'') was written and composed by [[Laurence Olivier Award]]-winning duo [[George Stiles]] and [[Anthony Drewe]].

The Three Little Pigs has toured internationally, and was selected for the [[National Alliance for Musical Theatre Festival]] 2013 in [[New York City]].  The show embarked on a UK Tour in 2015, before its [[West End of London|West End]] premiere at London’s [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]]. It has played at The [[Greenwich Theatre]] in [[London]], The Emerald City Theatre in [[Chicago]], The [[Sydney Opera House]] in [[Australia]], as well as [[Finland]] and several major cities in [[China]].

SRT has also worked with London-based award-winning duo [[Jake Brunger and Pippa Cleary]] to present ''[[Red Riding Hood]]'' (2013) and ''Treasure Island'' (2015).

Other past productions include: ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'' (2005, 2007, 2011), 'Dr. Seuss’ ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' (2012, 2015) and ''Junior Claus'' (2014)

==The Young Company==
The Young Company is a two-year [[educational]] and [[performing]] platform for 16 to 25 year-olds. Twenty young people are selected from open [[auditions]] to form the core of the company and receive practical training in all aspects of theatre. The Young Company also launched a [[playwriting]] programme for [[youths]] in 2012.

Past productions include: ''[[The Trojan Women]]'' (2013), ''[[The Laramie Project]]'' (2014) and ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' (2015).

==Stage Two==
Stage Two is a theatre division that develops and stages original Singaporean work. It incorporates the Playwright Incubator Programme.

==KC Arts Centre - Home of SRT==
The KC Arts Centre – Home of SRT is located along the [[Singapore River]] at [[Robertson Quay]] along Merbau Road. The 380-seat theatre is a hub for the [[performing arts]]. This remains the only fully furnished [[Theater (structure)|venue]] run by a theatre company in Singapore.

The KC Arts Centre is named after the [[Kewalram Chanrai Group]] in recognition of their generous donation to SRT.

==Education and Development==

===Education Programme===
SRT’s Education Department is committed to bringing meaningful and relevant programmes to students, teachers and emerging theatre talents. SRT collaborates with leading artists and educators in Singapore and around the world to provide experiential learning for young people, skill development in drama as pedagogy for educators and mentorship for emerging talents for the industry.

===Student Education Fund===
The SRT Student Education Fund (SRTSEF) was set up in 2012 to reach young minds who may not otherwise have the opportunity to come to the theatre. The fund fully subsidises student [[ticket (admission)|ticket]]s to any production by the SRT Group, as well as covers transport costs for them, where needed, to and from the performance venue.

[[Beneficiaries]] include an [[Alma Mater]] chosen by the donor, [[underprivileged]] children from local schools, [[Charitable organization|charity]] organisations or student care centres, and Arts Schools.

===Residency Programme===

The National Arts Council and SRT has a shared focus on developing the young arts industry. SRT is one of the biggest contributors to audience development to ensure a platform for the industry’s development and reach.

Conceptualised in 2013, the SRT Residency Programme has four Singaporean individuals who are offered a 18-month position in a learning environment. They are mentored by SRT and its creative team, focusing on industry's areas of expertise  such as direction, stage design, producing and musical composing/arranging. The programme provides a monthly [[stipend]] to assist the Resident for the duration of the skill development programme.

==Fundraising==
SRT is a [[non-profit]] [[charitable organization|charity]] granted Institutions of A Public Character (IPC) status, and issues [[tax deductible]] receipts for [[donations]] made.

Friends of SRT is a [[donor]] programme that offers a host of benefits for donors that include complimentary tickets and backstage tours.

===The Theatre Ball===
The Theatre Ball is a vital [[fundraising]] event for SRT to continue to offer meaningful, high calibre theatre to a diverse audience and focus on grooming and nurturing the next generation of [[actors]], [[Film director|directors]] and [[designers]]. In 2016, proceeds from the Theatre Ball went to a variety of initiatives including the SRT Student Education Fund - which endeavours to give children from lower [[income]] families the opportunity to experience the magic of theatre.

==Plot==
The story is a [[first-person narrative]] told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan.

Rachel Watson is a 32-year-old alcoholic, reeling from the end of her marriage to Tom, who left her for another woman, Anna Watson. Rachel's drinking has caused her to lose her job; she frequently binges and has [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blackouts]]. While drunk, she often harasses Tom, though she has little or no memory of these acts once she sobers up. Tom is now married to Anna and has a daughter with her, Evie – a situation that fuels Rachel's self-destructive tendencies, as it was her inability to conceive a child that began her spiral into alcoholism. Rachel follows her old routine of taking the train to London everyday; her train slowly passes her old house, where Tom, Anna, and Evie now live. She also begins watching from the train an attractive couple who live a few houses away from Tom. She idealises their life (christening them "Jason" and "Jess"), though she has no idea that their life is far from perfect. The wife of the couple, Megan Hipwell ("Jess"), has a troubled past. She finds her life boring, and escapes from her troubles by taking a series of lovers. Megan has sought help by seeing a therapist, Dr. Kamal Abdic. Eventually, she reveals to him a dark secret she has never confided to anyone before.

Anna is young, beautiful, in love with Tom, and happy as a stay-at-home mother to the young Evie. While at first she enjoyed the idea of showing off to Rachel that Tom picked her over Rachel, she eventually becomes furious at Rachel's harassment of her family. One day, Rachel is stunned to see Megan kissing another man. The next day, after heavy drinking, Rachel awakens to find herself bloody and injured, with no memories of the night before. She learns that Megan is missing, and is questioned by the police after Anna reports having seen her drunkenly staggering around the night of Megan's disappearance. Rachel becomes interested in the case and tells the police she thinks Megan was having an affair. She then contacts Megan's husband, Scott ("Jason") and tells him as well, lying that she and Megan were friends. Rachel learns that the man she saw kissing Megan was Kamal.

Rachel contacts Kamal, lying about her identity to get close to him and learn more about him. She makes a therapy appointment with him to see if he can help her recall the events that happened during her blackout that night. While Kamal suspects nothing, Rachel begins to gain insight into her life by speaking with him, inadvertently benefiting from the therapy. Her connections to Scott and Kamal, though built on lies, make her feel more important. She ends up not drinking for several days at a time but always relapses. Meanwhile, she continues to call, visit, and harass Tom. Megan's body is found; she is revealed to have been pregnant, and her unborn child was fathered by neither Scott nor Kamal. As Scott discovers Rachel's lies and lashes out at her, her memories become clearer. Rachel remembers seeing Megan get into Tom's car. Anna discovers that Tom and Megan were having an affair.

Rachel begins trusting her own memories more, and realises that many of the crazy things Tom told her she did while drunk never really happened. He had been [[gaslighting]] her for years, which made her question her sanity. Armed with this sad realisation, and the knowledge that he must have been the one who killed Megan, Rachel warns Anna. When Anna confronts him, Tom confesses to murdering Megan after she threatened to reveal that he had gotten her pregnant. Anna is cowed, fearing for her daughter's safety. Tom tries to beat and intimidate Rachel into keeping silent but she defies him and fights back. Knowing he is about to kill her, Rachel stabs Tom in the neck with a corkscrew. Anna helps Rachel make sure that he dies from the wound. When the police arrive, former adversaries Rachel and Anna support each other by co-ordinating their stories to explain their actions as self-defence. Finally free, Rachel decides to quit drinking and move on with her life. &lt;!-- This is a UK novel, "defense" is the correct spelling. --&gt;

==Reception==
''The Girl on the Train'' received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. In 2015 it became the fastest-selling adult hardcover novel in history, and it spent over four months on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller List following its release.&lt;ref name="db1"/&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the novel with a starred review, writing that "even the most astute readers will be in for a shock as Hawkins slowly unspools the facts, exposing the harsh realities of love and obsession's inescapable links to violence." Subsequently, the novel was honoured by ''Kirkus Reviews'' as one of the best books of 2015, in the fiction category. The book also won the 2015 [[Goodreads]] Choice Award in the category Mystery &amp; Thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2015 |title=The 2015 Goodreads Choice Awards |website=Goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a less positive review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Jean Hanff Korelitz questioned the novel's narrative structure and criticised the protagonist for behaving "illogically, self-destructively, and narcissistically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/books/review/the-girl-on-the-train-by-paula-hawkins.html |title='The Girl on the Train' by Paula Hawkins |first=Jean Hanff |last=Korelitz |date=30 January 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Girl on the Train'' has been compared frequently to ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'' by [[Gillian Flynn]], as both novels employ unreliable narrators and deal with suburban life.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; Paula Hawkins has waved these comparisons off, however, saying in an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': "Amy Dunne is a [[psychopath]], an incredibly controlling and manipulative, smart, cunning woman. [Rachel is] just a mess who can't do anything right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girl-train-author-shoots-down-932781 |title='Girl on the Train' Author Shoots Down 'Gone Girl' Comparisons |date=28 September 2016 |first=Tatiana |last=Siegel |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transformation playing card''' (sometimes referred to as a transformation deck when assembled into a complete set) is a type of [[playing card]] where an artist incorporates the [[Pip (counting)|pips]] of the non-[[face card]]s into an artistic design.  In a classical transformation playing card, the pips retain their standard position and coloration on the card.  In some variations, the pips may be different in size, location or color.  There is some debate as to whether these cards, often referred to as semi-transformed, should be considered true transformation playing cards.&lt;ref name=gamesetal&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Transformation Playing Cards - what are they?| work =| publisher =Games et al.| date =| url =http://www.gamesetal.net/transformation-cards/html/transformations.html| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-25| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930163303/http://www.gamesetal.net/transformation-cards/html/transformations.html| archivedate =2007-09-30| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:7 of hearts - metastasis.JPG|thumb|left|150px|7 of Hearts from ''Metastasis'']]
By the 19th century, the standard form for playing cards had become fixed in most of Europe and America.  French cards used hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs.  German cards used acorns, leaves, hearts and bells.  It was at this time that designers in Germany, France and England began to draw small figures around the pips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Bauwens  | first = Jan  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Comic Carten  | date =  | year =  | url =  | accessdate =  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first transformation playing cards were created by D.W. Soltan and D. Berger in 1801 as illustrations for a German edition of [[Hudibras]].  The cards illustrated were the 2 of hearts, 3 of hearts, 5 of hearts and 8 of hearts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Field  | first = Albert  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Transformation Playing Cards  | publisher = U.S. Games Systems, Inc.  | date = 1987  | location =  | pages = 6–7  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-88079-033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1803, John Nixon published the first complete set (52 cards) of transformed cards.

In 1865 Dean and Son published a deck in which the pips have been changed in both size and location, being placed at the artist's whim.  Collectors debate as to whether or not this deck should be considered a transformation deck, due to these differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Field  | first = Albert  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Transformation Playing Cards  | publisher = U.S. Games Systems, Inc.  | date = 1987  | location =  | pages = 113–115  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-88079-033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dean and Son deck remained the only deck to manipuate the pips until the 1970s, when the practice gained some popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Field  | first = Albert  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Transformation Playing Cards  | publisher = U.S. Games Systems, Inc.  | date = 1987  | location =  | pages = 199  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-88079-033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, cards that do not strictly adhere to standard pip placement, size and color are referred to as semi-transformation playing cards.  

An article entitled "Playing Card Squiggles." was published in the December 1910 issue of ''[[Strand Magazine]]''.  Several ''Cotta'' cards were pictured, erroneously attributed to an unnamed French artist.  ''Strand'' subsequently asked its readers to submit their own designs for card squiggles, which the magazine periodically published.  [[John Butler Yeats]] was one of the first to contribute a card design to the magazine.  The feature remained popular for some time.&lt;ref name=gamesetal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Field  | first = Albert  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Transformation Playing Cards  | publisher = U.S. Games Systems, Inc.  | date = 1987  | location =  | pages = 187–191  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-88079-033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3 of Clubs - Key to the Kingdom.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''[[Three Blind Mice]]'' as portrayed on the 3 of Clubs from ''The Key to the Kingdom'']]

Some have estimated that around 70 different transformation decks were created throughout the entire nineteenth century, which by modern standards is a relatively small number. This period of time also witnessed progression with this art-form. By the late 19th century more colourful and creative transformation decks by Vanity Fair and Harlequin appeared, which showed pips incorporated into artwork that depicted people dining, skating, playing tennis and riding bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;https://playingcarddecks.com/blogs/all-in/creative-genius-of-transformation-playing-cards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary designs==
Transformation playing cards like ''Art for the Earth'' by The [[Friends of the Earth]] and ''Under the Sea'' by the Marine Stewardship Counsel, are created for charity purposes, with different artists contributing art for each card.  Similarly, other collective projects like ''Ultimate Deck'' from Dan &amp; Dave and Stranger &amp; Stranger or the series from Black Rock Collective brings multiple artists together to create semi-transformation decks.

One of the more notable contemporary sets is the award winning ''The Key to the Kingdom,'' a semi-transformation deck commissioned by London's [[V&amp;A Museum of Childhood]] and created by Tony Meeuwissen.  It won the [[WH Smith Literary Award]] for best illustration and The Designers and Art Directory Association of London gold award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Tony Shows His Tricks  | publisher = South Wales Argus  | url = http://archive.southwalesargus.co.uk/2002/10/24/70236.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-02  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209013418/http://archive.southwalesargus.co.uk/2002/10/24/70236.html  | archivedate = 2010-02-09  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This set of cards was created around the theme of [[nursery rhyme]]s and [[poem]]s.  The cards were sold with a book containing each poem and a picture of the corresponding card on the opposite page. Additionally, the deck was constructed as a [[puzzle contest]] laid out in the form of an original poem.  The poem gave clues to pick certain cards, which then could be decrypted into a secret message. The prize of $10,000 and a golden key was won by Susan Kavanagh of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Key to the Kingdom - Solution | publisher = The Armchair Treasure Hunt Club | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | url = http://www.treasureclub.net/publichunts/keytothekingdom/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Kickstarter]] and other crowdfunded websites, individual artists are more easily able to bring transformation and semi-transformation decks to the public.  Notable examples include the series of semi-transformation decks from Emmanuel Jose (including ''Curator'' and ''Clipped Wings'') and Dave Ufford's traditional transformation EclecDeck.

'''''Trials HD''''' is an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game developed by [[RedLynx]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios (game studio)|Microsoft Game Studios]]. It was released on August 12, 2009 as part of the second annual [[Summer of Arcade|Xbox Live Summer of Arcade]] and was later re-released in a retail pack alongside ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]'' and ''[['Splosion Man]]'' in April 2011. It is a [[2.5D]] [[puzzle video game|puzzle]]/[[racing video game|racing]] game. The player must guide a [[Motorcycle trials|trial motorcycle]] with exaggerated physics through various obstacles to reach each stage's finish line. On September 6, 2012 it was announced that a [[Microsoft Windows]] version of ''Trials HD'' would be bundled inside a special version of ''[[Trials Evolution]]'', dubbed ''Trials Evolution: Gold Edition''—although this version changes the physics of the game. It is the third game in the series. On February 11, 2016, [[Microsoft]] added ''Trials HD'' as part of its backwards compatibility program for [[Xbox One]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:TrialsHDscreenshot.png|thumb|left|In ''Trials HD'' players must manipulate the rider and motorcycle to traverse obstacles and objects found throughout each level.]]
In ''Trials HD'' the player controls a rider on a physics-based motorcycle from the start of the level to the end while navigating a number of [[Obstacle course|obstacles]]. The objective is to complete the course as fast as possible and with as few crashes, known in the game as faults, as possible.&lt;ref name="teamxbox preview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://previews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/2385/Trials-HD/p1/ |publisher=[[TeamXbox]] |date=2009-07-20 |first=Dale |last=Nardozzi |title=Trials HD Hands-On Preview (Xbox 360) |accessdate=2010-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010080746/http://previews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/2385/Trials-HD/p1/ |archivedate=2010-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], but is played on a [[2.5D|2D]] plane, so the rider can only move forwards and backwards.  Players can also control the bike's pitch at slow speeds or while in the air.&lt;ref name="gamespot handson"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/driving/trialshd/news.html?sid=6213216&amp;mode=previews |title=Trials HD Hands-On |date=2009-07-10 |first=Guy |last=Cocker |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a variety of courses in a range of difficulties from beginner to extreme. There are a total of thirty-five courses in the game, and players can replay completed courses to attempt a faster time. Tournament mode sees the player attempt to complete a number of courses in sequence, trying to achieve a fast overall time with minimal faults. Twelve skill games can also be unlocked which place the player in different challenges.&lt;ref name="videogamer review"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[Videogamer.com]] |accessdate=2010-10-12 |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/trials/review.html |first=Tim |last=Orry |title=Trials HD Review |date=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include things such as riding inside or on top of a large spherical cage, achieving as many flips as possible within a set time limit, or towing a trailer with two large bombs as far as possible while keeping them from exploding by impact. Players earn medals based on their completion time, number of faults, and in the case of skill games, other specialized criteria.&lt;ref name="gamespot handson" /&gt;

When connected to [[Xbox Live]], the player can view their performance in relation to players in their friends list.  This is done by an in-game meter which displays the closest friend to the player's time which adjusts based on whether the player is leading or trailing the friend's course time.&lt;ref name="teamxbox preview" /&gt; ''Trials HD'' includes a level editor that allows players to construct their own courses and share them with players in their friends list. Every course in the game was created using the level editor, which allows users to create professional-quality levels. It also features [[Game ladder|leaderboards]] for each of the game's courses and modes.&lt;ref name="videogamer review" /&gt;  For each course the fastest five thousand times are able to be viewed as replays. During the replay the viewer can view that recorded player's controller presses, allowing them to learn patterns and skills from it.&lt;ref name="videogamer review" /&gt;

==Development and marketing==
''Trials HD'' is the second [[2.5D]] game in the ''Trials'' series, following ''[[Trials 2: Second Edition]]''.  The game is based on the popular [[Browser game|flash games]] from the same series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redlynx.com/index.php?id=520 |publisher=[[RedLynx]] |accessdate=2011-02-20 |title=RedLynx Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was released on August 12, 2009 as part of the second annual [[Xbox Live Arcade|Xbox Live Summer of Arcade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/100/1002344p1.html |title=Summer of Arcade Dates Revealed |publisher=[[IGN]] |first=Daemon |last=Hatfield |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712044556/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/100/1002344p1.html |archivedate=2009-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  RedLynx developed ''Trials HD'' using an in-house engine coupled with a modified version of [[Bullet (software)|''Bullet Physics Library'']] which was optimized to utilize the Xbox 360's CPU and vector units.  RedLynx applied the physics system to give a realistic feel, but to maintain the enjoyment of a video game, they tweaked the physics to "bend the reality in just the proper way."&lt;ref name="trialshd"/&gt; RedLynx saw this as a "crucial thing in making Trials such a fun and addictive game"&lt;ref name="trialshd" /&gt; Previous ''Trials'' games used a much simpler in-house physics engine, however for ''Trials HD'' developers opted to use the ''Bullet'' library and devote one of the 360's cpu cores entirely to physics.&lt;ref name="eurogamer tech interview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-tech-interview-trials-hd |title=Tech Interview: Trials HD |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-10-11 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Developers also improved on the ''Trials 2'' engine by adding more advanced lighting and real time soft shadows.&lt;ref name="eurogamer tech interview" /&gt;

[[File:TrialsHD levelEditor.png|thumb|''Trials HD'' levels were created using the same in-game editor which players can also use to create and share their own levels.]]
Levels created for ''Trials HD'' were designed using the same in-game level editor that allows players to make user-based content.&lt;ref name="eurogamer tech interview" /&gt; All of the tools and abilities the developers had at their disposal can be used by the community.&lt;ref name="eurogamer tech interview" /&gt; In an interview with [[Eurogamer]], RedLynx's Lead Programmer Sebastian Aaltonen stated that there were no plans to port the game to other platforms, adding "''Trials HD'' technology has been specially designed for the Xbox 360 feature-set."&lt;ref name="eurogamer tech interview" /&gt;  The voice work for the game was done by three [[Pennsylvania]]n voice actors, [[Rake Yohn]], [[Brandon DiCamillo]], and Art Webb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DymAMwFWSFI |accessdate=2010-10-12 |publisher=RedLynxTV via [[YouTube]] |date=2010-07-30 |title=RedLynx TV - Episode 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trials HD'' was announced June 1, 2009 at a Microsoft luncheon during [[E3 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/988/988799p1.html |title=Trials HD Coming to XBLA |publisher=IGN |first=Charles |last=Onyett |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404111335/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/988/988799p1.html |archivedate=2012-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was released August 12, 2009 as part of the Xbox Live Summer of Arcade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://games.ign.com/articles/101/1012654p1.html |first=Ryan |last=Geddes |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2011-02-06 |title=Out This Week: August 10-14, 2009 |date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 23, 2009 the first [[downloadable content]], known as the ''Trials HD Big Pack'', was released.

The ''Trials HD Big Thrills Pack'' features forty new courses made by RedLynx, but unlike the ''Trials HD Big Pack'' it also features ten user created courses. These ten courses are to be decided from entries to the Big Thrills Track Creation Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redlynxgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=4225 |title=Trials HD Big Thrills Track Creation Competition |author=jenkki |publisher=RedLynx |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2010-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top three contestants were awarded prizes of $5,000, $3,000, and $1,000, respectively.&lt;ref name="dough"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/20/trials-hd-dlc-to-deliver-big-thrills-later-this-year/ |accessdate=2010-10-12 |publisher=Joystiq |date=2010-07-20 |title=Trials HD DLC to deliver 'Big Thrills' later this year |first=David |last=Hinkle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners were announced on November 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="bigthrills info"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://microsoft.promo.eprize.com/trialshd/ |publisher=[[Microsoft]] and RedLynx |accessdate=2010-10-12 |title=Big Thrills!

Reviewers generally praised the game's replay value.  [[IGN]]'s Daemon Hatfield remarked that ''Trials HD'' had "truckloads of content" adding that the game's features "really take advantage of what can be done with Xbox Live."&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/101/1012642p1.html |title=Trials HD Review: This is no easy rider |first=Daemon |last=Hatfield |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214065945/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/101/1012642p1.html |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameTrailers]] staff also praised the amount of content in the game stating that it was an excellent value for the price.&lt;ref name="gametrailers review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=11618 |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |accessdate=2010-10-11 |date=2009-08-12 |title=Trials HD: Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]] stated that "it's a game built for endless replay and community expansion beyond that."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/trials-hd-review |title= Trials HD Xbox 360 Review |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |publisher=Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's leaderboards, especially the ability to have a view of where other players were at a certain time during a run, were widely praised by Brad Shoemaker of [[Giant Bomb]].&lt;ref name="gb review"&gt;{{cite web |title=Trials HD Review |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/trials-hd/61-26923/reviews/ |publisher=[[Giant Bomb]] |accessdate=2010-07-22 |date=2010-09-23 |first=Brad |last=Shoemaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary criticisms given by critics was ''Trials HD''{{'}}s steep difficulty curve. Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb stated that he wished the difficulty curve was "a little smoother."&lt;ref name="gb review" /&gt; Daemon Hatfield of IGN further commented on the game's difficulty, stating "It's when you get stuck trying to get over some small hill and you see that fault counter in the top left corner counting up [...] that the game starts being more frustrating than fun."&lt;ref name="IGN review" /&gt; [[GameSpy]]'s Anthony Gallegos added that the "limited number of tries per track feels arbitrary."&lt;ref name="gamespy review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/trials-hd/1013512p1.html |title=The Consensus: Trials HD Review |accessdate=2010-10-13 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |date=2009-08-12 |publisher=[[GameSpy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also critical of the game's file sharing system, noting that instead of a repository from which to download tracks that sharing is limited to those in the player's friends list.&lt;ref name="gamespy review" /&gt; Tom Mc Shea of [[GameSpot]] also agreed that the difficulty on the latter tracks was "ridiculously hard" and shared disappointment in the file sharing system.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/driving/trialshd/review.html |title=Trials HD Review |first=Tom |last=Mc Shea |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2010-10-13 |date=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2119">A '''visual narrative''' (also '''visual storytelling''')&lt;ref&gt;Tony C. Caputo, ''Visual Storytelling: The Art and Technique'', Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; is a story told primarily through the use of visual media. The story may be told using still [[photography]], [[illustration]], or [[video]], and can be enhanced with [[graphics]], music, voice and other audio.

==Overview&lt;!--'Visual narratology' redirects here--&gt;==
The term "visual narrative" has been used to describe several genres of visual storytelling, from news and information ([[photojournalism]], the [[photo essay]], the [[documentary film]]) to entertainment (art, movies, television, [[comic book]]s, the [[graphic novel]]). In short, any kind of a story, told visually, is a visual narrative.

The visual narrative has also been of interest to the academic community as scholars, thinkers and educators have sought to understand the impact and power of image and narrative in individuals and societies. The corresponding discipline is called '''visual [[narratology]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.imageandnarrative.be Image &lt;nowiki&gt;[&amp;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Narrative]'' – "a peer-reviewed [[e-journal]] on visual narratology in the broadest sense of the term".&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing characteristics of the visual narrative include:
*a persuasive story with a point of view
*high quality images, still or moving
*subject matter with pressing social, environmental, or spiritual value
*an appeal (explicit or implicit) for transformation in attitudes and behaviors

A '''whimbling iron''' is a [[bell clapper]] made from [[ductile iron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ductile.org/didata/default.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally bell clappers were standard cast [[grey iron]] with a razor-like crystalline structure that led to sudden catastrophic failure over time. The standard clapper is distinguished by the experienced ear as a whefting iron.  Whilst some believe that the advent of "health and safety" led to the search for an alternative, it is more likely that the ability to forge the bottom end ready for use practically died out early in [[World War II]].  Some attempts at composite clappers were made, but advances in casting technology, driven as much by the motor industry as by the war, resulted in the adoption of spheroidal graphite iron castings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=21]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wisconsin State Fair''' is an annual event held at the [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]] in [[West Allis, Wisconsin]], a suburb of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. The modern [[state fair|fair]] takes place in August (occasionally beginning late July) and lasts 11 days.

==History==
The first Wisconsin State Fair was held in 1851 in [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]], with approximately 13,000 to 18,000 people in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wistatefair.com/fair_info/history.html History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by the state’s Agricultural Society, it was held on a six-acre plot along the banks of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]]. It featured a 200-pound squash and a quarter-acre plowing competition with teams of horses and oxen. It was reportedly the largest gathering in Wisconsin history.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.wistatefair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Wisconsin-State-Fair-History.pdf Wisconsin State Fair History]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the second fair was held in Milwaukee in 1852, fairgoers took their carriages for rides around the Cold Spring Race Course.

Abraham Lincoln was invited to give the annual oration at the fair in 1859. He spoke on the principles of free labor - farmers and their families working for themselves without the use of hired labor - and of the interconnectedness of farmers, merchants, and other businesses. He advised farmers to embrace new methods of agriculture, with the goal of raising the standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner. ''The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery''. New York: Norton, 2010, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin P. Thomas]]. ''Abraham Lincoln: A Biography''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1952, pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fair added new attractions each year, and in 1869, there was a fire engine demonstration where boxes, barrels and a large wooden building were set aflame. For decades, the fair moved from city to city, including Janesville, Watertown, Fond du Lac, Madison and Milwaukee, until 1892, when it was first held at its permanent and present location at Wisconsin State Fair Park.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

During the 2011 fair, some adolescent African Americans formed a violent [[flash mob]] and began attacking fairgoers, with some witnesses stating that the attacks were racially-motivated.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 August 2014 |title=Wis.

== The Milwaukee Mile ==
[[The Milwaukee Mile]] is a one-mile paved [[oval track racing|oval]] racing circuit on the grounds of the State Fair. It is the oldest continuously-operated motor racing circuit in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wisc. State Fair Park http://www.milwaukeemile.com/event_planning/mile.html Feb. 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Racing or exhibition events are often held on the circuit in conjunction with the state fair.

== Events and entertainment ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Yearly features at the fair include a wide variety of vendors, many local and national bands, the [[Kids From Wisconsin]], and a large assortment of food and drink, including [[Profiterole|cream puffs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 August 2013 |title=Which State Fair Food Is Your Guilty Pleasure? |url=https://www.pbs.org/food/features/state-fair-foods/ |website=pbs.org |publisher= Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=22 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are one of the fair's most popular attractions.  In 2010, the Wisconsin State Fair introduced Comet 2, a forty-foot roller coaster.  New in 2012, the Wisconsin State Fair took over the Midway, creating Spin City, a collection of independently contracted rides including the Sizzler, the Freak Out, and the Stratosphere, a 200-foot-tall swing ride.

The Main Stage features headline performance every evening of the fair.  Many local bands can also be seen on smaller stages and pavilions located throughout the grounds.

Agricultural exhibits of horses, cattle, sheep, chickens and other animals are featured every year at the fair.

The Wisconsin State Fair is also home of the Wisconsin Wine Garden.  Established in 1996 by the then ten member-wineries of the [[Wisconsin Winery Association]], the Wine Garden features wines from dozens of Wisconsin wineries.
