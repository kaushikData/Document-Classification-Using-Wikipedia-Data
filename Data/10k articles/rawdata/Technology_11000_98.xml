      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17064">[[File:Cuttlefish color.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cephalopod]] molluscs such as this [[cuttlefish]] can change color rapidly for [[signalling theory|signalling]] or to [[camouflage|match their backgrounds]].]]

'''Active camouflage''' or '''adaptive camouflage''' is [[camouflage]] that adapts, often rapidly, to the surroundings of an object such as an animal or military vehicle. In theory, active camouflage could provide perfect concealment from visual detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKee, Kent W. |author2=Tack, David W.|year=2007 |title=Active Camouflage For Infantry Headwear Applications |publisher=HumanSystems |pages=iii |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA477147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active camouflage is used in several groups of animals, including [[reptile]]s on land, and [[cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]s and [[flatfish]] in the sea. Animals achieve active camouflage both by [[Camouflage#Crypsis by changing skin pattern.2C colour|color change]] and (among marine animals such as squid) by [[counter-illumination]], with the use of [[bioluminescence]].

Military counter-illumination camouflage was first investigated during [[World War II]] for marine use. More recent research has aimed to achieve [[crypsis]] by using cameras to sense the visible background, and by controlling [[Peltier panel]]s or coatings that can vary their appearance.

==In research==
[[File:Mediated-reality-easel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Illustrating the concept: active image capture and re-display creates an "illusory transparency", also known as "optical camouflage"]]

Active camouflage provides concealment by making an object not merely generally similar to its surroundings, but effectively [[invisibility|invisible]] with "illusory transparency" through accurate [[mimicry]], and by changing the appearance of the object as changes occur in its background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKee, Kent W. |author2=Tack, David W.|year=2007 |title=Active Camouflage For Infantry Headwear Applications |publisher=HumanSystems |page=1 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA477147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early research===
[[File:Principle of Yehudi Lights with Avenger head-on view.jpg|thumb|[[Yehudi Lights]] prototype raised the average brightness of a [[Grumman Avenger]] from a dark shape to the same as the sky.]]
{{main article|Diffused lighting camouflage|Yehudi lights}}

Military interest in active camouflage has its origins in Second World War studies of [[counter-illumination]]. The first of these was the so-called [[diffused lighting camouflage]] tested on [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]] [[corvettes]] including [[HMCS Rimouski (K121)|HMCS Rimouski]]. This was followed in the armed forces of the United States of America with the airborne [[Yehudi lights]] project, and trials in ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[US Navy]].&lt;ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/NMQ_MNQ/researches_recherches/diffusedLighting_camouflageLumineux/index-eng.asp |title=Naval Museum of Quebec |publisher=Royal Canadian Navy |work=Diffused Lighting and its use in the Chaleur Bay |accessdate=January 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522231113/http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/NMQ_MNQ/researches_recherches/diffusedLighting_camouflageLumineux/index-eng.asp |archivedate=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yehudi lights project placed low-intensity blue lights on aircraft. As skies are bright, an unilluminated aircraft (of any color) might be rendered visible. By emitting a small, measured amount of blue light, the aircraft's average brightness better matches that of the sky, and the aircraft is able to fly closer to its target before being detected.&lt;ref name=NDRC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/221102.pdf | work=Visibility Studies and Some Applications in the Field of Camouflage | publisher=Office of Scientific Research and Development, National Defence Research Committee | title=Camouflage of Sea-Search Aircraft | date=1946 | accessdate=February 12, 2013 |last1=Bush |first1=Vannevar |last2=Conant |first2=James |last3=Harrison |first3=George |display-authors=2 | pages=225–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible technologies===

Active camouflage may now develop using [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs) and other technologies which allow for images to be projected onto irregularly shaped surfaces. Using visual data from a camera, an object could perhaps be camouflaged well enough to avoid detection by the human eye and optical sensors when stationary. Camouflage is weakened by motion, but active camouflage could still make moving targets more difficult to see. However, active camouflage works best in one direction at a time, requiring knowledge of the relative positions of the observer and the concealed object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKee, Kent W. |author2=Tack, David W.|year=2007 |title=Active Camouflage For Infantry Headwear Applications |publisher=HumanSystems |pages=10–11 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA477147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An invisibility cloak using optical camouflage by Susumu Tachi.jpg|thumb|An [[cloaking device|invisibility cloak]] using active camouflage by Susumu Tachi. Left: The cloth seen without a special device. Right: The same cloth seen through the half-mirror projector part of the Retro-Reflective Projection Technology]]

Active camouflage technology exists only in theory and proof-of-concept prototypes. In 2003 researchers at the [[University of Tokyo]] under [[Susumu Tachi]] created a prototype active camouflage system using material impregnated with [[Retroreflector|retroreflective]] glass beads. The viewer stands in front of the cloth viewing the cloth through a transparent glass plate. A video camera behind the cloth captures the background behind the cloth. A video projector projects this image on to the glass plate which is angled so that it acts as a [[Pepper's ghost|partial mirror]] reflecting a small portion of the projected light onto the cloth. The retroreflectors in the cloth reflect the image back towards the glass plate which being only weakly reflecting allows most of the retroreflected light to pass through to be seen by the viewer. The system only works when seen from a certain angle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/2003/inventions/invinvisible.html Time magazine: Invisibility]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phased-array optics]] (PAO) would implement active camouflage, not by producing a two-dimensional image of background scenery on an object, but by [[Computer-generated holography|computational holography]] to produce a three-dimensional hologram of background scenery on an object to be concealed. Unlike a two-dimensional image, the holographic image would appear to be the actual scenery behind the object independent of viewer distance or view angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Wowk B | authorlink = Brian Wowk | chapter = Phased Array Optics | title = Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance | editor = BC Crandall | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year=  1996 | pages = 147–160 | isbn = 0-262-03237-6 | url = http://www.phased-array.com/1996-Book-Chapter.html | accessdate = 2007-02-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070227231535/http://www.phased-array.com/1996-Book-Chapter.html| archivedate= 27 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military prototypes===

In 2010, the Israeli company Eltics created an early prototype of a system of tiles for infrared camouflage of vehicles. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their ''[[Adaptiv]]'' infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal [[Peltier panel]]s to cover the sides of a tank. The panels are rapidly heated and cooled to match either the temperature of the vehicle's surroundings, or one of the objects in the thermal cloaking system's "library" such as a truck, car or large rock.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schechter |first1=Erik |title=Whatever Happened to Counter-Infrared Camouflage? |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a9172/whatever-happened-to-counter-infrared-camouflage-15648261/ |publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=19 February 2017 |date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adaptiv-Cloak&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baesystems.com/magazine/BAES_019786/adaptiv--a-cloak-of-invisibility | title=Adaptiv-A Cloak of Invisibility | publisher=BAE Systems |year=2011 | accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14788009 | title=BBC News Technology | publisher=BBC | work=Tanks test infrared invisibility cloak | date=5 September 2011 | accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Squid Counterillumination.png|thumb|[[Counter-illumination]] [[camouflage]] of the firefly squid, ''[[Watasenia scintillans]]'' uses [[bioluminescence]] to match brightness and colour of the sea surface above.]]
{{See also|List of camouflage methods|Category:Animals that can change color}}

Active camouflage is used in several groups of animals including cephalopod molluscs,&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"/&gt; fish,&lt;ref name="Sumner"/&gt; and reptiles.&lt;ref name="Wallin"/&gt; There are two mechanisms of active camouflage in animals: [[Counterillumination camouflage]],&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"/&gt; and [[Camouflage#Changeable skin pattern / colour|color change]].&lt;ref name="Wallin"/&gt;

===Counterillumination===
{{main|Counterillumination}}

Counterillumination is camouflage using the production of light to blend in against a lit background. In the sea, light comes down from the surface, so when marine animals are seen from below, they appear darker than the background. Some species of cephalopod, such as the [[Abralia veranyi|eye-flash squid]] and the [[firefly squid]], produce light in [[photophores]] on their undersides to match the background.&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History | work=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi (with photograph) | accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bioluminescence]] is common among marine animals, so counterillumination may be widespread, though light has other functions, including attracting prey and signalling.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1251214 | last1=Young | first1=R.E. | last2=Roper | first2=C.F. | year=1976 | title=Bioluminescent countershading in midwater animals: evidence from living squid | journal=Science | volume=191 | issue=4231 | pages=1046–8 | pmid=1251214 | bibcode=1976Sci...191.1046Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haddock&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haddock |first=S.

===Color change===
[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg|thumb|Four frames of a [[peacock flounder]] show its ability to match its coloration to the sea bed around and beneath it.]]

Color change permits camouflage against different backgrounds. Many cephalopods including [[octopus]]es, [[cuttlefish]], and [[squid]]s, and some terrestrial amphibians and reptiles including [[chameleon]]s and [[Dactyloidae|anole]]s can rapidly change color and pattern, though the major reasons for this include [[Signalling theory|signalling]], not only camouflage.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Peter.

Active camouflage by color change is used by many bottom-living [[flatfish]] such as [[plaice]], [[sole (fish)|sole]], and [[flounder]] that actively copy the patterns and colors of the seafloor below them.&lt;ref name="Sumner"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400100405/abstract;jsessionid=6BB19AA1C433D5D836497E8E911D45B9.d02t02 | title=The adjustment of flatfishes to various backgrounds: A study of adaptive color change | author=Sumner, Francis B. | journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |date=May 1911 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=409–506 | doi=10.1002/jez.1400100405}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tropical flounder ''[[Bothus|Bothus ocellatus]]'' can match its pattern to "a wide range of background textures" in 2–8 seconds.&lt;ref name="Ramachandran"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v379/n6568/abs/379815a0.html | title=Letters to Nature | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | work=Rapid adaptive camouflage in tropical flounders | date=29 February 1996 | accessdate=20 January 2012 | author=Ramachandran, V.S. | author2=C.

[[Image:Travellers' Axe - Project Gutenberg eText 14861.jpg|thumb|300 pcx|right|An 1872 diagram of an early ice axe, showing how the alpenstock was modified by the addition of a pick and an adze]]

An '''alpenstock''' is a long wooden pole with an iron spike tip, used by shepherds for travel on snowfields and glaciers in the [[Alps]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. It is the antecedent of the modern [[ice axe]]. 

French-speaking climbers called this item a "baton". [[Josias Simler]], a Swiss professor of theology at what later became the [[University of Zurich]], published the first treatise on the Alps, entitled ''De Alpibus commentarius''. [[Thomas Graham Brown|T. Graham Brown]] described Simler's observations on gear for travel over ice and snow in the mountains: "In 1574, Simler published a commentary on the Alps which is remarkable for its description of the technique of [[glacier]] travel and for its proof that Simler himself had practical experience.  He describes the alpenstock, [[crampons]], the use of the rope, the necessity of [[Photokeratitis|protecting the eyes]] on snow by veils or spectacles; and he mentions that the leader on snow covered glaciers sounds for hidden crevasses with a pole." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=T. Graham|title=Mountaineering|editor=Spencer, Sydney|publisher=Maurice Press|date=2008|edition=reprint|isbn=978-1-4437-8139-8|orig-year=1934}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 28, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yvon Chouinard]] quotes Simler as writing, "To counteract the slipperiness of the ice, they firmly attach to their feet shoes resembling the shoes of horses, with three sharp spikes in them, so that they may be able to stand firmly.  In some places they use sticks tipped with iron, by leaning upon which they climb steep slopes.  These are called alpine sticks, and are principally in use among the shepherds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chouinard|first=Yvon|title=Climbing Ice|publisher=Sierra Club Books with American Alpine Club|location=San Francisco|date=1978|pages=15|isbn=0-87156-208-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 1786, [[Jacques Balmat]] and [[Michel-Gabriel Paccard]] made the first ascent of [[Mont Blanc]]. Balmat, a [[chamois]] hunter and crystal collector, had experience with high mountain travel, and Paccard had made previous attempts to climb the peak. Illustrations show Balmat carrying two separate tools (whose respective functions would later be re-assigned to the ice axe): an alpenstock (or baton), and a small axe that could be used to chop steps on icy slopes.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, seeing that the traditional but unwieldy alpenstock might be a useful aid to climb steep slopes of snow or ice, Victorian alpinists fastened a sharpened blade (the pick) to the top of the alpenstock; this was used to provide stability. On the opposite end, a flattened blade was placed (the adze), which was used for cutting steps in the snow or ice, an essential technique for moving over steep icy slopes before the advent of the [[crampon]]. Gradually, the alpenstock evolved into the ice axe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebmc.co.uk/Feature.aspx?id=1791 History of the ice axe] thebmc.co.uk, accessed 13 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Tramp Abroad 1880 cover.jpg|right|thumb|First edition cover of A Tramp Abroad by Mark Twain.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most of the people, both male and female, are in walking costume, and carry alpenstocks. Evidently, it is not considered safe to go about in Switzerland, even in town, without an alpenstock. If the tourist forgets and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock, he goes back and gets it, and stands it up in the corner. When his touring in Switzerland is finished, he does not throw that broomstick away, but lugs it home with him, to the far corners of the earth, although this costs him more trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could. You see, the alpenstock is his trophy; his name is burned upon it; and if he has climbed a hill, or jumped a brook, or traversed a brickyard with it, he has the names of those places burned upon it, too."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thus it is his regimental flag, so to speak, and bears the record of his achievements. It is worth three francs when he buys it, but a bonanza could not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it. There are artisans all about Switzerland whose trade it is to burn these things upon the alpenstock of the tourist. And observe, a man is respected in Switzerland according to his alpenstock. I found I could get no attention there, while I carried an unbranded one. However, branding is not expensive, so I soon remedied that. The effect upon the next detachment of tourists was very marked. I felt repaid for my trouble." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Thus+it+is+his+regimental+flag,+so+to+speak,+and+bears+the+record+of+his+achievements.+It+is+worth+three+francs+when+he+buys+it,+but+a+bonanza+could+not+purchase+it+after+his+great+deeds+have+been+inscribed+upon+it.+There+are+artisans+all+about+Switzerland+whose+trade+it+is+to+burn+these+things+upon+the+alpenstock+of+the+tourist.+And+observe,+a+man+is+respected+in+Switzerland+according+to+his+alpenstock.+I+found+I+could+get+no+attention+there,+while+I+carried+an+unbranded+one.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NdYPM_ZU75&amp;sig=Syjx8UzHBwInJfKqX3E1fuUokmk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiduMia2oLTAhUB3mMKHbOwDxEQ6AEILTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Thus%20it%20is%20his%20regimental%20flag,%20so%20to%20speak,%20and%20bears%20the%20record%20of%20his%20achievements.%20It%20is%20worth%20three%20francs%20when%20he%20buys%20it,%20but%20a%20bonanza%20could%20not%20purchase%20it%20after%20his%20great%20deeds%20have%20been%20inscribed%20upon%20it.%20There%20are%20artisans%20all%20about%20Switzerland%20whose%20trade%20it%20is%20to%20burn%20these%20things%20upon%20the%20alpenstock%20of%20the%20tourist.%20And%20observe,%20a%20man%20is%20respected%20in%20Switzerland%20according%20to%20his%20alpenstock.%20I%20found%20I%20could%20get%20no%20attention%20there,%20while%20I%20carried%20an%20unbranded%20one.&amp;f=false|title=The Writings of Mark Twain: A tramp abroad|last=Twain|first=Mark|date=1907-01-01|publisher=Harper|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developed from earlier Greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] springs instead of a tension prod (the bow part of a modern crossbow), offering much greater efficiency over tension-based weaponry.

Early versions projected heavy [[dart (missile)|darts]] or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for [[siege warfare]]. It developed into a smaller precision weapon, the [[Scorpio (Dart-thrower)|scorpio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warry |first=John |year=1995 |title=Warfare in the Classical World: War and the Ancient Civilisations of Greece and Rome |page=178 |publisher=Salamander Books Ltd. |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=0-8061-2794-5 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=NoABCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the [[polybolos]].

== Greek weapon ==
{{Main|Greek and Roman artillery}}

The early ballista in [[Ancient Greece]] was developed from two weapons called [[oxybeles]] and [[gastraphetes]]. The gastraphetes ('belly-bow') was a handheld crossbow. It had a composite prod and was spanned by bracing the front end of the weapon against the ground while placing the end of a slider mechanism against the stomach. The operator would then walk forward to arm the weapon while a ratchet prevented it from shooting during loading. This produced a weapon which, it was claimed, could be operated by a person of average strength but which had a power that allowed it to be successfully used against armoured troops. The oxybeles was a bigger and heavier construction employing a winch, and was mounted on a tripod. It had a lower rate of fire and was used as a siege engine.
With the invention of [[torsion spring]] bundle technology, the first ballista was built. The advantage of this new technology was the fast relaxation time of this system. Thus it was possible to shoot lighter projectiles with higher velocities over a longer distance.

For an oxybeles, the rules of a torsion weapon demanded that the more energy could be stored, the thicker the prod and the heavier the projectile had to be to increase the amount of stored energy delivered to the projectile. The earliest form of the ballista is thought to have been developed for [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius of Syracuse]], circa 400 BCE.

The Greek ballista was a [[siege weapon]]. All components that were not made of wood were transported in the baggage train. It would be assembled with local wood, if necessary. Some were positioned inside large, armoured, mobile [[siege tower]]s or even on the edge of a battlefield. For all of the tactical advantages offered, it was only under [[Philip II of Macedon]], and even more so under his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], that the ballista began to develop and gain recognition as both a siege engine and field artillery. Historical accounts, for instance, cited that Philip II employed a group of engineers within his army to design and build catapults for his military campaigns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soldiers' Lives through History: The Ancient World|last=Gabriel|first=Richard|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0313333483|location=Westport, CT|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alexander the Great: Conqueror of the Ancient World|last=McGowen|first=Tom|publisher=Enslow Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9780766025608|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even a claim that it was Philip II - with his team of engineers - who invented the ballista after improving Dionysius's device, which was merely an oversized slingshot.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of the Catapult: Build Greek Ballistae, Roman Onagers, English Trebuchets, and More Ancient Artillery|last=Gurstelle|first=William|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2004|isbn=1556525265|location=Chicago|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further perfected by Alexander, whose own team of engineers introduced innovations such as the idea of using springs made from tightly strung coils of rope instead of a bow to achieve more energy and power when throwing projectiles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Polybius]] reported about the usage of smaller, more portable ballistae, called [[scorpio (weapon)|scorpions]], during the [[Second Punic War]].

Ballistae could be easily modified to shoot both spherical and shaft projectiles, allowing their crews to adapt easily to prevailing battlefield situations in real time.

As the role of battlefield artillery became more sophisticated, a [[universal joint]] (which was invented just for this function) was integrated into the ballista's stand, allowing the operators to alter the trajectory and firing direction of the ballista as required without a lengthy disassembly of the machine.

[[File:Harzhorn-Ereignis roemische Katapultgeschosse (Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum).jpg|thumb|Ballista bolt heads]]

After the absorption of the Ancient Greek city-states into the [[Roman Republic]] in 146 BCE, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.

The Romans 'inherited' the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from [[Pergamum]], which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.

The torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.

=== Early Roman ballistae ===
The early Roman ballistae were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the [[Crossbow bolt|bolts]] or stone ''shot''. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of '[[winch]]es' and a 'claw', used to [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] the bowstring back to the armed firing position.

The slider passed through the ''field frames'' of the weapon, in which were located the ''torsion springs'' (rope made of animal [[Tendon|sinew]]), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.

Drawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion-bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.

The ballista was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballista operators), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over {{convert|500|yd}}, but effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.

The Romans continued the development of the ballista, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the [[Roman Empire]].

It was used, just before the start of the Empire, by [[Julius Caesar]] during his conquest of [[Gaul]] and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.

==== First invasion of Britain ====
The first of [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] took place in 55 BCE, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practically to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.

A total of eighty transports, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many miles, yet the massed ranks of British [[chariot]]eers and javeliners were making it difficult.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing this, Caesar ordered the warships – which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance – to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy’s right flank, from which position the slings, bows and artillery could be used by men on deck to drive them back. This manoeuvre was highly successful.&lt;br&gt; Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and retreated. ''(Caesar, The Conquest of Gaul, p.99)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Siege of Alesia ====
[[File:Ballista-quadrirotis.jpeg|thumb|A four-wheeled [[carroballista]] drawn by armored horses, from an engraving illustrating a 1552 edition of the war-machine catalog ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' ({{circa|400}})]]
In Gaul, the stronghold of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] was [[Battle of Alesia|under a Roman siege]] in 52 BCE, and was completely surrounded by a Roman fortification including a wooden [[palisade]] and towers. As was standard siege technique at the time, small ballistae were placed in the towers with other troops armed with [[bow (weapon)|bows]] or [[Sling (weapon)|slings]]. The use of the ballista in the Roman siege strategy was also demonstrated in the case of the [[Siege of Masada]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ballistae in the Roman Empire ===
During the conquest of the Empire, the ballista proved its worth many times in sieges and battles, both at sea and on land. It was even used to quell riots.  It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date. Accounts by the finders, including technical manuals and journals, are used today by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons.

After Julius Caesar, the ballista was a permanent fixture in the Roman army and, over time, modifications and improvements were made by successive engineers. This included replacing the remaining wooden parts of the machine with metal, creating a much smaller, lighter and more powerful machine than the wooden version, which required less maintenance (though the vital torsion springs were still vulnerable to the strain). The largest ballistae of the 4th century could throw a dart further than 1200 yards (1,100 m). The weapon was named ''ballista fulminalis'' in [[De Rebus Bellicis]]: "From this ballista, darts were projected not only in great number but also at a large size over a considerable distance, such as across the width of the Danube River."&lt;ref&gt;De Rebus Bellicis, Chapter XVIII: ballista fulminalis. Note: The modern width of the Danube is 1.5 km. During the Roman Empire, it was unlikely to have been less than 1.1 km, bearing in mind that [[Trajan's Bridge]] is known to have been longer than 1.1 km.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballistae were not only used in laying siege: after {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;350, at least 22 [[bastion|semi-circular towers]] were erected around [[London Wall|the walls]] of [[Londinium]] ([[City of London|London]]) to provide platforms for permanently mounted defensive devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01+wall.htm |title=Visible Roman London: City wall and gates |publisher=Museum of London Group |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219043325/http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Londinium/Today/vizrom/01%2Bwall.htm |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eastern Roman Empire ===
[[File:Israel Batch 2 (50).JPG|thumb|Ballista stones found at excavation site in Jerusalem]]
During the 6th century, [[Procopius]] described the effects of this weapon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But Belisarius placed upon the towers engines which they call "ballistae". Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force''&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And at the Salarian Gate a Goth of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, Gothic war, chapter XXIII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Cheiroballistra and manuballista ====
{{Main|Cheiroballistra}}

The cheiroballistra and the manuballista are held by many archaeologists to be the same weapon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The difference in name may be attributable to the different languages spoken in the Empire. Latin remained the official language in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], but the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] predominantly used Greek, which added an extra 'r' to the word ballista.

The manuballista was a handheld version of the traditional ballista. This new version was made entirely of iron, which conferred greater power to the weapon, since it was smaller, and less iron (an expensive material before the 19th century), was used in its production. It was not the ancient [[gastraphetes]], but the Roman weapon. However, the same physical limitations applied as with the gastraphetes.

==== Carroballista ====
[[File:031 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XXXI (Ausschnitt 01).jpg|thumb|right|Roman cart-mounted carroballista]]
{{Main|Carroballista}}

The carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the ''cheiroballistra'' class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly 1.47 m width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on [[Trajan's Column]].

==== Polybolos ====
{{Main|Polybolos}}
[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of [[Greek and Roman artillery|ancient Greek artillery]], including [[catapult]]s such as the ''[[polybolos]]'' (to the left in the foreground) and a large, early [[crossbow]] known as the ''[[gastraphetes]]'' (mounted on the wall in the background)]]
It has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a 'repeating' ballista, also known as a ''polybolos''. Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, ''What the Romans Did For Us'', showed that they "were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated".&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, Adam [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/tech_01.shtml Discovering Roman Technology] [[BBC]] History 17 February 2011. Accessed 21 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.

=== Archaeology and the Roman ballista ===
[[File:Ballista Ampurias Schramm.jpg|thumb|Metal components of the Ampurias Catapult, found in 1912 in the ''Neapolis'' of [[Empúries|Ampurias]]]]
[[File:Balista Cluj Museaum.JPG|thumb|left|Metal components of a 4th-century ballista]]

[[Archaeology]], and in particular [[experimental archaeology]] has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as [[Vegetius]]) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.

Attempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognize certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Sites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The most influential archaeologists in this area have been [[Peter Connolly]] and Eric Marsden&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, E.W. (1971). ''Greek and Roman Artillery''. Technical Treatises (Oxford). Reprinted 1999 by Sandpiper&lt;/ref&gt;, who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.

== Middle Ages ==
With the decline of the Roman Empire, resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and the more efficient [[springald]].

Though the weapon continued to be used in the Middle Ages, it faded from popular use with the advent of the [[trebuchet]] and [[mangonel]] in siege warfare.

In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navaee-Ardeh S, Bertrand F, Stuart PR |title=Emerging biodrying technology for the drying of pulp and paper mixed sludges |journal=Drying Technology |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=863–78 |year=2006 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a748750739?words=biodrying}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugni M, Calcaterra E, Adani F |title=Biostabilization-biodrying of municipal solid waste by inverting air-flow |journal=Bioresour.

Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for [[refuse-derived fuel]]s. 
Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce [[landfill gas]] and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils [[Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme|LATS]] allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial [[mechanical biological treatment]] (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velis CA, Longhurst PJ, Drew GH, Smith R, Pollard SJ |title=Biodrying for mechanical-biological treatment of wastes: a review of process science and engineering |journal=Bioresour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[electronic engineering]], a '''bridging fault''' consists of two signals that are connected when they should not be. Depending on the [[logic circuit]]ry employed, this may result in a [[wired-OR]] or [[wired-AND]] logic function. Since there are O(n^2) potential bridging faults, they are normally restricted to signals that are physically adjacent in the design.

==Modeling bridge fault==
Bridging to VDD or Vss is equivalent to stuck at fault model. Traditionally bridged signals were modeled with logic AND or OR of signals. If one driver dominates the other driver in a bridging situation, the dominant driver forces the logic to the other one, in such case a ''dominant bridging fault'' is used. To better reflect the reality of CMOS VLSI devices, a ''dominant AND or dominant OR bridging fault model'' is used where dominant driver keeps its value, while the other signal value is the result of AND (or OR) of its own value with the dominant driver.

[[File:Chairlift_bullwheel.jpg|thumb|A chairlift's return bullwheel]]

A '''bullwheel''' or '''bull wheel''' is a large [[wheel]] on which a [[rope]] turns, such as in a [[chairlift]]. In that application, the bullwheel that is attached to the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] is called the drive bullwheel, and the other is the return bullwheel.

Originally, ''bullwheel'' was an [[oil field]] term applied to the large wheel that turns the drum upon which the drilling line is wound in [[percussion drilling]].

The bullwheel began use in [[farm implements]] with the [[reaper]].  The term described the traveling wheel, traction wheel, drive wheel, or harvester wheel. The bullwheel powered all the moving parts of these farm machines including the reciprocating knives, reel, rake, and self binder.  The bullwheel's outer surface provided traction against the ground and turned when the draft animals or [[tractor]] pulled the implement forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
'''Business analytics''' ('''BA''') refers to the skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title= Next Generation Business Analytics
 |url= http://www.docstoc.com/docs/7486045/Next-Generation-Business-Analytics-Presentation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on [[data]] and [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. In contrast, [[business intelligence]] traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the two sentences|date=October 2017}}

Business [[analytics]] makes extensive use of statistical analysis, including explanatory and [[predictive modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | title=Predictive vs. Explanatory Modeling in IS Research | author=Galit Schmueli and Otto Koppius | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011082717/http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | archivedate=2010-10-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fact-based management to drive [[decision making]]. It is therefore closely related to [[management science]]. Analytics may be used as input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. Business intelligence is [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[report]]ing, [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP), and "alerts."

In other words, querying, reporting, OLAP, and alert tools can answer questions such as what happened, how many, how often, where the problem is, and what actions are needed. Business analytics can answer questions like why is this happening, what if these trends continue, what will happen next (predict), and what is the best outcome that can happen (optimize).&lt;ref name=Davenport2007&gt;{{Cite book

==Examples of application==
Banks, such as [[Capital One]], use [[data analysis]] (or ''[[analytics]]'', as it is also called in the business setting), to differentiate among customers based on [[credit risk]], usage and other characteristics and then to match customer characteristics with appropriate product offerings. [[Harrah's Entertainment|Harrah’s]], the gaming firm, uses analytics in its [[customer loyalty]] programs. [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]] quantitatively analyses and predicts the appeal of its wines. Between 2002 and 2005, [[Deere &amp; Company]] saved more than $1 billion by employing a new analytical tool to better optimize inventory.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;  A telecoms company that pursues efficient call center usage over customer service may save money as well.

==History==
Analytics have been used in business since the management exercises were put into place by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in the late 19th century. [[Henry Ford]] measured the time of each component in his newly established assembly line. But analytics began to command more attention in the late 1960s when computers were used in [[decision support systems]]. Since then, analytics have changed and formed with the development of [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, [[data warehouses]], and a large number of other software tools and processes.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

In later years the business analytics have exploded with the introduction to computers. This change has brought analytics to a whole new level and has brought about endless possibilities. As far as analytics has come in history, and what the current field of analytics is today, many people would never think that analytics started in the early 1900s with Mr. Ford himself.

==Challenges==
Business analytics depends on sufficient volumes of high quality data. The difficulty in ensuring data quality is integrating and reconciling data across different systems, and then deciding what subsets of data to make available.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

Previously, analytics was considered a type of after-the-fact method of [[forecasting]] [[consumer behavior]] by examining the number of units sold in the last quarter or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |title= Choosing the Best Storage for Business Analytics |publisher= Dell.com |accessdate= 2012-06-25 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120718204914/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |archivedate= 2012-07-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a specific customer type is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time.

==Competing on analytics==
[[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that businesses can optimize a distinct business capability via analytics and thus better compete. He identifies these characteristics of an organization that are apt to compete on analytics:&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;
* One or more senior executives who strongly advocate fact-based decision making and, specifically, analytics
* Widespread use of not only [[descriptive statistics]], but also predictive modeling and complex [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques
* Substantial use of analytics across multiple business functions or processes
* Movement toward an enterprise level approach to managing analytical tools, data, and organizational skills and capabilities

[[File:Firework display (competition) Gozo, Malta 05.jpg|thumb|Catherine wheel at [[Qala, Malta|Qala]], [[Malta]]]]

The '''Catherine wheel''' or '''pinwheel''' is a type of [[firework]] consisting of a powder-filled spiral tube, or an angled [[rocket]] mounted with a pin through its center. When ignited, it rotates quickly, producing a display of sparks and coloured flame.

The [[firework]] is named after [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]] who, according to Christian tradition, was condemned to death by “[[breaking on the wheel]]”. When she touched the wheel it miraculously flew to pieces.

The largest Catherine wheel ever made was designed by the Lily Fireworks Factory of [[Mqabba]], [[Malta]]. The Catherine wheel had a diameter of {{convert|32.044|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and was lit on 18 June 2011, the eve of the annual feast of ''Our Lady of the Lilies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firework - largest Catherine wheel|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/firework-largest-catherine-wheel|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mqabba sets world record|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110620/local/Mqabba-sets-world-record.371470|accessdate=8 February 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Malta, Catherine wheels are a traditional fixture during every village 'festa'. Some villages even hold competitions on the eve of the parish feast, while others display the vast work of one firework. Entrants display a variety of moving shapes and include various colours year after year as the technology progresses. These displays are only a small part of the firework catalogue planned throughout the week preceding the feast and on the feast day itself. The Catherine wheel displays typically end with the burning of what is called 'the carpet': the largest Catherine wheel in the display on the night. 

In the [[Philippines]], Catherine wheel is also known as trompillo and according to [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] 7183, it is a legal firework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno7183.htm|title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7183|website=chanrobles.com|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590651/news/nation/pnp-bares-list-of-legal-firecrackers-pyrotechnics-for-holiday-revelry|title=PNP bares list of legal firecrackers, pyrotechnics for holiday revelry|newspaper=[[GMA News]]|last=Roxas|first=Joseph Tristan|date=November 29, 2016|accessdate=December 29, 2016|language=Ingles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="772">A '''cell''' in the context of [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) is an abstract representation of a component within a [[schematic diagram]] or [[physical layout]] of an electronic circuit in software. 

A cell-based design methodology is a technique that enables designers to analyze chip designs at varying levels of abstraction.  For example, one designer may focus on the logical function (high-level) and another may concentrate on physical implementation (low-level).  The technique also enables designers to reuse components in more complex designs without understanding all of the implementation details.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8043">A '''Controlled Mine''' was a circuit fired weapon used in coastal defenses with ancestry going back to 1805 when Robert Fulton termed his underwater explosive device a torpedo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Robert Fulton invented the word torpedo to describe his underwater explosive device and successfully destroyed a ship in 1805. In the 1840s Samuel Colt began experimenting with underwater mines fired by electric current and in 1842, he blew up an old schooner in the Potomac River from a shore station five miles away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/fowa/torpedo.htm National Park Service: Torpedo Defense: COAST DEFENSE OF THE POTOMAC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211155058/http://www.nps.gov/archive/fowa/torpedo.htm |date=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
"Torpedoes" were in use during the American Civil War when such devices were made famous with the order given by [[David Farragut]] at Mobile Bay. After that war similar mines were being contemplated or put into use by other nations.

In 1869 the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] was directed by [[Secretary of War]] William Belknap to assume responsibility for torpedoes for coastal defense.&lt;ref&gt;Bogart&lt;/ref&gt; That responsibility continued through the formation of the U.S. Torpedo Service as part of the [[Seacoast defense in the United States]]. In the United States, modern naval mine development began in 1869 at the [[U.S. Army Engineer School|Engineer School of Application]] under Major [[Henry Larcom Abbot]] at [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Willets Point, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, pp. 333-374&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, after calls for "rifled cannon"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29523 Chester A. Authur - Second Annual Message to Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; to cover the [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|torpedo fields]] became reality, that service and the Corps of Engineers turned over responsibility to the newly formed [[U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps]] in 1901.

The terms "mine" and "torpedo" were used interchangeably until modern usage began separating the term with "mine" applied to static explosive devices and "torpedo" to self-propelled or "locomotive torpedo" weapons. Even during the [[Spanish–American War]] the interchangeable terms caused confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanamwar.com/Spanishmines.htm The Use of Mines by the Spanish Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the term 'Submarine Mine' was used. Fixed minefields to defend harbours were the responsibility of the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE), which formed special companies of Submarine Miners to maintain them. [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882–86, found that he did not have enough Regular Army engineers to man all the minefields being installed so he decided to utilise the part-time soldiers of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]]. After successful trials the system was rolled out to ports around the country, where the Submarine Miners might be drawn from the Regular RE, the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]], or the Volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Short ''et al'', pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Westlake&gt;Westlake, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Submarine Miners were also to the fore in developing searchlights to illuminate the minefields. By 1907 the [[War Office]] had decided to hand responsibility for the minefields to the Militia, but several Volunteer units were converted to Electrical Engineer Companies employing their lights for coastal artillery control and, eventually, anti-aircraft defences.&lt;ref name=Westlake /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Short ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Unlike [[naval mines]] that are dispersed at sea, the controlled mine field location is chosen so that it could be under observation. The exact location of the mines was required so that they could be fired from the mine casemate when a target vessel was plotted by observers to be within the mine's effective range. For this reason the mines were "planted" in predetermined locations with electrical connection through cables to the firing location. The complex of mines, cables and junction boxes required maintenance. Specialized vessels to undertake the hazards of planting mines and maintaining the electrical cables were used.

In the United States a type of vessel termed [[Mine Planter (ship)|mine planter]] was developed, built&lt;ref&gt;[http://patriot.net/~eastlnd2/army-amps.htm Army Ships - The Ghost Fleet - Coast Artillery Corps Army Mine Planter Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927100156/http://patriot.net/~eastlnd2/army-amps.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and deployed in 1904. By 1909 more mine planters were under construction and deployment had reached the San  Francisco fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay]&lt;/ref&gt; These were assisted by smaller vessels. In the last stages of such coastal defenses during the Second World War the [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|U.S. Army Mine Planter Service]] (USAMPS) mine flotilla usually consisted of two planters, four Distribution Box Boats and a small fleet of yawls and launches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortmiles.org/firepower/batteries/batt8.html#AMP Ft. Miles Army Mine Planters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227131224/http://www.fortmiles.org/firepower/batteries/batt8.html |date=2012-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Royal Navy]] controlled mines were often laid alongside [[anti-submarine indicator loop]]s during both World Wars; the US Navy used a similar strategy in at least World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indicatorloops.com/loops.htm Indicator loops website]&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen specialized vessels known as ''Indicator Loop Mine Layers''—including three [[Linnet-class minelayer|''Linnet''-class minelayers]] and nine smaller vessels—much like the U.S. mine planters, were built for the Royal Navy immediately before and during WWII. Similarly in Japan four [[Hashima-class cable layer]]s were built between 1939 and 1941 for mine planting duties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8092">'''COSMOS''' stands for "'''COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard'''", which sets certification requirements for [[Organic product|organic]] and [[Natural product|natural]] [[cosmetics]] products in the [[Europe]]. The standard is recognized globally by the [[cosmetic industry]]. By adhering to specific guidelines, cosmetics marketers can use COSMOS signatures, which are registered [[trademark]]s, on packaging to confirm the products meet minimum industry requirements to be considered organic or natural.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2002 five European organisations responsible for setting organic and natural cosmetics [[International standard|standard]]s met at a trade show to share ideas for broader standards to be used globally. These five COSMOS members are:

* BDIH (Germany)
* Cosmebio (France)
* [[Ecocert]] Greenlife SAS (France)
* ICEA (Italy)
* [[Soil Association]] (Great Britain)
Over 1,600 [[manufacturer]]s who sell over 25,000 products across over 45 countries follow the standard, according to Cosmos-standard.org. About 85% of the certified cosmetics industry uses COSMOS signatures on its products.

Although the five members differed on certain standards separately, they were able to smooth out differences to create a harmonised international standard that was first published in 2010. At this time the five members formed a non-profit international association overseeing the standard. In June 2010 the COSMOS-standard AISBL was awarded [[Royal Assent]] from [[Belgium#Politics|Belgian authorities]]. The documents published with the standard include:

* The Control Manual: describes how the control systems works
* The Labeling Rules: explains how to use COSMOS labels
* The Technical Guide: additional information&lt;ref name="The COSMOS-standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=The COSMOS-standard|url=https://cosmos-standard.org/the-cosmos-standard/|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS" /&gt;

==Certification and Labeling Process==

There are four main [[certification]] signatures that comprise the COSMOS-standard, which are for ORGANIC, NATURAL, COSMOS CERTIFIED and COSMOS APPROVED products. Here are six steps to gaining approval of product labeling within the certification process:

# The authorized COSMOS-standard certification body must first approve of the product specification. 
# 
# The applicant must submit their proposed product labeling to the certification body and await approval. Generic label designs for certain single-ingredient product are acceptable if the design is consistent for all products.
# 
# In the event the product specification is not approved first, the labeling can only get provisional approval.
# 
# Only after full approval of the labeling is granted by the certification body can the manufacturer print the labelling. The certification process must be completed before the labels can be used commercially. 
# 
# If the manufacturer needs to make changes to the product or labeling after gaining certification, they must notify the certification body and wait for written approval or a certificate update. Further approval from the certification body will be needed if the manufacturer makes changes to the organic percentage of the ingredients. The vendor will also have to make an amendment to the ingredients. 
# 
# Before the product can be launched, the labeling must be approved by the certification body and the product must be listed on the COSMOS-standard certificate. Printing labels without first getting approval can lead to certification withdrawal if the certification body determines the products and labels are non-compliant.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Cosmetics organic and natural standard Version 2.0 – 21st October 2013|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cosmos-standard-v2-21102013.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Technical"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Technical Guide Version 2.11 09/05/2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cosmos20technical20guide20v2-1120090517202.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Labeling Requirements==

Manufacturers and marketers are only allowed to use COSMOS terms and signatures for products authorized by the certification body. The certification body must be identified on product labels if it is not clearly mentioned anywhere else on the product. In cases in which the label size restricts product labeling, the certification body may allow flexibility as long as the product maintains the general principles of the Labeling Guide. The firm must at least mention the nature of the certification (such as organic or natural) and the identity of the certification body.&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Labelling Guide Version 2.4 – 28 June 2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/cosmos-standard20labelling20guide20v2-420280617.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Identification==

Marketers are allowed to use the COSMOS terms and signatures on company letterhead and websites under certain conditions. All the products of a brand must be certified organic in order for the company to make the claim they are "COSMOS ORGANIC certified." Otherwise, the firm must be clear that only specific products have been certified organic. In other words, the use of the terms and signatures must not be misleading to the consumer.

Essentially, the labelling must clearly and accurately describe the product, which must comply with the standard. The marketer must avoid listing ingredients or naming the product in a way that implies it contains certain ingredients that are not present. Any use or branding of the term "organic," for example, must comply with the organic standard and not be confusing to the consumer.

The [[labeling]] must not confuse the terms "organic" and "natural," which have separate definitions and certifications based on the way the products and ingredients are processed. If a brand sells several organic products and a few natural products, they must make it clear in their labeling and marketing the differences. The firm must also be clear if some of its products have no certification at all. In other words, in order for a company to promote itself as "COSMOS ORGANIC certified," its entire range of products must meet the organic standard and be certified.

Companies are not allowed to use [[logo]]s or seals that may mislead customers into believing the products are COSMOS certified.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">In [[engineering]], '''double-subscript notation''' is notation used to indicate some variable ''between'' two points (each point being represented by one of the subscripts). In [[electronics]], the notation is usually used to indicate the direction of current or voltage, while in [[mechanical engineering]] it is sometimes used to describe the [[force]] or [[Stress (physics)|stress]] between two points, and sometimes even a component that spans between two points (like a beam on a bridge or [[truss]]). Note that, although there are many cases where multiple subscripts are used, they are not necessarily called ''double subscript notation'' specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Circuit Analysis for Power Engineering Handbook |author=Moses E. Zarudi, Shenkman, Arieh L. Shenkman|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-412-83180-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic usage ==
IEEE standard 255-1963, "Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices", defined eleven original quantity symbols expressed as abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 255-1963 - IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices|last =|first =|publisher = IEEE|year = 1963|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] to standardize the directions of double-subscript labels. The following uses [[transistors]] as an example, but shows how the direction is read generally. The convention works like this:

&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{CB} \ &lt;/math&gt; represents the [[voltage]] from C to B. In this case, C would denote the collector end of a transistor, and B would denote the base end of the same transistor. This is the same as saying "the voltage drop from C to B". Though this applies the standard definitions of the letters C and B,&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Dictionary of Electronics|last=Graf|first=Rudolf F.|publisher=Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=683-684|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{CE} \ &lt;/math&gt; would in turn represent the current from C to E. In this case, C would again denote the collector end of a transistor, and E would denote the emitter end of the transistor. This is the same as saying "the current in the direction going from C to E".&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IC power supply pin|Power supply pins on integrated circuits]] utilize the same letters for denoting what kind of voltage the pin would receive. For example, a power input labeled V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; would be a positive input that would presumably connect to the collector pin of a BJT transistor in the circuit, and likewise respectively with other subscripted letters. The format used is the same as for notations described above, though without the connotation of V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; meaning the voltage from a collector pin to collector pin; the repetition avoids confusion as such an expression would not exist.

The table above shows only the originally denoted letters; others have found their way into use over time, such as S and D for the Source and Drain of a [[Field-effect transistor|FET]], respectively.

{{Ecommerce}}
{{use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}
'''E-commerce''' is the activity of buying or selling of [[Product (business)|products]] on online services or over the [[Internet]]. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as [[mobile commerce]], [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Online advertising|Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[Inventory management software|inventory management systems]], and automated [[data collection]] systems.

Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as [[Email|e-mail]]. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books (such as [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]) and music purchases ([[music download]] in the form of [[digital distribution]] such as [[iTunes Store]]), and to a less extent, customized/personalized online [[liquor store]] [[inventory]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220177/b2c-e-commerce-sales-cagr-forecast-for-selected-countries/|title=Retail e-commerce sales CAGR forecast in selected countries from 2016 to 2021|last=|first=|date=October 2016|website=Statista|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electric markets, and online auctions. E-commerce is supported by [[electronic business]].&lt;ref&gt;Wienclaw, Ruth A. (2013) "E-Commerce." ''Research Starters: Business''&lt;/ref&gt;

E-commerce businesses may also employ some or all of the followings:
* [[Online shopping]] for [[direct selling|retail sales direct]] to consumers via [[Web sites]] and [[mobile apps]], and [[conversational commerce]] via [[live chat]], [[chatbot]]s, and [[voice assistants]]&lt;ref name="venturebeat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/06/how-to-prepare-your-products-and-brand-for-conversational-commerce/|title=How to prepare your products and brand for conversational commerce|date=6 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Providing or participating in [[online marketplace]]s, which process third-party business-to-consumer or consumer-to-consumer sales
* [[Business-to-business]] buying and selling;
* Gathering and using demographic data through web contacts and social media
* Business-to-business (B2B) [[electronic data interchange]]
* Marketing to prospective and established customers by e-mail or fax (for example, with [[newsletter]]s)
* Engaging in [[pretail]] for launching new products and services
* Online financial exchanges for currency exchanges or trading purposes.

==Governmental regulation==
In the United States, certain electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and [[consumer privacy]]. The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm |title= Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers' personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html | title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to address [[Online pharmacy|online pharmacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6353&amp;tab=summary |title = H.R. 6353: Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 |publisher= [[Govtrack]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict of laws in cyberspace is a major hurdle for harmonization of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).&lt;ref name="http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/1996Model.html"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/1996Model.html|title= UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996)

'''Internationally''' there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001. It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.

There is also '''Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation''' (APEC) was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Steering Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.

The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/209/introduction/made | title = The Payment Services Regulations 2009 |publisher= Legislation | place = UK |accessdate= 17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered the first law in China's e-commerce legislation. It was a milestone in the course of improving China's electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China's rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.efilecabinet.com/the-prc-electronic-signature-law/|title=PRC, Electronic Signature Law|last=|first=|date=28 August 2004|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce can be classified into two categories. The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering "digital" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to "meta" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant ([[B2B e-commerce|B2B]], [[Retail|B2C]], [[Consumer-to-business|C2B]] and [[Customer to customer|C2C]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/ecommerce-businesses-understanding-types-1141595|title=Did You Know That There Are 4 Types of Ecommerce?|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research clearly indicates that electronic commerce, commonly referred to as e-commerce, presently shapes the manner in which people shop for products. The GCC countries have a rapidly growing market and characterized by a population that becomes wealthier (Yuldashev). As such, retailers have launched Arabic-language websites as a means to target this population. Secondly, there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience (Yuldashev). The growth and development of the two aspects make the GCC countries to become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress. Specifically, research shows that e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $20 billion by the year 2020 among these GCC countries (Yuldashev). 
The e-commerce market has also gained much popularity among the western countries, and in particular Europe and the U.S. These countries have been highly characterized with consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) (Geisler, 34). However, trends show that there are future signs of a reverse. Similar to the GCC countries, there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels. Activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on CPG manufacturers (Geisler, 36). In these senses, CPG investors are being forced to adapt e-commerce as it is effective as a well as a means for them to thrive.

In 2013, Brazil's e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = eMarketer | url = http://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-Buyers-Join-Brazils-Robust-Ecommerce-Market/1009725 |title = More Buyers Join Brazil's Robust Ecommerce Market}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has an Internet user base of about 460 million as of December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2157/internet-usage-in-india/|title=Internet usage in India – Statistics &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being third largest user base in world, the penetration of Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around 6 million new entrants every month.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phani_Pasumarthy/publication/311518414_AFFECT_OF_DEMONETIZATION_ON_E-COMMERCE/links/584a7f5708ae4a7a6917c3d0/AFFECT-OF-DEMONETIZATION-ON-E-COMMERCE|title=Affect of demonetization on e-commerce – ResearchGate|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} The India retail market is expected to rise from 2.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/in/pdf/2016/08/E-commerce-retail-logistics-India.pdf|title=India’s e-commerce retail logistics growth story|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The future trends in the GCC countries will be similar with that of the western countries. Despite the forces that push business to adapt e-commerce as a means to sell goods and products, the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions. For instance, there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions. Yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing.
However, the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years. It will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend (The Statistics Portal). For example, UAE has the greatest smartphone penetration of 73.8 percent and has 91.9 percent of its population has access to the internet. On the other hand, smartphone penetration in Europe has been reported to be at 64.7 percent (The Statistics Portal). Regardless, the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because e-commerce technology is expected to grow allowing for more users. 
The e-commerce business within these two regions will result in a competition. Government bodies at country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection (Krings, et al.). These increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries, factors that will determine the success of e-commerce market in these countries. For example, an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the e-commerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies. As such, the future trends between GCC countries and the Western countries will be independent of these sanctions (Krings, et al.). These countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions.

The rate of growth of the number of internet users in the Arab countries has been rapid – 13.1% in 2015. A significant portion of the e-commerce market in the Middle East comprises people in the 30–34 year age group. Egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia and Morocco; these constitute 3/4th of the region’s share. Yet, internet penetration is low: 35% in Egypt and 65% in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.embitel.com/blog/ecommerce-blog/ecommerce-in-the-middle-east-what-are-the-demographics|title=Ecommerce in the Middle East – What are the demographics?|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For traditional businesses, one research stated that information technology and cross-border e-commerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises.

== Logistics ==
Logistics in e-commerce mainly concerns fulfillment. Online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products. Small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company. Most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a company's logistic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kawa, Arkadiusz|title=Fulfillment Service in E-Commerce Logistics|journal=Logforum|volume= 13|issue= 4|year= 2017|pages= 429–438|doi=10.17270/J.LOG.2017.4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

E-commerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere. Online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business. Traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where, online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacture. The pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers. Traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory. Online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery.

There are two ways for marketers to conduct business through e-commerce: fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store. Online marketers can offer lower prices, greater product selection, and high efficiency rates. Many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price. However, online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty. Another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions. Many customers remain loyal to well-known retailers because of this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhaolin|date=July 2015|title=Online Versus Bricks-And-Mortar Retailing: A Comparison of Price, Assortment and Delivery Time|doi=10.1080/00207543.2014.973074|journal=International Journal of Production Research|volume=53|issue=13|pages=3823–3835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimkota|first=Angelika|date=June 2012|title=On Product Uncertainty in Online Markets: Theory and Evidence|url=https://yilihong.github.io/paper/Product%20Uncertainty%20in%20Online%20Markets_Dimoka_Hong_Pavlou2012.pdf|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=36|pages=395–A15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security is a primary problem for e-commerce in developed and developing countries. E-commerce security is protecting business' websites and costumers from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. The type of threats include: malicious codes, unwanted programs ([[Adware|ad ware]], [[spyware]]), [[phishing]], [[Hacker|hacking]], and [[Vandalism|cyber vandalism]]. E-commerce websites use different tools to avert security threats. These tools include [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[encryption software]], digital certificates, and passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kohli, Gautam|title=E-Commerce: Transaction Security Issue and Challenges|journal=CLEAR International Journal of Research in Commerce &amp; Management|volume= 7|issue= 2|year= 2016|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on supply chain management==
{{main|Supply chain management}}
For a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Delia, M. |year=2008|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/aes/amfeco/v10y2008i24p236-253.html |title=Impact of E-Commerce in Supply Chain Management|journal=The AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC journal|volume =10 |issue =24 |pages= 236–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimised the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"/&gt;

In addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems, like [[SAP ERP]], [[Xero (software)|Xero]], or [[Megaventory]], have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"/&gt;

== Impact on employment ==
E-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products. It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information, customer demands, and production processes. In contrast, people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare. On the other hand, because e-commerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time, the warehouse becomes an important element. Warehouse needs more staff to manage, supervise and organize, thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The impact of e-commerce on international trade and employment |last=Teriz|first=N|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.09.010|volume=24|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=745–753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on customers ==
E-commerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online, especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers’ time. Consumers also gain power through online shopping. They are able to research products and compare prices among retailers. Also, online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code, thus it is more price effective for customers. Moreover, e-commerce provides products’ detailed information; even the in-store staff cannot offer such detailed explanation. Customers can also review and track the order history online.

E-commerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries. This is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase. The success of e-commerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to e-commerce. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-jstor-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/43084757?Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=The&amp;searchText=impact&amp;searchText=of&amp;searchText=e-commerce&amp;searchText=on&amp;searchText=international&amp;searchText=trade&amp;searchText=and&amp;searchText=employment&amp;searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?wc=on&amp;amp;Query=The+impact+of+e-commerce+on+international+trade+and+employment+&amp;amp;group=none&amp;amp;acc=on&amp;amp;fc=off&amp;refreqid=search:9152a690fbce039bb1a8a26334497de4&amp;seq=7#page_scan_tab_contents|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=www-jstor-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, e-commerce lacks human interaction for customers, especially who prefer face-to-face connection. Customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to well-known retailers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Online Retail Industry Profile: United States|publisher=Datamonitor Plc|pages=1–36|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, clothing retailers such as [[Tommy Hilfiger]] have started adding Virtual Fit platforms to their e-commerce sites to reduce the risk of customers buying the wrong sized clothes, although these vary greatly in their fit for purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=Monika|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|last4=Gill|first4=Simeon|title=Online Virtual Fit is not yet Fit for Purpose: An Analysis of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces|journal=3DBODY.TECH 2017|date=2017|pages=210–217|doi=10.15221/17.210|url=http://www.3dbody.tech/cap/abstracts/2017/17210januszkiewicz.html|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the customer regret the purchase of a product, it involves returning goods and refunding process. This process is inconvenient as customers need to pack and post the goods. If the products are expensive, large or fragile, it refers to safety issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/ict/implications/1lifestylerev3.shtml|title=BBC – GCSE Bitesize: Electronic money and electronic commerce|last=BBC News|first=|date=2014|website=|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution channels==
E-commerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted pure-click and [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] channel systems. We can distinguish pure-click and brick-and-click channel system adopted by companies.
* Pure-click or pure-play companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm.
* Bricks-and-clicks companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for e-commerce.
* Click-to-brick online retailers that later open physical locations to supplement their online efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-10/click-to-brick-why-online-retailers-want-stores-in-real-life |title=Click-to-Brick: Why Online Retailers Want Stores in Real Life |publisher=Business week |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of digital channels==
E-commerce may take place on retailers' [[Web site]]s or [[mobile apps]], or those of e-commerce marketplaces such as on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], or [[Tmall]] from [[Alibaba Group|AliBaba]]. Those channels may also be supported by [[conversational commerce]], e.g. [[live chat]] or [[chatbot]]s on  Web sites. Conversational commerce may also be standalone such as live chat or chatbots on [[messaging app]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/omnichannel-cross-channel-strategies/retail-s-big-opportunity-87-of-u-s-consumers-grasp-the-power-of-conversational-commerce|title=Retail’s Big Opportunity: 87% Of U.S. Consumers Grasp The Power Of Conversational Commerce - Retail TouchPoints|first=Glenn|last=Taylor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via [[voice assistants]].&lt;ref name="venturebeat.com"/&gt;

== Recommendation ==
The contemporary e-commerce trend recommends companies to shift the traditional business model where focus on "standardized products, homogeneous market and long product life cycle" to the new business model where focus on "varied and customized products". E-commerce requires the company to have the ability to satisfy multiple needs of different customers and provide them with wider range of products.

With more choices of products, the information of products for customers to select and meet their needs become crucial. In order to address the mass customization principle to the company, the use of recommender system is suggested. This system helps recommend the proper products to the customers and helps customers make the decision during the purchasing process. The recommender system could be operated through the top sellers on the website, the demographics of customers or the consumers' buying behavior. However, there are 3 main ways of recommendations: recommending products to customers directly, providing detailed products' information and showing other buyers' opinions or critiques. It is benefit for consumer experience without physical shopping. In general, recommender system is used to contact customers online and assist finding the right products they want effectively and directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Applications of Data Mining to Electronic Commerce|last=Schafer|first=J.

An '''electronic performance support system''' (EPSS) is any computer software program or component that improves user performance.

EPSSs can help an organization to reduce the cost of training staff while increasing productivity and performance. They can [[Empowerment|empower]] employees to perform tasks with a minimum amount of external intervention or [[training]]. By using this type of system an employee, especially a new employee, will often not only be able to complete his or her work more quickly and accurately, but, as a secondary benefit, will also learn more about the job and the employer's business.

An EPSS is best considered when
*workers require knowledge to achieve individual performance in a business environment 
*skilled performers are spending a lot of time helping less skilled performers
*new workers must begin to perform immediately and training is impractical, unavailable or constrained
*employees need to be guided through a complex process or task that cannot be memorized.
These situations often occur when new systems (e.g. [[customer relationship management]], [[enterprise resource planning]]) are introduced, upgraded or consolidated, and in certain [[call centres]] when agents must perform using complex systems, processes or products.

==Components==
There are different views about the components and characteristics of EPSS. For example, from Barker and Banerji’s (1995) point of view, an EPSS has four functional levels, which should be brought together:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DESIGNING ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS|author=Philip Barker and Ashok Banerji|journal= Innovations in Education and Training International, Special Edition on Electronic Performance Support Systems|pages=4-12|volume=32|issue=1|year=1995|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a746782853}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the user interface shell (the human computer interface) and the database
#generic tools (help system, documentation, text retrieval system, intelligent agents, tutoring facility, simulation tools and communication resources)
#application-specific support tools
#a target application domain (schools, particular business settings, military, etc.).

== Advantages ==

#Reducing the complexity or number of steps required to perform a task
#Providing the performance information an employee needs to perform a task
#Providing a [[decision support system]] that enables an employee to identify the action that is appropriate for a particular set of conditions

== Definitions ==

In ''Electronic Performance Support Systems'', [[Gloria Gery]] defined EPSS as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic Performance Support Systems|year=1991|author=[[Gloria Gery]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Performance-Support-System-Gloria/dp/0961796812|isbn=978-0-9617968-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily &lt;br /&gt;
accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate, individualized &lt;br /&gt;
on-line access to the full range of information, software, guidance, advice and &lt;br /&gt;
assistance, data, images, tools, and assessment and monitoring systems to permit &lt;br /&gt;
[[job performance]] with minimal support and intervention by others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, in 1991, [[Barry Raybould]] gave a shorter definition:&lt;ref&gt;''An EPSS Case Study: Prime Computer'', Barry Raybould. 1991, Ariel PSS Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a business perspective, a former [[Nortel Networks]] executive, [[William Bezanson]] (2002) provided a definition linked to application usability and organizational results:&lt;ref name=bezanson&gt;''Performance Support Solutions: Achieving Goals Through Enabling User Performance''. William Bezanson, 2002, Trafford Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A performance support system provides just-in-time, just enough training, information, tools, and help for users of a product or work environment, to enable optimum performance by those users when and where needed, thereby also enhancing the performance of the overall business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== EPSS versus online help ==

An EPSS must be distinguished from a traditional [[online help]] system. Online help usually supports a single software application and is not necessarily focused on the entire range of job tasks (which may involve multiple applications), but just that specific software. With online help, cross-referencing is often not available and the information provided is limited and rarely combined with procedures or complex tasks. Perhaps most critically, on-line help cannot be customized to the user or the job task; in fact, the same software screen may require different inputs depending on the user and job task. Online help is also not [[Context-sensitive help|contextual]] to the user's current situation and requires users to search through for the solution to their problem. 

== EPSS versus e-learning simulations ==

EPSS must also be differentiated from [[e-learning]] [[simulation]]s that replay a series of steps on-demand within a software application. Simulations are more closely associated with on-demand training, not [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] support, because of the longer time considerations, complexity, and media restrictions for playing a simulation. An EPSS can be considered a part of the [[e-learning]] category, as it is on-demand learning, and notes that the EPSS modality fits more within the informal learning definition.

== EPSS versus knowledge management ==

In his book, Bezanson points out that "[[knowledge management]]" is the noun corresponding to the verb of "performance support".&lt;ref name=bezanson/&gt; The knowledge documented in the system plays a critical role in any EPSS system. This concept was originated by Raybould (1997)&lt;ref&gt;''The Five Phases of Migration from Training to Knowledge Management'', Barry Raybould,  CBT Solutions July/August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; who separates out the repository, delivery and infrastructure aspects of the EPSS from the knowledge base it contains. In fact, Bezanson emphasizes the advantage that an LMS ([[learning management system]]) will interface with the EPSS to supply the knowledge base, content-courseware, or other tracking capabilities that an EPSS may require if the LMS precedes the implementation of the EPSS.

== EPSS versus training ==

EPSS's role in the future of [[training]] and work have been noted by followers of the trend towards more [[informal learning]] systems driven by knowledge management systems.
[[Tony O'Driscoll]] (1999) summarizes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; As the pace of technological change speeds up, many jobs will require constant adaptation, because of new information and new task requirements. In this context, the distinction between learning and work will disappear. A trend toward integrating training with on-the-job activities will be a result. This trend will extend itself to the point that training, as a distinct function, will no longer be the primary learning vehicle for many types of jobs. Works will use on-the-job information systems instead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this day, analysts such as [[Forrester Research|Forrester]]'s [[Claire Schooley]] and [[Bersin &amp; Associates]]' Chris Howard write similarly themed articles based on their research in informal learning, technology and training.

[[File:Hjell-oversikt.arj.jpeg|thumb|right|A fish-drying rack in [[Norway]]]]

Ancient methods of preserving fish included [[Drying (food)|drying]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[pickling]] and [[Smoking (food)|smoking]]. All of these techniques are still used today but the more modern techniques of [[Freezing#Freezing food for preservation|freezing]] and [[Fish canning|canning]] have taken on a large importance.

[[Fish curing]] includes and of curing [[fish]] by [[Drying (food)|drying]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], and [[pickling]], or by [[combinations]] of these processes have been employed since ancient times. On sailing vessels fish were usually salted down immediately to prevent spoilage; the swifter boats of today commonly bring in unsalted fish. Modern [[freezing]] and [[canning]] methods have largely supplanted older methods of [[food preservation|preservation]]. Fish to be cured are usually first cleaned, scaled, and eviscerated. Fish are salted by packing them between layers of [[salt]] or by [[:wikt:immersion|immersion]] in [[brine]]. The fish most extensively salted are [[cod]], [[herring]], [[mackerel]], and [[haddock]]. Smoking preserves fish by drying, by [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]] of creosote ingredients, and, when the fish are near the source of heat, by heat penetration. Herring and haddock (finnan haddie) are commonly [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]]. [[Kippers]] are split herring, and [[bloater (herring)|bloaters]] are whole herring, salted and smoked. [[Sardines]], [[pilchards]], and [[anchovies]] are small fish of the herring family, often salted and smoked and then preserved in [[oil]]. Fish are dried under controlled conditions of [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [[air velocity]]. Since the dried product is relatively unappetizing and rehydrating slow, other preservation methods are common.

==History==
{{quote box
| title = Socio-economic value of fish preservation
| qalign = left
| quote = Preservation of marine products is of great importance to the coastal poor. Preserved fish products endure adequate protein during low fishing periods. Subsistence fishers use their abundant catch of small fish to make fermented [[fish paste]] and [[smoked fish]] with the assistance of family members. Large fish are used to make fermented fish or salt dried fish. Other important processing activities include drying of small shrimp, squid, ray and shark and preparation of [[shrimp paste]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gQnPR4l3eN0C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=%22Fish+paste%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6VfKT-u4K86jiAfh8d21Bg&amp;ved=0CNgBEOgBMBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fish%20paste%22&amp;f=false ''Globalisation and Fisheries: Proceedings of an OECD-FAO Workshop''] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD Publishing. {{ISBN|9789264037762}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
| width = 250px
| align = right}}

In the past, fishing vessels were restricted in range by the simple consideration that the catch must be returned to port before it spoils and becomes worthless. The development of [[refrigeration]] and freezing technologies transformed the commercial fishing industry: fishing vessels could be larger, spending more time away from port and therefore accessing fish stocks at a much greater distance. Refrigeration and freezing also allow the catch to be distributed to markets further inland, reaching customers who previously would have had access only to dried or salted sea fish.

[[Fish canning|Canning]], developed during the 19th century has also had a significant impact on fishing by allowing seasonal catches of fish that are possibly far from large centres of population to be exploited. For example: [[canned sardines]].

[[Food preservation|Preservation]] techniques are needed to prevent fish [[Food spoilage|spoilage]] and lengthen [[shelf life]]. They are designed to inhibit the activity of spoilage [[bacteria]] and the [[metabolic]] changes that result in the loss of fish quality. [[Meat spoilage#Microbial spoilage|Spoilage bacteria]] are the specific bacteria that produce the unpleasant odours and flavours associated with spoiled fish. Fish normally host many bacteria that are not spoilage bacteria, and most of the bacteria present on spoiled fish played no role in the spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;Huss HH (1988) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7180e/V7180E00.HTM ''Quality and quality changes in fresh fish''] FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 348, Rome. {{ISBN|92-5-103507-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To flourish, bacteria need the right temperature, sufficient water and oxygen, and surroundings that are not too acidic. Preservation techniques work by interrupting one or more of these needs. Preservation techniques can be classified as follows.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation"&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/12322/en Preservation techniques] Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control of temperature==
[[File:Kingfish great south bay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ice]] preserves fish and extends shelf life by lowering the temperature]]
{{see also|Refrigerating|Freezing (food)}}

If the temperature is decreased, the metabolic activity in the fish from [[microbial]] or [[autolytic]] processes can be reduced or stopped. This is achieved by [[refrigeration]] where the temperature is dropped to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C, or [[Frozen food|freezing]] where the temperature is dropped below -18&amp;nbsp;°C. On fishing vessels, the fish are refrigerated mechanically by circulating cold air or by packing the fish in boxes with ice. [[Forage fish]], which are often caught in large numbers, are usually chilled with refrigerated or chilled seawater. Once chilled or frozen, the fish need further cooling to maintain the low temperature. There are key issues with fish cold store design and management, such as how large and energy efficient they are, and the way they are insulated and [[pallet]]ized.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt;

An effective method of preserving the freshness of fish is to chill with ice by distributing ice uniformly around the fish. It is a safe cooling method that keeps the fish moist and in an easily stored form suitable for transport. It has become widely used since the development of mechanical [[refrigeration]], which makes ice easy and cheap to produce. Ice is produced in various shapes; crushed ice and ice flakes, plates, tubes and blocks are commonly used to cool fish.&lt;ref name="FAO handling"&gt;FAO: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/12321/en Handling of fish and fish products] Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 22 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly effective is [[slurry ice]], made from micro crystals of ice formed and suspended within a solution of water and a [[Freezing-point depression|freezing point depressant]], such as common salt.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffeld M, Kawaji M and Egol PW (Eds.) (2005)''Handbook on ice slurries: fundamentals and engineering'', International Institute of Refrigeration. {{ISBN|978-2-913149-42-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent development is [[pumpable ice technology]]. Pumpable ice flows like water, and because it is [[homogeneous]], it cools fish faster than fresh water solid ice methods and eliminates freeze burns. It complies with [[HACCP]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] food safety and public health standards, and uses less energy than conventional fresh water solid ice technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deepchill™ Variable-State Ice in a Poultry Processing Plant in Korea|url=http://www.sunwell.com/suntech13.htm|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of Liquid Ice Trails aboard Challenge II|date=April 27, 2003|url=http://www.seafoodscotland.org/images/stories/downloads/pdf/libraryOfPublications/2challeng.pdf|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control of water activity==
{{see also|Dried fish|Salted fish|Smoked fish}}

The [[water activity]], a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, in a fish is defined as the ratio of the [[water vapour]] pressure in the flesh of the fish to the vapour pressure of pure water at the same temperature and pressure. It ranges between 0 and 1, and is a parameter that measures how available the water is in the flesh of the fish. Available water is necessary for the microbial and enzymatic reactions involved in spoilage. There are a number of techniques that have been or are used to tie up the available water or remove it by reducing the a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;. Traditionally, techniques such as [[Stockfish|drying]], [[Salted fish|salting]] and [[Smoked fish|smoking]] have been used, and have been used for thousands of years. These techniques can be very simple, for example, by using solar drying. In more recent times, [[freeze-drying]], water-binding [[humectant]]s, and fully automated equipment with temperature and humidity control have been added. Often a combination of these techniques is used.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt;

==Physical control of microbial loads==
[[File:Canned fish 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Microbial]] loads can be physically controlled by [[Fish canning|canning]] and then sterilizing with heat]]
{{see also|Fish canning}}

Heat or ionizing irradiation can be used to kill the [[bacteria]] that cause decomposition. Heat is applied by cooking, blanching or microwave heating in a manner that pasteurizes or sterilizes fish products. Cooking or pasteurizing does not completely inactivate microorganisms and may need to be followed with refrigeration to preserve fish products and increase their shelf life. Sterilised products are stable at ambient temperatures up to 40&amp;nbsp;°C, but to ensure they remain sterilized they need packaging in [[canning|metal cans]] or [[retortable pouch]]es before the heat treatment.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt;

==Chemical control of microbial loads==
{{see also|Biopreservation|Fermented fish}}

Microbial growth and proliferation can be inhibited by a technique called [[biopreservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ananou1 S, Maqueda1 M, Martínez-Bueno1 M and Valdivia1 E (2007) [http://www.formatex.org/microbio/pdf/Pages475-486.pdf "Biopreservation, an ecological approach to improve the safety and shelf-life of foods"] In: A. Méndez-Vilas (Ed.) ''Communicating Current Research and Educational Topics and Trends in Applied Microbiology'', Formatex. {{ISBN|978-84-611-9423-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biopreservation is achieved by adding [[antimicrobial]]s or by increasing the [[acidity]] of the fish muscle. Most bacteria stop multiplying when the [[pH]] is less than 4.5. Acidity is increased by [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]], [[marination]] or by directly adding acids (acetic, citric, lactic) to fish products. [[Lactic acid bacteria]] produce the antimicrobial [[nisin]] which further enhances preservation. Other preservatives include [[nitrite]]s, [[sulphite]]s, [[sorbate]]s, [[benzoate]]s and [[essential oil]]s.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt;

==Control of the oxygen reduction potential==
Spoilage bacteria and [[lipid oxidation]] usually need oxygen, so [[reduction potential|reducing the oxygen]] around fish can increase shelf life. This is done by [[Controlled atmosphere|controlling]] or [[Modified atmosphere|modifying the atmosphere]] around the fish, or by [[vacuum packaging]]. Controlled or modified atmospheres have specific combinations of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and the method is often combined with refrigeration for more effective fish preservation.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt;

==Combined techniques==
{{see also|Hurdle technology}}

Two or more of these techniques are often combined. This can improve preservation and reduce unwanted side effects such as the [[denaturation (food)|denaturation]] of nutrients by severe heat treatments. Common combinations are salting/drying, salting/marinating, salting/smoking, drying/smoking, pasteurization/refrigeration and controlled atmosphere/refrigeration.&lt;ref name="FAO preservation" /&gt; Other process combinations are currently being developed along the [[Hurdle technology|multiple hurdle theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Leistner L and Gould GW (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_6cQ-dFuzGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Hurdle+technologies:+combination+treatments+for+food+stability,+safety+and+quality%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wcp9TZy4OcG3cfSKiboG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Hurdle technologies: combination treatments for food stability, safety, and quality''] Springer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-47263-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fluid bearings''' are [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] in which the load is supported by a thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas between the bearing surfaces.&lt;ref name="Rowe" /&gt;  Since there is no contact between the moving parts, there is no [[sliding friction]], allowing fluid bearings to have lower friction, wear and vibration than many other types of bearings.&lt;ref name="Rowe" /&gt;

They can be broadly classified into two types: '''fluid dynamic bearings''' (also known as '''hydrodynamic bearings''') and '''hydrostatic bearings'''. Hydrostatic bearings are externally pressurized fluid bearings, where the fluid is usually oil, water or air, and the pressurization is done by a pump. Hydrodynamic bearings rely on the high speed of the [[wikt:journal|journal]] (the part of the shaft resting on the fluid) to pressurize the fluid in a wedge between the faces.  Fluid bearings are frequently used in high load, high speed or high precision applications where ordinary [[ball bearing]]s would have short life or cause high noise and vibration.  They are also used increasingly to reduce cost.  For example, [[hard disk]] drive motor fluid bearings are both quieter and cheaper than the ball bearings they replace.

The fluid bearing may have been invented by French civil engineer L. D. Girard, who in 1852 proposed a system of railway propulsion incorporating water-fed hydraulic bearings.&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{cite book

==Operation==
[[File:Hydrostatic bearing diagram.svg|thumb|right|A hydrostatic bearing has two surfaces which has a fluid forced, via a restrictive orifice, in between the surfaces so that it keeps them apart. If the gap between the surfaces reduces then the outflow via the edges of the bearing is reduced and the pressure goes up, forcing the surfaces apart again very strongly, giving excellent control of the gap and giving low friction.]]

Fluid bearings are noncontact bearings that use a thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas [[fluid]] between the moving bearing faces, typically sealed around or under the rotating shaft.&lt;ref name="Rowe"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The moving parts do not come into contact, so there is no [[sliding friction]]; the load force is supported solely by the pressure of the moving fluid. There are two principal ways of getting the fluid into the bearing:

*In '''fluid static''', '''hydrostatic''' and many '''gas''' or '''air bearings''', the fluid is pumped in through an orifice or through a porous material. Such bearings should be equipped with the shaft position control system, which adjusts the fluid pressure and consumption according to the rotation speed and shaft load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13909/proektirovanie_elementa_struynoy_sistemyupravleniya_gazostaticheskim_podshipnikom.htm|title=Element design for an inkjet system of hydrostatic gas bearing control.|author= Il’ina T.E., Prodan N.V.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=921–929|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;      
*In '''fluid-dynamic bearings''', the bearing rotation sucks the fluid on to the inner surface of the bearing, forming a lubricating wedge under or around the shaft.

Hydrostatic bearings rely on an external pump.  The power required by that pump contributes to system energy loss, just as bearing friction otherwise would.  Better seals can reduce leak rates and pumping power, but may increase friction.

Hydrodynamic bearings rely on bearing motion to suck fluid into the bearing, and may have high friction and short life at speeds lower than design, or during starts and stops. An external pump or secondary bearing may be used for startup and shutdown to prevent damage to the hydrodynamic bearing. A secondary bearing may have high friction and short operating life, but good overall service life if bearing starts and stops are infrequent.

===Hydrodynamic lubrication===
''Hydrodynamic'' (HD) ''lubrication'', also known as ''fluid film lubrication'' has essential elements:

#A [[lubricant]], which must be a [[viscous]] fluid. 
#[[Hydrodynamic]] flow behavior of fluid between [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and journal.
#The surfaces between which the fluid films move must be convergent.

Hydrodynamic (Full Film) Lubrication is obtained when two mating surfaces are completely separated by a cohesive film of lubricant.

The thickness of the film thus exceeds the combined roughness of the surfaces. The coefficient of friction is lower than with boundary-layer lubrication. Hydrodynamic lubrication prevents wear in moving parts, and metal to metal contact is prevented.

Hydrodynamic lubrication requires thin, converging fluid films.  These fluids can be liquid or gas, so long as they exhibit viscosity.  In computer components, like a [[hard disk]], heads are supported by hydrodynamic lubrication in which the fluid film is the atmosphere.

The scale of these films is on the order of micrometers.  Their convergence creates pressures normal to the surfaces they contact, forcing them apart.

Three types of bearings include:

*Self-acting: Film exists due to relative motion. e.g. [[spiral groove bearing]]s.
*Squeeze film: Film exists due to relative normal motion.
*Externally pressurized: Film exists due to external pressurization.

Conceptually the bearings can be thought of as two major geometric classes: bearing-journal (anti-friction), and plane-slider (friction).

The [[Reynolds equation]]s can be used to derive the governing principles for the fluids.  Note that when gases are used, their derivation is much more involved.

The thin films can be thought to have pressure and viscous forces acting on them.  Because there is a difference in velocity there will be a difference in the surface traction vectors. Because of mass conservation we can also assume an increase in pressure, making the body forces different.

*Hydrodynamic lubrication – characteristics:

# Fluid film at the point of minimum thickness decreases in thickness as the load increases
# Pressure within the fluid mass increases as the film thickness decreases due to load
# Pressure within the fluid mass is greatest at some point approaching minimum clearance and lowest at the point of maximum clearance (due to divergence)
# Viscosity increases as pressure increases (more resistance to shear)
# Film thickness at the point of minimum clearance increases with the use of more viscous fluids
# With same load, the pressure increases as the viscosity of fluid increases
# With a given load and fluid, the thickness of the film will increase as speed is increased
# Fluid friction increases as the viscosity of the lubricant becomes greater

*Hydrodynamic condition – Fluid velocity:

# Fluid velocity depends on velocity of the journal or rider
# Increase in relative velocity tends towards a decrease in eccentricity of journal bearing centers
# This is accompanied by greater minimum film thickness

*Hydrodynamic condition – Load:

# Increase in load decreases minimum film thickness
# Also increases pressure within the film mass to provide a counteracting force
# Pressure acts in all directions, hence it tends to squeeze the oil out of the ends of the bearing
# Increase in pressure increases fluid viscosity

*Bearing characteristic number:

Since viscosity, velocity, and load determine the characteristics of a hydrodynamic condition, a bearing characteristic number was developed based on the effects of these on film thickness.

: Increase in velocity increases min. film thickness
: Increase in viscosity increases min. film thickness
: Increase in load decreases min. film thickness

Therefore,
: Viscosity × velocity/unit load = a dimensionless number = ''C''

''C'' is known as the '''bearing characteristic number'''.

The value of ''C'', to some extent, gives an indication of whether there will be hydrodynamic lubrication or not

==Characteristics and principles&lt;sup&gt;[not discussed]&lt;/sup&gt; of operation==
Fluid bearings can be relatively cheap compared to other [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s with a similar load rating.  The bearing can be as simple as two smooth surfaces with seals to keep in the working fluid. In contrast, a conventional [[rolling-element bearing]] may require many high-precision rollers with complicated shapes. Hydrostatic and many gas bearings do have the complication and expense of external pumps.

Most fluid bearings require little or no maintenance, and have almost unlimited life. Conventional rolling-element bearings usually have shorter life and require regular maintenance. Pumped hydrostatic and [[aerostatic (gas)]] bearing designs retain low friction down to zero speed and need not suffer start/stop wear, provided the pump does not fail.

Fluid bearings generally have very low friction—far better than mechanical bearings.  One source of friction in a fluid bearing is the [[viscosity]] of the fluid. Hydrostatic gas bearings are among the lowest friction bearings.  However, lower fluid viscosity also typically means fluid leaks faster from the bearing surfaces, thus requiring increased power for pumps or friction from seals.

When a roller or ball is heavily loaded, fluid bearings have clearances that change less under load (are "stiffer") than mechanical bearings.  It might seem that bearing stiffness, as with maximum design load, would be a simple function of average fluid pressure and the bearing surface area.  In practice, when bearing surfaces are pressed together, the fluid outflow is constricted. This significantly increases the pressure of the fluid between the bearing faces.  As fluid bearing faces can be comparatively larger than rolling surfaces, even small fluid pressure differences cause large restoring forces, maintaining the gap.

However, in lightly loaded bearings, such as disk drives, the typical ball bearing stiffnesses are ~10^7 MN/m.  Comparable fluid bearings have stiffness of ~10^6 MN/m.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Because of this, some fluid bearings, particularly hydrostatic bearings, are deliberately designed to pre-load the bearing to increase the stiffness.

Fluid bearings often inherently add significant damping. This helps attenuate resonances at the gyroscopic frequencies of journal bearings (sometimes called conical or rocking modes).

It is very difficult to make a mechanical bearing which is atomically smooth and round; and mechanical bearings deform in high-speed operation due to [[centripetal force]].  In contrast, fluid bearings self-correct for minor imperfections.

Fluid bearings are typically quieter and smoother (more consistent friction) than rolling-element bearings.  For example, [[hard disk]]s manufactured with fluid bearings have noise ratings for bearings/motors on the order of 20–24 [[decibel|dB]], which is a little more than the background noise of a quiet room.  Drives based on rolling-element bearings are typically at least 4&amp;nbsp;dB noisier.

Fluid bearings can be made with a lower NRRO (non repeatable run out) than a ball or rolling element bearing. This can be critical in modern hard disk drive and ultra precision spindles.

Tilting pad bearings are used as radial bearings for supporting and locating shafts in compressors.

===Disadvantages===
* Overall power consumption is typically higher compared to ball bearings.
* Power consumption and stiffness or damping greatly vary with temperature, which complicates the design and operation of a fluid bearing in wide temperature range situations.
* Fluid bearings can catastrophically seize under shock situations. Ball bearings deteriorate more gradually and provide acoustic symptoms.
* Like cage frequency vibration in a ball bearing, the half frequency whirl is a bearing instability that generates eccentric [[precession]] which can lead to poor performance and reduced life.
* Fluid leakage; keeping fluid in the bearing can be a challenge.
* Oil fluid bearings are impractical in environments where oil leakage can be destructive or where maintenance is not economical.
* Fluid bearing "pads" often have to be used in pairs or triples to avoid the bearing tilting and losing the fluid from one side.
* Unlike greaseless mechanical bearings, fluid bearings cannot operate at the extremely low temperatures needed for some specialized scientific research applications.

==Some fluid bearings==

===Foil bearings===

{{Main|Foil bearing}}

[[Foil bearing]]s are a type of fluid dynamic air bearing that was introduced in high speed turbine applications in the 1960s by [[Garrett AiResearch]].  They use a gas as the working fluid, usually air and require no external pressurisation system.

===Journal bearings===

Journal bearings are lubricated with fluid. The working part of the bearing operates by carrying oil at a low pressure and is compressed to allow the bearing to spin around the shaft without any contact.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosal, Arindam.

===Water Lubricated Rubber Bearings===

Water lubricated rubber bearings have long cylindrical metal shell that hosts multiple rubber [[stave bearing|stave]]s separated by axial grooves. The usage of the bearing has three major advantages: (i) pumped water going through the bearing is conveniently used as a lubricant, which reduces pump operation cost; (ii) water flow takes away heat and fine particles through the bearing grooves; and (iii) the natural resilience of rubber gives the bearing good properties for shock and vibration absorption and wear resistance. Water lubricated rubber bearings operate under the condition of mixed-lubrication. &lt;ref&gt;Liu, S.

===Air bearings===
{{Main|air bearing}}
[[File:Luftlagerung einer Hochfrequenz-Spindel für das Leiterplattenbohren.jpg|thumb|Air bearings on a drill spindle for printed circuit boards]]
Unlike contact-roller bearings, an air bearing (or [[air caster]]) utilizes a thin film of pressurized air to provide an exceedingly low friction load-bearing interface between surfaces. The two surfaces don't touch. Being non-contact, air bearings avoid the traditional bearing-related problems of friction, wear, particulates, and lubricant handling, and offer distinct advantages in precision positioning, such as lacking backlash and stiction, as well as in high-speed applications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The fluid film of the bearing is air that flows through the bearing itself to the bearing surface. The design of the air bearing is such that, although the air constantly escapes from the bearing gap, the pressure between the faces of the bearing is enough to support the working loads.

Air-lubricated bearings require highly finished surfaces and precise manufacturing, and can only be operated in high-speed applications.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

====Examples====
[[Air hockey]] is a game based on an aerostatic bearing which suspends the puck and players' paddles to provide low friction and thus sustain high puck speeds. The bearing uses a flat plane with periodic orifices which deliver air just over ambient pressure. The puck and paddles rest on air.

[[File:Collection of air bearings from Specialty Components.jpg|thumb|Air bearings used to provide linear and rotational motion]]

Another example of a fluid bearing is [[ice skating]]. Ice skates form a hydrodynamic fluid bearing where the skate and ice are separated by a layer of water caused by [[entropy]] (formerly thought to be caused by pressure-induced melting; see [[ice skating#Physics|ice skating]] for details.)

===Michell/Kingsbury tilting-pad fluid bearings{{Anchor|Tilting-pad bearing}}===
{{other uses|Thrust block}}
Michell/Kingsbury fluid dynamic tilting-pad bearings were invented independently and almost simultaneously by both British-born Australian, [[Anthony Michell|Anthony George Maldon Michell]] and American [[tribology|tribologist]] [[Albert Kingsbury]]. Both designs were near-identical except for differences in the approach used for pivoting the pads. Michell mathematically derived the pressure distribution where a span-wise line pivot was placed, allowing the load to act through the point of maximum fluid pressure. The Kingsbury patent lacked this mathematical approach, and the pad's pivot point was placed in the geometric centre of the bearing.&lt;ref&gt;Stachowiak, Gwidon; Batchelor, Andrew W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ8p0x2S1dwC&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Engineering Tribology pp 135–136"], ''[[Butterworth–Heinemann]]'', London, 31 March 2011. Retrieved on 23 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Michell's patent (in Britain and Australia) was granted in 1905, while Kingsbury's first patent attempt was 1907. Kingsbury's U.S. patent was eventually granted in 1911 after he demonstrated that he had been working on the concept for many years. As stated by Sydney Walker, a long-time employee of Michell's, the granting of Kingsbury's patent was "a blow which Michell found hard to accept".

The bearing has [[circle|sectional]] ''shoes'', or ''pads'' on pivots.  When the bearing is in operation, the rotating part of the bearing carries fresh oil in to the pad area through [[Drag (physics)|viscous drag]].  Fluid pressure causes the pad to tilt slightly, creating a narrow constriction between the shoe and the other bearing surface. A wedge of pressurised fluid builds behind this constriction, separating the moving parts.  The tilt of the pad adaptively changes with bearing load and speed.  Various design details ensure continued replenishment of the oil to avoid overheating and pad damage.

Michell/Kingsbury fluid bearings are used in a wider variety of heavy-duty rotating equipment, including in [[hydroelectric plant]]s to support turbines and generators weighing hundreds of tons.  They are also used in very heavy machinery, such as [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[propeller shaft]]s.

The first tilting pad bearing in service was probably built under A.G.M. Michell's guidance by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd, for a [[centrifugal pump]] at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, in 1907, just two years after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynold's equation]]. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel [[steamboat]] the ''Paris'', but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the [[First World War]]. The practical results were spectacular – the troublesome [[thrust block]] became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles. It was estimated that the Royal Navy saved coal to a value of £500,000 in 1918 alone as a result of fitting Michell's tilting-pad bearings.

According to the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] (see reference link), the first Michell/Kingsbury fluid bearing in the US was installed in the [[Holtwood Dam|Holtwood Hydroelectric Power Plant]] (on the [[Susquehanna River]], near [[Lancaster Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], US) in 1912.  The 2.25-tonne bearing supports a [[water turbine]] and [[electric generator]] with a rotating mass of about 165 tonnes and water turbine pressure adding another 40 tonnes.  The bearing has been in nearly continuous service since 1912, with no parts replaced.  The [[ASME]] reported it was still in service as of 2000.  As of 2002, the manufacturer estimated the bearings at Holtwood should have a maintenance-free life of about 1,300 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1647">'''Full-custom''' design is a methodology for designing [[integrated circuit]]s by specifying the layout of each individual [[transistor]] and the interconnections between them.  Alternatives to full-custom design include various forms of semi-custom design, such as the repetition of small transistor subcircuits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The VLSI handbook | author = Rajneesh kaswan | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-8493-8593-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0r5LihlMogkC&amp;pg=PT853&amp;dq=%22full+custom+design%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=Bq1nSL7mAoHksQOn_tA2&amp;sig=ACfU3U3byyX96xBFhc8pBSTYlyTJXHFcQg }}&lt;/ref&gt; one such methodology is the use of [[Library (electronics)|standard cell libraries]] (standard cell libraries are themselves designed using full-custom design techniques).  

Full-custom design potentially maximizes the performance of the chip, and minimizes its area, but is extremely labor-intensive to implement.  Full-custom design is limited to ICs that are to be fabricated in extremely high volumes, notably certain [[microprocessor]]s and a small number of [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s. 

The main factor affecting the design and production of ASICs is the high cost of [[mask set]]s and the requisite [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] design tools. The mask sets are required in order to transfer the ASIC designs onto the [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]].

The '''Global Area Reference System''' ('''GARS''') is a standardized geospatial reference system developed by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) for use across the [[United States Department of Defense]]. Under the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Instruction CJCSI 3900.01C dated 30 June 2007, GARS was adopted for use by the US DoD as "the “area-centric” counterpart to the “point-centric” [[Military Grid Reference System|MGRS]]".  It uses the [[WGS 84|WGS 1984]] Datum and is based on lines of longitude (LONG) and latitude (LAT). It is intended to provide an integrated common frame of reference for joint force situational awareness to facilitate air-to-ground coordination, deconfliction, integration, and synchronization. This area reference system provides a common language between the components and simplifies communications.  GARS is primarily designed as a battlespace management tool and not to be used for navigation or targeting.

== Design ==

* GARS divides the surface of the earth into 30-minute by 30-minute cells. Each cell is identified by a five-character designation. (ex. 006AG)
** The first three characters designate a 30-minute wide longitudinal band. Beginning with the 180-degree meridian and proceeding eastward, the bands are numbered from 001 to 720, so that 180 E to 179 30’W is band 001; 179 30’W to 179 00’W is band 002; and so on. 
** The fourth and fifth characters designate a 30-minute wide latitudinal band. Beginning at the south pole and proceeding northward, the bands are lettered from AA to QZ (omitting I and O) so that 90 00’S to 89 30’S is band AA; 89 30’S to 89 00’S is band AB; and so on. 
* Each 30-minute cell is divided into four 15-minute by 15-minute quadrants.
** The quadrants are numbered sequentially, from west to east, starting with the northernmost band. Specifically, the northwest quadrant is “1”; the northeast quadrant is “2”; the southwest quadrant is “3”; the southeast quadrant is “4”.
** Each quadrant is identified by a six-character designation. (ex. 006AG3) The first five characters comprise the 30-minute cell designation. The sixth character is the quadrant number. 
* Each 15-minute quadrant is divided into nine 5-minute by 5-minute areas.
** The areas are numbered sequentially, from west to east, starting with the northernmost band. The graphical representation of a 15-minute quadrant with numbered 5-minute by 5-minute areas resembles a telephone keypad.
** Each 5-minute by 5-minute area, or keypad “key” is identified by a seven-character designation. The first six characters comprise the 15-minute quadrant designation. The seventh character is the keypad “key” number. (ex.006AG39)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3627">The '''Golden Bull''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] prize in the world of brokers since 2007. The choice for the bull as a symbol is easy, since it also represents a rising exchange, which therefore is also called a [[Market trend#Bull market|bullmarket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/van/2013/maart/02/een-stier-in-de-financiele-wereld-12624713 A bull in the financial world]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the adding of a jury, the price has got more esteem with professional traders. The press also noticed and on special broker and trading websites there has been more and more attention towards the issue of the ''Golden Bull'' award.

== Categories ==
On annual basis, there are prizes in different categories. In 2015 these categories were: ''best [[broker]], best trade innovation, best fund, best ETF, Green Bull (best sustainable fund), best mixfund-range'', ''best asset'' en ''best trade-expert''. The winners of the categories are chosen by a jury, except for the people choice award for ''best trade-expert''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belegger.nl/Column/168202/BUX-DeGiro-en-Care-IS-winnaars-Gouden-Stier-2015.aspx Bux, DeGiro and Care IS winners Golden Bull 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation and jury ==
Since 2015, the Golden Bull award has been hosted by the biggest broker websites in The Netherlands: IEX.nl, Belegger.nl, DeBeurs.nl, EuroBench.com en BeursOnline. Before that the organization of the event was in hands of Belegger.nl. This website was in hands of the Dutch company [[Sanoma Media]] until 2015 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=521166 Company Overview of Sanoma Digital Group]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now in hands of Value8 of former chairman of the [[Vereniging van Effectenbezitters]], Peter Paul de Vries.
In the first few years the winners of the award were determined by public vote. The last few years the public vote made place for a jury with specialists from the trading world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goudenstier.nl/jury/ Goudenstier.nl Value 8 takes over exchange platforms Belegger.nl and Beursduivel.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Glickauf''' Jr. (January 15, 1912 – July 9, 2005), was an American-born engineer, inventor and corporate executive known as one of the first advocates of the use of computers in business and industry and the “father” of the computer consulting industry.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;Manya A. Brachear [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-28/news/0507280218_1_arthur-andersen-electronic-computer-ham-radio-operator "Joseph Glickauf Jr."], ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', Chicago, July 28, 2005. Retrieved on 10 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Joseph Glickauf was hired by Arthur Andersen Co. immediately after serving in the US Navy and was tasked with initiating the use of the freshly invented computer for his employer. Glickauf became familiar with the capabilities of the UNIVAC and immediately saw the far-reaching implications of computers for business. To demonstrate the computer to Arthur Andersen’s employees he built the Arthur Andersen Demonstration Computer known as “Glickiac”. The company management was quick to see the potential and made resources available for future development. 
	
In 1953 General Electric Appliance Park hired Arthur Andersen to automate GE’s payroll. Glickauf lead the effort and recommended GE the installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer. The project was initially a failure but it started what is now known as the “computer consulting”.&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt;

A '''level spreader''' is an [[erosion control]] device designed to reduce [[water pollution]] by mitigating the impact of high-velocity [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff]].  It is used both on [[construction sites]] and for permanent applications such as drainage for [[road]]s and [[highway]]s. The device reduces the energy level in high-velocity flow by converting it into sheet flow, and disperses the discharged water so that it may be [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrated]] into [[soil]].

[[File:Sadz na ryby A 232.jpg|thumb|A wooden livewell (container for live bait), towed by fishing boat. Exposition in Fisheries Museum in Hel (branch of [[National Maritime Museum in Gdańsk]])]]A '''livewell''' is a tank found on many [[fishing boat]]s that is used to keep [[bait (fishing)|bait]] and caught fish alive. It  works by pumping fresh water from the surrounding body into the tank, as well as keeping the water [[aerated]].  A [[rule of thumb]] for determining the necessitated size of a livewell is that every one inch of fish needs a gallon of water if it is desired to keep the fish alive for a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccoastalfishing.com/index.htm?livewells.htm~main Live Well With Livewells] nccoastalfishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides size and water circulation, two other key factors of the functionality of a livewell are maintaining proper temperature and removing [[metabolic waste]]. Water temperatures should be below {{convert|75|F|C}}; ice can be used as a [[coolant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massbass.com/conservation/In%20the%20livewell%20part2%20sec%202.htm Keeping Bass Alive Livewell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822134637/http://www.massbass.com/conservation/In%20the%20livewell%20part2%20sec%202.htm |date=2009-08-22 }} massbass.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxygen levels==
It is very important to maintain adequate oxygen levels in the livewell. It should be above 5 [[parts per million]]. Electric [[aeration systems]] are often used to do this. These often work by creating a spray that increases the [[surface area]] of the water, or by passing it through a [[Venturi effect|Venturi]].

A livewell is a box used to transport live aquatic animals; shrimp, baitfish and mature fish, saltwater or freshwater species. A livewell should be made of materials that are non- toxic to aquatic animals. The shape may be square, rectangular, oval or round. The box may be insulated, portable, have a drain and lid.
Maintaining minimal safe water quality standards in livewell water is essential and necessary to insure a safe habitat for all the captive animals during transport.
When transporting baitfish, shrimp or mature fish, maintaining dissolved oxygen saturation (DO Sat) is the single most important water quality parameter that must be controlled.
Livewell oxygen–injection systems and LOX systems insure O2 enriched livewell water. Pure 100% compressed welding oxygen is injected into the water with a precision dose adjustable high-pressure oxygen regulator, oxygen tube and diffuser. Commercial and sport fishing oxygen-injection systems are designed to insure 100% DO Saturation or greater whether the bait or fish load is 1&amp;nbsp;lb or &gt;1000&amp;nbsp;lbs.
Minimal safe EPA water quality standards for steady state environments (rivers, lakes, ponds, etc.) is 5 ppm DO.

Dissolved oxygen is the single most important factor for keeping bass alive, and an understanding of factors that affect oxygen levels will better enable anglers to keep their fish [aquatic animals] alive. At a moderate water temperature of 70˚F, 100 percent oxygen saturation is 8.8&amp;nbsp;mg/l of oxygen, whereas at the higher temperature of 80˚F, 100 percent saturation is 7.9&amp;nbsp;mg/l. Both of these 100 percent saturation oxygen levels are suitable for keeping bass alive.
Without injecting oxygen into the livewell, it is very difficult to supply enough oxygen to keep alive heavier tournament limits.
Oxygen injection has long been used by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) hatcheries to maintain the health of fish being stocked into reservoirs. Fisheries staff regularly transport or hold fish in ratios equal to or greater than one pound of fish to a gallon of water. However, boat manufactures do not offer oxygen injection system options…
Proper installation and operation of an oxygen injection system will ensure oxygen levels remain above the preferred level of 7&amp;nbsp;mg/l even when livewells contain heavy limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">[[Image:Melamine-CH2Oresin idealized.svg|right|thumb|Idealized subunit of a melamine-formaldehyde resin (R - H, alkyl).]]
'''Melamine resin''' or '''melamine formaldehyde''' (also shortened to '''melamine''') is a hard, [[thermosetting plastic]] material made from [[melamine]] and [[formaldehyde]] by [[polymerization]].&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt; 

In its butylated form, it is dissolved in [[n-Butanol|''n''-butanol]] and [[xylene]]. It is then used to cross-link with [[alkyd]], [[epoxy]], [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]], and [[polyester]] resins, used in surface coatings. There are many types, varying from very slow to very fast curing. 

It was discovered by [[William F. Talbot]],&lt;ref name="founding"&gt;{{cite book | first = Weldon B | last = Gibson | authorlink = Weldon B. Gibson | title = SRI: The Founding Years | publisher = Stanford Research Institute | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-913232-80-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who applied to patent it on December 12, 1936.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 2260239 | status = patent | title = Manufacture of melamine-aldehyde condensation products | gdate = 1941-10-21 | fdate = 1936-12-10 | pridate = 1936-12-10 | inventor = Talbot, William F | invent1 = Talbot, William F | assign1 = Monsanto Chemicals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Construction material ===
The principal use of melamine resin is as the main constituent of high-pressure [[laminate]]s, such as [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]] and [[Arborite]], and of [[laminate flooring]]. Melamine-resin tile wall panels can also be used as [[whiteboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=H. Deim, G. Matthias, R. A. Wagner|title=Amino Resins|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_115.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melamine formaldehyde is used in plastic laminate and overlay materials. Formaldehyde is more tightly bound in melamine-formaldehyde than it is in urea-formaldehyde, reducing emissions.

====In the kitchen====
[[Image:Piatto in melammina.jpg|thumb|A melamine-resin plate]]
[[Image:Ladle melamine 18j07.JPG|thumb|A melamine-resin [[Ladle (spoon)|ladle]]]]
Melamine resin is often used in kitchen utensils and plates (such as Melmac). Melamine resin utensils and bowls are not [[Microwave oven#Microwave-safe plastics|microwave safe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Michigan State University Extension]] | work = Home Maintenance and Repair | date = 2003-06-24 | title = Melamine Plastic | author = Anne Field | url = http://www.msue.msu.edu/objects/content_revision/download.cfm/revision_id.493538/workspace_id.-4/01500096.html/ |accessdate=2016-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327144152/http://www.msue.msu.edu/objects/content_revision/download.cfm/revision_id.493538/workspace_id.-4/01500096.html/ |archivedate=2014-03-27 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s and 1960s melamine [[tableware]] became fashionable. Aided by the stylish modern designs of [[A. H. Woodfull]] and the Product Design Unit of British Industrial Plastics, it was thought to threaten the dominant position of [[ceramic]]s in the market. The tendency of melamine cups and plates to stain and scratch led sales to decline in the late 1960s, however, and eventually the material became largely restricted to the [[camping]] and [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Summer 2004 |title=The Rise and Fall of Melamine Tableware |journal=plastiquarian |issue=32 |page=10 |publisher=Plastics Historical Society |url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/styr3n3/pqs/pq32.htm |accessdate=2008-12-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625052055/http://www.plastiquarian.com/styr3n3/pqs/pq32.htm |archivedate=2008-06-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cabinet and furniture making ====
Melamine resin is often used to saturate decorative paper that is laminated under heat and pressure and then pasted onto [[particle board]]; the resulting panel, often called ''melamine'', is commonly used in [[ready-to-assemble furniture]] and [[Cabinet making|kitchen cabinet]]s.

Melamine is available in diverse sizes and thicknesses, as well as a large number of colors and patterns. The sheets are heavy; the resin is prone to chipping when being cut with conventional table saws.&lt;ref name = pro&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Pro Woodworking Tips.com | title = Melamine | url = http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Melamine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and structure==
Melamine-formaldehyde resin forms via the [[condensation]] of [[formaldehyde]] with melamine to give, under idealized conditions, the hexa-hydroxymethyl derivative.  Upon heating in the presence of acid, this or similar hydroxymethylated species undergoes further condensation and crosslinking.  Linkages between the heterocycles include mono-, di-, and poly[[ether]]s.  The microstructure of the material can be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;David R. Bauer "Melamine/formaldehyde crosslinkers: characterization, network formation and crosslink degradation" Progress in Organic Coatings 1986, Volume 14, pp. 193–218. {{doi|10.1016/0033-0655(86)80001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crosslinking density of melamine resins can be controlled by co-condensation with bifunctional analogues of melamine, such as [[benzoguanamine]] and [[acetoguanamine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18792">A '''momentum exchange tether''' is a kind of [[space tether]] that could theoretically be used as a launch system, or to change spacecraft orbits.  Momentum exchange tethers create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to [[Centrifugal force|the pseudo-force known as centrifugal force]].  While the tether system rotates, the objects on either end of the tether will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the tether and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation.  The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating tether to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude.  However, using [[electrodynamic tether]] thrusting, or [[ion propulsion]] the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A non-rotating tether is a rotating tether that rotates exactly once per orbit so that it always has a vertical orientation relative to the parent body.  A spacecraft arriving at the lower end of this tether, or departing from the upper end, will take momentum from the tether, while a spacecraft departing from the lower end of the tether, or arriving at the upper end, will add momentum to the tether. 

In some cases momentum exchange systems are intended to run as balanced transportation schemes where an arriving spacecraft or payload is exchanged with one leaving with the same speed and mass, and then no net change in momentum or angular momentum occurs.

== Tether systems ==

=== Tidal stabilization ===
{{Main article|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}
[[File:Skyhooks.gif|thumb|right|A rotating tether and a tidally stabilized tether in orbit]]

Gravity-gradient stabilization, also called "gravity stabilization" and "tidal stabilization", is a simple and reliable method for controlling the attitude of a satellite that requires no electronic control systems, rocket motors or propellant.

This type of [[attitude control]] tether has a small mass on one end, and a [[satellite]] on the other. [[Tidal force]]s stretch the tether between the two masses. There are two ways of explaining tidal forces. In one, the upper end mass of the system is moving faster than orbital velocity for its altitude, so [[centrifugal force]] makes it want to move further away from the planet it is orbiting. At the same time, the lower end mass of the system is moving at less than orbital speed for its altitude, so it wants to move closer to the planet.  The end result is that the tether is under constant tension and wants to hang in a vertical orientation. The other way to explain tidal force is that the top of a tall object weighs less than the bottom, so they are pulled by different amounts. The "extra" pull on the "bottom" of the object stretches it out. On [[Earth]], these are small effects, but in space, nothing opposes them.  Either way, the end result is that the tidal forces stabilize the satellite so that its long dimension points towards the planet it is orbiting. Simple satellites have often been stabilized this way; either with tethers, or with how the mass is distributed within the satellite.

As with any freely hanging object, it can be disturbed and start to swing.  Since there is no atmospheric drag in space to slow the swing, a small bottle of fluid with baffles may be mounted in the spacecraft to damp the pendulum vibrations via the viscous friction of the fluid.

==== Sky-hook ====
{{main article|Skyhook (structure)}}
A sky-hook is a theoretical class of orbiting [[tether propulsion]] intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;H. Moravec, "A non-synchronous orbital skyhook". ''Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 307–322, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Colombo, E. M. Gaposchkin, M. D. Grossi, and G. C. Weiffenbach, “The sky-hook: a shuttle-borne tool for low-orbital-altitude research,” Meccanica, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 3–20, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.M. L. Cosmo and E. C. Lorenzini, Tethers in Space Handbook, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala, USA, 3rd edition, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.L. Johnson, B. Gilchrist, R. D. Estes, and E. Lorenzini, "Overview of future NASA tether applications," ''Advances in Space Research'', vol. 24, no. 8, pp. 1055–1063, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Levin, "Dynamic Analysis of Space Tether Missions", ''American Astronautical Society'', Washington, DC, USA, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for sky-hooks include designs that employ tethers spinning at hyper-sonic speed for catching high speed payloads or high altitude aircraft and placing them in orbit.&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"/&gt;

=== Electrodynamic tethers ===
{{Main article|Electrodynamic tether}}
[[Image:USP6116544-Circuit.png|thumb|left|Electrons flow through the conductive structure of the tether to the power system interface, where it supplies power to an associated load, not shown. (Source: U.S. patent 6,116,544, "Electrodynamic Tether And Method of Use".)]]

In a strong planetary [[magnetic field]] such as around the Earth, a conducting tether can be configured as an [[electrodynamic tether]]. This can either be used as a [[dynamo]] to generate power for the satellite at the cost of slowing its orbital velocity, or it can be used to increase the orbital velocity of the satellite by putting power into the tether from the satellite's power system. Thus the tether can be used to either accelerate or to slow an [[orbit]]ing spacecraft without using any rocket propellant.&lt;ref name= "handbook"&gt;[[NASA]], [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980018321_1998056794.pdf Tethers In Space Handbook], edited by M. L. Cosmo and E. C. Lorenzini, third edition December 1997 (accessed 20 October 2010); see also version of [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/337451main_Tethers_In_Space_Handbook_Section_1_2.pdf NASA MSFC]; available on [https://www.scribd.com/doc/13841374/Tethers-in-Space-Handbook-3rd-Ed Scribd]&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this techniques with a rotating tether, the current through the tether must alternate in phase with the rotation rate of the tether in order to produce either a consistent slowing force or a consistent accelerating force.

Whether slowing or accelerating the satellite, the electrodynamic tether pushes against the planet's magnetic field, and thus the momentum gained or lost ultimately comes from the planet.

=== Bolo ===

A Bolo, or rotating tether, is a tether that rotates more than once per orbit and whose endpoints have a significant tip speed (~ 1 – 3&amp;nbsp;km/s).  The maximum speed of the endpoints is limited by the strength of the cable material and the safety factor it is designed for.

The purpose of the Bolo is to either speed up, or slow down, a spacecraft that docks with it without using any of the spacecraft's on-board propellant and to change the spacecraft's orbital flight path.  Effectively, the Bolo acts as a reusable upper stage for any spacecraft that docks with it.

The momentum imparted to the spacecraft by the Bolo is not free. In the same way that the Bolo changes the spacecraft's momentum and direction of travel, the Bolo's orbital [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum|rotational momentum]] is also changed, and this costs [[energy]] that must be replaced. The idea is that the replacement energy would come from a more efficient and lower cost source than a chemical rocket motor.  Two possible lower cost sources for this replacement energy are an ion propulsion system, or an electrodynamic tether propulsion system that would be part of the Bolo. An essentially free source of replacement energy is momentum gathered from payloads to be accelerated in the other direction, suggesting that the need for adding energy from propulsion systems will be quite minimal with balanced, two-way, space commerce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Rotovator ===
[[File:Cycloid f.gif|right|thumb|If the orbital velocity and the tether rotation rate are synchronized, in the rotovator concept the tether tip moves in a cycloid, and at the lowest point is momentarily stationary with respect to the ground, where it can "hook" a payload and swing it into orbit.)]]

Rotovators are rotating tethers with a rotational direction such that the lower endpoint of the tether is moving slower than the orbital velocity of the tether and the upper endpoint is moving faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baenebooks.com/chapters/0671876864/0671876864_toc.htm] Indistinguishable From Magic [[Robert Forward]]- Chapter 4 Beanstalk&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a [[portmanteau]] derived from the words ''[[wikt:rotor|rotor]]'' and ''[[elevator]]''.

If the tether is long enough and the rotation rate high enough, it is possible for the lower endpoint to completely cancel the orbital speed of the tether such that the lower endpoint is stationary with respect to the planetary surface that the tether is orbiting.  As described by Moravec,&lt;ref name="nonsynch"&gt;Hans Moravec, [https://archive.li/19991012232419/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx “Orbital Bridges”] (1986) (accessed Oct. 10, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "moravec87"&gt;Hans Moravec, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx "Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials"] (Hans Moravec's thoughts on skyhooks, tethers, rotavators, etc., as of 1987) (accessed 10 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; this is "a satellite that rotates like a wheel". The tip of the tether moves in approximately a [[cycloid]], in which it is momentarily stationary with respect to the ground. In this case, a payload that is "grabbed" by a capture mechanism on the rotating tether during the moment when it is stationary would be picked up and lifted into orbit; and potentially could be released at the top of the rotation, at which point it is moving with a speed significantly greater than the escape velocity and thus could be released onto an interplanetary trajectory. (As with the bolo, discussed above, the momentum and energy given to the payload must be made up, either with a high-efficiency rocket engine, or with momentum gathered from payload moving the other direction.)

On bodies with an atmosphere, such as the Earth, the tether tip must stay above the dense atmosphere. On bodies with reasonably low orbital speed (such as the [[Moon]] and possibly [[Mars]]), a rotovator in low orbit can potentially touch the ground, thereby providing cheap surface transport as well as launching materials into [[cislunar space]]. In January 2000, [[The Boeing Company]] completed a study of tether launch systems including [[two-stage tethers]] that had been commissioned by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]].&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Thomas J. |last=Bogar |first2=Michal E. |last2=Bangham |first3=Robert L. |last3=Forward |first4=Mark J. |last4=Lewis |contribution=Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch System |title=Research Grant No. 07600-018l Phase I Final Report |publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts |date=7 January 2000 |contribution-url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/355Bogar.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth launch assist bolo===

Unfortunately an Earth-to-orbit rotovator cannot be built from currently available materials since the thickness and tether mass to handle the loads on the rotovator would be uneconomically large. A "watered down" rotovator with two-thirds the rotational speed, however, would halve the centripetal acceleration stresses.

Therefore, another trick to achieve lower stresses is that rather than picking up a cargo from the ground at zero velocity, a rotovator could pick up a moving vehicle and sling it into orbit. For example, a rotovator could pick up a [[mach number|Mach 12]] aircraft from the upper atmosphere of the Earth and move it into orbit without using rockets, and could likewise catch such a vehicle and lower it into atmospheric flight. It is easier for a rocket to achieve the lower tip speed, so "single stage to tether" has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;AIAA95-2895 "Potential launch cost savings of a tether transport facility"&lt;/ref&gt; One such is called the Hyper-sonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL).&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"/&gt; Either air breathing or rocket to tether could save a great deal of fuel per flight, and would permit for both a simpler vehicle and more cargo.

The company [[Tethers Unlimited, Inc.]] (founded by [[Robert Forward]] and [[Robert P. Hoyt]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9574513 Space Tethers: Slinging Objects in Orbit?] By Nell Boyce — United States National Public Radio — 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has called this approach "Tether Launch Assist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/LaunchAssist.html Tethers Unlimited Inc, "Tether Launch Assist"]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been referred to as a '''space bolas'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry Pratchett|author2=Ian Stewart|author3=Jack Cohen|authorlink1=Terry Pratchett|authorlink2=Ian Stewart (mathematician)|authorlink3=Jack Cohen (scientist)|title=The Science Of Discworld|date=1999|publisher=Random House|isbn=1448176670|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space elevator ===
{{Main article|Space elevator}}
[[File:Mature non-rotating Skyhook.png|thumb|right|upright|Non-rotating Sky-hook first proposed by E. Sarmont in 1990]]

A [[space elevator]] is a space tether that is attached to a planetary body. For example, on [[Earth]], a space elevator would go from the equator to well above geosynchronous orbit.

A space elevator does not need to be powered as a rotovator does, because it gets any required [[angular momentum]] from the planetary body. The disadvantage is that it is much longer, and for many planets a space elevator cannot be constructed from known materials. A space elevator on Earth would require material strengths outside current technological limits (2014).&lt;ref name="io9.why"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dvorsky |first=G. |title=Why we'll probably never build a space elevator |work=io9.com |date=13 February 2013 |url=http://io9.com/5984371/why-well-probably-never-build-a-space-elevator }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop.15185070"&gt;{{cite web |last=Feltman |first=R. |title=Why Don't We Have Space Elevators? |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=7 March 2013 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/nasa/why-dont-we-have-space-elevators-15185070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff.3353697"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jillian |last=Scharr |title=Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=29 May 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[planet Mars|Martian]] and [[lunar space elevator]]s could be built with modern-day materials however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/chapter7.html Space Elevator - Chapter 7: Destinations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025102330/http://isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/chapter7.html |date=2007-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A space elevator on Phobos has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030065879_2003074809.pdf Space Colonization Using Space-Elevators from Phobos, Leonard M. Weinstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space elevators also have larger amounts of potential energy than a rotovator, and if heavy parts (like a "dropped wrench") should fall they would reenter at a steep angle and impact the surface at near orbital speeds. On most anticipated designs, if the cable component itself fell, it would burn up before hitting the ground.

===Cislunar transportation system===
[[Image:Cislunar potential.png|thumb|right|Potential energy in the Earth–Moon system. Because the Moon has higher potential energy, tethers can work together to pick an object off the Moon (the tiny dimple on the right), and place it closer to the Earth in LEO, taking essentially no propellant and even generating energy while doing so.]]

Although it might be thought that this requires constant energy input, it can in fact be shown to be energetically favorable to lift cargo off the surface of the [[Moon]] and drop it into a lower Earth orbit, and thus it can be achieved without any significant use of propellant, since the Moon's surface is in a comparatively higher potential energy state. Also, this system could be built with a total mass of less than 28 times the mass of the payloads.&lt;ref name=lunarforward&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar%2792.pdf "Tether Transport from LEO to the Lunar Surface", R. L. Forward, AIAA paper 91-2322, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LDC00Cislunar.pdf THE CISLUNAR TETHER TRANSPORT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, Robert P. Hoyt, Tethers Unlimited, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotovators can thus be charged by [[momentum]] exchange. Momentum charging uses the rotovator to move mass from a place that is "higher" in a [[gravity field]] to a place that is "lower". The technique to do this uses the [[Oberth effect]], where releasing the payload when the tether is moving with higher linear speed, lower in a gravitational potential gives more [[specific energy]], and ultimately more speed than the energy lost picking up the payload at a higher gravitational potential, even if the rotation rate is the same. For example, it is possible to use a system of two or three rotovators to implement trade between the [[Moon]] and [[Earth]]. The rotovators are charged by lunar mass (dirt, if exports are not available) dumped on or near the Earth, and can use the momentum so gained to boost Earth goods to the Moon. The momentum and energy exchange can be balanced with equal flows in either direction, or can increase over time.

Similar systems of rotovators could theoretically open up inexpensive transportation throughout the [[solar system]].

=== Tether cable catapult system ===

A tether cable catapult system is a system where two or more long conducting tethers are held rigidly in a straight line, attached to a heavy mass. Power is applied to the tethers and is picked up by a vehicle that has linear magnet motors on it, which it uses to push itself along the length of the cable. Near the end of the cable the vehicle releases a payload and slows and stops itself and the payload carries on at very high velocity. The calculated maximum speed for this system is extremely high, more than 30 times the speed of sound in the cable; and velocities of more than 30&amp;nbsp;km/s seem to be possible.&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6290186&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mortise gauge''' is a woodworking tool used by a carpenter or joiner to scribe mortise and tenon joints on wood prior to cutting.  Mortise gauges are commonly made of hardwood&lt;ref name=step&gt;{{cite book|title=Woodwork: A Step-by-Step Photographic Guide to Successful Woodworking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAfm2RMxgL0C&amp;pg=PA38|date=19 April 2010|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-7566-7002-3|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with brass fittings.&lt;ref name=tech /&gt;

Like the simpler [[marking gauge]], a mortise gauge has a locking thumb screw slide for adjusting the distance of the scribe from the edge of the wood. It has two protruding pins, often called "spurs",&lt;ref name=tech&gt;[http://www.technologystudent.com/equip1/mortga1.htm The Mortise Gauge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. ''Technology Student''&lt;/ref&gt; which are designed to scribe parallel lines marking both sides of a [[mortise and tenon|mortise]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencedictionary.org/mortise-gauge/ What is MORTISE GAUGE? definition of MORTISE GAUGE (Science Dictionary)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. ''The Science Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pins is adjustable, attached to a sliding fence,&lt;ref name="Media1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=New Track Media|title=American Woodworker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|date=April 1998|publisher=New Track Media|pages=47–|issn=1074-9152}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that mortises of different widths can be marked.&lt;ref name=step /&gt;

Some mortise gauges are designed with one retractable spur, so that they can be used as marking gauges as well;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolsforworkingwood.com/store/know/gaugeguide.html A Short Guide to Mortise and Marking Gauges&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. ''Tools for Working Wood''&lt;/ref&gt; however, because the mortise gauge is an expensive and high precision tool, many carpenters prefer to have a separate marking gauge for general use.&lt;ref name="Media1998" /&gt;

For complex joints, some mortise gauges have a double-beam design which allows the gauge to be wrapped around a tool such as a chisel for extra accuracy.&lt;ref name="Tolpin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Tolpin|title=Measure Twice, Cut Once: Simple Steps to Measure, Scale, Draw and Make the Perfect Cut-Every Time.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8L8y1J8YcgC&amp;pg=PA86|date=2 July 2007|publisher=Popular Woodworking Books|isbn=1-55870-809-X|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum for Old Techniques''' ({{lang-nl|Museum voor de Oudere Technieken}}, '''MOT''') is located in [[Grimbergen]], [[Belgium]]. The [[museum]] has an extensive collection of hand tools, technical manuals and trade catalogues.

The MOT studies the history of techniques, more specifically natural power. The subject is limited to what is driven by muscle, water or wind power.

== History==
The MOT was founded in 1982 by Johan David, its curator. The town of Grimbergen made some historic buildings available for it. In 1999 the MOT was recognized as a museum by the [[Flemish Community]].

== Buildings==
The main building of the MOT is the Guldendal, situated in the shadow of the ruins of the Prinsenkasteel (Prince’s Castle). The administration and staff are accommodated in this building. Here, too, are the library, the educational service and the conference room.

In addition there are the Liermolen and Tommenmolen, two watermills, situated on the [[Maalbeek]]. The Liermolen is a working mill, which is used for milling demonstrations.

== Mission==
The MOT aims to encourage an understanding of the past and present of mankind, here and elsewhere, by giving a realistic picture of the origin and evolution of techniques and their impact of everyday life and the environment.

==Early life and education==
Nicole Wong, a fourth-generation [[Chinese American]], was born in the United States. Her great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant who entered the United States through [[Canada]] and harvested potatoes in [[Idaho]], worked at a laundry in [[Michigan]] and became a cook in [[Livermore, California]].&lt;ref name="berkeleyyoutube"/&gt; Her maternal grandmother was from [[Southern China]].&lt;ref name="berkeleyyoutube"/&gt; Until the 1950s, her grandparents were unable to own property in California. They helped found one of the first Chinese community banks in the country, and her grandfather became its vice president.&lt;ref name="berkeleyyoutube"/&gt; 

Wong grew up in [[Del Mar, California]] and initially wanted to be a journalist&lt;ref name="mercurynews2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/businessheadlines/ci_6162894?nclick_check=1 |title=Google deputy general counsel addresses privacy fears |publisher=''San Jose Mercury News'' |date=June 17, 2007 |first=Elise |last=Ackerman |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because her aunt was a reporter at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. She attended [[Georgetown University]] where she worked as a news editor at the campus paper and radio station. She graduated ''magna cum laude'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in American Studies and a minor in English&lt;ref name="berkeleyyoutube"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y6OM2vvo4Q |title=Graduation 2014 Keynote: Nicole Wong |publisher=YouTube |date=May 21, 2014 |author=BerkeleySchool |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990.&lt;ref name="mercurynews2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prnewswire"/&gt; She has a fellowship in poetry&lt;ref name="berkeleyyoutube"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allreadable.com/04cdEfuL |title=Graduation 2014 Keynote - Nicole wong |publisher=''Readable'' |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later received her law degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]], and a master's degree in journalism from the [[University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism]] in 1995. At Berkeley, she co-founded the Asian Law Journal and became its first editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name="mercurynews2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/29/news/two-new-law-journals-plan-to-focus-on-asian-americans.html |title=Two New Law Journals Plan To Focus on Asian Americans |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=January 29, 1993 |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Wong worked as an associate and practiced First Amendment law at Steinhart &amp; Falconer LLP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/439476/twitter-legal-director-tapped-as-white-house-tech-adviser |title=Twitter Legal Director Tapped As White House Tech Adviser |publisher=''Law 360'' |date=May 7, 2013 |first=Sindhu |last=Sundar |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Francisco]]; her clients included Bay Area newspapers and radio stations. When the Internet boom hit, she began advising [[Yahoo!]], [[Evite]], and [[PayPal]].&lt;ref name="mercurynews2007"/&gt; She was an associate at [[Perkins Coie|Perkins Coie LLP]] in 1997 and was named a partner in 2000.&lt;ref name="prnewswire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/perkins-coie-elects-nicole-wong-new-partner-73025432.html |title=Perkins Coie Elects Nicole Wong New Partner |publisher=''PRNewswire'' |date=August 25, 2000 |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/12/twitter-hires-former-google-vp-and-deputy-general-counsel-of-seven-years-nicole-wong/ |title=Twitter Hires Former Google VP and Deputy General Counsel Of Seven Years, Nicole Wong |publisher=''TechCrunch'' |date=November 12, 2014 |first=Drew |last=Olanoff |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong represented media clients including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon.com]] before joining [[Google]] as senior compliance counsel.&lt;ref name="berkeley2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Transcript_Spring_2011_v2.pdf |title=Keeping Policy on Pace with the Internet |publisher=''UC Berkeley Law Transcript'' |date=Spring 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually got promoted to Vice President and Deputy General Counsel in 2004.&lt;ref name="mercurynews2007"/&gt; Wong was responsible for [[Google]]’s product and regulatory matters.

In November 2012, Wong left Google and became the legal director of products at [[Twitter]]. In June 2013, she joined the Obama administration as deputy U.S. chief technology officer, working with U.S. Chief Technology Officer [[Todd Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/twitters-nicole-wong-joins-white-house-as-deputy-chief-technology-officer/2013/06/20/41878b3c-d911-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html |title=Twitter’s Nicole Wong joins White House as deputy chief technology officer |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |date=June 20, 2013 |first=Hayley |last=Tsukayama |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently a Senior Advisor at [[Albright Stonebridge Group]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albrightstonebridge.com/team/nicole-wong&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parcel audit''' (also referred to as '''small package auditing''' or '''small parcel auditing''') is the process of reviewing shipping invoices for invalid charges and other billing inaccuracies. Each shipment tendered to a major parcel carrier like UPS and FedEx come with service guarantees outlined within each carrier's tariff or service guide. An increasing number of businesses contract third-party companies to perform these services because they have the technology necessary to automate the otherwise time consuming process.

==Parcel invoices==
Parcel carriers like [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx]], and [[DHL Express|DHL]] often have large, long, and complicated invoices. A customer shipping a high volume of parcel boxes via one of these carriers sees invoices hundreds of pages long. The invoices show a high amount of visibility to how a package was carried and delivered. This finite data is collected by UPS and FedEx for tracking purposes and to automate the process of charging the appropriate amount to their clients.

==Invoicing process: errors and overbills==
The invoicing process is so automated that mistakes happen often. Insiders to UPS and FedEx claim that little focus is spent to prevent billing for inappropriate charges: duplicate charges, incorrect [[discounts and allowances|discount]] amounts, and phantom accessorial charges. Invoicing errors are a common phenomenon, and most large carriers provide teams and electronic forms to contest improper charges on invoices. With the proper data to dispute the charges, they are often credited in a matter of hours.&lt;ref&gt;Parcel audit invoice mistakes, https://www.controlpay.com/blog/small-parcel-audit-invoice-mistakes-you-can-expect-shipper&lt;/ref&gt;

Overbilling - or service failures - is a larger problem than invoicing errors. A service failure occurs when a package with a time-sensitive guarantee is delivered late and a refund is due to the client. Most carriers like UPS and FedEx place the responsibility on the customer to check the timeliness of the delivered package. Once the service failure is found, the carrier typically credits the amount due quickly. The terms and conditions for claiming a late package are stated and the act of claiming a refund is also time-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.controlpay.com/blog/5-effective-ways-reduce-parcel-shipping-costs 5 effective ways to reduce parcel shipping costs - ControlPay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published savings rates==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Up to 5% of a clients UPS and/or FedEx charges are due to errors or overbilled items. This results in around $2&amp;nbsp;billion of unclaimed refunds.

==How to implement audit==
Customers forward their electronic billing file or approve their carriers to send the electronic billing files directly to the auditor. Most auditors accept all forms of electronic billing files. Customers may request these files from their carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Cost Recovery, "Parcel Audit [http://tcrecovery.com/small-parcel-management/]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition in the parcel audit industry==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The parcel auditing industry, otherwise knows as small package audit, has been growing in popularity. Most auditors operate using a performance-based model.

[[file:Pascaline - top view and mechanism.jpg|thumb|Top view and overview of the entire mechanism&lt;ref&gt;''Œuvres de Pascal'' in 5 volumes, ''La Haye'', 1779&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Pascal's calculator''' (also known as the '''arithmetic machine''' or '''Pascaline''') is a [[mechanical calculator]] invented by [[Blaise Pascal]] in the early 17th century. Pascal was led to develop a calculator by the laborious arithmetical calculations required by his father's work as supervisor of taxes in [[Rouen]].&lt;ref name=WHY&gt;[[#NAT_CHAP|Magazine Nature]], (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the machine to add and subtract two numbers directly and to perform multiplication and division through repeated addition or subtraction.

Pascal's calculator was especially successful in the design of its [[#Inner mechanism|carry mechanism]], which adds 1 to 9 on one dial, and when it changes from 9 to 0, carries 1 to the next dial. His innovation made each digit independent of the state of the others, which enabled multiple carries to rapidly cascade from one digit to another regardless of the machine's capacity.  Pascal  was also the first to shrink and adapt for his purpose a [[Gears#Cage gear|lantern gear]], used in [[turret clock]]s and [[water wheels]], which could resist the strength of any operator input with very little added friction.

Pascal designed the machine in 1642,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | url = http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.TheModernEpochAndTheEmergenceOfTheModernCalculator | first = Jim | last = Falk | author-link = Jim Falk | title = Things that Count | chapter = Blaise Pascal's Pascaline | chapter-url = http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.TheModernEpochAndTheEmergenceOfTheModernCalculator#pascaline | date = November 14, 2014 | accessdate = January 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after 50 [[prototype]]s, he presented it to the public in 1645, dedicating it to [[Pierre Séguier]], then [[Lord Chancellor of France|chancellor of France]].&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique|La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal]], Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal built around twenty more machines during the next decade, many of which improved on his original design. In 1649, King [[Louis XIV of France]] gave Pascal a [[Patent#Etymology|royal privilege]] (similar to a [[patent]]), which gave him the exclusive right to design and manufacture calculating machines in France. Nine Pascal calculators presently exist;&lt;ref name=mour12&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p.&amp;nbsp;12 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; most are on display in European museums.

Many later calculators either were directly inspired by, or shaped by the same historical influences which led to, Pascal's invention. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] invented his [[Leibniz wheel]]s after 1671, after trying to add an automatic multiplication feature to the Pascaline.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Leland Locke]], p. 316 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, [[Thomas de Colmar]]  designed his [[arithmometer]], the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. It is not clear whether he ever saw Leibniz's device, but he either re-invented it or utilised Leibniz's invention of the step drum.

== History ==
[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators -Detail.jpg|thumb|Four Pascalines and a clone from Lépine on display at the CNAM museum in Paris]]

Pascal began to work on his calculator in 1642, when he was 19 years old. He had been assisting his father, who worked as a tax commissioner, and sought to produce a device which could reduce some of his workload. Pascal received a [[patent|Royal Privilege]] in 1649 that granted him exclusive rights to make and sell calculating machines in France.

By 1654 he had sold about twenty machines, but the cost and complexity of the Pascaline was a barrier to further sales and production ceased in that year. By that time Pascal had moved on to the study of [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], which gave us both the ''[[Lettres provinciales]]'' and the ''[[Pensées]]''.

The tercentenary celebration of Pascal's invention of the mechanical calculator occurred during WWII when France was occupied by Germany and therefore the main celebration was held in London, England. Speeches given during the event highlighted Pascal's practical achievements when he was already known in the field of pure mathematics, and his creative imagination, along with how ahead of their time both the machine and its inventor were.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942). [[#NAT_MEP|Magazine Nature]], (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[file:Detail of the pascaline's carry mecanism - the sautoir.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the carry mechanism and of the ''sautoir'']]
[[file:Pascaline roue d'inscription.jpg|thumb|Input wheel]]

The calculator had spoked metal wheel dials, with the digit 0 through 9 displayed around the circumference of each wheel. To input a digit, the user placed a stylus in the corresponding space between the spokes and turned the dial until a metal stop at the bottom was reached, similar to the way the [[rotary dial]] of a telephone is used. This displayed the number in the windows at the top of the calculator. Then, one simply redialed the second number to be added, causing the sum of both numbers to appear in the accumulator.

Each dial is associated with a one-digit display window located directly above it, which displays the value of the accumulator for this position. The complement of this digit, in the base of the wheel (6, 10, 12, 20), is displayed just above this digit. A horizontal bar hides either all the complement numbers when it is slid to the top, or all the direct numbers when it is slid toward the center of the machine. It thereby displays either the content of the accumulator or the complement of its value.

Since the gears of the calculator rotated in only one direction, negative numbers could not be directly summed. To subtract one number from another, the method of [[#9's complement|nine's complement]] was used. The only two differences between an addition and a subtraction are the position of the display bar (direct versus complement) and the way the first number is entered (direct versus complement).

For a 10-digit wheel (N), the fixed outside wheel is numbered from 0 to 9 (N-1). The numbers are inscribed in a decreasing manner clockwise going from the bottom left to the bottom right of the stop lever. To add a 5, one must insert a stylus between the spokes that surround the number 5 and rotate the wheel clockwise all the way to the stop lever. The number displayed on the corresponding display register will be increased by 5 and, if a carry transfer takes place, the display register to the left of it will be increased by 1.  To add 50, use the tens input wheel (second dial from the right on a decimal machine), to add 500, use the hundreds input wheel, etc...

On all the wheels of all the known machines, except for the ''machine tardive'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 29 (1988). "Toutes les machines arithmétiques inventoriées....sauf la machine tardive du C.N.A.M....ont deux rayons contigus marqués".&lt;/ref&gt; two adjacent spokes are marked; these marks differ from machine to machine. On the wheel pictured on the right, they are drilled dots, on the surveying machine they are carved; some are just scratches or marks made with a bit of varnish,&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 29 (1988). "...palmette, petits ronds, griffures, vernis".&lt;/ref&gt; some were even marked with little pieces of paper.&lt;ref&gt;''Usage de la machine'', Courrier du centre international Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, no 8, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

These marks are used to set the corresponding cylinder to its maximum number, ready to be re-zeroed.  To do so, the operator inserts the stylus in between these two spokes and turns the wheel all the way to the stopping lever.  This works because each wheel is directly linked to its corresponding display cylinder (it automatically turns by one during a carry operation). To mark the spokes during manufacturing, one can move the cylinder so that its highest number is displayed and then mark the spoke under the stopping lever and the one to the right of it.

Four of the known machines have inner wheels of complements, which were used to enter the first operand in a subtraction.  They are mounted at the center of each spoked metal wheel and turn with it.  The wheel displayed in the picture above has an inner wheel of complements but the numbers written on it are barely visible. On a decimal machine, the digits 0 through 9 are carved clockwise, with each digit positioned between two spokes so that the operator can directly inscribe its value in the window of complements by positioning his stylus in between them and turning the wheel clockwise all the way to the stop lever.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], pp. 31–33 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[#Marks on two adjacent spokes|marks on two adjacent spokes]] flank the digit 0 inscribed on this wheel.

On four of the known machines, above each wheel, a small quotient wheel is mounted on the display bar.  These quotient wheels, which are set by the operator, have numbers from 1 to 10 inscribed clockwise on their peripheries (even above a non-decimal wheel). Quotient wheels seem to have been used during a division to memorize the number of times the divisor was subtracted at each given index.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 27 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal designed a gear that could easily take the strength of the strongest operator and yet added almost zero friction to the entire mechanism]]

Pascal went through 50 prototypes before settling on his final design; we know that he started with some sort of calculating clock mechanism that used springs which apparently "works by springs and which has a very simple design", was used "many times" and remained in "operating order".  Nevertheless, "while always improving on it" he found reason to try to make the whole system more reliable and robust.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]] Wikisource: La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he adopted a component of very large clocks, shrinking and adapting for his purpose the robust gears that can be found in a turret clock mechanism called a [[lantern gear]], itself derived from a water wheel mechanism. This could easily handle the strength of an operator input.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGUIN|Jean Marguin]], p. 41 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal adapted a pawl and ratchet mechanism to his own turret wheel design; the pawl prevents the wheel from turning counterclockwise during an operator input, but it is also used to precisely position the display wheel and the carry mechanism for the next digit when it is pushed up and lands into its next position.  Because of this mechanism, each number displayed is perfectly centered in the display window and each digit is precisely positioned for the next operation.  This mechanism would be moved six times if the operator dialed a six on its associated input wheel.

=== Carry mechanism ===
[[File:PascalineSautoirColored.png|thumb|The sautoir]]

The sautoir is the centerpiece of the pascaline's carry mechanism. In his "[[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Avis nécessaire...]]", Pascal noted that a machine with 10,000 wheels would work as well as a machine with two wheels because each wheel is independent of the other. When it is time to propagate a carry, the sautoir, under the sole influence of gravity,&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 17 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; is thrown toward the next wheel without any contact between the wheels. During its free fall the sautoir behaves like an acrobat jumping from one trapeze to the next without the trapezes touching each other ("sautoir" comes from the French verb ''sauter'', which means to jump). All the wheels (including gears and sautoir) have therefore the same size and weight independently of the capacity of the machine.

Pascal used gravity to arm the sautoirs. One must turn the wheel five steps from 4 to 9 in order to fully arm a sautoir, but the carry transfer will move the next wheel only one step. Thus much extra energy is accumulated during the arming of a sautoir.

All the sautoirs are armed by either an operator input or a carry forward. To re-zero a 10,000-wheel machine, if one existed, the operator would have to set every wheel to its maximum and then add a 1 to the "unit" wheel. The carry would turn every input wheel one by one in a very rapid [[Domino effect]] fashion and all the display registers would be reset.

[[File:Sautoir-Animation.gif|thumb|The three phases of a carry transfer operation]]

The carry transmission has three phases:

#The first phase happens when the display register goes from 4 to 9.  The two carry pins (one after the other) lift the sautoir pushing on its protruding part marked (3,4,5).  At the same time the kicking {{nowrap|pawl (1)}} is pulled up, using a pin on the receiving wheel as guidance, but without effect on this wheel because of the top {{nowrap|pawl/ratchet (C)}}. During the first phase, the active wheel touches the one that will receive the carry through the sautoir, but it never moves it or modifies it and therefore the status of the receiving wheel has no impact whatsoever on the active wheel.
#The second phase starts when the display register goes from 9 to 0.  The kicking pawl passes its guiding pin and its {{nowrap|spring (z,u)}} positions it above this pin ready to push back on it.  The sautoir keeps on moving up and suddenly the second carry pin drops it.  The sautoir falls of its own weight. During the second phase, the sautoir and the two wheels are completely disconnected.
#The kicking {{nowrap|pawl (1)}} pushes the pin on the receiving wheel and starts turning it.  The upper {{nowrap|pawl/ratchet (C)}} is moved to the next space.  The operation stops when the protruding {{nowrap|part (T)}} hits the {{nowrap|buffer stop (R)}}.  The upper {{nowrap|pawl/ratchet (C)}} positions the entire receiving mechanism in its proper place. During the third phase the sautoir, which no longer touches the active wheel, adds one to the receiving wheel.

== Operation ==

The Pascaline is a direct adding machine (it has no crank), so the value of a number is added to the accumulator as it is being dialed in. By moving a display bar, the operator can see either the number stored in the calculator or the complement of its value. Subtractions are performed like additions using some properties of [[#9's complement|9's complement]] arithmetic.

=== 9's complement ===
The 9's complement of any one digit decimal number ''d'' is 9-''d''.  So the 9's complement of 4 is 5 and the 9's complement of 9 is 0.  Similarly the 11's complement of 3 is 8.

In a decimal machine with n dials the 9's complement of a number A is:
: &lt;math&gt;CP(A) = 10^n - 1-A&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore the 9's complement of (A-B) is:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
CP(A-B) &amp;= 10^n -1 - (A-B) 
\\

&amp; = 10^n -1 - A + B
\\
&amp; = CP(A) + B
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the 9's complement of the difference of two numbers is equal to the sum of the 9's complement of the minuend added to the subtrahend.  The same principle is valid and can be used with numbers composed of digits of various bases (base 6, 12, 20), like in the surveying or the accounting machines.

This can also be extended to:

: &lt;math&gt;CP(A-B-C-D) = CP(A) + B + C + D&lt;/math&gt;

This principle applied to the pascaline:
{| border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="wikitable"
|-
! valign="top" | {{tmath|CP(A)}}
| First the complement of the minuend is entered.  The operator can either use the [[#Inner wheel of complements|inner wheels of complements]] or dial the complement of the minuend directly.  The display bar is shifted to show the complement's window so that the operator sees the direct number displayed because {{tmath|CP(CP(A)) {{=}} A}}.
|-
! valign="top" | {{nobold|{{mvar|B}}}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| Then the second number is dialed in and adds its value to the accumulator.
|-
! valign="top" | {{tmath|CP(A-B)}}
| The result (A-B) is displayed in the complement window because {{tmath|CP(CP(A-B)) {{=}} A-B}}.  The last step can be repeated as long as the subtrahend is smaller than the minuend displayed in the accumulator.
|-
|}

=== Resetting the machine ===

The machine has to be re-zeroed before each new operation. To reset his machine, the operator has to set all the wheels to their maximum, using the [[#Marks on two adjacent spokes|marks on two adjacent spokes]], and then add 1 to the rightmost wheel.&lt;ref name=CR_RESET/&gt;

The method of re-zeroing that Pascal chose, which propagates a carry right through the machine, is the most demanding task for a mechanical calculator and proves, before each operation, that the machine is fully functional. This is a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet this feature was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.&lt;ref name=NO_BLOC/&gt;

|-

=== Addition ===

Additions are performed with the display bar moved closest to the edge of the machine, showing the direct value of the accumulator.

After re-zeroing the machine, numbers are dialed in one after the other.

The following table shows all the steps required to compute 12,345 + 56,789 = 69,134

{| style="width: 80%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"

|}
|-
|}

=== Subtraction ===

Subtractions are performed with the display bar moved closest to the center of the machine showing the complement value of the accumulator.

The accumulator contains {{tmath|CP( A )}} during the first step and {{tmath|CP( A-B)}} after adding B.  In displaying that data in the complement window, the operator sees {{tmath|CP( CP( A))}} which is A and then {{tmath|CP(CP( A-B ))}} which is {{tmath|(A-B)}}.  It feels like an addition since the only two differences in between an addition and a subtraction are the position of the display bar (direct versus complement) and the way the first number is entered (direct versus complement).

The following table shows all the steps required to compute 54,321-12,345=41,976

== Uses ==

Pascalines came in both [[decimal]] and non-decimal varieties, both of which can be viewed in museums today. They were designed for use by scientists, accountants and surveyors.  The simplest Pascaline had five dials; later variants had up to ten dials.

The contemporary [[French livre|French currency]] system used ''livres'', ''sols'' and ''deniers'' with 20 ''sols'' to a ''livre'' and 12 ''deniers'' to a ''sol''. Length was measured in ''[[toise]]s'', [[French units of measurement|''pieds'', ''pouces'' and ''lignes'']] with 6 ''pieds'' to a ''toise'', 12 ''pouces'' to a ''pied'' and 12 ''lignes'' to a ''pouce''.  Therefore, the pascaline needed wheels in base 6, 10, 12 and 20.  Non-decimal wheels were always located before the decimal part.

In an accounting machine (..10,10,20,12), the decimal part counted the number of ''livres'' (20 ''sols''), ''sols'' (12 ''deniers'') and ''deniers''. In a surveyor's machine (..10,10,6,12,12), the decimal part counted the number of ''toises'' (6 ''pieds''), ''pieds'' (12 ''pouces''), ''pouces'' (12 ''lignes'') and ''lignes''.
Scientific machines just had decimal wheels.

The decimal part of each machine is highlighted.

The metric system was adopted in France on {{date|1799-12-10|mdy}}, by which time Pascal's basic design had inspired other craftsmen, although with a similar lack of commercial success.

== Production ==

Most of the machines that have survived the centuries are of the accounting type.  Seven of them are in European museums, one belongs to the IBM corporation and one is in private hands.

== Competing designs ==
[[File:Rechenmaschine wilhelm schickard.png|thumb|Schickard's calculating clock]]

In 1957, Franz Hammer, a biographer of [[Johannes Kepler]], announced the discovery of two letters that [[Wilhelm Schickard]] had written to his friend Johannes Kepler in 1623 and 1624 which contain the drawings of a previously unknown working calculating clock, predating Pascal's work by twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AUGARTEN|Stan Augarten]], p. 20, (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1624 letter stated that the first machine to be built by a professional had been destroyed in a fire during its construction and that he was abandoning his project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin]], pp. 46-48 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; After careful examination it was found, in contradistinction to Franz Hammer's understanding, that Schickard's drawings had been published at least once per century starting from 1718.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/Pioneers/Schickard.html The calculating Clock of Wilhelm Schickard. Retrieved January 31, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno von Freytag Loringhoff, a mathematics professor at the [[University of Tübingen]] built the first replica of Schickard's machine but not without adding wheels and springs to finish the design.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; This detail is not described in Schickard's two surviving letters and drawings. A problem in the operation of the Schickard machine, based on the surviving notes, was found after the replicas were built.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], pp. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Schickard's machine used clock wheels which were made stronger and were therefore heavier, to prevent them from being damaged by the force of an operator input.  Each digit used a display wheel, an input wheel and an intermediate wheel.  During a carry transfer all these wheels meshed with the wheels of the digit receiving the carry.  The cumulative friction and inertia of all these wheels could "...potentially damage the machine if a carry needed to be propagated through the digits, for example like adding 1 to a number like 9,999".&lt;ref&gt;[[#SWED|Eric Swedin]], p. 11 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The great innovation in Pascal's calculator was that it was designed so that each input wheel is totally independent from all the others and carries are propagated in sequence.  Pascal chose, for his machine, a method of re-zeroing that propagates a carry right through the machine.&lt;ref name=CR_RESET&gt;[[#COURRIER|Courrier du CIBP]], N°8, p. 9, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most demanding operation to execute for a mechanical calculator and proved, before each operation, that the carry mechanism of the Pascaline was fully functional. This could be taken as a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet this feature was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.&lt;ref name=NO_BLOC&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 30 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leibniz Calculator Using The Pascaline.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Leibniz' drawing showing 365 multiplied by 124.]]

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] started to work on his own calculator after Pascal's death.  He first tried to build a machine that could multiply automatically while sitting on top of the Pascaline, assuming (wrongly) that all the dials on Pascal's calculator could be operated at the same time.  Even though this could not be done, it was the first time that a pinwheel was described and used in the drawing of a calculator.

He then devised a competing design, the [[Stepped Reckoner]] which was meant to perform additions, subtractions and multiplications automatically and division under operator control. Leibniz struggled for forty years to perfect this design and produced two machines, one in 1694 and one in 1706.&lt;ref name=LEIB&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, pp. 64–65 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the machine built in 1694 is known to exist; it was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century, having spent 250 years forgotten in an attic at the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref name=LEIB/&gt;

The German calculating-machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to attempt to put Leibniz' machine in operating condition. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 149 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; and "therefore, especially in the case of multiple carry transfers, the operator had to check the result and manually correct the possible errors".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGUIN|Jean Marguin]], p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz had not succeeded in creating a calculator that worked properly, but he had invented the [[Leibniz wheel]], the principle of a two-motion mechanical calculator.  He was also the first to have cursors to inscribe the first operand and a movable carriage for results.

There were five additional attempts at designing  "direct entry" calculating machines in the 17th century (including the designs of [[Tito Livio Burattini|Tito Burattini]], [[Samuel Morland]] and [[René Grillet de Roven|René Grillet]]).

Around 1660 Claude Perrault designed an ''abaque rhabdologique'' that is often mistaken for a mechanical calculator because it has a carry mechanism in between the numbers.  But it is actually an abacus, since it requires the operator to handle the machine differently when a carry transfer takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#PERRAULT|Claude Perrault]], p. 38 (1700).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal's calculator was the most successful mechanical calculator developed in the 17th century for the addition and subtraction of large numbers. The stepped reckoner had a problem in the carry mechanism after more than two consecutive carries, and the other devices had carry mechanisms (one tooth wheel) that were limited in their capacity to carry across multiple digits or had no carry mechanism in between the digits of the accumulator.

Calculating machines did not become commercially viable until 1851, when [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Thomas de Colmar]] released, after thirty years of development, his simplified [[arithmometer]], the first machine strong enough to be used daily in an office environment.  The Arithmometer was designed around [[Leibniz wheel]]s and initially used Pascal's [[#9's complement|9's complement]] method for subtractions.

'''Petrojack''' was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] offshore [[drilling rig]] operator. The company had two [[jackup rig]]s under order from [[Jurong Shipyard]] in [[Singapore]], while it sold its two former rigs ''Petrojack I'' and ''Petrojack III'' to [[Maersk Drilling]]. The company was founded in 2004 and was listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] the next year. The largest shareholders were [[Petrolia Drilling]] (40%), [[Awilco Offshore]] (18%) and [[Sinvest]] (18%).

== Stock Value ==
In week 47 2009, Petrojack's stock value went up from 0,90 NOK per share to a maximum of 7,12 NOK per share. On the first day of this extreme rise, at 09:49, the stock was suspended because the share price rose 64% without any statement from the company itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://e24.no/boers-og-finans/article3377090.ece&lt;/ref&gt; The stock was reopened 11 minutes later at 10:00.

== Bankruptcy ==
Petrojack reportedly went bankrupt toward the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offshore.no/international/news/article.aspx?Id=16255 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211202621/http://www.offshore.no/international/news/article.aspx?Id=16255 |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''RF module''' (radio frequency module) is a (usually) small electronic device used to transmit and/or receive radio signals between two devices. In an [[embedded system]] it is often desirable to communicate with another device [[wireless]]ly. This wireless communication may be accomplished through [[Free-space optical communication|optical communication]] or through [[radio]] frequency (RF) communication. For many applications the medium of choice is RF since it does not require line of sight. RF communications incorporate a [[transmitter]] and a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. They are of various types and ranges. Some can transmit up to 500 feet.
RF modules are widely used in electronic design owing to the difficulty of designing radio circuitry. Good electronic radio design is notoriously complex because of the sensitivity of radio circuits and the accuracy of components and layouts required to achieve operation on a specific frequency. In addition, reliable RF communication circuit requires careful monitoring of the manufacturing process to ensure that the RF performance is not adversely affected. Finally, radio circuits are usually subject to limits on radiated emissions, and require [[Conformance testing]] and certification by a [[standardization]] organization such as [[ETSI]] or the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). For these reasons, design engineers will often design a circuit for an application which requires radio communication and then "drop in" a pre-made radio module rather than attempt a [[Discrete device|discrete]] design, saving time and money on development.

RF modules are most often used in medium and low volume products for consumer applications such as garage door openers, wireless alarm or monitoring systems, [[Remote controls|industrial remote controls]], smart sensor applications, and [[Home automation|wireless home automation systems]]. They are sometimes used to replace older [[infra red]] communication designs as they have the advantage of not requiring line-of-sight operation.

Several carrier frequencies are commonly used in commercially available RF modules, including those in the [[ISM band|industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands]] such as 433.92&amp;nbsp;MHz, 915&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 2400&amp;nbsp;MHz. These frequencies are used because of national and international regulations governing the used of radio for communication.  [[Short Range Devices]] may also use frequencies available for unlicensed such as 315&amp;nbsp;MHz and 868&amp;nbsp;MHz.

RF modules may comply with a defined protocol for RF communications such as [[Zigbee]], [[Bluetooth low energy]], or [[Wi-Fi]], or they may implement a [[proprietary protocol]].

== Types of RF modules ==
The term RF module can be applied to many different types, shapes and sizes of small electronic sub assembly [[circuit board]]. It can also be applied to modules across a huge variation of functionality and capability. RF modules typically incorporate a [[printed circuit board]], transmit or receive circuit, [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], and [[serial interface]] for communication to the host processor.

Most standard, well known types are covered here:
* Transmitter module
* Receiver module
* Transceiver module
* [[System on a chip]] module

=== Transmitter modules ===
An RF transmitter module is a small [[Printed Circuit Board Assembly|PCB sub-assembly]] capable of transmitting a radio wave and [[modulating]] that wave to carry data. Transmitter modules are usually implemented alongside a [[micro controller]] which will provide data to the module which can be transmitted. RF transmitters are usually subject to [[Regulation|regulatory requirements]] which dictate the maximum allowable [[transmitter power output]], [[harmonics]], and band edge requirements.

=== Receiver modules ===
An RF receiver module receives the modulated RF signal, and [[Demodulation|demodulates]] it. There are two types of RF receiver modules: [[superheterodyne receiver]]s and [[Regenerative circuit|super-regenerative receivers]]. Super-regenerative modules are usually low cost and low power designs using a series of amplifiers to extract modulated data from a carrier wave. Super-regenerative modules are generally imprecise as their frequency of operation varies considerably with temperature and power supply voltage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Superheterodyne receivers have a performance advantage over super-regenerative; they offer increased accuracy and stability over a large [[voltage]] and temperature range. This stability comes from a fixed crystal design which in the past tended to mean a comparatively more expensive product. However, advances in receiver chip design now mean that currently there is little price difference between superheterodyne and super-regenerative receiver modules.

=== Transceiver modules ===
An RF transceiver module incorporates both a transmitter and receiver. The circuit is typically designed for [[half-duplex]] operation, although [[full-duplex]] modules are available, typically at a higher cost due to the added complexity.

=== System on a chip (SoC) module ===
An SoC module is the same as a transceiver module, but it is often made with an onboard microcontroller. The microcontroller is typically used to handle radio data packetisation or managing a protocol such as an [[Comparison of 802.15.4 radio modules|IEEE 802.15.4 compliant module]].  This type of module is typically used for designs that require additional processing for compliance with a protocol when the designer does not wish to incorporate this processing into the host microcontroller.

== Host microcontroller interface ==
RF modules typically communicate with an embedded system, such as a microcontroller or a microprocessor. The communication protocols include [[UART]], used in [[Digi International]]'s X-Bee modules, [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] used in [[Anaren]]'s AIR modules and [[Universal Serial Bus]] used in Roving Networks' modules. Although the module may use a standardized protocol for wireless communication, the commands sent over the microcontroller interface are typically not standardized as each vendor has its own proprietary communications format. The speed of the microcontroller interface depends on the speed of the underlying RF protocol used: higher speed RF protocols such as Wi-Fi require a high-speed serial interface such as USB whereas protocols with a slower data rate such as Bluetooth Low Energy may use a UART interface.

== RF signal modulation ==
There are three types of signal modulation methods commonly used in RF transmitter and receiver modules:
* [[Amplitude-shift keying|ASK]]
* [[On-off keying|OOK]]
* [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]
* [[Direct-sequence spread spectrum]]
* [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum]]
The detailed description, advantages and disadvantages are listed in the linked articles above.

== Main factors affecting RF module performance ==
As with any other RF device, the performance of an RF module will depend on a number of factors. For example, by increasing the transmitter power, a larger communication distance will be achieved. However, this will also result in a higher electrical power drain on the transmitter device, which will cause shorter operating life for battery powered devices. Also, using a higher transmit power will make the system more prone to interference with other RF devices, and may in fact possibly cause the device to become illegal depending on the jurisdiction. Correspondingly, increasing the receiver sensitivity will also increase the effective communication range, but will also potentially cause malfunction due to interference from other RF devices.

The performance of the overall system may be improved by using matched antennas at each end of the communication link, such as those described earlier.

Finally, the labeled remote distance of any particular system is normally measured in an open-air line of sight configuration without any interference, but often there will be obstacles such as walls, floors, or dense construction to absorb the radio wave signals, so the effective operational distance will in most practical instances be less than specified.

== Module Physical Connection ==
[[File:Example_of_different_physical_connections_used_on_RF_Modules.jpg|thumb|Module Physical Connection: From left to right: land grid array, through-hole, and Castellated Pads]]

A variety of methods are used to attach an RF module to a [[printed circuit board]], either with [[through-hole technology]] or [[surface-mount technology]]. Through-hole technology allows the module to be inserted or removed without soldering. Surface-mount technology allows the module to be attached to the PCB without an additional assembly step. Surface-mount connections used in RF modules include [[land grid array]] (LGA) and [[Castellated Holes]]. The LGA package allows for small module sizes as the pads are all beneath the module but connections must be X-rayed to verify connectivity. Castellated Holes enable optical inspection of the connection but will make the module footprint physically larger to accommodate the pads.

== Wireless protocols used in RF modules==
RF modules, especially SoC modules, are frequently used to communicate according to a pre-defined wireless standard, including:
* [[Zigbee]]
* [[Bluetooth low energy]]
* [[Wi-Fi]]
* [[IEEE 802.15.4]]
* [[Z-Wave]]
However, RF modules also frequently communicate using proprietary protocols, such as those used in garage door openers.

== Typical applications ==
* Vehicle monitoring
* [[Remote control]]
* [[Telemetry]]
* [[Home automation|Small-range wireless network]]
* Wireless meter reading
* Access [[control systems]]
* [[Security systems|Wireless home security systems]]
* Area paging
* Industrial data acquisition system
* Radio tags reading
* RF contactless smart cards
* [[Data terminals|Wireless data terminals]]
* Wireless fire protection systems
* Biological signal acquisition
* Hydrological and meteorological monitoring
* Robot remote control
* Wireless data transmissions

* Industrial remote control, telemetry and remote sensing
* Alarm systems and wireless transmission for various types of [[Digital signal (electronics)|low-rate digital signal]]

A '''soft box''' is a type of [[photography|photographic]] [[lighting]] device, one of a number of photographic [[soft light]] devices. All the various soft light types create even and [[photon diffusion|diffused]] light&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, David. ''How to Control and Use Photographic Lighting''. HPBooks, 1980, p. 54. {{ISBN|978-0-89586-059-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; by transmitting light through some [[light scattering|scattering]] material, or by [[diffuse reflection|reflecting]] light off a second surface to diffuse the light. The best known form of reflective source is the [[umbrella]] light, where the light from the bulb is "bounced" off the inside of a metalized umbrella to create an indirect "soft" light.

A soft box is an enclosure around a bulb comprising reflective side and back walls and a diffusing material at the front of the light.  

The sides and back of the box are lined with a bright surface - an aluminized fabric surface or an [[aluminum]] foil, to act as an efficient reflector. In some commercially available models the diffuser is removable to allow the light to be used alone as a [[floodlight]] or with an [[umbrella reflector]]. 

A soft box can be used with either [[Flash (photography)|flash]] or continuous light sources such as [[fluorescent]] lamps or "hot lights" such as quartz halogen bulbs or [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten bulbs]]. If soft box lights are used with "hot" light sources, the user must be sure the soft box is heat rated for the wattage of the light to which it is attached in order to avoid fire hazard.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2017}}

'''Sticky pad''' is a friction device used to prevent objects from sliding on a surface, by effectively increasing the friction between the object and the surface.

Sticky pads are used to fix items to otherwise smooth surface that is leaned or that moves, so that objects put on that surface could off due to insufficient friction when the surface inclines or moves.
&lt;ref name="StickypadBoatUse"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carolyn Shearlock | url=https://theboatgalley.com/sticky-pads/ | title=Sticky Pads | work= | publisher=The Boat Galley | date=Jan 2012 |isbn= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902171302/https://theboatgalley.com/sticky-pads/ | archive-date=2017-09-02 | access-date=2017-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pad has large friction coefficient both with the base surface and with the item laid on it, which prevent both the sticky pad from moving with respect to the surface, and objects laid on the pad from moving relative to the pad. Sticky pads are commonly used on car dashboards where forces caused by acceleration of the vehicle would cause objects put on dashboards slip off the otherwise smooth surface of the dashboard.

Contrary to [[fasteners]], sticky pads do not affix objects to the surface. They merely prevent objects from slipping on the surface until the threshold acceleration or inclination angle is exceeded. Sticky pads also usually don't make use of [[adhesives]]. Because of this they are easily detached form the surface, and they need gravity to serve their purpose. In particular, the force acting on the object must have a component perpendicular on the surface and directed towards it. This is different from [[Microsuction tape]] where adhesion of object is achieved by microscopic bubbles on the surface that function as small suction cups. Sticky pads are made of rubber-like materials. This help dissipate kinetic energy when the base surface vibrates, such that object on the pad keep maintaining large enough contact surface with the pad and tangential friction forces keep preventing objects from slipping relative to the pad.

==Principle of operation==
Although basic principles of sticky pads are simple, physics behind may be complex due to many specific and sometimes conflicting requirements arising from practical use. Mechanisms involved in high friction materials go beyond simple [[friction|Coulomb friction]].
&lt;ref name="FrictionRubber"&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Elena Loredana Deladi | url=https://www.utwente.nl/en/et/ms3/research-chairs/stt/research/publications/phd-theses/thesis_Deladi.pdf | title=Static Friction in Rubber-metal Contacts with Application to Rubber Pad Forming Process | work= | publisher=University of Twente | date=2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905101758/https://www.utwente.nl/en/et/ms3/research-chairs/stt/research/publications/phd-theses/thesis_Deladi.pdf |access-date=2017-09-05 |archive-date=2017-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These can be combined by other mechanisms such as energy dissipation in viscous materials or adhesion.

The above requirements impose many design challenges. To operate well on vibrating surfaces, pads are usually made of soft, rubber like materials with very high friction coefficients. Designs seek to achieve certain level of adhesion (e.g. for use on vertical or very steep surfaces) without compromising easy detachment and continuous use without residual left-over. Some applications (such as sticking smartphones or tablets to vertical surface) require high degree of reliability, which is difficult to achieve without strong sticking to the surfaces.

Various innovative approaches and engineered materials are used to keep in line with requirements. Some designs apply sticking based on vacuum in addition to high friction and softness (see e.g. [[Microsuction tape|micro-suction tapes]]).

Mechanisms of insects that can scale walls and ceilings help understand how to produce surfaces with extremely high friction that don't exhibit too much sticking for practical applications.&lt;ref name="InsectStick" /&gt; Abilities of geckos have been intensively studied to find out how sticking of vertical walls or ceilings can be joined with ability of easy and quick detachment that enables geckos quick movement.&lt;ref name="GeckoSelfCleaning" /&gt; It has been discovered that [[Van der Waals force]] rather than friction or adhesion is the most important mechanism behind gecko's abilities.&lt;ref name="GeckoSubstrateModulus" /&gt; This implies that artificial designs mimicking geckos' feet should rely on maximizing surface contact between object and the pad, which is less practical in some situations, for example when pads are used on non-flat surfaces or when objects put on the pad don't have flat surfaces. On the other hand, mechanisms in geckos' feet help design materials with reliable sticking and easy detachment at the same time.&lt;ref name="GeckoSelfCleaning" /&gt; Mechanisms used in geckos, tree frogs and some insects were also studied for self-cleaning ability,&lt;ref name="InsectStick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrogFeet" /&gt; which would enable artificial materials retain the ability to prevent sliding after continuous use in dirty environments.

'''The Pee Pocket''' is a single-use urinary device that allows a person to stand while urinating, in situations where they could not normally do so. It was developed by a team of doctors and it is marketed primarily to women, athletes, travelers, the elderly, disabled, pregnancy, parents of young girls, and post-surgery patients. It can also be used to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids between people through contact with unsanitary surfaces. In 2014, when media reported an increase of [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] cases around the world, the Pee Pocket was said to help prevent the disease{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.
'''The Pee Pocket''' has also become very popular in the LGBTQ community and is used in bathrooms world wide{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42479">In [[microelectronics]], a '''three-dimensional integrated circuit''' ('''3D IC''') is an [[integrated circuit]] manufactured by stacking [[silicon wafer]]s or dies and interconnecting them vertically using, for instance, [[through-silicon via]]s (TSVs) or [[Cu-Cu connection]]s, so that they behave as a single device to achieve performance improvements at reduced power and smaller footprint than conventional two dimensional processes. 3D IC is just one of a host of 3D integration schemes that exploit the z-direction to achieve electrical performance benefits.

3D integrated circuits can be classified by their level of interconnect hierarchy at the global (package), intermediate (bond pad) and local (transistor) level &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semi.org/cms/groups/public/documents/web_content/ctr_033139.pdf|title=SEMI.ORG|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100353/http://www.semi.org/cms/groups/public/documents/web_content/ctr_033139.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, 3D integration is a broad term that includes such technologies as 3D wafer-level packaging (3DWLP); 2.5D and 3D interposer-based integration; 3D stacked ICs (3D-SICs), monolithic 3D ICs; 3D heterogeneous integration; and 3D systems integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dincites.com/3d-incites-knowledge-portal/what-is-3d-integration/|title=What is 3D Integration? - 3D InCites|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230233541/http://www.3dincites.com/3d-incites-knowledge-portal/what-is-3d-integration/|archivedate=2014-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRE-24"/&gt;

International organizations such as the [http://home.jeita.or.jp/jisso2/english/about/index.html Jisso Technology Roadmap Committee] (JIC) and the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS) have worked to classify the various 3D integration technologies to further the establishment of standards and roadmaps of 3D integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2011itrs/2011Chapters/2011Design.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230234546/http://www.itrs.net/Links/2011itrs/2011Chapters/2011Design.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===3D ICs vs. 3D packaging===
3D Packaging refers to 3D integration schemes that rely on traditional methods of interconnect such as [[wire bonding]] and [[flip chip]] to achieve vertical stacks. 3D packaging can be disseminated further into 3D [[system in package]] (3D SiP) and 3D [[wafer level package]] (3D WLP).   Stacked memory die interconnected with wire bonds, and [[package on package]] (PoP) configurations interconnected with either wire bonds, or flip chips are 3D SiPs that have been in mainstream manufacturing for some time and have a well established infrastructure. PoP is used for vertically integrating disparate technologies such as 3D WLP uses wafer level processes such as [[redistribution layer]]s (RDL) and wafer bumping processes to form interconnects.

2.5D [[interposer]] is also a 3D WLP that interconnects die side-side on a silicon, glass or organic interposer using TSVs and RDL. In all types of 3D Packaging, chips in the package communicate using off-chip signaling, much as if they were mounted in separate packages on a normal circuit board.

3D ICs can be divided into 3D Stacked ICs (3D SIC), which refers to stacking IC chips using TSV interconnects, and monolithic 3D ICs, which use fab processes to realize 3D interconnects at the local levels of the on-chip wiring hierarchy as set forth by the ITRS, this results in direct vertical interconnects between device layers. The first examples of a monolithic approach are seen in [http://www.3dincites.com/2013/08/comparing-samsungs-3d-nand-with-traditional-3d-ics/ Samsung’s 3D VNAND devices].

[[File:3DS die stacking concept model.PNG|thumb|One master die and three slave dies]]

===3D SiCs===
The digital electronics market requires a higher density [[semiconductor memory]] chip to cater to recently released [[Central processing unit|CPU]] components, and the multiple die stacking technique has been suggested as a solution to this problem. [[JEDEC]] disclosed the upcoming DRAM technology includes the "3D SiC" die stacking plan at "Server Memory Forum", November 1–2, 2011, Santa Clara, CA. In August 2014, Samsung  started producing 64GB DRAM modules for servers based on emerging [[DDR4]] (double-data rate 4) memory using 3D TSV package technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2599700/samsung-starts-production-of-3d-ddr4-dram-modules.html|title=Samsung starts production of 3D DDR4 DRAM modules|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231012258/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2599700/samsung-starts-production-of-3d-ddr4-dram-modules.html|archivedate=2014-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer proposed standards for 3D stacked DRAM include Wide I/O, Wide I/O 2, [[Hybrid Memory Cube]], [[High Bandwidth Memory]].

===Monolithic 3D ICs===
Monolithic 3D ICs are built in layers on a single [[wafer (electronics)|semiconductor wafer]], which is then [[wafer dicing|diced]] into 3D ICs. There is only one substrate, hence no need for aligning, thinning, bonding, or [[through-silicon via]]s. Process temperature limitations are addressed by partitioning the transistor fabrication to two phases. A high temperature phase which is done before layer transfer follow by a layer transfer use [http://www.monolithic3d.com/ion-cut-the-building-block.html ion-cut], also known as layer transfer, which has been used to produce [[Silicon on insulator|Silicon on Insulator (SOI)]] wafers for the past two decades. Multiple thin (10s–100s nanometer scale) layers of virtually defect-free Silicon can be created by utilizing low temperature (&lt;400℃) bond and cleave techniques, and placed on top of active transistor circuitry. Follow by finalizing the transistors using etch and deposition processes. This monolithic 3D IC technology has been researched at [[Stanford University]] under a [[DARPA]]-sponsored grant.

CEA-Leti is also developing monolithic 3D IC approaches, called sequential 3D IC. In 2014, the French research institute introduced its CoolCube™, a low-temperature process flow that provides a true path to 3DVLSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michallet|first1=Jean-Eric|title=CoolCube™: A True 3DVLSI Alternative to Scaling|url=http://www.3dincites.com/2015/03/coolcube-a-true-3dvlsi-alternative-to-scaling/|website=www.3DInCites.com|accessdate=March 24, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122234232/http://www.3dincites.com/2015/03/coolcube-a-true-3dvlsi-alternative-to-scaling/|archivedate=January 22, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Stanford University, researchers are designing monolithic 3D ICs using carbon nanotube (CNT) structures vs. silicon using a wafer-scale low temperature CNT transfer processes that can be done at 120℃.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Trapp|first1=Francoise|title=Monolithic 3D IC Heats Up at DATE 2015|url=http://www.3dincites.com/2015/03/monolithic-3d-ic-heats-up-at-date-2015/|website=3D InCites|publisher=3D InCites|accessdate=March 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402031755/http://www.3dincites.com/2015/03/monolithic-3d-ic-heats-up-at-date-2015/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, monolithic 3D ICs are still a developing technology and are considered by most to be several years away from production.

==Manufacturing technologies for 3D SiCs==
As of 2014, a number of memory products such as [[High Bandwidth Memory]] (HBM) and the [[Hybrid Memory Cube]] have been launched that implement 3D IC stacking with TSVs. There are a number of key stacking approaches being implemented and explored. These include die-to-die, die-to-wafer, and wafer-to-wafer.

; Die-to-Die: Electronic components are built on multiple die, which are then aligned and bonded. Thinning and TSV creation may be done before or after bonding. One advantage of die-to-die is that each component die can be tested first, so that one bad die does not ruin an entire stack.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-5"/&gt; Moreover, each die in the 3D IC can be binned beforehand, so that they can be mixed and matched to optimize power consumption and performance (e.g. matching multiple dice from the low power process corner for a mobile application).
; Die-to-Wafer: Electronic components are built on two semiconductor wafers. One wafer is diced; the singulated [[die (integrated circuit)|dice]] are aligned and bonded onto die sites of the second wafer. As in the wafer-on-wafer method, thinning and TSV creation are performed either before or after bonding. Additional die may be added to the stacks before dicing.
; Wafer-to-Wafer: [[Electronic component]]s are built on two or more [[wafer (electronics)|semiconductor wafers]], which are then aligned, bonded, and [[wafer dicing|diced]] into 3D ICs. Each wafer may be thinned before or after bonding. Vertical [[electrical connection|connections]] are either built into the wafers before bonding or else created in the stack after bonding. These "[[through-silicon via]]s" (TSVs) pass through the silicon substrate(s) between active layers and/or between an active layer and an external bond pad. Wafer-to-wafer bonding can reduce yields, since if any 1 of ''N'' chips in a 3D IC are defective, the entire 3D IC will be defective. Moreover, the wafers must be the same size, but many exotic materials (e.g. III-Vs) are manufactured on much smaller wafers than CMOS logic or [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] (typically 300&amp;nbsp;mm), complicating heterogeneous integration.

==Benefits==
While traditional [[CMOS]] scaling processes improves signal propagation speed, scaling from current manufacturing and chip-design technologies is becoming more difficult and costly, in part because of power-density constraints, and in part because interconnects do not become faster while transistors do.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-6"/&gt; 3D ICs address the scaling challenge by stacking 2D dies and connecting them in the 3rd dimension. This promises to speed up communication between layered chips, compared to planar layout.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-7"/&gt; 3D ICs promise many significant benefits, including:

; Footprint: More functionality fits into a small space. This extends [[Moore's law]] and enables a new generation of tiny but powerful devices.
; Cost: Partitioning a large chip into multiple smaller dies with 3D stacking can improve the yield and reduce the fabrication cost if individual dies are tested separately.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRE-9"/&gt;
; Heterogeneous integration: Circuit layers can be built with different processes, or even on different types of wafers. This means that components can be optimized to a much greater degree than if they were built together on a single wafer. Moreover, components with incompatible manufacturing could be combined in a single 3D IC.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRE-24"/&gt;
; Shorter interconnect: The average wire length is reduced. Common figures reported by researchers are on the order of 10–15%, but this reduction mostly applies to longer interconnect, which may affect circuit delay by a greater amount. Given that 3D wires have much higher capacitance than conventional in-die wires, circuit delay may or may not improve.
; Power: Keeping a signal on-chip can reduce its [[power consumption]] by 10–100 times.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-11"/&gt; Shorter wires also reduce power consumption by producing less [[parasitic capacitance]].&lt;ref name="AutoRE-12"/&gt; Reducing the power budget leads to less heat generation, extended battery life, and lower cost of operation.
; Design: The vertical dimension adds a higher order of connectivity and offers new design possibilities.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-24"/&gt;
; Circuit security: 3D integration can achieve [[security through obscurity]]; the stacked structure complicates attempts to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] the circuitry. Sensitive circuits may also be divided among the layers in such a way as to obscure the function of each layer.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-13"/&gt; Moreover, 3D integration allows to integrate dedicated, [[system monitor]]-like features in separate layers.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-24" /&gt; The objective here is to implement some kind of hardware [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] for any commodity components/chips to be monitored at runtime, seeking to protect the whole [[electronic system]] against run-time attacks as well as malicious hardware modifications.
; [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|Bandwidth]]: 3D integration allows large numbers of vertical vias between the layers. This allows construction of wide bandwidth [[bus (computing)|buses]] between functional blocks in different layers. A typical example would be a processor+memory 3D stack, with the cache memory stacked on top of the processor. This arrangement allows a bus much wider than the typical 128 or 256 bits between the cache and processor.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-14"/&gt; Wide buses in turn alleviate the [[memory wall]] problem.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-15"/&gt;

==Challenges==
Because this technology is new it carries new challenges, including:
; Cost: While cost is a benefit when compared with scaling, it has also been identified as a challenge to the commercialization of 3D ICs in mainstream consumer applications. However, work is being done to address this. Although 3D technology is new and fairly complex, the cost of the manufacturing process is surprisingly straightforward when broken down into the activities that build up the entire process. By analyzing the combination of activities that lay at the base, cost drivers can be identified. Once the cost drivers are identified, it becomes a less complicated endeavor to determine where the majority of cost comes from and, more importantly, where cost has the potential to be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;A. Palesko, The Cost of 3D ICs, 3D InCites Knowledge Portal, January 9, 2015 {{cite web |url=http://www.3dincites.com/2015/01/cost-3d-ics-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109231028/http://www.3dincites.com/2015/01/cost-3d-ics-2/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Yield: Each extra manufacturing step adds a risk for defects. In order for 3D ICs to be commercially viable, defects could be repaired or tolerated, or defect density can be improved.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leedt09"/&gt;
; Heat: Heat building up within the stack must be dissipated. This is an inevitable issue as electrical proximity correlates with thermal proximity. Specific thermal hotspots must be more carefully managed.
; Design complexity: Taking full advantage of 3D integration requires sophisticated design techniques and new [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] tools.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-17"/&gt;
; TSV-introduced overhead: TSVs are large compared to gates and impact floorplans. At the 45&amp;nbsp;nm technology node, the area footprint of a 10μm x 10μm TSV is comparable to that of about 50 gates.&lt;ref name="kim09"/&gt; Furthermore, manufacturability demands landing pads and keep-out zones which further increase TSV area footprint. Depending on the technology choices, TSVs block some subset of layout resources.&lt;ref name=kim09 /&gt; Via-first TSVs are manufactured before metallization, thus occupy the device layer and result in placement obstacles. Via-last TSVs are manufactured after metallization and pass through the chip. Thus, they occupy both the device and metal layers, resulting in placement and routing obstacles. While the usage of TSVs is generally expected to reduce wirelength, this depends on the number of TSVs and their characteristics.&lt;ref name=kim09 /&gt; Also, the granularity of inter-die partitioning impacts wirelength. It typically decreases for moderate (blocks with 20-100 modules) and coarse (block-level partitioning) granularities, but increases for fine (gate-level partitioning) granularities.&lt;ref name=kim09 /&gt;
; Testing: To achieve high overall yield and reduce costs, separate testing of independent dies is essential.&lt;ref name=leedt09 /&gt;&lt;ref name="S. Borkar, 2011, pp. 214"/&gt; However, tight integration between adjacent active layers in 3D ICs entails a significant amount of interconnect between different sections of the same circuit module that were partitioned to different dies. Aside from the massive overhead introduced by required TSVs, sections of such a module, e.g., a multiplier, cannot be independently tested by conventional techniques. This particularly applies to timing-critical paths laid out in 3D.
; Lack of standards: There are few standards for TSV-based 3D IC design, manufacturing, and packaging, although this issue is being addressed.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRE-19"/&gt; In addition, there are many integration options being explored such as via-last, via-first, via-middle;&lt;ref name="AutoRE-20"/&gt; [[interposer]]s&lt;ref name="AutoRE-21"/&gt; or direct bonding; etc.
; Heterogeneous integration supply chain: In heterogeneously integrated systems, the delay of one part from one of the different parts suppliers delays the delivery of the whole product, and so delays the revenue for each of the 3D IC part suppliers.
; Lack of clearly defined ownership: It is unclear who should own the 3D IC integration and packaging/assembly. It could be assembly houses like [[Advanced Semiconductor Engineering|ASE]] or the product [[OEM]]s.

==Design styles==
Depending on partitioning granularity, different design styles can be distinguished. Gate-level integration faces multiple challenges and currently appears less practical than block-level integration.&lt;ref name="knechtel11"/&gt;

; Gate-level integration: This style partitions standard cells between multiple dies. It promises wirelength reduction and great flexibility. However, wirelength reduction may be undermined unless modules of certain minimal size are preserved. On the other hand, its adverse effects include the massive number of necessary TSVs for interconnects. This design style requires 3D [[Place and route|place-and-route]] tools, which are unavailable yet. Also, partitioning a design block across multiple dies implies that it cannot be fully [[Semiconductor fabrication#Device test|tested]] before die stacking. After die stacking (post-bond testing), a single failed die can render several good dies unusable, undermining yield. This style also amplifies the impact of [[Process variation (semiconductor)|process variation]], especially inter-die variation. In fact, a 3D layout may yield more poorly than the same circuit laid out in 2D, contrary to the original promise of 3D IC integration.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-22"/&gt; Furthermore, this design style requires to redesign available Intellectual Property, since existing [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP blocks]] and EDA tools do not provision for 3D integration.
; Block-level integration: This style assigns entire design blocks to separate dies. Design blocks subsume most of the [[netlist]] connectivity and are linked by a small number of global interconnects. Therefore, block-level integration promises to reduce TSV overhead. Sophisticated 3D systems combining heterogeneous dies require distinct manufacturing processes at different technology nodes for fast and low-power random logic, several memory types, analog and RF circuits, etc. Block-level integration, which allows separate and optimized manufacturing processes, thus appears crucial for 3D integration. Furthermore, this style might facilitate the transition from current 2D design towards 3D IC design. Basically, 3D-aware tools are only needed for partitioning and thermal analysis.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-23"/&gt; Separate dies will be designed using (adapted) 2D tools and 2D blocks. This is motivated by the broad availability of reliable IP blocks. It is more convenient to use available 2D IP blocks and to place the mandatory TSVs in the unoccupied space between blocks instead of redesigning IP blocks and embedding TSVs.&lt;ref name="knechtel11"/&gt; [[design for test|Design-for-testability]] structures are a key component of IP blocks and can therefore be used to facilitate testing for 3D ICs. Also, critical paths can be mostly embedded within 2D blocks, which limits the impact of TSV and inter-die variation on manufacturing yield. Finally, modern chip design often requires [[Engineering Change Order#Chip design|last-minute engineering changes]]. Restricting the impact of such changes to single dies is essential to limit cost.

==Notable 3D chips==
In 2004 [http://www.tezzaron.com Tezzaron Semiconductor] built working 3D devices from six different designs.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-31"/&gt;  The chips were built in two layers with "via-first" tungsten TSVs for vertical interconnection.  Two wafers were stacked face-to-face and bonded with a copper process.  The top wafer was thinned and the two-wafer stack was then diced into chips.  The first chip tested was a simple memory register, but the most notable of the set was an 8051 processor/memory stack that exhibited much higher speed and lower power consumption than an analogous 2D assembly.

In 2004, [[Intel]] presented a 3D version of the [[Pentium 4]] CPU.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-1"/&gt; The chip was manufactured with two dies using face-to-face stacking, which allowed a dense via structure. Backside TSVs are used for I/O and power supply. For the 3D floorplan, designers manually arranged functional blocks in each die aiming for power reduction and performance improvement. Splitting large and high-power blocks and careful rearrangement allowed to limit thermal hotspots. The 3D design provides 15% performance improvement (due to eliminated pipeline stages) and 15% power saving (due to eliminated repeaters and reduced wiring) compared to the 2D Pentium 4.

The [[Teraflops Research Chip]] introduced in 2007 by [[Intel]] is an experimental 80-core design with stacked memory. Due to the high demand for memory bandwidth, a traditional I/O approach would consume 10 to 25&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref name="S. Borkar, 2011, pp. 214"/&gt; To improve upon that, Intel designers implemented a [[Through-silicon via|TSV]]-based memory bus. Each core is connected to one memory tile in the [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] die with a link that provides 12 GB/s bandwidth, resulting in a total bandwidth of 1 TB/s while consuming only 2.2&amp;nbsp;W.

An academic implementation of a 3D processor was presented in 2008 at the [[University of Rochester]] by Professor Eby Friedman and his students. The chip runs at a 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz and it was designed for optimized vertical processing between the stacked chips which gives the 3D processor abilities that the traditional one layered chip could not reach.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-2"/&gt; One challenge in manufacturing of the three-dimensional chip was to make all of the layers work in harmony without any obstacles that would interfere with a piece of information traveling from one layer to another.&lt;ref name="AutoRE-3"/&gt;

In ISSCC 2012, two 3D-IC-based multi-core designs using GlobalFoundries' 130&amp;nbsp;nm process and Tezzaron's FaStack technology were presented and demonstrated. 3D-MAPS,&lt;ref name="AutoRE-4"/&gt; a 64 custom core implementation with two-logic-die stack was demonstrated by researchers from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. The second prototype was from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [[University of Michigan]] called Centip3De, a near-threshold design based on ARM Cortex-M3 cores.

== History ==
Tung-Sol was founded as Tung-Sol Lamp Works Inc. in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]] in 1907. Their early products were mainly geared towards the automotive market and included [[headlamp]]s, [[pilot light]]s, and [[flashlight]] bulbs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The trade name was formed from the first syllable of "tungsten" and the Latin word "sol" meaning sun.

The company entered the electronics field in the 1920s. In time they established themselves as leaders in the development and production of vacuum tubes, with their main competition including [[RCA]] and [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]]. By 1951, they began doing business as Tung-Sol Electric Inc. Soon after, they were acquired by [[Wagner Electric]], which itself merged into [[Studebaker-Worthington]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tung-Sol was also active in the semiconductor industry, with its transistors being easily recognizable by their sky blue color.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tung-Sol was privately held and run like a laboratory. This gave Tung-Sol vacuum tubes a reputation of having some of the best [[metallurgy]] and [[chemistry]] that has ever been pulled off in actual production.&lt;ref name="tung sol2" /&gt; The Tung-Sol brand name is now owned by the New Sensor Corporation, the same company that owns the brands [[Sovtek]] and [[Electro-Harmonix]].&lt;ref name="new sensor"&gt;[http://www.newsensor.com/ The New Sensor Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
[[File:Tung Sol 6550.jpg|thumb|Tung-Sol 6550]]
[[File:Tungsol 5881 vacuum tube.jpg|thumb|Current production Russian Tung-Sol 5881 Vacuum Tube]]Tung-Sol developed the first successful car [[headlight]] in 1907, followed in 1913 by a single bulb two filament high and low beam headlight. Other Tung-Sol inventions included the flashing [[turn signal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   Tung-Sol created the [[6550]] [[vacuum tube]], a specialized [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]] audio tube in 1955.

=== 6550 ===
The '''6550''' is a high power [[beam tetrode]] vacuum tube used mainly as an [[audio power amplifier]].

The 6550 was developed by Tung-Sol in 1955&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; originally for use as a [[Servomechanism|servo amplifier]]. It was used in audio equipment before [[semiconductor]] power amplifiers came into use, and continues in production today. It is often found in [[Valve amplifier|valve-driven]] [[Bass instrument amplification|bass amplifiers]] such as [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] and [[Ampeg]], [[guitar amplifier]]s and the [[Leslie speaker|Leslie speaker system]].

Based on the [[6L6]] vacuum tube, the 6550 was designed to have higher output power and better stability. It operates with a [[HT (vacuum tube)|plate voltage]] of 600VDC, a screen voltage of 400VDC, and plate dissipation of 35 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = KT88  and 6550  Directory|url = http://www.jacmusic.com/KT88/kt88.htm|website = www.jacmusic.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KT88]], [[KT90]], and 6550, although not identical, are often interchangeable, dependent on external circuit parameters. The 6550's glass envelope was originally wider in the middle than at the top and bottom, but a straight-sided design was later introduced by [[General Electric|GE]] and [[Philips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 6550 Tube Types - www.boiaudioworks.com|url = http://www.boiaudioworks.com/6550|website = www.boiaudioworks.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2006-01-01_Closer_view_of_the_Baker_5W_US_Climate_Reference_Network_station.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A USCRN station]]
The US Climate Reference Network (USCRN) is a network of climate stations developed and maintained by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/us-climate-reference-network-uscrn completed in 2008.]. It has the long-term commitment{{elucidate|date=October 2013}} of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] and the NOAA.{{verify source|date= October 2013}}

== Project ==
=== Overview ===
The USCRN is made up of over 143 stations in the [[United States]].{{better source|date= October 2013}} Its purpose is to maintain a sustainable high quality network which will detect, with high confidence, signals of climate change in the US.&lt;ref name="ATDD"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = U.S. Surface Climate Observing Reference Networks | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/# | publisher = NOAA | date =  | accessdate = 12 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the United States with a reference network that meets the requirements of the [[Global Climate Observing System]].{{nonspecific|date=October 2013}}

The primary goal of the USCRN is to provide future long-term high-quality observations of surface air temperature and precipitation that can be coupled to past long-term observations for the detection and attribution of present and future climate change. It records data with minimal time dependent biases affecting the interpretation of decadal to centennial climate variability and change.{{technical inline|date= October 2013}}

[[File:US_Climate_Reference_Network_Map.jpg|thumb|right|Locations of CRN stations]]

=== Background ===
This program is used to collect and analyze the high-quality data on climate change. The hope is that research based on this data is thrusted to impact near and long term policy and decision plans made by senior government and business leaders.

It is being implemented and managed by the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC)
located in [[Asheville, NC]]. Scientists and engineers from the Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division located in [[Oak Ridge, TN]], are assisting the NCDC USCRN program staff. System design, test, implementation, and associated expenses are being provided by the [[National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service]]'s Office of Systems Development.{{verify source|date= October 2013}}

=== Stations ===
Each station is positioned in a pristine site which is expected to remain free from development over coming decades. Each station may include the following sensors: triple redundant air temperature sensors{{technical inline|date= October 2013}}, precipitation sensors, wind speed sensors, and ground temperature sensors.&lt;ref name="ATDD" /&gt;  Stations have been placed in rural environments in order to avoid possible urban micro climate interference. In 2008, the NOAA announced that it expected to have the 114 contiguous US sites online that summer.&lt;ref name="NEWS_FROM_NOAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2008/20080424_climatechange.html|title=NOAA Employing New Tools to Accurately Measure Climate Change|accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--do we need this at all? maybe for verifying above?--&gt;

==== Components ====
Essential components of the USCRN are well-documented life cycle maintenance, modernization, and performance histories, as well as a robust science and research component. There are routine maintenance visits to the sites and regular calibration of the sensors. Research effort has focused on continual evaluation of the data, new sensors, and emerging calibration techniques. When a new type of sensor can contribute to improving the quality of the observations, there will be at least a one-year continuity overlap of current and new sensors.

Every USCRN instrument site is being equipped with the following:
* a standard set of sensors
* a [[data logger]]
* a satellite communications transmitter attached to a typical 10 foot (3&amp;nbsp;meter) instrument tower
* at least one weighing [[rain gauge]], encircled by a wind shield

Data from these USCRN sites are used to provide information on long-term changes in air temperature and precipitation, including means and extremes.{{technical inline|date= October 2013}} Additional sensors may be added in the future, such as soil moisture and soil temperature.{{update-inline|date=October 2013}} USCRN data is intended to be used in operational climate monitoring activities and for placing current climate anomalies into a historical perspective. Data is transmitted hourly via the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]]{{verify source|date=October 2013}} [[Morcom International, Inc.|Data Collection System]]{{spam link|date=October 2013}} and is immediately distributed by the [[National Weather Service]] to their operational sites.{{update-inline|date=October 2013}} Observations are accessible through the Internet.{{where|date=October 2013}}

=== The future of the project ===
The USCRN hopes to provide the nation with a long-term (50 to 100 years) observation network that will serve as the Nation's Benchmark Climate Reference Network. When fully implemented, the network will consist of several hundred instrument suites strategically selected to capture climate trends, variations, and change across the nation.{{update-inline|date=October 2013}}

The '''United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory''' (NCML) was a highly secret design and manufacturing site for [[code-breaking]] machinery located in Building 26 of the [[National Cash Register]] (NCR) company in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and operated by the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. It is now on the [[List of IEEE Milestones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:US_Naval_Computing_Machine_Laboratory,_1942-1945 |title=Milestones:US Naval Computing Machine Laboratory, 1942-1945 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of its machines is on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]].

The laboratory was established in 1942 by the Navy and [[National Cash Register Company]] to design and manufacture a series of code-breaking machines ("[[bombe]]s") targeting German [[Enigma machine]]s, based on earlier work by the British at [[Bletchley Park]] (which in turn owed something to pre-war Polish cryptanalytical work). [[Joseph Desch]] led the effort.{{sfn|DeBrosse|Burke|2004}} Preliminary designs, approved in September 1942, called for a fully electronic machine to be delivered by year's end. However, these plans were soon judged infeasible, and revised plans were approved in January 1943 for an electromechanical machine, which became the [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]].

These designs were proceeding in parallel with, and influenced by, British attempts to build a high-speed bombe for the German 4-rotor Enigma. Indeed, [[Alan Turing]] visited Dayton in December 1942. His reaction was far from enthusiastic:

:It seems a pity for them to go out of their way to build a machine to do all this stopping if it is not necessary. I am now converted to the extent of thinking that starting from scratch on the design of a Bombe, this method is about as good as our own. The American Bombe program was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this program. Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or [[banburismus]] unless they are really going to do something about it.&lt;ref&gt;Quote from &lt;www.daytoncodebreakers.org/depth/bombe_history&gt; (March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The American approach was, however, successful. The first two experimental bombes went into operation in May 1943, running in Dayton so they could be observed by their engineers. Designs for production models were completed in April, 1943, with initial operation starting in early June.

All told, the laboratory constructed 121 bombes which were then employed for code-breaking in the  US Navy's signals intelligence and cryptanalysis group [[OP-20-G]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilcox| first=Jennifer E|year=2001|title=About the Enigma|publisher=National Security Agency|url= http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00021.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2008|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was accomplished in three shifts per day by some 600 [[WAVES]] (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), 100 Navy officers and enlisted men, and a large civilian workforce. Approximately 3,000 workers operated the bombes to produce "[[Ultra]]" decryptions of German Enigma traffic.

According to a contemporary US Navy report (dated April 1944), the bombes were used on naval jobs until all daily keys had been run; then the machines were used for non-naval tasks. During the previous six months, about 45% of the bombe time had been devoted to non-naval problems carried out at the request of the British. British production and reliability problems with their own high-speed bombes had then recently led to construction of 50 additional Navy units for Army and Air Force keys.

==Building==
The building in Dayton, called [[Building 26 (Dayton)]] was an Art Deco design of Dayton firm [[Schenck &amp; Williams]] and was located at Patterson Blvd and Stewart Street.  The building was demolished by the University of Dayton in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/videos/news/demolition-of-building-26/vcL8J/|title=Demolition of Building 26|accessdate=Feb 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">'''Wet oxidation''' is a form of hydrothermal treatment.  It is the [[oxidation]] of dissolved or suspended components in [[water]] using [[oxygen]] as the [[oxidizer]].  It is referred to as "Wet Air Oxidation" (WAO) when [[air]] is used.  The oxidation reactions occur in [[superheated water]] at a temperature above the normal boiling point of water (100&amp;nbsp;°C), but below the critical point (374&amp;nbsp;°C).

The system must be maintained under pressure to avoid excessive evaporation of water.  This is done to control energy consumption due to the [[latent heat of vaporization]].  It is also done because liquid water is necessary for most of the oxidation reactions to occur.  Compounds oxidize under wet oxidation conditions that would not oxidize under dry conditions at the same temperature and pressure.

Wet oxidation has been used commercially for around 60 years.  It is used predominantly for treating wastewater.  It is often referred to as '''Zimpro'''  (from ZIMmerman PROcess), after Fred T. Zimmermann who commercialized it in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.siemens.com/en/about_us/legacy_brands/Pages/zimpro.aspx|title=Zimpro History|accessdate=February 2010|df=}}| archiveurl= | archivedate=2013-03-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Description==
Commercial systems typically use a [[bubble column reactor]], where air is bubbled through a vertical column that is liquid full of the hot and pressurized wastewater.  Fresh wastewater enters the bottom of the column and oxidized wastewater exits the top.  The heat released during the oxidation is used to maintain the operating temperature.

WAO is a liquid phase reaction using dissolved oxygen in water to oxidize wastewater contaminants.  The dissolved oxygen is typically supplied using pressurized air, but pure oxygen can also be used.  The oxidation reaction generally occurs at moderate temperatures of 150°-320&amp;nbsp;°C and at pressures from 10 to 220 barg.  The process converts organic contaminants to carbon dioxide, water, and biodegradable short chain organic acids.  Inorganic constituents such as sulfides and cyanides are converted to non-reactive inorganic compounds.

In the WAO reaction, complex organic molecules, including biological refractory compounds, are broken into simpler organic compounds or to a complete mineralized state (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; Simple organic compounds such as low molecular weight carboxylic acids and mineralized reaction products may be present in the WAO effluents.  Because of this, the WAO effluent generally requires post treatment prior to discharge. WAO effluents are typically readily biodegradable and exhibit high values for [[Biological oxygen demand|BOD]]:[[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] ratios.  Standard treatment techniques such as activated sludge biotreatment are typically used with WAO for complete treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Lehmann, D. Wet Air Oxidation of Difficult to Treat Pharmaceutical Waste Streams. ''Water Practice'' '''2007,''' ''2''''',''' 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catalysis|Catalyst]] can be used in the WAO system to enhance treatment and achieve a higher COD destruction.  Heterogeneous and homogenous catalysts have been used.  Heterogeneous catalysts are based on precious metals deposited on a stable substrate.  Homogenous catalysts are dissolved transition metals.  Several processes, such as Ciba-Geigy, LOPROX, and ATHOS utilize a homogenous catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Levec,J.; Albin,P. Catalytic wet-air oxidation processes: A review. ''Catalysis Today''. '''2007''', ''124'', 172-184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Luck, F. Wet air oxidation: past, present and future. ''Catalysis Today'' '''1999''', ''53'', 81-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed metal catalysts, such a Ce/Mn, Co/Ce, Ag/Ce,  have also been effective in improving the treatment achieved in a WAO system.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, A.; Marques, R.; Quinta-Ferreira, R. Catalyst based in cerium oxide for wet oxidation of acrylic acid in the prevention of environmental risks. ''Applied Catalysis'' '''2004''', ''47'', 269-279.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special type of wet oxidation process was the so-called "VerTech process" system. A system of this type operated in [[Apeldoorn]], [[Netherlands]] between 1994 and 2004. The system was installed in a below-ground pressure vessel (also called a gravity [[pressure vessel]] or GPV). The pressure was supplied by feeding the material to a reactor with a depth of {{convert|1200|m|ft}}. The deep shaft reactor also served as a heat exchanger, so no pre-heating was required. The operating temperature was about 270&amp;nbsp;°C with a pressure of about {{convert|100|bar|psi}}. The installation was eventually shut down due to operational problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava, S.K.; Tardio, J.; Prasad, J.; Folger, K.; Akolekar, D.B.; Grocott, S.C.

== Commercial Applications ==

=== Spent Caustic Treatment ===
The majority of commercial wet oxidation systems are used to treat industrial wastewater, such as [[sulfide]] laden [[spent caustic]] streams from ethylene and LPG production as well as naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics from refinery applications.

Typical classification of WAO treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Clark, M. “Wet Air Oxidation of Spent Caustic in Petroleum Refineries”, International Water Conference (IWC), San Antonio, TX, November 4–8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Low temperature WAO systems oxidize sulfides to thiosulfate and sulfate but high concentrations of thiosulfate are present in the treated effluent.  The mid temperature systems fully oxidize sulfides to sulfate and mercaptans are oxidized to sulfonic acids.  For sulfidic spent caustics, this results in a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) destruction (&gt;90%).  High temperature systems are used to oxidize organic compounds that are present in naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics.

=== Sewage Sludge Treatment ===
Almost as many systems are also used for treating [[biosolids]], in order to [[pasteurize]] and to decrease volume of material for disposal.  The thermal conditioning occurs at temperatures of 210 – 240&amp;nbsp;°C.  A 4% dry solid slurry can be processed in a WAO system where it is disinfected and the treated effluent can be dewatered to 55% dry solids using a filter press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other Applications ===
Wet air oxidation has also been used to treat a variety of other industrial process waters and wastewaters which include:
