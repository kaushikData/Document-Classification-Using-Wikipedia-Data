      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="919">The '''Abuja Declarations and Frameworks for Action on Roll Back Malaria''' was a pledge made in 2001 by members of the [[African Union]] during a conference in [[Abuja, Nigeria]]. In it, the member nations pledged to increase their health budget to at least 15% of the state´s annual budget, and requested Western donor countries to increase their support. Tracking the progress of the efforts, the [[World Health Organization]] reported in 2010 that only one African country had reached that target, while 26 had increased health expenditures and 11 had reduced it. Nine others had not had a noticeable negative or positive trend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/healthsystems/publications/abuja_declaration/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics''' ('''ACT''') is an organization supporting [[medical marijuana]] that was founded in 1981 by [[Robert C. Randall]] and Alice O'Leary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/08/us/robert-randall-53-sued-for-marijuana.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rssnyt |title=Robert Randall, 53; Sued for Marijuana |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-06-08 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randall was the first person known to have successfully used medical necessity as a defense against a charge of marijuana possession in violation of the Controlled Substances Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/necesssumm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Clare Hodges aka Elizabeth Brice]] founded the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) in the UK after contacting the Alice O'Leary and Robert Randall in 1992 about the medical benefits of marijuana for individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis.    

The group participated in the 1986 hearings on [[cannabis rescheduling in the United States]]. ACT along with NORML petitioned for review of the final order of the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration which followed the hearings. See Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C.Cir.1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/930/936/151647/ |title=930 F.2d 936: Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, Petitioner, v.

The '''Berkeley Student Food Collective''' (BSFC) is a collectively operated non-profit grocery market founded by students of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] near the Berkeley campus.  The market aims to expand student access to as many [[Organic food|organic]], locally sourced, [[fair trade]] and whole foods as possible. It also aims to educate the community about the food system and its environmental, social and political impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levi Holtz|first=Debra|title=Berkeley co-op aims to educate about food choices|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/30/BAFE1HDOPN.DTL|accessdate=7 Jun 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=31 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened its doors in 2010, after having won a $91,000 grant from UC Berkeley's [[The Green Initiative Fund]] (TGIF).  The collective serves a selection of produce, refrigerated and packaged goods, as well as a weekly subscription-style produce box that contains local, seasonal produce. The storefront is located across the street from the university, on Bancroft Way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2010/11/15/food/]--~~~~--~~~~

==History==
In 2009, the national fast food chain [[Panda Express]] attempted to open a restaurant on Lower [[Sproul Plaza]] on the UC Berkeley campus, an area run by the [[ASUC]] student government. Students were angered that a business they considered to be unhealthy, unsustainable and unrepresentative of their community was coming to their space and began a campaign to prevent its opening. A petition against Panda Express gathered 1,300 signatures, and students held demonstrations at ASUC Store Operations Board planning meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yollin|first=Patricia|title=Berkeley students decry proposed Panda Express|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/06/BA2L16AQRS.DTL|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement inspired students to create their own business that represented their interests and provided better food options for the campus community. The Berkeley Student Food Collective began as a student group and worked towards opening a grocery storefront, which opened on November 15, 2010. The cooperative was the inspiration for the [[Cooperative Food Empowerment Directive]] (CoFED), an organization helping students form sustainable food businesses on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Landau|first=Yonatan|title=Student Food Co-op Revolution on Campus|url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2010/12/30|newspaper=Common Dreams|date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mazar|first=Anne|title=College students act to bring 'real food' to their campuses|url=http://www.sj-r.com/mysource/food/x392612915/Anne-Mazar-College-students-act-to-bring-real-food-to-their-campuses|newspaper=The State Journal-Register|date=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food and products==
The student food collective has a physical store on Bancroft Way, near the [[UC Berkeley]] campus. The store offers a variety of food and other items that are healthy and/or sustainable options. They have fresh produce every day including vegetables like chard, broccoli, kale, lettuce, carrots, and parsley and fruits like apples, oranges, grapefruit, tomatoes, lemons, tangerines, and pumpkins. The student workers prepare fresh foods including smoothies, vegan sandwiches, pastas, and salads. The collective also offers prepackaged lunch items like tofu burgers, wraps, and bento boxes. There are a wide variety of snacks like granolas, nuts, dried fruits, coffee beans, chocolate covered raisins, yogurt covered pretzels, and chia chunks. They also offer drinks like [[coffee]], kombucha, and tea as well as pastries. In addition to all the food items, the collective also sells soap, shampoo, lip balm, cleaning products, reusable bags, and water bottles. The physical store is open from Monday to Sunday, with shorter operating hours on Saturday and Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/store |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117222426/http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/store |archivedate=2014-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective also offers bulk ordering of items normally offered in-store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/bulkorders |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095834/http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/bulkorders |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have a weekly produce box simply named "The Box", which includes $15 worth of local, organic produce, and corresponding recipes. People can pick up their order on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/box |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123259/http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/box |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==

The BSFC is run cooperatively, which means that each member has a say in the store's operations. Anyone, not just students, can become a member or shop at the store. Membership is obtained by volunteering in the store or on a committee for two hours a week. In return, members receive a 10% discount on store purchases. Members should attend membership meetings that occur once every two weeks. This is where members get to meet people outside of their committees, share their ideas, and debate and vote on issues that can't be resolved in committees because they require the input of the entire collective. They can also join a committee to meet people with a similar interests and implement BSFC related projects. There are seven BSFC committees dedicated to education, outreach, policy, food preparation, membership, fundraising, and the storefront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committees|url=http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/about/committees|publisher=Berkeley Student Food Collective|accessdate=8 Jun 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113604/http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/about/committees|archivedate=2012-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives members a chance to work on logistical side of running a cooperative educational grocery store.  Being a member also means they can run and vote for board member positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Admin.|title=Berkeley Student Food Collective aims to improve the quality of food available to students|url=http://www.foodfirst.org/en/node/3300|accessdate=7 Jun 2012|newspaper=Food First|date=11 Feb 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105132236/http://www.foodfirst.org/en/node/3300|archivedate=2013-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are fifteen coordinator titles on the board of directors, consisting of publicity, education, membership, fundraising, outreach, food events, product, produce, policy, storefront, communications, information technology, food preparation, events, and finance. Elections occur every semester and the current director may opt to run again One or two people may serve under one title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board|url=http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/about/board|publisher=Berkeley Student Food Collective|accessdate=8 Jun 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618212258/http://berkeleystudentfoodcollective.org/about/board|archivedate=2012-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Britain's Missing Top Model''''' was a British [[Reality TV]] modelling show for disabled women, aired on [[BBC Three]]. The premiere episode aired on 1 July 2008. The show courted [[controversy]], with many arguing that the show made [[disability]] a [[freak show|spectator event]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The show followed eight young women with disabilities, who competed for a modelling [[contract]] (which included a photo shoot with [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]] and a cover photo in ''[[Marie Claire]]''). One of the contestants, Sophie Morgan, had already appeared on another [[reality TV]] show, ''[[Beyond Boundaries]]'', in 2005. The series aired over a period of five weeks. The women lived together and competed in a series of challenges and photo shoots. Each week, at least one contestant was sent home.

The winner of the competition was 23-year-old [[Kelly Knox]].

===Episode 1===
''Original Airdate: 1 July 2008''

The eight women met up in the penthouse where they would be living. Jonathan Phang met them and gave them their first outfits: a white vest, shorts and trainers, simple hair and make-up, to show their shape. They met up with the judges and they were asked questions. They were told their first task was called "Objects of desire" – an haute couture shoot, which involved being sat on a chaise lounge with an object that represented how they feel about their disabilities. They went to a market to search for their objects.

*'''Debbie:''' Hand mirror – after her accident, she couldn't bear to look in mirrors, but now she is happy to look
*'''Jenny:''' Crucifix pendant – her faith in God helped her to recover from her accident, re-learning to speak and other activities
*'''Jessica:''' Make-up box – unsaid
*'''Kellie:''' Hand mirror – unsaid, but from the series, Kellie said she was teased as a child by other schoolchildren, being called ugly, making her not like her appearance. She has been Miss Deaf UK and competed for the Miss Deaf World title, meaning she now sees herself as beautiful and likes her appearance
*'''Kelly:''' Riding crop – unsaid, but from the series, Kelly said she was taught to be tough and not let anyone put her down, so she aptly chose a riding crop
*'''Lilli:''' Jewelled bracelet – unsaid
*'''Rebecca:''' Perfume bottle – unsaid
*'''Sophie:''' Cracked hand mirror (using a hammer to crack the mirror) – she was looking at the cracked rear-view mirror the moment she crashed and became a paraplegic

After the photoshoot, the girls lined up on Trafalgar Square and their photos were shown on a big screen for everyone to see. Sophie commented that this was why her accident happened; so she can do things like this.

After the photoshoot, the women returned home to find a buffet had been laid out for them. Jessica was questioned why she didn't drink. She replied that she wanted to always have control of her body. She then got emotional that her disability will ultimately kill her. The other women were sympathetic yet also apathetic about their own views on their own disabilities; Kelly said "I don't give a fucking shit!" about her missing forearm. Sophie didn't want to dwell on disability and wanted to enjoy the evening.

When the judges saw the pictures, they questioned Lilli about how she would cope being a model and being deaf. This angered her as they never asked personal questions regarding being deaf to Kellie, the only other deaf contestant.

*'''First Call-Out:''' Kellie Moody
*'''Bottom Two:''' Lilli Risner &amp; [[Rebecca Le'gon]]
*'''Eliminated:''' Rebecca Le'gon, for not showing the right emotion in her face
*'''Featured Photographer:''' Christopher Sims
*'''Special Guests:''' Jonathan Phang (mentor), Melissa Richardson
*'''Other details:''' During showing the Wayne Hemingway and Lara Masters regretted their decision to eliminate her, but Mark Summers was happy with the decision.

===Episode 2===
''Original Airdate: 8 July 2008''

The first task was to be a lingerie window model in a lingerie shop. The response was positive from the public. However, Sophie complained that Kellie, one of the deaf contestants, did not look disabled, that she had "big boobs, big arse, a body that's great," whereas she's a paraplegic and looks disabled. Jonathan Phang, their mentor, invited himself round to dinner, and purposefully did not bring a sign language interpreter, his reason being that Kellie and Lilli have to be able to cope without an interpreter if they were models, which upset them both.

The second task given was a casting challenge to win the opportunity to show Louis Mariette's hats at a fashion show. Each model was given one of Mariette's hats to pose in and was asked questions, like in a beauty pageant. Kellie won, which displeased Sophie as Kellie was able to pose in different positions and she couldn't pose as much, and using Kellie is not the same as using a disabled model as the only difference is language: "It's the same as picking someone who speaks French"

That night, they all went out to party, except Jessica who needs to sleep because of her ME(her disability).

The next morning, they were phoned by the casting location to be there in half an hour. This was to test their punctuality when they need to be at a casting call quickly. Debbie, Kelly, Sophie and Jenny all rushed ahead to get a taxi, leaving Jessica, Lilli and Kellie to get to the location themselves. Lilli and Kellie were annoyed that the others didn't take the time to explain what was happening, but Debbie was insistent that she was being clear. Jonathan Pang wasn't happy with their lack of cooperation. They each took it in turn to be interviewed by a casting director, and modelled an item of clothing.

A 1950s [[pin-up]] photoshoot followed, where the photos would be judged. The photoshoot was 1950s pin-up, the task that their photos would be judged by the judges. The scenarios of the models' photoshoots were as follows:

*'''Debbie:''' Lying on the floor, speaking on the phone, wearing a short white top and shorts, black stockings and white stilettos
*'''Jenny:''' Looking over her shoulder, wearing black lingerie, and fanning herself with a purple feather
*'''Jessica:''' Sitting on a puff, dressed as a sexy cowgirl
*'''Kellie:''' Standing beside a drape and cushions, dressed as a sexy maid, and holding a feather duster
*'''Kelly:''' Kneeling on a white cushion, wearing white lingerie, holding something red
*'''Lilli:''' Sitting on a stool, wearing naval-designed lingerie and a sailor's hat
*'''Sophie:''' Sitting beside a map and a box with a pilot's jacket laid on top, wearing red lingerie and a pilot hat

At the end of the day, when the women sat at the table, Kellie and Lilli brought earplugs for the others to help them understand what it's like to be deaf. They sat around and had to mouth their speech, which proved difficult for them to understand each other.

The judges announced that 2 people would be eliminated. The judges were presented with 1950s pin-up photos. When they met the judges, Lilli was upset yet again at their feedback – they told her she should tone up her belly.

*'''First Call-Out:''' Kellie Moody
*'''Bottom two:''' Lilli Risner and Debbie van der Putten
*'''Eliminated:''' Lilli Risner, for her untoned belly, and [[Debbie van der Putten]], for her uncomfortable facial expression
*'''Featured photographer:'''
*'''Special guests:''' Louis Mariette, Jonathan Pang, Michelle Paradise
*'''Extra details:''' * Lilli said she was happy to go and didn't ever want to be part of the modelling world. Debbie was more optimistic, saying there will be plenty of opportunities for her.
* [[Rebecca Le'gon]], eliminated in the first episode, returned to the 1950s pin-up photoshoot to take a photo with the rest of the contestants. Her outfit was a red silk top, cream waistcoat and a red feather in her hair, and black stockings.

===Episode 3===
''Original Airdate: 15 July 2008''

This task was a catwalk. They met with a choreographer who taught them how to walk. He paid close attention to how to help Sophie move her wheelchair in a model-like fashion. Sophie got upset as she missed walking and dancing. It proved difficult for Jenny also as her ataxia makes it difficult to walk, let alone walk in stilettos. Jessica spent part of her time there asleep due to her ME. They were also given a selection of outfits that they would model on the catwalk. They were each given a new hairstyle as well. They were also given MP3 players with the music they would walk to, which had to be put on the loudest possible volume for Kellie, who's deaf, so she could feel the vibrations. Jenny also got upset as she found the catwalk difficult due to her ataxia making her body shake; "My body won't do what I tell it to do."

At the catwalk, the judges and Jonathan Phang (mentor) were in the audience, as well as family members and friends. Jenny wore flat shoes so she could walk easier. Kellie missed her cue as the director had forgotten about her and didn't let her know when to go. Afterwards, Jenny talked to Mark Summers, one of the judges, and jokingly grinded and flirted with him.

At the judging part, this was used against her and Mark asked her if that was appropriate behaviour towards him. Jenny apologised for her behaviour, but replied that she knows she is a flirty person. Jenny also said to Jessica that she couldn't do this. Jessica was understandably upset by this, but Sophie backed Jenny's comment by saying that Jenny wasn't niggling over her shoulder, but questioning whether it was possible for her because of her conditions as she needs sleep, which was proved at the training. Jessica replied that she is getting better. When the girls left so the judges could decide, Jenny exclaimed that Jessica was "a fucking child", and "she's not getting any better, she's faking it!"

*'''First Call-Out:''' Kelly Knox
*'''Bottom Two:''' Jessica Kellgren-Hayes &amp; Jenny Johnston
*'''Eliminated:''' Jenny Johnston, for her behaviour towards Mark
*'''Featured Photographer:'''
*'''Special Guests:'''
*'''Extra details''' After Jenny had been eliminated, she said to the judges how embarrassed she was for being too sexual, but Wayne Hemingway went up to her saying "This is a shit industry" and she's better off without it. After Jenny left, Mark and Wayne argued about the decision and the words used by Mark, and Wayne threatened to leave

===Episode 4===
''Original Airdate: 22 July 2008''

This task featured male models Daniel Lake, Tommy Maxwell, Matthew McDonough and Eric Monjoin. For the first part each contestant was paired up with a male model and had to hug and touch each other to get used to the closeness for the photoshoots. The second part was a challenge set by Alenka. The challenge was for each couple to star in an advert, advertising a fake brand ice cream, Pang's Ice cream (names after Jonathan Pang, their mentor). Kellie struggled the most as she was told to speak, when she was more comfortable signing. She argued that British Sign Language is her language and Sophie was allowed her wheelchair on the catwalk task, why shouldn't she be allowed to sign? By learning that models used in adverts are sometimes dubbed, she did two adverts – she spoke in one, and signed in the other. Jessica slept through most the rehearsal due to her ME.

*'''4th place:''' Kellie and Daniel Lake, due to Kellie's unwillingness to speak
*'''3rd place:''' Kelly and Matthew McDonough, due to the long passionate kiss, which Alenka said was "too steamy for morning television," plus her Essex accent wasn't right for the advert
*'''2nd place:''' Jessica and Eric Monjoin; their acting was best, but their childish behaviour when they came in was unacceptable
*'''1st place:''' Sophie and Tommy Maxwell; Sophie choked on the ice cream on the first take, but Alenka felt their overall performance was best

The contestants and the male models returned to the penthouse where they were treated to a chocolate fountain. Jessica felt embarrassed about how Sophie and Kelly loudly pointed out she was a lesbian, which she felt was unnecessary. Kellie got upset that she wasn't following the conversation with the others and left.

At the photoshoot, the women were photographed with their partners in an old house. Sophie had to be carried by her partner up the stairs as there was no lift. The photographs are as follows:
*'''Jessica:''' laying on a bed with Matthew McDonough
*'''Kellie:''' standing in front of Daniel Lake
*'''Kelly:''' sitting on Eric Monjoin's lap
*'''Sophie:''' laying across Tommy Maxwell's lap

After the photoshoot, Phang treats them to eat at a posh restaurant. Jessica compares her disabilities to Kellie and Sophie's disabilities and lists the things she can't do, which is quickly pointed out by Sophie. Jessica explains that she needs to prove her disability to other people, to get help. Sophie doesn't like how Jessica desires to be labelled and to be recognised as disabled, which ends in Sophie telling her, "Stop feeling sorry for yourself!"

The judges commented on Kellie's picture that she looked uneasy and uncomfortable in her picture. They equally told Kelly that her appearance was cold.

*'''First Call-Out:''' Sophie Morgan
*'''Bottom Two:''' Jessica Kellgren-Hayes &amp; Kellie Moody
*'''Eliminated:''' Kellie Moody, for her poor photo
*'''Featured Photographer:''' Anna Stephenson
*'''Special Guests:''' Alenka, Daniel Lake, Tommy Maxwell, Matthew McDonough, Eric Monjoin, Jeremy Stockwell
*'''Extra details:''' Kelly was upset that Kellie had gone and Jessica didn't deserve to stay. She also cried about Kellie's treatment in the ice cream task; Kellie was forced to speak when she couldn't, and Kelly queried, "How can you be someone that you're not?" This also reflected Phang's comment that looks cold in her pictures and needs to let down her guard.

===Episode 5===
''Original Airdate: 29 July 2008''

The episode was split into 2 rounds. The first round was a photo shoot at an East London housing estate. The photographer made sure that their disabilities were hidden; Kelly was positioned so her missing forearm was hidden, Sophie was out of her wheelchair, and Jessica took off her wrist splints. The photos are as follows:
*'''Jessica:''' stood in front of a house with an umbrella and watering can in hand, wearing a green dress and purple stockings
*'''Kelly:''' sat on the grass, wearing a yellow dress
*'''Sophie:''' sat on the roof, wearing a pink dress, leopard print stockings and sunglasses

During the photoshoot, Kelly complained that there's nothing wrong with Jessica as she held the watering can with no problem. Jessica slept for some of the time due to her ME, but when she awoke, the zip from her jacket left an imprint on her face and needed make up to cover that.

In the evening, the girls accompanied Jonathan Phang at a ball, acting as ambassadors for the disabled modelling cause. Kelly didn't eat much and became drunk after Phang left. She leapt onto a bush and threw up. Sophie was unimpressed as they were acting as ambassadors and Kelly was not representing the cause well.

The judges looked at the photos. Lara Masters, who is a wheelchair user herself, was upset at how the photographer had hidden their disabilities, but the other judges dismissed her comment, stating that not all the photos have to show their disabilities. Mark Summers commented about Jessica holding the watering can. Without her wrist splints, Jessica's hands are [[paralysed]], but she showed how her fingers naturally curled up and she was able to hold the watering can by her fingers. When she was asked how much sleep she needs (which had been an issue through the series) she replied that there is no telling when she needs to sleep.

*'''First Call-Out:''' Kelly Knox
*'''Bottom Two:''' Jessica Kellgren-Hayes &amp; Sophie Morgan
*'''Eliminated:''' Jessica Kellgren-Hayes
*'''Featured Photographer:''' Amelia Troubridge

When Jessica was eliminated, she said she would 'rule the world' one day.

The final challenge was a monochrome nude photoshoot. Kelly let the photographer tell her what to do; which resulted in her photo being of her kneeling on a couch, just being made apparent that her forearm is missing. Sophie made suggestions of what she could do, and her photo was of her sitting on the floor with her foot on the wheel of her wheelchair.

*'''Final Two:''' Kelly Knox &amp; Sophie Morgan
*'''Britain's Missing Top Model:''' Kelly Knox
*'''Featured Photographer:''' Oliver Pearce
*'''Special Guests:'''
*'''Extra details:''' After the winner was announced, Sophie was told that the decision was based on looks. Sophie got upset and angry when she lost, and left abruptly. She told Phang that Kelly wouldn't make changes to the industry.

===Episode 6===
''Original Airdate: 5 June 2008''

In this episode, Kelly had a photo shoot with [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]], and the photos were assessed by individuals from Marie Claire magazine. The episode also contained interviews with the 7 other contestants, recapping on their best and worst moments throughout the series.

'''World Car Free Day''', which is celebrated on September 22, encourages motorists to give up their cars for a day.  Organized events are held in some cities and countries.&lt;ref name=Alcindor&gt;{{cite news|author=Alcindor, Yamiche|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/22/AR2009092203532.html|title=A Day Without the Detriments of Driving|date=September 22, 2009|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the event "promotes improvement of [[public transport|mass transit]], cycling and [[walking]], and the development of communities where jobs are closer to home and where shopping is within walking distance".&lt;ref name=Alcindor /&gt; Studies showed that for short trips in cities, one can reach more quickly using a bicycle rather than using a car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesnow.in/blog/2015/07/09/step-out-of-your-cars-to-embrace-your-city/ Step out of your cars to embrace your cities | Cities Now] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923151042/http://citiesnow.in/blog/2015/07/09/step-out-of-your-cars-to-embrace-your-city/ |date=September 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events, which vary by location, give motorists and [[commuter]]s an idea of their locality with fewer cars. While projects along these lines had taken place from time to time on an ''ad hoc'' basis starting with the [[1973 oil crisis]], it was only in October 1994 that a structured call for such projects was issued in a keynote speech by [[Eric Britton]] at the International Ciudades Accessibles (Accessible Cities) Conference held in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (Spain).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/thursday.htm Thursday: A Breakthrough Strategy for Reducing Car Dependence in Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68YcbQr6d?url=http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/thursday.htm |date=2012-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two years the first Days were organized in [[Reykjavík]] (Iceland), [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (United Kingdom) and [[La Rochelle]] (France), and the informal [https://web.archive.org/web/20051120062104/http://worldcarfreeday.com/ World Car Free Days Consortium] was organized in 1995 to support Car-Free Days worldwide. The first national campaign was inaugurated in Britain by the [[Environmental Transport Association]] in 1997, the French followed suit in 1998 as [[In town, without my car!]] and was established as a Europe-wide initiative by the [[European Commission]] in 2000. In the same year the Commission enlarged the program to a full [[European Mobility Week]] which now is the major focus of the Commission, with the Car-Free Day part of a greater ''new mobility'' whole.
Also in 2000, car free days went global with a [http://www.worldcarfree.net/wcfd/ World Carfree Day] program launched by Carbusters, now [[World Carfree Network]], and in the same year the Earth Car Free Day collaborative program of the Earth Day Network and the World Car Free Days collaborative.

While considerable momentum has been achieved in terms of media coverage, these events turn out to be difficult to organize to achieve real success (perhaps requiring significant reorganization of the host city's transportation arrangement) and even a decade later there is considerable uncertainty about the usefulness of this approach. Broad public support and commitment to change is needed for successful implementation. By some counts by advocates (disputed), more than a thousand cities worldwide organized “Days” during 2005.

Currently [[Bogotá]] holds the world's largest car-free weekday event covering the entire city. The first car-free day was held in February 2000 and became institutionalised through a public referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Wright L. and Montezuma R.: Reclaiming public space {{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/110/1/Wright_and_Montezuma,_Walk21_V,_Copenhagen,_Jun_2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331093914/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/110/1/Wright_and_Montezuma,_Walk21_V,_Copenhagen,_Jun_2004.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-31 |df= }}, retrieved 2009-10-03&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, [[Jakarta]], the capital city of [[Indonesia]], held its first Car-Free Day that closed the main avenue of the city from cars and invited local pedestrian to exercise and having their activities on the streets that normally full of cars and traffic. Along the road from the Senayan traffic circle on Jalan Sudirman, South Jakarta, to the [[Selamat Datang Monument]] at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle on Jalan Thamrin, all the way north to [[National Monument (Indonesia)|National Monument]] Central Jakarta, cars are cleared out for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/25/carfree-day-reduces-air-pollution-tests.html |title=Carfree day Jakarta |publisher=Thejakartapost.com |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since May 2012 Car-Free Day in Jakarta is held every Sunday. It is held on the main avenues of the city, Jalan Sudirman and Jalan Thamrin, from Senayan area to Monas (Monumen Nasional), from 6 AM to 11 AM.

[[Image:Yom Kippur on Highway 20 Tel-Aviv.jpg|thumb|right|Cyclists ride down the deserted [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]] in Tel Aviv on [[Yom Kippur]].]]
While not an officially organized Car-Free Day, every year traffic in [[Israel]] stops (except for emergency vehicles) for more than 24 hours in observance of [[Yom Kippur#Observance in Israel|Yom Kippur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2014/10/yom-kippur-day-when-israel-goes-car-free.html|title=Yom Kippur, The Day When Israel Goes Car Free|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encompasses all motorized vehicles, including cars and public transportation (buses, trains, taxis, airplanes etc.). Cycling enthusiasts of the [[Hiloni]] stream and other religions take advantage of this, and roads (except in religious neighborhoods) become de facto [[esplanade]] and cycleways. Air pollution in Israel that day, measured by nitrogen oxides, drop by 99 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Air-pollution-levels-plunge-99-percent-in-Jerusalem-Tel-Aviv-over-Yom-Kippur-378069|title=Air pollution levels plunge 99% in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv over Yom Kippur|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
The 1994 Car Free Day Call &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/thursday.htm 1994 CFDC] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68YcbQr6d?url=http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/thursday.htm |date=2012-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set out a challenge for a city, neighborhood or group:

*To spend one carefully prepared day without cars.
*To study and observe closely what exactly goes on during that day.
*Then, to reflect publicly and collectively on the lessons of this experience and on what might be prudently and creatively done next to build on these.

The exercise considered car users to be "addicts" who need to be "treated" in some way. The organisers considered this to mean that motorists should have no choice but to be without cars, at least for a time. In this particular instance the proposed "treatment" was to find an answer to the following question in three main parts:

*Is it possible to get drivers out of their cars in one or more cities...
*In ways that will be tolerable in a pluralistic democracy...
*For at least long enough to demonstrate what needs to happen to make a car-less (or, more accurately, less-car) urban transport paradigm actually work?

== History and timeline ==

=== First ten years ===
The [[Environmental Transport Association]] set the initial annual '''Car-Free Day''' on the first Tuesday in their Green Transport Week (around 17 June), since 2000 it was agreed to make it a self-standing day held on September 22, originally as a [[Europe|pan-European]] day organised under the auspices of the [[European Commission]] and later with international extensions—during which a large number of cities around the world are invited to close their centers to [[Automobile|cars]]. Pedestrians, bicycles, public transit and other forms of sustainable transportation are encouraged on these days. People can reflect on what their city would look like with a lot fewer cars, and what might be needed to make this happen. Advocates claim that over 100 million people in 1,500 cities celebrate International Car-Free Day, though on days and in ways of their choice. This claim however is not confirmed.
	
Over the first decade of the car-free day movement (1994–2005), the world has seen hundreds of cities giving the CFD (Car Free Day) approach a try in very different circumstances, some good, some undeniably bad, some of them on several occasions.
	
Activists in this field wondered what were the actual accomplishments. They suggested that it was agreeable to have a pleasant day with fewer cars and probably fewer accidents at least in some parts of the city, but considered that this was not the bottom line. For them the goal of a Car Free Day had from the beginning been to serve as a small step, as a catalyst in a much larger and more ambitious process of citywide systemic transformation toward a more truly sustainable mobility system. They suggested that with rare exceptions they were not seeing anything like that.
	
The persons involved in the movement thought that after ten years it was time to stand back and look hard to see what if any difference this approach has made. They asked themselves if CFDs made here or there had produced any significant permanent impacts on cities and the ways human beings get around in them. They wondered if they could be content with what the great bulk of these projects and programs had achieved and just keep going on as-is, or if it were not time to stand back and look again. They decided to fight complacency with a new international collaborative program starting in 2004.

=== Timeline: Some major events ===
The following chronology assembles some of the main events of the last decades, which together have gradually built on each other's accomplishments to leave us today with a movement that is only now beginning to get under way. There are a very large number of cities and events that are not covered here.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3433">The '''condom challenges''' are two [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] [[Challenge (Internet)|Internet challenges]]. The first is a challenge involving snorting a latex [[condom]] through one's nasal cavity and into the back of the throat; the second is a challenge where a water-filled condom is dropped onto a person's head, typically enveloping the head of the person taking part. Both variations carry a risk of choking.

== Nasal cavity ==
The earlier challenge consists of inserting a latex condom into a [[nostril]] and snorting it into the [[nasal cavity]] and back through the [[throat]] to be pulled out of the [[mouth]]. The challenge originated in May 2006, when a video was uploaded onto [[Break.com]] of a young man successfully completing the challenge.{{cn|date=August 2013}} The term "condom challenge" was coined in May 2012 following the widespread popularity of the [[cinnamon challenge]], but the idea dates to the early 1990s when it was a staple of Matt "The Tube" Crowley's performances at the [[Jim Rose Circus]] Sideshow&lt;ref name="Gooch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19931029-01.2.43|work=Daily Kent Stater|title=It's disgusting but delightful: the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow|last=Gooch|first=Jamie|date=29 October 1993|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and videos of challenge attempts date to at least 2007.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Entertainment/condom-challenge-videos-youtube-bad-idea/story?id=18977460|title=Condom Challenge Videos On YouTube a Bad Idea|last=Alvarez|first=Alex|date=17 April 2013|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge went viral in 2013,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; when [[WorldStarHipHop]] posted a video of two young women attempting the challenge, and several people subsequently uploaded videos onto the Internet of themselves attempting the challenge.

The stunt poses potential choking hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2013/04/18/teen-condom-snorting-videos-are-gross-disturbing-not-funny-dangerous/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130823044244/http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2013/04/18/teen-condom-snorting-videos-are-gross-disturbing-not-funny-dangerous/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2013 |title=Teen Condom Snorting Trend is Dangerous, Gross, Not Funny at All [VIDEO] |last=Greenberg |first=Molly |date=18 April 2013 |work=[[InTheCapital]] |accessdate=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Condom challenge.jpg|thumb|A man taking the condom challenge]]
The later challenge, popularised in November 2015, involves filling a [[condom]] with water and filming it being dropped on one's head. This often results in the condom enveloping and adhering to the participant's face, giving the impression that they have somehow became immersed in the water held within the condom.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=Condom challenge: teens invent a new way to potentially maim themselves online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/25/condom-challenge-teens-internet|accessdate=11 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper noted the danger in putting an airtight seal over one's nose and mouth.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12130">'''CONSORT''' ('''Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials''') encompasses various initiatives developed by the CONSORT Group to alleviate the problems arising from inadequate reporting of [[randomized controlled trial]]s.

==The CONSORT Statement==
The main product of the CONSORT Group is the CONSORT Statement,&lt;ref name=statement&gt;Schulz KF, Altman DG, Moher D; CONSORT Group. CONSORT 2010 statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials. BMJ. 2010 Mar23;340:c332&lt;/ref&gt; which is an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]], minimum set of recommendations for reporting [[Clinical trial#Design|randomized trials]]. It offers a standard way for authors to prepare reports of trial findings, facilitating their complete and transparent reporting, reducing the influence of bias on their results, and aiding their critical appraisal and interpretation.

The most recent version of the Statement&amp;mdash;the CONSORT 2010 Statement&amp;mdash;consists of a 25-item [[checklist]] and a participant flow diagram, along with some brief descriptive text. The checklist items focus on reporting how the trial was designed, analyzed, and interpreted; the flow diagram displays the progress of all participants through the trial. The Statement has been translated into several languages.

The CONSORT ‘Explanation and Elaboration’ document&lt;ref name="explain"&gt;Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG. CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials. BMJ. 2010;340:c869&lt;/ref&gt; explains and illustrates the principles underlying the CONSORT Statement. It is strongly recommended that it is used in conjunction with the CONSORT Statement.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;

Considered an evolving document,&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt; the CONSORT Statement is subject to periodic changes as new evidence emerges; the most recent update was published in March 2010. The current definitive version of the CONSORT Statement and up-to-date information on extensions are placed on  the CONSORT website.

===Extensions of the CONSORT Statement===
The main CONSORT Statement is based on the 'standard' two-group parallel design. Extensions of the CONSORT Statement have been developed to give additional guidance for randomized trials with specific designs (e.g., [[cluster randomized trial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell MK, Elbourne DR, Altman DG. CONSORT statement: extension to cluster randomised trials. BMJ 2004; 328(7441):702-708.

==History==
In 1993, 30 experts - [[medical journal]] editors, clinical trialists, [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]], and [[Methodology|methodologists]] - met in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Canada]] to discuss ways of improving the reporting of randomized trials. This meeting resulted in the Standardized Reporting of Trials (SORT) statement,&lt;ref&gt;The Standards of Reporting Trials Group. A proposal for structured reporting of randomized controlled trials. The Standards of Reporting Trials Group. JAMA. 1994; 272(24):1926-1931.&lt;/ref&gt; a 32-item checklist and flow diagram in which investigators were encouraged to report on how randomized trials were conducted.

Concurrently, and independently, another group of experts, the Asilomar Working Group on Recommendations for Reporting of Clinical Trials in the Biomedical Literature, convened in [[California|California, USA]], and were working on a similar mandate. This group also published recommendations for authors reporting randomized trials.&lt;ref&gt;Working Group on Recommendations for Reporting of Clinical Trials in the Biomedical Literature. Call for comments on a proposal to improve reporting of clinical trials in the biomedical literature. Working Group on Recommendations for Reporting of Clinical Trials in the Biomedical Literature. Ann Intern Med. 1994; 121(11):894-895.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of Dr. Drummond Rennie, from [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]],&lt;ref&gt;Rennie D. Reporting randomized controlled trials. An experiment and a call for responses from readers. JAMA 1995; 273(13):1054-1055.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 representatives from both these groups met in [[Chicago|Chicago, USA]], with the aim of merging the best of the SORT and Asilomar proposals into a single, coherent evidence-based recommendation. This resulted in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement, which was first published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Begg C, Cho M, Eastwood S, Horton R, Moher D, [[Ingram Olkin|Olkin I]], Pitkin R, Rennie D, Schulz KF, Simel D, Stroup DF. Improving the quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials: the CONSORT statement. JAMA 1996; 276(8):637-639.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further meetings of the CONSORT Group in 1999 and 2000 led to the publication of the revised CONSORT Statement in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Moher D, Schulz KF, Altman DG. The CONSORT statement: revised recommendations for improving the quality of reports of parallel-group randomized trials . Ann Intern Med 2001; 134(8):657-662. [http://www.consort-statement.org/mod_product/uploads/CONSORT%20Statement%202001%20(Ann%20Intern%20Med).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the revision in 2001, the evidence base to inform CONSORT has grown considerably; empirical data highlighting new concerns regarding the reporting of randomized trials. Therefore, a third CONSORT Group meeting was held in 2007 resulting in publication of a newly revised CONSORT Statement&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; and explanatory document&lt;ref name="explain"/&gt; in 2010. Users of the guideline are strongly recommended to refer to the most up-to-date version while writing or interpreting reports of clinical trials.

==Impact==
The CONSORT Statement has gained considerable support since its inception in 1996. Over 600 journals and editorial groups worldwide now endorse it, including [[The Lancet]], [[British Medical Journal|BMJ]], [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]], [[New England Journal of Medicine]], World Association of Medical Editors, and [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals#International Committee of Medical Journal Editors|International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]]. The 2001 revised Statement has been cited over 1,200 times and the accompanying explanatory document over 500 times. Another indication of CONSORT’s impact is reflected in the approximately 17,500 hits per month that the CONSORT website has received. It has also recently been published as a book for those involved in the planning, conducting and interpretation of clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;Keech A, Gebski VJ, Pike R. Interpreting and reporting clinical trials. A guide to the CONSORT Statement and the principles of randomised controlled trials. 2007: Australasian Medical Publishing: NSW, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results from a recent [[systematic review]] suggest that use of the CONSORT checklist is associated with improved reporting of randomized trials.&lt;ref&gt;Plint AC, Moher D, Morrison A, Schulz K, Altman DG, Hill C, Gaboury I. Does the CONSORT checklist improve the quality of reports of randomised controlled trials? A systematic review. Med J Aust 2006; 185(5):263-267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar initiatives to improve the reporting of other types of research have arisen after the introduction of CONSORT. They include: Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE),&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbroucke JP. The making of STROBE. Epidemiology 2007;18: 797e9.&lt;/ref&gt; Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD),&lt;ref&gt;Knottnerus JA, Tugwell P. The standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy.

[[File:Ultrasound of human fetus, 8 weeks and 1 day.jpg|thumb|An ultrasound showing a fetus measured to have a crown-rump length of 1.67 cm, and estimated to have a gestational age of 8 weeks and 1 day]]

'''Crown-rump length''' ('''CRL''') is the measurement of the length of human [[embryo]]s and [[fetus]]es from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). It is typically determined from [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound imagery]] and can be used to estimate [[gestational age]].

==Measuring==
[[File:Crown-rump length by gestational age.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing crown-rump length by [[gestational age]]. The blue line is the [[mean]] and the green area delimits the 3rd versus the 97th [[percentile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohuma EO, Papageorghiou AT, Villar J, Altman DG |title=Estimation of gestational age in early pregnancy from crown-rump length when gestational age range is truncated: the case study of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=13 |issue= |pages=151 |year=2013 |pmid=24314232 |pmc=4029763 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-13-151 |url=}}
&lt;br&gt;Crown rump length before a gestational age of 9 weeks is extrapolated by assuming a crown rump length of 0 at a gestational age of 2 weeks, corresponding to an [[:en:embryonic age|embryonic age]] of 0 weeks. This extrapolated part is blurred because of uncertain values.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The embryo and fetus float in the [[amniotic fluid]] inside the [[uterus]] of the mother usually in a curved posture resembling the letter ''C''. The measurement can actually vary slightly if the fetus is temporarily stretching (straightening) its body. The measurement needs to be in the natural state with an unstretched body which is actually ''C'' shaped. The measurement of CRL is useful in determining the [[gestational age]] (menstrual age starting from the first day of the last menstrual period) and thus the expected date of delivery (EDD). Different babies do grow at different rates and thus the gestational age is an approximation. Recent evidence has indicated that CRL growth (and thus the approximation of gestational age) may be influenced by maternal factors such as age, [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking]], and folic acid intake. Early in [[pregnancy]] it is accurate within +/- 4 days but later in pregnancy due to different growth rates, the accuracy is less. In that situation, other parameters can be used in addition to CRL. The length of the [[umbilical cord]] is approximately equal to the CRL throughout pregnancy.

Gestational age is not the same as fertilization age. It takes about 14 days from the first day of the last menstrual period for [[Conception (biology)|conception]] to take place and thus for the [[conceptus]] to form. The age from this point in time (conception) is called the fertilization age and is thus 2 weeks shorter than the gestational age. Thus a 6-week gestational age would be a 4-week fertilization age. Some authorities however casually interchange these terms {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and the reader is advised to be cautious. An average gestational period (duration of pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period up to delivery) is 280 days. On average, this is 9 months and 6 days.

===Typical measurements===
{| border="1"
|+ Gestational Age for CRL
! Age !! CRL 
|-
| 6.1 Weeks: || 0.45&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 7.1 Weeks: || 1.0&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 8.0 Weeks: || 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm
|-

|-
| 13.2 Weeks: || 6.90&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 14.0 Weeks: || 8.0&amp;nbsp;cm

|}

The following formula is an approximation that can be used up to 14 weeks of gestational age, with CRL in [[millimetre|mm]] and gestational age in days:&lt;ref name="LoughnaChitty2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loughna|first1=Pam|last2=Chitty|first2=Lyn|last3=Evans|first3=Tony|last4=Chudleigh|first4=Trish|title=Fetal Size and Dating: Charts Recommended for Clinical Obstetric Practice|journal=Ultrasound|volume=17|issue=3|year=2009|pages=160–166|issn=1742-271X|doi=10.1179/174313409X448543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestational age = (CRL x 1.037)&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; x 8.052 + 23.73

'''Disability abuse''' is when a person with a disability is abused [[Physical abuse|physically]], [[Financial abuse|financially]], [[Sexual abuse|sexually]] and/or [[Psychological abuse|psychologically]] due to the person having a disability. Since many disabilities are not visible (for example, [[asthma]], [[schizophrenia]], or [[learning disabilities]]) some abusers cannot rationalise the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on. Since some disabled people are in need of additional support from others throughout their lives, they are also [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to [[neglect]]. Disability abuse has also been considered a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yIJh7Z0AG84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people]". ''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse is not limited to those who are visibly disabled such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a [[cleft lip]] but also those with [[learning disabilities]] or difficulties such as dyslexia and dysgraphia, and other disabilities, including [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Down syndrome]]&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;Sainsbury, Clare.

''Paul Chapman Publishing'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attwood&gt;Attwood, Tony. "The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome". ''Jessica Kingsley Publishers'', 2007, pp 95–111.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;Kirby, Amanda.

''Continuum'', 2005, 2007 (second edition), pp 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an unthinking physical education teacher.{{Who|date=October 2015}} Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools. There are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a care institution, such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol]] which led to its closure and the suspension or dismissal of some of the staff.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

Those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  There was one study done that shows 60 percent of the children with disabilities come forth about being bullied regularly, versus 25 percent of the students who are being bullied with no disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and Students need to Know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can also affect their learning and school and education.  Their grades are more at risk in dropping, they have a more difficult time concentrating, and there is no interest in school and the learning material.  All of this can lead to the child dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents. educators, and students need to know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=National Bullying prevention center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous cases of parents of children with disabilities who have murdered their children because of their disabilities. Sometimes the parents kill themselves alongside their child. It was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity—"As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aristotle (384–322 bc): philosopher and scientist of ancient Greece| pmc=2672651 | pmid=16371395|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.074534|volume=91|year=2006|pages=F75–7 | last1 = Dunn | first1 = PM | journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is documented in various indigenous societies. 
Disabled girls and women are particularly vulnerable to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1514 |title=Women and girls with disabilities |format= |work=UN Enable |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==
{{Main article|Bullying}}
Bullying is an aggressive behavior or attitude towards a person that is unwanted.  It is usually a repeated behavior.  There is more than just one type of bullying, there is verbal bullying, social, and physical.  Verbal bullying consist of name calling a person, teasing, and threatening to cause harm to the person.  Social abuse is intentionally leaving a person out while in a social setting or gathering, or taunting the person.  Physical abuse consist of hitting or pushing someone, pulling their hair, tripping them, or breaking their belongings intentionally.  Bullying happens usually before or after school hours, and it is usually done on campus or on the playground of the school.  However, it can also happen while on the school bus or going to and from the school bus.   Bullying can also happen through the internet or through the phone as well, this is known as cyber bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/definition/|title=Bullying definition|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Bullying|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey by the [[Interactive Autism Network]] found that 63% of children with [[autism]] are bullied in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57406540/survey-finds-63-of-children-with-autism-bullied/ |title=Survey finds 63% of children with autism bullied |format= |work=CBS News |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of autistic adults said they had been bullied at work in a survey by the UK's [[National Autistic Society]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/autistic-adults-bullied-and-not-supported-at-work-poll-shows-7743517.html |title=Autistic adults bullied and not supported at work, poll shows  |work=The Independent (UK) |accessdate= |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Cassidy |date=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

82% of children with learning disability in the UK are bullied, according to [[Mencap]], and 79% are scared to go out in case they are bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/18/schools.children | title = Eight of out 10 disabled children bullied, report finds | accessdate = 2016-10-23| date = 2007-06-18| work = Mencap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey that was done shows that roughly 7 out of 10 people with disabilities have been abused, and that it is an ongoing problem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2013/09/04/survey-abuse-widespread/18652/|title=Survey Finds Disability Abuse Widespread|website=Disability Scoop|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that bullying people with disabilities is a problem that is going on in different countries as well, and that problem is not always surfaced and given attention to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bullying is also a cause of disability and exacerbates existing disabilities.

Bullying can take occur in a variety of forms. They aren't always physical. Verbal bullying and nonverbal bullying are the ones that occur very often. Catherine Thornberry and Karin Olson claim that carers often [[Dehumanization|dehumanize]] disabled people, taking away their abilities and qualities that make them a person and lowering them to the level of just an object or a thing. They found that the caregivers or assistants are often the ones who are unintentionally bullying the disabled individuals. The caregivers look at the individuals at lower standard than they do other people, leading to their labeling of disabled individuals as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;Thornberry, Catherine, and Karin Olson. "[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ844468.pdf The Abuse of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities]." Developmental Disabilities Bulletin 33.1-2 (n.d.): 1-19. EBSCO Host. Web. 22 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying a child with a disability is considered to be harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilitie|title=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and students need to know|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual abuse==
{{Main article|Sexual abuse}}
Disabled people are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than the general population for numerous reasons. As they are less likely to report what has happened to them, their rapists are able to get away with the abuse. Victims often not taken seriously due to [[ableism]] which intersects with societal myths about sexual violence, for example, that 'ugly' people aren't raped, since society's beauty standard devalues disability.

According to Valenti-Hein &amp; Schwartz, only 3% of sexual abuse cases involving developmentally disabled people are ever reported, more than 90% of developmentally disabled people will experience sexual abuse at some point in their lives, and 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.&lt;ref name="Leigh Ann Davis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwild.org/Victims%20of%20Crime/Downloads/Research/Vulnerability%20and%20Abuse%20of%20People%20with%20an%20Intellectual%20Disability/Davis%20n.d.pdf |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |format= |work=by Leigh Ann Davis |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' by Sequeira, Howlin, &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric and behavioural disorder in people with learning disabilities in a case-control study. Sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, and with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/5/451|title=Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study.|vauthors=Sequeira, H, Howlin, P, Hollins, S|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=183|number=5|year=2003|pages=451–456|doi=10.1192/bjp.183.5.451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual abuse is less likely to be reported by individuals with disabilities. The people that surround these individuals are often found to be less likely to report these cases of abuse. Society sees the disabled as weak and vulnerable targets, making it easy for the abuser to not feel guilty or to blame themselves. More often than not people figure they can trust their physicians or doctors who provide care for these individuals. In a clinical study it was found that the physicians would provide poor quality of care to individuals with disabilities. They would suppress the problems instead of addressing them by giving them drugs to make them be quiet. It was also found that physicians were less likely to report sexual abuse or any abuse that they found present on these individuals. The justified these actions by believing that in society that disabled people matter less than any other person.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Ruth.

Community Mental Health Journal 36.6 (2001): 499–509. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Extreme disability abuse can lead directly or indirectly to death. In [[Tanzania]], people with [[albinism]] are hunted by witchcraft practitioners for their organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociocultural aspects of albinism in Sub-Saharan Africa: mutilations and ritual murders committed in east Africa (Burundi and Tanzania)| pmid=20025171 | volume=69 | year=2009| journal=Med Trop (Mars)| pages=449–53 | last1 = Aquaron | first1 = R | last2 = Djatou | first2 = M | last3 = Kamdem | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales over 1700 disability hate crimes were recorded by police in 2011 and 2012, but a review by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] said that they are 'overlooked' and 'under-reported'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability hate crime is 'overlooked and under-reported'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21865264|newspaper=BBC | date=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Awareness Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.co.uk/2002/08/people-with-mental-retardation-sexual.html |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |work=The Awareness Center |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has been passing laws and policies to help [[Disability|people with disabilities]] in [[Zambia]], however, [[social stigma]] and other factors sometimes interfere in people being able to access services and assistance. In addition, the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV epidemic]] in Zambia also has a significant impact on the lives of people with disabilities.

==Demographics==
As of 2008, it was estimated that around 256,000 in Zambia have a disability in some form and around 5.4% of that number have an [[intellectual disability]].{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=142}} In 2011, it was estimated that the numbers may actually be somewhere between 1 and 2 million people with disability in Zambia.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osisa.org/law/zambia/dealing-disability|title=Dealing with disability|last=Lee|first=Richard|date=7 August 2013|website=The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA)|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603073138/http://www.osisa.org/law/zambia/dealing-disability|archive-date=3 June 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of Zambians live in rural areas where they have limited access to healthcare.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-829186141.html|title=Zambia: Rights Disabled|last=|first=|date=3 January 2005|work=Women's Feature Service|access-date=8 July 2018|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities have an employment rate of 45.5%, which is lower than the 58% rate for people without disabilities, according to 2005 statistics.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=1}}

Care-giving roles for people with disabilities in Zambia has shifted to a younger demographic than in previous years.{{Sfn|Chiluba|Moyo|2017|p=6}} This is in part due to the drop in [[life expectancy]] in Zambia.{{Sfn|Chiluba|Moyo|2017|p=6}}

==Cultural attitudes towards disability==
In general, people with disability often face [[social stigma]] in Zambia.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=2}} Zambian people with disability can be thought to be the victims of [[witchcraft]] by others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/08/06/488665391/the-mis-education-and-remarkable-triumph-of-georgina-mamba|title=The Mis-Education — And Remarkable Triumph — Of Georgina Mumba|last=Aizenman|first=Nurith|date=6 August 2016|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215203703/https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/08/06/488665391/the-mis-education-and-remarkable-triumph-of-georgina-mamba|archive-date=15 February 2017|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Zambian religious beliefs have come to accept and embrace individuals with disabilities over time.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=143}} Some Zambians attribute a shift to [[Christianity]] to the new, more positive, views on people with disability in Zambia.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2015/08/21/disability-and-the-church-breaking-the-silence/|title=Zambia : Disability and the Church: Breaking the Silence|last=Mumba|first=Georgina|date=2015-08-21|work=Lusaka Times|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the workplace, individuals still face [[discrimination]].{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=52}}

Relatives are expected to care for individuals who have a disability.{{Sfn|Chiluba|Moyo|2017|p=2}} However, there are boarding schools for children with disabilities, and these are often utilized when the children had been orphaned or abandoned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People with disabilities and who are also [[HIV|HIV positive]] are further marginalized by their communities.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=10}} People with disability are often expected to rely on [[Charity (practice)|charity]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

People with disabilities, especially women and those who are HIV positive are assumed to have no sexuality or sex lives by others in Zambia.{{Sfn|Wickenden|Nixon|Yoshida|2013|p=2}} Disabled women attempting to access health care are often discouraged from visiting health centres, especially for sexual and maternal health needs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Policy==
Disability issues in Zambia fall under the control of the Ministry of Community Development and Social Welfare, now known as the [[Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health]] (MCDMCH).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=3}} However, overall, there is a lack of government support for individuals with disabilities.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=53}} Individuals who have an [[intellectual disability]] cannot receive [[Welfare|social welfare]] benefits.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=144}} A trust fund, managed by the [[Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities]], give out funds to mostly individuals with physical disabilities.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=144}}

Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan has made some progress in helping people with disabilities in Zambia achieve equal status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Infrastructure ===
Laws requiring ramps for schools and public buildings were passed in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, many of the ramps that have been built are not suitable for people with physical disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The largest museum in Zambia, the [[Livingstone Museum]], installed a ramp and other accessibility features in 2006.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=57}}

=== Education ===
The [[Ministry of Education (Zambia)|Ministry of Education]] in Zambia handles special education in the schools.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}} The [[Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority]] (TEVETA) is also involved in both education and employment.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=3}} People with disabilities in Zambia experience difficulty accessing educational opportunities.{{Sfn|Trani|Loeb|2012|p=S32}} Special education services have been very limited in Zambia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Parents of children with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] (ID) in [[Lusaka]] reported that there were challenges to meeting the social needs of their young adult children.{{Sfn|Nkhosi|Menon|2015|p=164}}

=== Non Governmental Organisations ===
The first organisation focusing on helping people with disabilities, The Northern Rhodesia Society for the Blind, was formed in 1952.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=60}}

The [[Zambia Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities]] (ZACALD) is one of the most prominent organisations to advocate for individuals with intellectual disabilities in Zambia.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=144}} The [[Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities]] (ZAPD) works with the government to advise on policy and advocate for people with disabilities.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=3}} In addition, the [[Zambia Federation of Disability Organisations]] (ZAFOD) has been cited by the [[Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa]] (OSISA) as an active and influential organisation in Zambia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ZAFOD advocates for [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] and promotes teaching issues relating to people with disabilities in [[Higher education|tertiary schools]] in the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Legislation ===
In 1996, the Zambian government passed the Disability Act of 1996.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=60}} This act bans discrimination based on disability.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=60}} This act was repealed in 2012 and replaced with the Persons with Disability Act of 2012.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}} The new act is meant to implement the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}}

In 1998, the Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Act was passed and a provision considers the needs of people with disability.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}} The Workers' Compensation Act of 1999 changed the law relating to workers' compensation for injuries on the job.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}}

==Unique challenges==

=== People with disabilities and HIV status ===
Zambia is affected by a generalized [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV epidemic]].{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=51}} Individuals with disabilities face unique challenges in getting access to [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]] and treatment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tun|first=Waimar|last2=Okal|first2=Jerry|last3=Schenk|first3=Katie|last4=Esantsi|first4=Selina|last5=Mutale|first5=Felix|last6=Kyeremaa|first6=Rita Kusi|last7=Ngirabakunzi|first7=Edson|last8=Asiah|first8=Hilary|last9=McClain-Nhlapo|first9=Charlotte|date=2016-07-01|title=Limited accessibility to HIV services for persons with disabilities living with HIV in Ghana, Uganda and Zambia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.7448/IAS.19.5.20829/abstract|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|language=en|volume=19|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.7448/ias.19.5.20829|issn=1758-2652|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a lack of information and education available in formats such as [[Braille]], large print or via [[Sign language|sign-language]] interpreters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Children with disabilities also have trouble accessing HIV prevention information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/15/zambia-people-disabilities-left-behind-hiv-response|title=Zambia: People With Disabilities Left Behind in HIV Response|date=2014-07-15|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the social stigma of disability and having HIV means that some individuals prefer to die at home rather than receive treatment for HIV.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=1}} People who are both HIV positive and have a disability have reported that "they were seen as 'other' and 'less than human' by" health care providers.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=7}} They report "disability-related stigma that became heightened by the presence of HIV."{{Sfn|Nixon|Cameron|Hanass-Hancock|Simwaba|2014|p=4}}

Many disabled individuals have reported losing their jobs after discovery of their HIV status has been revealed.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=53}} These individuals turn to begging for money, which is also frowned upon in most Zambian communities.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=53}} Those who do have jobs find that it is difficult to take their HIV medications on time outside of the home.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=54}}

People with disabilities who are also HIV positive are generally assumed to not be engaging in sexual activity, when in fact, they "may be equally as sexually active as others and at increased risk of [[sexual abuse]]."{{Sfn|Nixon|Cameron|Hanass-Hancock|Simwaba|2014|p=1}} Assumptions about their sexuality can impact their health.{{Sfn|Wickenden|Nixon|Yoshida|2013|p=7}} They have also had their [[privacy]] disregarded by health care workers who were shocked to discover a person with disabilities who was also HIV positive: "whenever they find a person with disability who is positive, it becomes a shock to them. They share it with other counsellors, and then it get broken into society."{{Sfn|Nixon|Cameron|Hanass-Hancock|Simwaba|2014|p=5}}

=== Children with intellectual disabilities ===
Parents of children with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] (ID) in Zambia have found that healthcare professionals do not have an "understanding of their child's condition" and the effects the condition can have on the caregivers.{{Sfn|Nkhosi|Menon|2015|p=167}}

== Disability culture==
=== Arts ===
A project to train disabled Zambians in filmmaking was launched in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Musika |first1=Chomba |title=Film-making earns living for disabled – Zambia Daily Mail |url=https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/film-making-earns-living-for-disabled/ |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=Zambia Daily Mail Limited |date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport ===
{{See also|Zambia at the Paralympics}}
[[Disabled sport]] in Zambia is organised by the [[National Paralympic Committee of Zambia]] since its establishment in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/magazine/120209154614856_TheParalympian_2008_01.pdf |title=NPC Profile: A Remarkable Presidency |magazine=The Paralympian |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}} Zambia has participated in [[Summer Paralympic Games]] in [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996]], [[2000 Summer Paralympics|2000]], [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]], and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|2012]]. They have yet to win any medals.

[[Special Olympics]] Zambia has sent teams to the [[2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games|2007]], [[2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games|2011]] and [[2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games|2015]] editions of the [[Special Olympics World Summer Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Olympics Zambia continues to inspire athletes with "Intellectual Disabilities". – OYDC {{!}} Home of Olympic Heroes |url=https://www.oydc.org.zm/special-olympics-zambia-continues-to-inspire-athletes-with-intellectual-disabilities/ |website=www.oydc.org.zm |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Resistance of Microbes to Disinfectants.png|thumb|Levels of resistance of microbes to disinfectants.]]
'''Disinfectants''' are [[antimicrobial]] agents that are applied to the surface of non-living objects to destroy [[microorganisms]] that are living on the objects.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/glossary.htm|accessdate=19 April 2016|title=Division of Oral Health - Infection Control Glossary|publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413120331/http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/glossary.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant [[endospore|bacterial spores]]; it is less effective than [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], which is an extreme physical and/or chemical process that kills all types of life.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt; Disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as [[antibiotic]]s, which destroy microorganisms within the body, and [[antiseptic]]s, which destroy microorganisms on living [[biological tissue|tissue]]. Disinfectants are also different from [[biocide]]s — the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life, not just microorganisms.
Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with their metabolism.

Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midsussex.gov.uk/page.cfm?pageID=1783 Cleaning and disinfecting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709225141/http://www.midsussex.gov.uk/page.cfm?pageID=1783 |date=9 July 2011 }}, (2009), ''[[Mid Sussex|Mid Sussex District Council]]'', UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals, dental surgeries, kitchens, and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms.

Bacterial [[endospore]]s are most resistant to disinfectants, but some viruses and bacteria also possess some tolerance.

[[File:DISINFECTANT PIC.svg|thumb| Disinfectants are used to rapidly kill bacteria. They kill off the bacteria by causing the proteins to become damaged and outer layers of the bacteria cell to rupture. The DNA material subsequently leaks out.]]

In [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]], a disinfection step with [[chlorine]], [[Ultra-violet radiation|ultra-violet (UV) radiation]] or [[ozonation]] can be included as tertiary treatment to remove [[pathogens]] from wastewater, for example if it is to be reused to irrigate golf courses. An alternative term used in the [[sanitation]] sector for disinfection of waste streams, [[sewage sludge]] or [[septage|fecal sludge]] is '''sanitisation''' [[American and British English spelling differences|or]] '''sanitization'''.

==Properties==
A perfect disinfectant would also offer complete and full microbiological [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilisation]], without harming humans and useful form of life, be inexpensive, and noncorrosive. However, most disinfectants are also, by nature, potentially harmful (even [[toxic]]) to humans or animals. Most modern household disinfectants contain [[Denatonium|Bitrex]], an exceptionally bitter substance added to discourage ingestion, as a safety measure. Those that are used indoors should never be mixed with other cleaning products as [[chemical reaction]]s can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/cehsweb/bleach_fs.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2016 |title=Common Cleaning Products May Be Dangerous When Mixed |publisher=New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323153736/http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/cehsweb/bleach_fs.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of disinfectant to be used depends on the particular situation. Some disinfectants have a wide spectrum (kill many different types of microorganisms), while others kill a smaller range of disease-causing organisms but are preferred for other properties (they may be non-corrosive, non-toxic, or inexpensive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/protocols_and_guidelines/antibiotic_resistance/docs/hospital_disinfectants_for_general_disinfection_of_environmental_surfaces.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2016 |title=Hospital Disinfectants for General Disinfection of Environmental Surfaces |publisher=New York State Department of Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025446/http://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/protocols_and_guidelines/antibiotic_resistance/docs/hospital_disinfectants_for_general_disinfection_of_environmental_surfaces.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are arguments for creating or maintaining conditions that are not conducive to bacterial survival and multiplication, rather than attempting to kill them with chemicals. Bacteria can increase in number very quickly, which enables them to [[evolution|evolve]] rapidly. Should some bacteria survive a chemical attack, they give rise to new generations composed completely of bacteria that have resistance to the particular chemical used. Under a sustained chemical attack, the surviving bacteria in successive generations are increasingly resistant to the chemical used, and ultimately the chemical is rendered ineffective. For this reason, some question the wisdom of impregnating cloths, [[cutting board]]s and worktops in the home with [[bactericidal]] chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Types==

===Air disinfectants===
Air disinfectants are typically chemical substances capable of disinfecting microorganisms suspended in the air. Disinfectants are generally assumed to be limited to use on surfaces, but that is not the case.  In 1928, a study found that airborne microorganisms could be killed using mists of dilute bleach.&lt;ref name="bacterialaction"&gt;For a review of the early work in this field, see: {{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson OH, Bigg E, Puck TT, Miller BF |title= The bactericidal action of propylene glycol vapor on microorganisms suspended in air. i |journal= Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=75 |pages=593–610 |date=June 1942  |pmid=19871209 |doi=10.1084/jem.75.6.593 |issue= 6 |pmc= 2135271}}&lt;/ref&gt; An air disinfectant must be dispersed either as an [[aerosol]] or [[vapour]]&lt;!--WP:ENGVAR: please WP:RETAIN--&gt; at a sufficient concentration in the air to cause the number of viable infectious microorganisms to be significantly reduced.

In the 1940s and early 1950s, further studies showed inactivation of diverse [[bacteria]], [[influenza virus]], and ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' (previously ''P. notatum'') [[mold]] [[fungus]] using various glycols, principally [[propylene glycol]] and [[triethylene glycol]].&lt;ref name="bactericidaleffects"&gt;For a review through 1952 see: {{cite journal |vauthors=Lester W, Dunklin E, Robertson OH |title= Bactericidal effects of propylene and triethylene glycol vapors on airborne Escherichia coli |journal= Science |volume=115 |pages=379–382 |date=April 1952 |pmid= 17770126 |doi=10.1126/Science.115.2988.379 |issue= 2988|bibcode=1952Sci...115..379L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In principle, these chemical substances are ideal air disinfectants because they have both high lethality to microorganisms and low mammalian toxicity.&lt;ref name="propyleneglycol"&gt;For a review of the toxicity of propylene glycol, see:  {{cite journal |author= United States Environmental Protection Agency |title= Reregistration eligibility decision for propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol |volume= EPA 739-R-06-002 |date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="triethyleneglycol"&gt;For a review of the toxicity of triethylene glycol, see:  {{cite journal |author= United States Environmental Protection Agency |title= Reregistration eligibility decision for triethylene glycol |volume= EPA 739-R-05-002 |date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although glycols are effective air disinfectants in controlled laboratory environments, it is more difficult to use them effectively in real-world environments because the disinfection of air is sensitive to continuous action.  Continuous action in real-world environments with outside air exchanges at door, HVAC, and window interfaces, and in the presence of materials that adsorb and remove glycols from the air, poses engineering challenges that are not critical for surface disinfection.  The engineering challenge associated with creating a sufficient concentration of the glycol vapours in the air have not to date been sufficiently addressed.&lt;ref name="progressincontrol"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Committee on Research Standards |title= Air Sanitation (Progress in the Control of Air-Borne Infections) |journal= American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health |volume=40 |pages=82–88 |date=May 1950 |pmid= 15418852 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.40.5_Pt_2.82 |issue= 5 Pt 2 |pmc= 1528669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factorsofimportance"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lester W, Kaye S, Robertson OH, Dunklin EW |title= Factors of Importance in the Use of Triethylene Glycol Vapor for Aerial Disinfection |journal= American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health |volume=40 |pages=813–820 |date=July 1950 |pmid= 15425663 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.40.7.813 |issue= 7 |pmc= 1528959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohols===
{{see also|Hand sanitizer}}
[[Alcohol]] and alcohol plus [[Quaternary ammonium cation]] based compounds comprise a class of proven surface sanitizers and disinfectants approved by the [[EPA]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] for use as a hospital grade disinfectant.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html | title=Disinfection &amp; Sterilization Guidelines | publisher=CDC | work=Guidelines Library: Infection Control | date=December 28, 2016 | accessdate=January 12, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112160244/https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html | archivedate=12 January 2018 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohols are most effective when combined with [[distilled water]] to facilitate diffusion through the cell membrane; 100% alcohol typically denatures only external membrane proteins.&lt;ref name="foodsafety"&gt; {{cite web |url=http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/a2z-b.html |title= Food Safety A to Z Reference Guide-B | publisher=[[FDA]] [[CFSAN]]|accessdate=10 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103105715/http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/a2z-b.html |archivedate=3 January 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mixture of 70% ethanol or [[isopropanol]] diluted in water is effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria, though higher concentrations are often needed to disinfect wet surfaces.&lt;ref name="alcoholreview"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moorer WR |title=Antiviral activity of alcohol for surface disinfection |journal=[[International Journal of Dental Hygiene]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=138–42 |date=August 2003 |pmid=16451513 |doi=10.1034/j.1601-5037.2003.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, high-concentration mixtures (such as 80% ethanol + 5% isopropanol) are required to effectively inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]]).&lt;ref name="foodsafety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alcoholreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="virucidal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Engelenburg FA, Terpstra FG, Schuitemaker H, Moorer WR |title=The virucidal spectrum of a high concentration alcohol mixture |journal=[[The Journal of Hospital Infection]] |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=121–5 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12090799 |doi=10.1053/jhin.2002.1211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="virucidal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lages SL, Ramakrishnan MA, Goyal SM |title=In-vivo efficacy of hand sanitisers against feline calicivirus: a surrogate for norovirus |journal=The Journal of Hospital Infection |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=159–63 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18207605 |doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2007.11.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The efficacy of alcohol is enhanced when in solution with the wetting agent [[dodecanoic acid]] (coconut soap).  The synergistic effect of 29.4% ethanol with dodecanoic acid is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.  Further testing is being performed against [[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]] (C.Diff) spores with higher concentrations of ethanol and dodecanoic acid, which proved effective with a contact time of ten minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.urthpro.com | title = Clean &amp; Disinfect Mold, Bacteria &amp; Viruses in any Environment | publisher=UrthPRO| accessdate = November 18, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202151102/http://www.urthpro.com/| archivedate=February 2, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aldehydes===
[[Aldehyde]]s, such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[glutaraldehyde]], have a wide microbiocidal activity and are [[sporicidal]] and [[fungicidal]]. They are partly inactivated by organic matter and have slight residual activity.

Some bacteria have developed resistance to glutaraldehyde, and it has been found that glutaraldehyde can cause asthma and other health hazards, hence [[ortho-phthalaldehyde]] is replacing glutaraldehyde.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Oxidizing agents===

[[redox|Oxidizing agents]] act by oxidizing the cell membrane of microorganisms, which results in a loss of structure and leads to cell [[lysis]] and death.  A large number of disinfectants operate in this way. [[Chlorine]] and [[oxygen]] are strong oxidizers, so their compounds figure heavily here.

*[[Electrolyzed water]] or "Anolyte" is an oxidizing, acidic hypochlorite solution made by [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]] into [[sodium hypochlorite]] and hypochlorous acid. Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5––8.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0–6.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is [[hypochlorous acid]].
*[[Hydrogen peroxide]] is used in [[hospital]]s to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with [[colloidal silver]]. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer [[allergic]] reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.
* [[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] is used as a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|medical sterilant]] and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals approved for decontamination of anthrax spores from contaminated buildings, such as occurred during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the U.S. It has also been shown to be effective in removing exotic animal viruses, such as avian influenza and [[Newcastle disease]] from equipment and surfaces.
* The antimicrobial action of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by [[surfactant]]s and organic acids. The resulting chemistry is known as Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide. A 2% solution, stabilized for extended use, achieves high-level disinfection in 5 minutes, and is suitable for disinfecting medical equipment made from hard plastic, such as in [[endoscope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Omidbakhsh|title= A new peroxide-based flexible endoscope-compatible high-level disinfectant |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=571–577 |year=2006 | pmid=17097451 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.02.003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence available suggests that products based on Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, apart from being good germicides, are safer for humans and benign to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sattar|title= A product based on accelerated hydrogen peroxide: Evidence for broad-spectrum activity |journal=Canadian Journal of Infection Control |pages=123–130 |date=Winter 1998 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ozone]] is a gas used for disinfecting water, laundry, foods, air, and surfaces. It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. 
*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining "stainless" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is also widely used in community swimming pools to disinfect ones feet before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.

=== Peroxy and peroxo acids ===
[[Peroxy acid|Peroxycarboxylic acids and inorganic peroxo acids]] are strong oxidants and extremely effective disinfectants.

* [[Peroxyformic acid]]
* [[Peracetic acid]]
* [[Peroxypropionic acid]]
* [[Monoperoxyglutaric acid]]
* [[Monoperoxysuccinic acid]]
* [[Peroxybenzoic acid]]
* [[Peroxyanisic acid]]
* [[meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|Chloroxyperbenzoic acid]]
* [[Monoperoxyphthalic acid]]
* [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]]

===Phenolics===
[[Phenols|Phenolics]] are active ingredients in some household disinfectants. They are also found in some mouthwashes and in disinfectant soap and handwashes. Phenols are toxic to cats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1677&amp;aid=2243|title=Phenol and Phenolic Poisoning in Dogs and Cats|website=www.peteducation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919033206/http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1677&amp;aid=2243|archivedate=19 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and newborn humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+113|title=PHENOL - National Library of Medicine HSDB Database|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031619/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+113|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Phenol]] is probably the oldest known disinfectant as it was first used by [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]], when it was called carbolic acid. It is rather corrosive to the skin and sometimes toxic to sensitive people. Impure preparations of phenol were originally made from [[coal tar]], and these contained low concentrations of other [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s including [[benzene]], which is an [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]] [[carcinogen]].
* [[2-Phenylphenol|''o''-Phenylphenol]] is often used instead of [[phenol]], since it is somewhat less corrosive.
* [[Chloroxylenol]] is the principal ingredient in [[Dettol]], a household disinfectant and [[antiseptic]].
* [[Hexachlorophene]] is a phenolic that was once used as a germicidal additive to some household products but was banned due to suspected harmful effects.
* [[Thymol]], derived from the herb thyme, is the active ingredient in some "broad spectrum" disinfectants that often bear ecological claims. It is used as a stabilizer in pharmaceutic preparations. It has been used for its antiseptic, antibacterial, and antifungal actions, and was formerly used as a vermifuge.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|title=The PubChem Project|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808222031/http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Amylmetacresol]] is found in [[Strepsils]], a throat disinfectant.
* Although not a phenol, [[2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol]] has similar effects as phenols, but it cannot inactivate viruses.

===Quaternary ammonium compounds===

[[Quaternary ammonium compounds]] ("quats"), such as [[benzalkonium chloride]], are a large group of related compounds. Some concentrated formulations have been shown to be effective low-level disinfectants. Quaternary Ammonia at or above 200ppm plus Alcohol solutions exhibit efficacy against difficult to kill non-enveloped viruses such as [[norovirus]], [[rotavirus]], or [[polio virus]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;  Newer synergous, low-alcohol formulations are highly effective broad-spectrum disinfectants with quick contact times (3–5 minutes) against bacteria, enveloped viruses, pathogenic fungi, and [[mycobacteria]].  Quats are biocides that also kill algae and are used as an additive in large-scale industrial water systems to minimize undesired biological growth.

=== Inorganic compounds ===

==== Chlorine ====
This group comprises aqueous solution of [[chlorine]], [[hypochlorite]], or [[hypochlorous acid]]. Occasionally, chlorine-releasing compounds and their salts are included in this group. Frequently, a concentration of &lt; 1 ppm of available chlorine is sufficient to kill bacteria and viruses, spores and mycobacteria requiring higher concentrations.

* [[Sodium hypochlorite]]
* [[Calcium hypochlorite]]
* [[Chloramine]]
* [[Chloramine-T]]
* [[Trichloroisocyanuric acid]]
* [[Chlorine dioxide]]

==== Iodine ====
* [[Iodine]]
* [[Iodophor]]s

==== Acids and bases ====
* [[Sodium hydroxide]]
* [[Potassium hydroxide]]
* [[Calcium hydroxide]]
* [[Magnesium hydroxide]]
* [[Sulfurous acid]]
* [[Sulfur dioxide]]

==== Metals ====

=== Terpenes ===
* [[Thymol]]
* [[Pine oil]]

===Other===
The [[biguanide]] [[polymer]] [[polyaminopropyl biguanide]] is specifically bactericidal at very low concentrations (10&amp;nbsp;mg/l). It has a unique method of action: The polymer strands are incorporated into the bacterial cell wall, which disrupts the membrane and reduces its permeability, which has a lethal effect to bacteria. It is also known to bind to bacterial DNA, alter its transcription, and cause lethal DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen MJ, White GF, Morby AP |title=The response of Escherichia coli to exposure to the biocide polyhexamethylene biguanide |journal=Microbiology |volume=152 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=989–1000 |year=2006 |pmid=16549663 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.28643-0 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/152/4/989 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526161153/http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/152/4/989 |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has very low toxicity to higher organisms such as human cells, which have more complex and protective membranes.

Common [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has antifungal properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zamani M, Sharifi Tehrani A, Ali Abadi AA |title=Evaluation of antifungal activity of carbonate and bicarbonate salts alone or in combination with biocontrol agents in control of citrus green mold |journal=Communications in Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=773–7 |year=2007 |pmid=18396809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some antiviral and antibacterial properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malik YS, Goyal SM |title=Virucidal efficacy of sodium bicarbonate on a food contact surface against feline calicivirus, a norovirus surrogate |journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology |volume=109 |issue=1–2 |pages=160–3 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16540196 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.08.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; though those are too weak to be effective at a home environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=William A.

[[Lactic acid]] is a registered disinfectant. Due to its natural and environmental profile, it has gained importance in the market.

===Non-chemical===
[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] is the use of high-intensity shortwave [[ultraviolet light]] for disinfecting smooth surfaces such as dental tools, but not porous materials that are opaque to the light such as wood or foam. Ultraviolet light is also used for municipal [[water treatment]]. Ultraviolet light fixtures are often present in [[microbiology]] labs, and are activated only when there are no occupants in a room (e.g., at night).

Heat treatment can be used for disinfection and sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://ehs.research.uiowa.edu/87-heat-disinfection-and-sterilization | title = Heat Disinfection and Sterilization | publisher = [[University of Iowa]], Environmental Health &amp; Safety | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190620/https://ehs.research.uiowa.edu/87-heat-disinfection-and-sterilization | archivedate = 8 January 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Sunlight}}The phrase "sunlight is the best disinfectant" was [[Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It|popularized in 1913]] by [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] and later advocates of [[government transparency]]. While sunlight's ultraviolet rays can act as a disinfectant, the Earth's [[ozone layer]] blocks the rays' most effective wavelengths. Ultraviolet light-emitting machines, such as those used to disinfect some hospital rooms, make for better disinfectants than sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Ciara |title=Is Sunlight Actually the Best Disinfectant? |work=Slate |date=9 August 2013 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/08/sunlight_is_the_best_disinfectant_not_exactly.html |issn=1091-2339 |df=mdy-all |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305042551/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/08/sunlight_is_the_best_disinfectant_not_exactly.html |archivedate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements of effectiveness==
One way to compare disinfectants is to compare how well they do against a known disinfectant and rate them accordingly. Phenol is the standard, and the corresponding rating system is called the "[[Phenol coefficient]]". The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' or ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient &amp;gt; 1. Those that are less effective have a coefficient &amp;lt; 1.

The standard European approach for disinfectant validation consists of a basic suspension test, a quantitative suspension test (with low and high levels of organic material added to act as ‘interfering substances’) and a two part simulated-use surface test.&lt;ref name=Sandle&gt;{{cite book | editor = Sandle T | title = The CDC Handbook: A Guide to Cleaning and Disinfecting Cleanrooms  | edition = 1st | publisher = Grosvenor House Publishing Limited | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1781487686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less specific measurement of effectiveness is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) classification into either ''high'', ''intermediate'' or ''low'' levels of disinfection. "High-level disinfection kills all organisms, except high levels of bacterial spores" and is done with a chemical germicide marketed as a sterilant by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). "Intermediate-level disinfection kills mycobacteria, most viruses, and bacteria with a chemical germicide registered as a 'tuberculocide' by the Environmental Protection Agency. Low-level disinfection kills some viruses and bacteria with a chemical germicide registered as a hospital disinfectant by the EPA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/prevent/sd_medicalDevices.html |title=Sterilization or Disinfection of Medical Devices |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 December 2012 |website=CDC |publisher= |accessdate=20 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720040938/http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/prevent/sd_medicalDevices.html |archivedate=20 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative assessment is to measure the Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of disinfectants against selected (and representative) microbial species, such as through the use of microbroth dilution testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Vijayakumar R, Kannan VV, Sandle T, Manoharan C

==Home disinfectants==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Overuse of the definite article, and non-encyclopedic style|date=February 2015}}

The most cost-effective home disinfectant is [[Bleach|chlorine bleach]] (typically a &gt;10% solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]), which is effective against most common [[pathogens]], including disinfectant-resistant organisms such as [[tuberculosis]] ([[mycobacterium tuberculosis]]), [[hepatitis]] B and C, [[fungi]], and antibiotic-resistant strains of [[staphylococcus]] and [[enterococcus]]. It has disinfectant action against some [[Parasites|parasitic organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm EPA's Registered Sterilizers, Tuberculocides, and Antimicrobial Products Against [[HIV]]-1, and Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Viruses.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930061054/http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm |date=30 September 2015 }} (Obtained 4 January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}}

The benefits of chlorine bleach include its inexpensive and fast acting nature. However it is harmful to mucous membranes and skin upon contact, has a strong odour; is not effective against ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''; and combination with other cleaning products such as ammonia and [[vinegar]] can generate noxious gases like [[chlorine]]. The best practice is not to add anything to household bleach except water. As with most disinfectants, the area requiring disinfection should be cleaned before the application of the chlorine bleach, as the presence of organic materials may inactivate chlorine bleach.

The use of some antimicrobials such as [[triclosan]], is controversial because it may lead to [[antimicrobial resistance]]. The use of chlorine bleach and alcohol disinfectants does not cause [[antimicrobial resistance]] as it denatures the protein of the microbe upon contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watoxics.org/healthy-living/healthy-homes-gardens-1/factsheets/antimicrobials |title=Antimicrobial Products: Who Needs Them? — Washington Toxics Coalition |publisher=Watoxics.org |date=15 September 1997 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710230146/http://watoxics.org/healthy-living/healthy-homes-gardens-1/factsheets/antimicrobials |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thomas Bonham v College of Physicians''''', commonly known as '''''Dr. Bonham's Case''''' or simply '''''Bonham's Case''''', was a case decided in 1610 by the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] in [[England]], under Sir [[Edward Coke]], the court's [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]], who explained why he thought that "in many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament".&lt;ref name="Pollard 2007 p.51"&gt;Pollard (2007) p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's meaning has been disputed over the years. According to one interpretation, Coke intended the kind of [[judicial review]] that would later develop in the [[United States]], but other scholars believe that Coke meant only to construe a statute, not to challenge [[parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;Edlin (2008) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; If Coke intended the former, he may have later changed his view.&lt;ref name="Pollard 2007 p.51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 2007 p.42"&gt;Martin (2007) p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The statement by Coke is sometimes considered to be an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' (a statement made 'by the way'), rather than part of the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' (rationale for the decision) of the case.&lt;ref name=dictum /&gt; 

Whatever Coke's meaning, after an initial period during which his decision enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, ''Bonham's Case'' was thrown aside, in favour of the growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In one of the most prominent early treatises supporting the doctrine, [[William Blackstone]] wrote that Parliament is the sovereign lawmaker, preventing the common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes in the fashion that Coke had suggested. Parliamentary sovereignty is now the accepted judicial doctrine in the legal system of [[England and Wales]].

''Bonham's Case'' was met with mixed reactions at the time, with King [[James I of England|James I]] and his [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], both deeply unhappy with it. One of the reasons for Coke's dismissal from the Common Pleas in 1613 was suggested to be the case.

Academics in the 19th and the 20th centuries have been scarcely more favourable and called it "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially"&lt;ref name=orth37/&gt; and simply an "abortion".&lt;ref name=all/&gt;

In the United States, Coke's decision met with a better reaction. During the legal and public campaigns against the [[writ of assistance|writs of assistance]] and the 1765 [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], ''Bonham's Case'' was used as a justification for nullifying the legislation, but by 1772, Blackstone's views had gained acceptance.&lt;ref name="Hamburger 2008 p.278"&gt;Hamburger (2008) p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1803 case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', which in 1803 formed the basis for the exercise of [[judicial review in the United States]], under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[US Constitution]], used the words "void" and "repugnant", but the usage of ''Marbury'' was somewhat different from that of Coke.

Academics have argued that the case forms the basis of judicial review in the United States; other academics disagree, one scholar calling that "one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to say nothing of history".&lt;ref name=mc3/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:St John's College, Cambridge by Loggan 1690.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A picture of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where Bonham studied, from around 1685]]
The College of Physicians (renamed in 1674 to the [[Royal College of Physicians]]) was an elite organisation. Created by [[royal charter]] in 1518, it was founded by six English academic doctors trained in English universities. It admitted only British men who had trained at a university and passed a three-part [[Latin]] exam in medical theory. Only 24 Fellows were allowed, and if an entrant came at a time when all 24 Fellowships were full, he would instead become a Candidate, the most senior Candidate being admitted to the first vacant Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.129&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Act of Parliament]] confirming the royal charter also gave the college the ability to act as a court to judge other practitioners and to punish those who were acting badly or practising without a licence. A second Act, the College of Physicians Act 1553, amended the charter and gave the college the right to imprison indefinitely those judged.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1972) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; That "flew in the face of the common law assumption that to practice medicine one needed only the consent of the patient".&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.130&lt;/ref&gt; Still, on 8 April 1602, [[John Popham (Lord Chief Justice)|John Popham]], the Chief Justice, upheld the college's authority to imprison and fine: "That no man, though never so learned a Phisition, or doctor may Practise in London, or within seaven myles, without the Colledge Lycense.... That a free man of London, may lawfully be imprysoned by the Colledge".&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Bonham (physician)|Thomas Bonham]] had been admitted to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1581. Earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1584, he completed a [[master's]] by 1588 and studied for a medical [[doctorate]] at Cambridge, which was later granted by the [[University of Oxford]]. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to [[London]], where he practised medicine and associated himself with the [[Barber-Surgeons' Company]], campaigning for it to be allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving up after a failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.134&lt;/ref&gt; Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined £5 ({{Inflation|UK|5|1606|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-1}}) and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined £10. Bonham again appeared before the college, now with a lawyer, on 7 November.&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.152&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. He was then imprisoned (some say at [[Fleet Prison]],&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger (2008) p.624&lt;/ref&gt; and some say at [[Newgate Prison]]) for contempt, but his lawyer had a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', issued by the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], which freed him on 13 November.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonham's successful writ worried the college, whose previous success with Popham and "keen cultivation" of same as well as Lord Ellesmere and other Crown officials had left them assured that their jurisdiction would be maintained. As such, the college appealed directly to the Crown officers, and on 1 May 1607, it met with a committee of judges at Ellesmere's house. The committee were Ellesmere, Popham, [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Thomas Fleming]], two judges from the Court of Common Pleas and two from the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]]. The judges all agreed that "for not well doeing useing or practicing the facultie or arte of physike or for disobedience or contempte donne and committed against anye ordynaunce made by the colledge... they may committ the offenders without bayle or mayneprise".&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.136&lt;/ref&gt; That success spurred the college to move against Bonham yet again, now by suing him in the King's Bench for £60 ({{Inflation|UK|60|1607|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-2}}) for maintaining an illicit practice. In a counterattack, Bonham brought a suit in the Common Pleas, requesting £100 (£{{Inflation|UK|100|1607|fmt=c|r=-2}}) damages,&lt;ref name="Gray 1972 p.36"&gt;Gray (1972) p.36&lt;/ref&gt; and alleging that they had [[trespass in English law|trespassed against his person]] and wrongfully imprisoned him "against the law and custom of this [[kingdom of England]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case==
[[File:Edward Coke1629.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]], the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] who decided in favour of Bonham]]
The case was heard in the Court of Common Pleas by [[Peter Warburton (judge)|Warburton J]], Daniel J, [[Thomas Foster (judge)|Foster J]], [[Thomas Walmsley (judge)|Walmisley J]] and the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]], with a decision finally reached in the winter of 1610. The college's lawyers had argued that the two Acts of Parliament and the royal charter "intends, that none shall practise here but those who are most learned and expert, more than ordinary". As such, the college was free to punish for both practising without a licence and for malpractice, with the 1553 Act giving them the authority to imprison those they judged. Bonham's lawyers replied by arguing that the Acts and charter were intended to prevent malpractice, not practising without a licence.

Moreover, Bonham's study "[in the texts at university] is practise [sic]", and to become a doctor means to be considered capable of teaching: "when a man brings with him the ensign of doctrine, there is no reason that he should be examined again, for then if thou will not allow of him, he shall not be allowed, though he is a learned and grave man, and it is not the intent of the King to make a monopoly of this practise". As such, the Act "doth not inhibit a doctor to practice [sic], but [only] punisheth him for ill using, exercising, and making [of physic]". In other words, it covered malpractice, not illicit practice.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

Walmisley and Foster sided with the college, with Walmisley delivering the joint opinion. He said that since the statute clearly said "no person" could practise without the college's licence, only one verdict was acceptable, as the college had a valid licensing authority. The royal charter was to be interpreted as granting the college a duty on behalf of the King:

{{quote|It is the office of a King to survey his subjects, and he is a physician to cure their maladies, and to remove leprosies amongst them, and also to remove all fumes and smells, which may offend or be prejudicial to their health... and so if a man be not right in his wits, the King is to have the protection and government of him, lest he being infirm, waste or consume his lands or goods; and it is not sufficient for him that his subjects live, but that they should live happily; and [he] discharges not his office, if his subjects live a life, but [only] if they live and flourish; and he hath cure as well of their bodies as of their lands and goods for health for the body is as necessary as virtue to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.140&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As such, in Walmisley's mind, the King had a duty to protect the health of his subjects and had delegated it to the college. In addition, Bonham had given "an absurd and contemptuous answer" when he claimed that he would not submit to the college, and "it should be a vain law if it did not provide punishment for them that offend against that". The King had delegated part of his [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative powers]] to the college, for the purposes of punishment and imprisonment, and as such, it had the right to sit as a court.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

Coke delivered the majority opinion in favour of Bonham, with Daniel and Warburton agreeing. He undertook a closer reading of the college's charter and associated Acts and divided the relevant passage into two clauses. One gave the power to fine practitioners without licences. The latter specified that they could imprison a practitioner for "not well doing, using or practicing physic". He argued that they constituted separate powers and issues; the former dealt with authorisation to punish for illicit practise, and the other covered punishment for malpractice. Simply practising without a licence did not constitute malpractice. As such, the college did not have the power to imprison Bonham, who was accused of practising without a licence, not of practising dangerously.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2004) p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

Coke also went further by arguing against the validity of the charter and its associated Acts, which gave the college the right to act as both as a judge and as a party to a case, which "provided for an absurdity":

{{quote|One cannot be Judge and attorney for any of the parties.... And it appears in our books, that in many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void; for when an act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it, and adjudge such an Act to be void; and, therefore in.... Thomas Tregor's case... Herle saith, some statutes are made against law and right, which those who made them perceiving would not put them in execution.&lt;ref name=will2&gt;Williams (2006) p.111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of that and four other reasons given by Coke,&lt;ref&gt;Conklin (1979) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the college was to stop trying to supervise medical practice, arbitrating and acting as a court.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2006) p.116&lt;/ref&gt; In support of his judgment, Coke cited not only ''Tregor's Case'' but also two anonymous cases with the academic names of ''Cessavit'' 42 and ''Annuitie'' 11, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Y. B. Pasch. 8 Edw. III, 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The decision in ''Bonham's Case'' has been described by [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|John Campbell]] ([[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] and Lord Chancellor in the 19th century) as "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially".&lt;ref name=orth37&gt;Orth (1999) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Allott, in the ''Cambridge Law Journal'', simply called it an "abortion".&lt;ref name=all&gt;Allott (1990) p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Coke was later dismissed from his judicial posts, and Ellesmere immediately began making veiled criticisms, maintaining that it was unconscionable to allow the judges power to throw aside Acts of Parliament if they were repugnant or contrary to reason; however, he spoke "not of impossibilities or direct repugnancies". It was acceptable to overturn an Act if it was clearly and obviously repugnant but not otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2006) p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

Coke has come under criticism for his examples to justify his decision. The first case that he gave, ''Tregor's Case'', was seriously misquoted. Coke stated, "Herle said some statutes are made against law and right, which those who made them perceiving, would not put into execution". In fact, there is no reference to "law and right" is found in the original text; Herle wrote that "there are some statutes made which he himself who made them does not will to put into execution", meaning only that some statutes are poorly drafted, and if they cannot be interpreted to work, Parliament would accept the courts not applying them. [[Theodore Plucknett]] wrote, "Whoever reads the whole of Herle's remarks can see that he did not regard the statute then under discussion as falling within this category; on the contrary, he suggested a perfectly obvious and straightforward interpretation of it.... Coke's first authority is far from convincing".&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

His second authority, ''Cessavit'' 42, "goes much further to support his thesis" and concerns a situation in which [[William Bereford]] refused to apply an Act of Parliament because it would undermine several common law principles. However, Plucknett notes the distinction that in ''Cessavit'' 42, "the statute is not held void; it is just ignored. To this fact Coke has really added an explanation and a theory of his own".&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

His third example, ''Annuitie'' 11, was based on the Statute of Carlisle, which required all religious orders to have seals, placed in the custody of the prior and four of the "worthiest brethren" so that the [[Abbot]] could not use it without their knowledge. Any decisions made without the seal kept in that fashion were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; That clashed with church law and was incredibly difficult for small religious orders; as such, Sir [[Anthony Fitzherbert]] said that the statute was void, as it was "impertinent" or "impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.160&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plucknett again casts doubt on the example's validity by stating that it "would have looked strong... [but] is, in fact, of doubtful import".&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bonham's Case'' was deeply unpopular with the Crown;&lt;ref&gt;Bowen (1957) p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Coke was removed from the Common Pleas and sent to the King's Bench, in theory a more senior office but in practice a less rewarding one in 1613. In June 1616, he was suspended from office and ordered to "correct" his case reports. In October 1617, James I demanded an explanation from Coke of the reasoning behind ''Bonham's Case''. Coke claimed that "the words of my report do not import any new opinion, but only a relation of such authorities of law, as had been adjudged and resolved in former times, and were cited in the argument of Bonham's case". He refused to admit to any flaws with his writings, and his only corrections were minor errors and rearrangements of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.168&lt;/ref&gt; If he meant the case as an endorsement of judicial review instead of Parliamentary sovereignty, withdrawal of that endorsement has been inferred from his later writings.&lt;ref name="Pollard 2007 p.51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 2007 p.42"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The decision has been variously interpreted. It can be construed as marking the supremacy of the common law over Parliament by judicial review or only as being another form of [[statutory interpretation]]. Noah Feldman suggested that the dispute over the two meanings has its origins in 1930s America, where frustration over judicial review of elements of the [[New Deal]] spilled into the academic world.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2004) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Kent]], in his ''[[Commentaries on American Law]]'', argued that ''Bonham's Case'' and similar cases meant only that statutes should be given a "reasonable construction".&lt;ref name=orth33&gt;Orth (1999) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Gray, in the ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', argues that Coke, as a judge, never intended to advocate the judicial review of statutes.&lt;ref name="Gray 1972 p.36"/&gt; [[Bernard Bailyn]] wrote that "Coke had not meant... 'that there were superior principles of right and justice which Acts of Parliament might not contravene'" and also that by "saying that courts might 'void' a legislative provision that violated the constitution he meant only that the courts were to construe statutes so as to bring them into conformity with recognized legal principles".&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1969) p.526&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Searle Holdsworth]] agreed that it would be a mistake to view isolated statements by Coke in ''Bonham’s Case'' as endorsing limitations upon Parliament; Coke himself elsewhere acknowledged the power of Parliament as being "so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds".&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth (1912) pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Raoul Berger, in the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', disagrees; the words of the statute were clear, and the only application that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1969) p. 527&lt;/ref&gt; John V. Orth, writing in the ''Constitutional Commentary'', concurs: "If that were so, why did they not say so? Is it likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?"&lt;ref name=orth33/&gt;

Research by Samuel Thomas and [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]] has led to a reassessment. During the early 17th century, non-common law courts were claiming an "[i]mperial, almost legislative discretion over statutory interpretation, free from any supervisory jurisdiction of the common law courts". Coke's decision can, therefore, be seen as him reminding such courts that their interpretations were subject to the law, not to individual discretion.&lt;ref name=ham622/&gt;

==Later impact==
===Britain===
[[File:SirWilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|[[William Blackstone]]'s comments in the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' saw [[parliamentary sovereignty]] overtake Coke's doctrine.]]
During Coke's lifetime, he was judicially dominant, and his ideas were upheld by his successor as Chief Justice, [[Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Hobart]], in ''Day v Savadge'' and ''Lord Sheffield v Ratcliffe''.&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.167&lt;/ref&gt; After Coke's death, however, his jurisprudence "naturally suffered an eclipse", and its next appearance is in ''Godden v Hales'', in 1686, where the doctrine was twisted to argue that the Crown had the prerogative to dismiss government laws.&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Plucknett notes that "the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] marks the abandonment of the doctrine of ''Bonham's Case''",&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.171&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1701, the common law judges cited Coke's decision with approval in ''City of London v Wood'',&lt;ref&gt;12 Mod. 669 (1701)&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Holt (Lord Chief Justice)|John Holt]] concluding that Coke's statement is "a very reasonable and true saying".&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1969) p.523&lt;/ref&gt; His position was to treat statutes in the same way as other documents for the purpose of judicial review and was followed for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2006) p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the judiciary, [[John Lilburne]] used ''Bonham's Case'' in his book ''The Legall Fundamentall Liberties of the People of England'' and then in his 1649 treason trial to justify his attack on the [[Rump Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Parkin-Speer (1979) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, Coke's theory gradually died out; [[William Blackstone]], in the first edition of his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', wrote that "if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government".&lt;ref&gt;Plucknett (2004) p.176&lt;/ref&gt; Parliamentary sovereignty is now upheld by the English judiciary as a "central principle of British constitutionalism" despite with some issues by membership in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott (2004) p.546&lt;/ref&gt; The case's modern irrelevance is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, "Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten".&lt;ref name=ham622&gt;Hamburger (2008) p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;

==In America==
In the [[Thirteen Colonies]], there were instances of Coke's statement being interpreted to mean that the common law was superior to statute. For example, drawing on Coke's statement, [[James Otis, Jr.]], declared during the struggle over writs of assistance courts had to ignore Acts of Parliament "against the constitution and against natural equity", which had a significant impact on [[John Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1940) p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; When the 1765 Stamp Act was declared invalid by the [[Massachusetts Assembly]], the rationale was that it was "against [[Magna Charta]] and the natural [[rights of Englishmen]], and therefore, according to the Lord Coke, null and void".&lt;ref&gt;Bowen (1957) p.172&lt;/ref&gt; By 1772, Otis and others had reversed course by adopting Blackstone's position that judges cannot challenge Acts of Parliament.&lt;ref name="Hamburger 2008 p.278"/&gt; Even before then, ''Dr. Bonham's Case'' had rarely been used as a rallying cry in America; judicial review in America grew primarily from other political and intellectual sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer (2006) pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gough (1985) p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Marbury v. Madison'' (1803), the case that forms the basis for the exercise of judicial review in America, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] stated that "the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument". Marshall specifically used the words "void" and "repugnant", which has been characterised as a deliberate reference to Coke, but Marshall's principle involved repugnancy to the written Constitution. instead of repugnancy to reason.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2004) p.29&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hurtado v. California]]'' (1884), the US Supreme Court discussed ''Bonham's Case'' specifically by saying that it had not affected the omnipotence of parliament over the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1917) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Samuel Corwin]], writing in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', praised the idea of a fundamental higher law of reason enforceable by judges and so endorsed "the ratification which Coke's doctrine received in American constitutional law and theory".&lt;ref&gt;Corwin (1929) pp. 370-371&lt;/ref&gt; Gary McDowell, writing in ''[[University of Notre Dame#Political science|The Review of Politics]]'', called the case's influence "one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to say nothing of history".&lt;ref name=mc3&gt;McDowell (1993) p.393&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell pointed out that it was never discussed during the 1786 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. During the ratification conventions, despite Coke being mentioned, it was not during debates over the striking down of unconstitutional statutes. Also, other writings of Coke were brought up but never ''Bonham's Case'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (1993) p.395-7&lt;/ref&gt;
An additional point of view is that the US Supreme Court has come "full circle to the dictum in Bonham's Case" by using the [[Due Process Clause]] to strike down what the Court deems "unreasonable" legislation.&lt;ref name=dictum&gt;Schwartz (1968) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dutch hypothesis''' provides one of several [[biologically plausible]] explanations for the [[pathogenesis]] of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]], a progressive disease known to be [[Etiology (medicine)|aetiologically]] linked to environmental insults such as [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref name=Tam2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tam A, Sin DD |title=Pathobiologic mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=Med.

The Dutch hypothesis was originally proposed by Dick Orie and his team in 1961 at the [[University of Groningen]].&lt;ref name="ERJ-20061101" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kauffmann02&gt;&lt;!-- M.D.MacNee2002 --&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kauffmann |first1=Francine |last2=Demenais |first2=Florence |editor-last=King, |editor-first=Richard A. |editor2-last=Rotter |editor2-first=Jerome I. |editor3-last=Motulsky |editor3-first=Arno G. |title=The Genetic Basis of Common Diseases |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKC4swxJC1UC&amp;pg=PA163 |accessdate=19 November 2012|date=17 October 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512582-5|pages=163–171|chapter=Chronic obstructive pulmonory disease - Pathophysiology: biologic basis of genetic susceptibility}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Orie, "Bronchitis and Asthma  may be found in one patient at the same age but as a rule there is a fluent development from bronchitis in youth to a more asthmatic picture in adults, which in turn develops into bronchitis of elderly patients."&lt;ref name="Goodfellow2012"&gt;As quoted in: {{cite book|author=John A.

More recent [[molecular biology]] research suggests that the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD may share overlapping pathways involving innate biological susceptibility, coupled with environmental factors which can trigger the different diseases. [[Genetic association]] studies that have uncovered the same [[genetic polymorphism|polymorphism]]s in people with asthma and COPD provide support for the notion that the two conditions share some biological characteristics; implicated genes include ''[[ADAM33]]'', ''[[CCL5]]'' and ''[[Interleukin 17|IL17F]]''.&lt;ref name=Hizawa2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hizawa|first=N|title=Genetic backgrounds of asthma and COPD.|journal=Allergology International|date=September 2009|volume=58|issue=3|pages=315–22|pmid=19628974|url=http://ai.jsaweb.jp/fulltext/058030315/058030315_index.html#a5|accessdate=18 November 2012|doi=10.2332/allergolint.09-RAI-0105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although clinically debated,&lt;ref name=Kraft2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraft|first=M|title=Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exhibit common origins in any country!|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=August 2006|volume=174|issue=3|pages=238–40; discussion 243–4|pmid=16864716|doi=10.1164/rccm.2604007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barnes2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=PJ|title=Against the Dutch hypothesis: asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are distinct diseases|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=August 2006|volume=174|issue=3|pages=240-3; discussion 243-4|pmid=16864717|doi=10.1164/rccm.2604008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dutch hypothesis remains one of four main plausible explanations which could help explain the [[Complex disease|complex]] pathogenesis of COPD, others being the [[protease]]-antiprotease hypothesis (involving [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] overexpression and consequent alpha-1 proteinase deficiency), the British hypothesis (regarding a putative aetiological role of acute bronchial infections), and the [[autoimmunity]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Tam2012 /&gt;

'''Edmonston Pumping Plant''' is a [[pumping station]] near the south end of the [[California Aqueduct]], which is the principal feature of the [[California State Water Project]].  It lifts water 1,926 feet (600 m) to cross the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] where it splits into the west and east branches of the California Aqueduct serving Southern California.  It is the most powerful water lifting system in the world, not considering [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watereducation.org/aquapedia/ad-edmonston-pumping-plant|title=A.D. Edmonston Pumping Plant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 14 4-stage 80,000-horsepower centrifugal pumps that push the water up to the top of the mountain. Each motor-pump unit stands 65-feet high and weighs 420 tons. The pumps themselves extend downward six floors. Each unit discharges water into a manifold that connects to the main discharge lines. The two main discharge lines stairstep up the mountain in an 8400-foot long tunnel. They are 12.5 feet in diameter for the first half and 14-feet in diameter for the last half. They each contain 8.5 million gallons of water at all times.  At full capacity, the pumps can fling nearly 2 million gallons per minute up over the Tehachapis. At the top of mountain, there’s a 68-feet high, 50-foot diameter surge tank.  This prevents tunnel damage when the valves to the pumps are suddenly open or closed.  Near the top of the lift there are valves which can close the discharge lines to prevent backflow into the pumping plant below in event of a rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mavensphotoblog.com/2011/08/27/the-big-lift-a-photo-tour-of-the-state-water-projects-pumps-at-edmonston/|title=The Big Lift: A photo tour of the State Water Project’s Edmonston Pumping Plant|publisher=Maven's Photoblog|date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station consumes up to 787 MW of electricity, delivered through a dedicated 230kV [[Electric_power_transmission|transmission line]] from the nearby [[Southern California Edison]] Pastoria substation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.sce.com/sscc/law/dis/dbattach7.nsf/0/A3FCBFC1CFED06DA882575920062466D/$FILE/2005-03-07+Offer+Of+Settlement+ER05-170.pdf#page=20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esophageal pH monitoring''' is the current [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosis of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD). It provides direct physiologic measurement of acid in the [[esophagus]] and is the most objective method to document reflux disease, assess the severity of the disease and monitor the response of the disease to medical or surgical treatment. It can also be used in diagnosing [[laryngopharyngeal reflux]].

== Background ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TRDeMeester.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Tom DeMeester MD developed esophageal pH monitoring.]] --&gt;

The importance of refluxed gastric contents in the [[pathogenesis]] of [[GERD]] was emphasized by Winkelstein who introduced the term "[[peptic]] [[esophagitis]]" and by Bernstein and Baker who reported the symptom of [[heartburn]] following instillation of [[hydrochloric acid]] in the distal [[esophagus]]. Formal measurement of [[acid]] in the [[esophagus]] was first described in 1960 by Tuttle. He used a glass [[pH]] probe to map the gastroesophageal pH gradient, and demonstrated a sharp gradient in normal subjects and a gradual sloping gradient in patients with esophagitis. Four years later, Miller used an indwelling esophageal pH electrode to continuously measure esophageal and gastric pH for a period up to 12 hours. This technique required that the patient keep their hands immersed in saline to serve as a reference. Prolonged monitoring became feasible in 1974 when Johnson and DeMeester developed a dependable external reference electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson LF, Demeester TR |title=Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring of the [[distal]] esophagus. A quantitative measure of gastroesophageal reflux |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=325–32 |date=October 1974 |pmid=4432845 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Using this technique to monitor esophageal acid exposure patients for periods up to 24 hours, DeMeester and Johnson were able to identify the most important parameters of esophageal acid exposure, and they developed a composite pH score to quantify gastroesophageal reflux. The initial 24-hour pH studies required hospitalization until the introduction of [[microcircuits]] in the 1980s that allowed portable esophageal pH monitoring in an outpatient setting.

== Clinical application==
[[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) is a common disease in western countries. In the [[United States]], 7% of the population experiences [[heartburn]] daily and 44% at least once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Talley NJ, Zinsmeister AR, Schleck CD, Melton LJ |title=Dyspepsia and dyspepsia subgroups: a population-based study |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=102 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=1259–68 |date=April 1992 |pmid=1551533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heartburn]] occurs when esophageal mucosa is exposed to the acidic gastric content, but the complaint of [[heartburn]] is not always a reliable guide to the presence of acid reflux in the esophagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tefera L, Fein M, Ritter MP, etal |title=Can the combination of symptoms and endoscopy confirm the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease? |journal=Am Surg |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=933–6 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9322676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only half of the patients with increased esophageal acid exposure will have [[esophagitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeMeester TR, Peters JH, Bremner CG, Chandrasoma P |title=Biology of gastroesophageal reflux disease: pathophysiology relating to medical and surgical treatment |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=50 |pages=469–506 |year=1999 |pmid=10073290 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.50.1.469 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.med.50.1.469?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the diagnosis of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) on the basis of symptoms or endoscopic findings is problematic.

Although there remains no gold standard for the diagnosis of GERD, ambulatory esophageal [[pH]] monitoring can provide data to guide further evaluation and treatment of patients with GERD-associated symptoms. In the past, an indwelling nasoesophageal [[catheter]] was the only way to measure esophageal acid exposure. Because this method is associated with [[nose|nasal]] and [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] discomfort and [[rhinorrhea]], patients may have limited their activity and become more sedentary during the monitored period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fass R, Hell R, Sampliner RE, etal |title=Effect of ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring on reflux-provoking activities |journal=Dig. Dis. Sci. |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=2263–9 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10573372 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0163-2116&amp;volume=44&amp;page=2263|doi=10.1023/A:1026608804938}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have resulted in less acid reflux and a false negative test. A catheter-free radio [[telemetric]] system allows a longer period of monitoring and may be better tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ayazi S, Lipham JC, Portale G, etal |title=Bravo catheter-free pH monitoring: normal values, concordance, optimal diagnostic thresholds, and accuracy |journal=Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=60–7 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18976965 |doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2008.08.020 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1542-3565(08)00846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Bravo tracing.jpg|right|thumb|330px|'''96 Hour Bravo pH monitoring''' A sample of Bravo pH tracing recorded over 48 hours]]

Esophageal pH monitoring is currently performed using one of the following three techniques:
# Single sensor pH monitoring using a pH catheter
# Dual sensor pH monitoring using a pH catheter
# Wireless pH monitoring using Bravo pH capsule or OMOM pH monitoring capsule

The duration of the test is 24 hours in the first and second techniques and 48 hours for the Bravo capsule or more (96 hours) for OMOM capsule.

== pH sensor location and probe placement==
In assessment of distal esophageal pH, the sensor is placed 5&amp;nbsp;cm above upper border of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) determined by [[esophageal manometry]]. To measure [[proximal]] esophageal acid exposure the second sensor is placed 1-5 below the lower border of the [[upper esophageal sphincter]] (UES). The Bravo pH capsule is placed either transnasally based on manometric measurements, or following [[endoscopy]]. In transnasal placement the capsule is placed 5&amp;nbsp;cm above upper border of the LES, and in endoscopic placement 6&amp;nbsp;cm above [[gastroesophageal junction]]. The same applies to OMOM pH monitoring capsule.

== Components of esophageal pH monitoring==
A reflux episode is defined as esophageal pH drop below four. Esophageal pH monitoring is performed for 24 or 48 hours and at the end of recording, a patient's tracing is analyzed and the results are expressed using six standard components. Of these 6 parameters a pH score called '''Composite pH Score''' or '''DeMeester Score''' has been calculated, which is a global measure of esophageal acid exposure. A Demeester score &gt; 14.72 indicates reflux.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) pH monitoring ==

The widespread prescription of [[proton pump inhibitors]] (PPI) by primary care physicians has resulted in a change in pattern of GERD in patients who use these medications. Quite often gastroenterologist and foregut surgeons receive consultations to assess patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite the fact that patients is on acid suppression medications. This is due to the fact that symptoms of these patients are the results of weak acid or non-acid reflux.
In 1991 '''Silny''' was the first investigator who described Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance (MII), a technique which detects intraesophageal bolus transport. This method is based on measuring the resistance to alternating current (i.e., impedance) of the content of the esophageal lumen. MII- pH monitoring was then developed by several clinical investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tutuian R, Vela MF, Shay SS, Castell DO |title=Multichannel intraluminal impedance in esophageal function testing and gastroesophageal reflux monitoring |journal=J. Clin. Gastroenterol. |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=206–15 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12960718 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0192-0790&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=206 |doi=10.1097/00004836-200309000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical application of this technique is mainly in GERD patients who have persistent symptoms despite medical therapy.

== pH monitoring in laryngopharyngeal reflux==
Retrograde flow of gastric contents to the upper aerodigestive tract causes a variety of symptoms such as [[cough]], [[asthma]] and [[hoarseness]]. These respiratory manifestations of the reflux disease are commonly called [[laryngopharyngeal reflux]] (LPR) or extraesophegeal reflux disease (EERD). Distal esophageal pH monitoring has been used as an objective test to establish reflux as the cause of the atypical reflux symptoms but, its role in causally associating patients’ symptoms to GERD is controversial. In an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy of testing, a catheter with two pH sensors has been used to measure the degree of esophageal acid exposure in both distal and proximal esophagus. The ideal location for pH measurement to confirm the diagnosis of the laryngopharyngeal reflux is the [[pharynx]] and new studies have focused on the development of a new pH sensor which can function in the challenging environment of the oropharynx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ayazi S, Lipham JC, Hagen JA, etal |title=A new technique for measurement of pharyngeal pH: normal values and discriminating pH threshold |journal=J. Gastrointest. Surg. |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=1422–9 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19421822 |doi=10.1007/s11605-009-0915-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Good Food Awards''' or '''GFAs''' is an annual award competition for outstanding American craft food producers and the farmers who provide their ingredients. Created by the [http://goodfoodawards.org   Good Food Foundation] (formerly Seedling Projects), the Good Food Awards celebrate the kind of food we all want to eat: tasty, authentic and responsibly produced. An annual Awards Ceremony and Marketplace is held to honor the Good Food Award recipients who push their industries towards craftsmanship and sustainability while enhancing our agricultural landscape and building strong communities.&lt;ref name=Thelin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thelin|first1=Emily|title=Good Food Awards bestow accolades on those who make the cut|url=http://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Good-Food-Awards-bestow-accolades-on-those-who-5991068.php|website=San Francisco Gate|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucchesi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucchesi|first1=Paolo|title=2015 Good Food Awards winners announced|url=http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2015/01/09/2015-good-food-awards-winners-announced/|website=SF Gate|publisher=San Francisco Gate|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Good Food Awards have been particularly notable in the coffee industry.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Nick|title=The Good Food Awards: How it Works, How to Win, and Coffee ‘Elitism’|url=http://dailycoffeenews.com/2014/01/20/the-good-food-awards-how-it-works-how-to-win-and-coffee-elitism/|website=Daily Coffee News|publisher=Roast Magazine|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2018 Good Food Awards, [[Patric Chocolate]] has won twenty-one awards, more than any other entrant.

==Criteria==
The criteria for the Good Food Awards varies by industry, however basic rules says that entries must be made without GM ingredients, using good animal husbandry and "without the use of artificial ingredients, hormones, synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer " and, most importantly, crafted in the USA.

{{Life in the Philippines}}
'''[[Health care]] in the [[Philippines]]''' varies with private, public and barangay health centers (many in rural municipalities). Most of the national burden of health care is taken up by private health providers.

==Overview==
The Ministry of Health, or the Department of Health, provides national health policies and standards. The provision of health services is overseen by local government units and private sector agencies, both of which are responsible for providing health services to communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sarbani|date=January 2013|title=Philippines' Government Sponsored Health Coverage Program for Poor Households|url=|journal=The World Bank|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health services are brought by barangay health units, rural health units, city health offices, municipal or district hospitals, provincial and regional hospitals, and medical centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grundy|first=J.|last2=Healy|first2=V.|last3=Gorgolon|first3=L.|last4=Sandig|first4=E.|date=July 2003|title=Overview of devolution of health services in the Philippines|journal=Rural and Remote Health|volume=3|issue=2|pages=220|issn=1445-6354|pmid=15877513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the [[Philippines]] had about 95,000 [[physicians]], or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 [[hospitals]], of which about 40 percent were government run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were [[diarrhea]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[hypertension]], [[tuberculosis]], [[heart disease]], [[malaria]], [[chickenpox]], and [[measles]]. [[Cardiovascular diseases]] account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS). Other estimates state that there may have been as many as 9,400 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2001.&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf Philippines country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (March 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Expenditures on health in 2002 totaled about US$2.2 billion, or about 2.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government expenditures on health accounted for only about 15 percent of total health expenditures, 30 percent of per capita health expenditures, and about 0.9 percent of all government spending. Per capita health expenditures in 2002 totaled US$28, of which government spending accounted for $8. Both total and per capita expenditures on health have continued to decline since at least 1990, leading to a decrease in the share of GDP attributable to health expenditures. The main cause of this decline has been the high population growth rate. The government share of total spending on health also has declined steadily, and with more people, there has been less to spend per person from both the government and private sectors.&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

== History ==
The 1991 Republic Act No 1760, or the Local Government Code, gave local health boards the authority over decisions about the delivery of health services and financial management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossert|first=Thomas J.|last2=Beauvais|first2=Joel C.|date=March 2002|title=Decentralization of health systems in Ghana, Zambia, Uganda and the Philippines: a comparative analysis of decision space|journal=Health Policy and Planning|volume=17|issue=1|pages=14–31|issn=0268-1080|pmid=11861583}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the National Health Insurance Act led to the implementation of universal health coverage as it was among the first compulsory health insurance systems in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thind|first=Amardeep|last2=Cruz|first2=Anne Marie|date=October 2003|title=Determinants of children's health services utilization in the Philippines|journal=Journal of Tropical Pediatrics|volume=49|issue=5|pages=269–273|issn=0142-6338|pmid=14604158}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established the [[Philippine Health Insurance Corporation]] as a form of national health insurance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philippines Health System Review|last=|first=|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2011|isbn=9789290615583|location=Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large areas of the Philippines do not have daily access to any pharmaceuticals due to high drug prices. Medicines are supplies account for the largest share of household medical expenses, at 49%, compared to 33% share of bills for hospital stay and 10% for consultation and treatment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Filipino Report Card on Pro-poor Services|last=World Bank|first=|publisher=East Asia and the Pacific Region Report Number 22181 - PH, Environment and Social Development Sector Unit|year=2001|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed National Health Budget for 2010 is P28 billion, about US$597 million, or about 310 pesos (US$7) per person in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2002495&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; Generic medicines in the Philippines are highly competitive versus branded medicines due to the high out of pocket expenses in the Philippines in terms of value even with the 81% coverage of the country's healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e.globis.jp/article/000290.html|title=Abenomics and the Generic Threat|last=Del Rosario|first=King|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors, nurses, nursing aides, midwives, caregivers, and health administrators can all train for their profession in the Philippines.  However, those who migrate to different countries often encounter difficulty practicing outside the Philippines.

===Other===
Some studies have found increased risks of [[dermatitis]] in those exposed.&lt;ref name=CFP07b/&gt;

Additionally, studies have indicated that pesticide exposure is associated with long-term respiratory problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doust|first1=E|last2=Ayres|first2=JG|last3=Devereux|first3=G|last4=Dick|first4=F|last5=Crawford|first5=JO|last6=Cowie|first6=H|last7=Dixon|first7=K|title=Is pesticide exposure a cause of obstructive airways disease?|journal=European Respiratory Review|date=June 2014|volume=23|issue=132|pages=180–92|pmid=24881073|doi=10.1183/09059180.00005113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summaries of peer-reviewed research have examined the link between pesticide exposure and neurologic outcomes and [[cancer]], perhaps the two most significant things resulting in organophosphate-exposed workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alavanja MC, Hoppin JA, Kamel F |title=Health effects of chronic pesticide exposure: cancer and neurotoxicity |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=25 |issue= |pages=155–97 |year=2004 |pmid=15015917 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kamel F, Hoppin JA |title=Association of pesticide exposure with neurologic dysfunction and disease |journal=Environ.

According to researchers from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), licensed pesticide applicators who used chlorinated pesticides on more than 100 days in their lifetime were at greater risk of [[diabetes]]. One study found that associations between specific pesticides and incident diabetes ranged from a 20 percent to a 200 percent increase in risk. New cases of diabetes were reported by 3.4 percent of those in the lowest pesticide use category compared with 4.6 percent of those in the highest category. Risks were greater when users of specific pesticides were compared with applicators who never applied that chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montgomery MP, Kamel F, Saldana TM, Alavanja MC, Sandler DP |title=Incident diabetes and pesticide exposure among licensed pesticide applicators: Agricultural Health Study, 1993–2003 |journal=Am J Epidemiol  |volume=167 |issue=10 |pages=235–46. |date=May 2008 |pmid=18343878 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwn028 |pmc=2832308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541427/ Newswise: Long-term Pesticide Exposure May Increase Risk of Diabetes] Retrieved on June 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route of exposure==
People can be exposed to pesticides by a number of different routes including: occupation, in the home, at school and in their food.

There are concerns that pesticides used to control pests on food crops are dangerous to people who consume those foods. These concerns are one reason for the [[organic food]] movement. Many food crops, including fruits and vegetables, contain [[pesticide residue]]s after being washed or peeled. Chemicals that are no longer used but that are resistant to breakdown for long periods may remain in soil and water and thus in food.&lt;ref name=cornellvet&gt;Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine (March 1999), [http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/FactSheet/Pesticide/fs24.consumer.cfm Consumer concerns about pesticides in food]. Fact Sheet #24. Retrieved on 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission has recommended international standards for [[maximum residue limit]]s (MRLs), for individual pesticides in food.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Alimentarius Commission [http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/1/CXP_020e.pdf Code of Ethics for International Trade in Food]. CAC/RCP 20-1979 (Rev. 1-1985). Retrieved on 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, [[Maximum Residue Limit|MRLs]] are set by [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/index_en.htm DG-SANCO].

In the United States, levels of residues that remain on foods are limited to tolerance levels that are established by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and are considered safe.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (March 27, 2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm Pesticides and food: What the pesticide residue limits are on food]. epa.gov. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA sets the tolerances based on the toxicity of the pesticide and its breakdown products, the amount and frequency of [[pesticide application]], and how much of the pesticide (i.e., the residue) remains in or on food by the time it is marketed and prepared.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (July 24, 2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/stprf.htm Setting tolerances for pesticide residues in foods]. epa.gov. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerance levels are obtained using scientific risk assessments that pesticide manufacturers are required to produce by conducting toxicological studies, exposure modeling and residue studies before a particular pesticide can be registered, however, the effects are tested for single pesticides, and there is little information on possible [[synergistic]] effects of exposure to multiple pesticide traces in the air, food and water.&lt;ref&gt;Rabideau, Christine L.

Strawberries and tomatoes are the two crops with the most intensive use of soil fumigants. They are particularly vulnerable to several type of diseases, insects, mites, and parasitic worms. In 2003, in California alone, 3.7 million pounds (1,700 metric tons) of [[metham sodium]] were used on tomatoes. In recent years other farmers have demonstrated that it is possible to produce strawberries and tomatoes without the use of harmful chemicals and in a cost-effective way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Levine, Marvin J. | title=Pesticides: A Toxic Time Bomb in our Midst | publisher=Praeger Publishers | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-275-99127-2 | pages=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure routes other than consuming food that contains residues, in particular [[pesticide drift]], are potentially significant to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (December 1999), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/spraydrift.htm Spray drift of pesticides]. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pesticides can remain in the environment for prolonged periods of time. For example, most people in the United States still have detectable levels of DDT in their bodies even though it was banned in the US in 1972.&lt;ref name=Gilden-risks/&gt;

==Prevention==
Pesticides exposure cannot be studied in [[placebo controlled trials]] as this would be unethical.&lt;ref name=CFP07b/&gt; A definitive cause effect relationship therefore cannot be established.&lt;ref name=CFP07b/&gt; Consistent evidence can and has been gathered through other study designs.&lt;ref name=CFP07b/&gt; The [[precautionary principle]] is thus frequently used in [[environmental law]] such that absolute proof is not required before efforts to decrease exposure to potential toxins are enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lockwood AH |title=Pesticides and parkinsonism: is there an etiological link? |journal=Curr.

The [[American Medical Association]] recommend limiting exposure to pesticides.&lt;ref name=Council1997/&gt; They came to this conclusion due to the fact that surveillance systems currently in place are inadequate to determine problems related to exposure.&lt;ref name=Council1997&gt;{{cite journal |title=Educational and informational strategies to reduce pesticide risks.

==Epidemiology==
The [[World Health Organization]] and the [[UN Environment Programme]] estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe [[Pesticide poisoning|poisoning from pesticides]], about 18,000 of whom die.&lt;ref name="sustaining"&gt;Miller GT (2004), ''Sustaining the Earth'', 6th edition.

==Public Health Measures==

In 2016 [[Hunbisco]] produced a critical report on the implementation of the sugar tax which was introduced in Hungary in 2011.  It reported that the consumption of products subject to the sugar tax had decreased.  They argued that manufacturers now have a smaller budget to explore healthier alternatives to sugar. Innovation and new marketing initiatives have reduced since 2011. The effect of the health tax, in addition to 27% VAT, increases the price of products by as much as 40%, and has led to redundancies.  They say that the consumption of other products not subject to the tax but with similar nutritional contents, like popcorn, has not dropped.  The advocate abolition of the tax in favour of educational measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Better health but side effects persist|url=http://budapesttimes.hu/2016/02/21/better-health-but-side-effects-persist/|accessdate=21 February 2016|publisher=Budapest Times|date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

62,979 deaths (49.4% of all) in Hungary were caused by [[cardiovascular disease]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="KSH"/&gt; Number of cardiovascular disease deaths peaked in 1985 with 79,355, declining continuously since the fall of Communism.&lt;ref name="KSH"/&gt; The second most important cause of death was [[cancer]] with 33,274 (26.2% of all), stagnating since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="KSH"/&gt; Number of [[accident]] deaths dropped from 8,760 in 1990 to 3,654 in 2013, number of [[suicide]]s from 4,911 in 1983 to 2,093 (21.1 per 100,000 people) in 2013 (the lowest data registered since 1956).&lt;ref name="KSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dev"/&gt; According to [[Péter Polt]], [[Chief Prosecutor of Hungary]], there were only 133 [[homicide]]s in 2012, which is the lowest number registered in the last 50 years in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/itthon/20130210_polt_peter_emberoles_statisztika Polt Péter: rég volt ilyen alacsony itthon a gyilkosságok száma ("Péter Polt: number of homicides is the lowest for a long time"), HVG (Hungarian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Homicide rate was 1.3 per 100,000 people, which is [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|among the lowest in the World]].

===Major health issues===
Despite recent improvements, [[alcoholism]] is still a major problem in Hungary, inherited from the [[People's Republic of Hungary|Socialist era]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oefi.hu/szerhasznalat_2006_4.pdf Judit Kiss - Edina Gábor: Az alkoholfogyasztás hazai tendenciái a 80-as évektől napjainkig I.

===Regional differences===
According to the last ''Országos Lakossági Egészségfelmérés'' ("National Population Health Survey") held in 2003 the most healthy [[Regions of Hungary|region]] is [[Western Transdanubia]] and the least is the [[Southern Great Plain]]. There are huge differences between the western and eastern parts of Hungary, [[heart disease]], [[hypertension]], [[stroke]] and [[suicide]] is prevalent in the mostly [[agricultural]] and low-income characteristic [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] (can be described as the Hungarian [[Stroke Belt]]), but infrequent in the high-income and [[middle class]] characteristic [[Western Transdanubia]]. [[Central Hungary]] (region of [[Budapest]]) is between east and west by health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oefi.hu/olef/OLEF2003/Jelentesek/KronikusBbetegsegekOLEF2003.pdf Országos Lakossági Egészségfelmérés ("National Population Health Survey"), 2003, Dr. Dóra Hermann: Krónikus betegségek (Chronic illnesses)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams, Chongjun Yan, Jiajie Zhang, Yuan-Ting Zhang. “Healthcare Engineering Defined – a White Paper”, Journal of Healthcare Engineering, Vol. 6, No. 4, Page 635–648, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The term “engineering” in this definition covers all engineering disciplines such as Biomedical, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, Industrial, Information, Materials, Mechanical, Software, and Systems Engineering. Based on the definition of "healthcare", a more elaborated definition of '''Healthcare Engineering''' is the following:''“Healthcare Engineering is engineering involved in all aspects of the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of illness, as well as the preservation and improvement of physical and mental health and well-being, through the services offered to humans by the medical and allied health professions”''.&lt;ref name="Chyu" /&gt;

==Overview==

Almost all engineering disciplines (e.g., Biomedical, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, Industrial, Information, Materials, Mechanical, Software, and Systems Engineering) have made significant contributions and brought about advances in healthcare. Contributions have also been made by healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, and health scientists) who are engaged in supporting, improving, and/or advancing healthcare through engineering approaches.  Healthcare Engineering is a multi-disciplinary specialty that focuses on advancing healthcare through engineering approaches involving both healthcare and engineering professionals. 
Healthcare Engineering is expected to play a role of growing importance as healthcare continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries &lt;ref&gt;Janz BD., Pitts MG, and Otondo RF.

As the demand for engineers continues to increase in healthcare, Healthcare Engineering will be recognized as the most important profession where engineers make major contributions directly benefiting human health.

==History==

The American Society of Healthcare Engineering (ASHE),&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Healthcare Engineering. http://www.ashe.org/. Accessed July 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; established in the 1960s, was one of the first to publicize the term “Healthcare Engineering”. ASHE, as well as its many local affiliate societies, is devoted to the health care physical environment, including design, building, maintenance, and operation of hospitals and other health care facilities, which represents only one sector of engineers’ activities in healthcare.  The term “healthcare engineers” first appeared in the scientific literature in 1989, where the critical role of engineers in the healthcare delivery system was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;David Y, Goodman G.

The first scholarly journal dedicated to Healthcare Engineering, Journal of Healthcare Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Healthcare Engineering, Multi-Science Publishing, UK. http://www.multi-science.co.uk/jhe.htm. Accessed December 31, 2015. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/.  Accessed January 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010 by Dr. Ming-Chien Chyu, focusing on engineering involved in all aspects of healthcare delivery processes and systems.  In the meantime, a number of companies with various foci have adopted “Healthcare Engineering” in their names.

Healthcare Engineering was first defined in a white paper &lt;ref name="Chyu" /&gt; published in 2015 by Dr. Chyu and 40 co-authors who are active members of and contributors to the Healthcare Engineering community all over the world. The white paper was reviewed by more than 280 reviewers, including members of US National Academy of Engineering, Engineering Deans of the world’s top universities, administrators and faculty members of Healthcare Engineering academic programs, leaders of healthcare/medical and engineering professional societies/associations, leaders of healthcare industry and government, and Healthcare Engineering professionals from all over the world.  This white paper documents a clear, rigorous definition of Healthcare Engineering as an academic discipline, an area of research, a field of specialty, and a profession, and is expected to raise the status and visibility of Healthcare Engineering, help students choose Healthcare Engineering-related fields as majors, help engineers and healthcare professionals choose Healthcare Engineering as a profession, define Healthcare Engineering as a specialty area for the research community, funding agencies, and conference/event organizers, help job searching databases properly categorize Healthcare Engineering jobs, help healthcare employers recruit from the right pool of expertise, bring academic administrators’ attention to Healthcare Engineering in considering new program initiations, help governments and institutions of different levels put Healthcare Engineering into perspective for policy making, budgeting, and other purposes, and help publishers and librarians categorize literature related to Healthcare Engineering. Based on this white paper, a global, non-profit professional organization, Healthcare Engineering Alliance Society (HEALS), was founded by Dr. Chyu in 2015, that focuses on improving and advancing all aspects of healthcare through engineering approaches.

==Purpose==

The purpose of Healthcare Engineering is to improve human health and well-being through engineering approaches.

==Education &amp; Training==

Engineers from almost all engineering disciplines (such as Biomedical, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, Industrial, Information, Materials, Mechanical, Software, and Systems Engineering) are always in demand in healthcare. It is a common misconception that only engineers with a background in Biomedical Engineering, Clinical Engineering, or related areas may work in healthcare.  However, there is a need for courses and certificate type of programs that prepare non-biomedical engineering students and practicing engineers for service in healthcare.  On the other hand, healthcare professionals (physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, etc.) may benefit from training to apply engineering to their practice, problem solving, and advancing healthcare.  Due to the rapid advance of technology, continuing education plays a crucial role in ensuring Healthcare Engineering professionals’ continued competence.

The '''Honduran Red Cross''' is a non-profit institution of social and voluntary interest that provides help to at-risk populations and those affected by disasters. It is part of the international organization [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross and Half Moon Red Crescent]], which seeks to alleviate human suffering according to each particular situation.

== Founding and history ==
The Honduran Red Cross was developed in 1924 during the [[History of Honduras (1838–1932)#The threat of renewed instability .281919.E2.80.9324.29|second civil war]]. During the conflict, a group of people organized to tend to those who had been injured at the site of [[Tegucigalpa]] by rebels, following the example set by [[Henry Dunant]] during the [[World War I|first world war]]. This group of volunteers, which included Carlos Rivas, Delia Becerra, Emma Bonilla, Ernesto López Alleys, Hernán López Alleys, Isolina Guilbert, Luz Becerra, Marine Stair, Marieta Guilbert, Otilia Idiáquez, Roberto Rivas, Soledad Lozano, among others, became the first to carry the symbol of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] in Honduras, albeit without a concrete leader. Later, in 1932, [[Tiburcio Carías Andino|Tiburcio Carias Andino]] created a national aid committee, designating civil engineer Abraham Williams Caldéron as its president. Williams Caldéron, along with Dr. Enrique Douglas Guilbert, an active member of [[Rotary International]], decided to devise the founding of the Red Cross in Honduras. Thus, on 22 August 1934, the first board of directors was elected in a Honduran casino, which was as follows:

* President Manuel Larios Córdover, president of the Honduran Medical Association.
* First vice president Nicolás Cornelsen.
* Second vice president Abraham Williams Caldéron, engineer and general.
* Vice president of the republic and minister of governing, justice, health, and welfare, Dr. Francisco Sánchez Urbina.
* Secretary Ricardo Diego Alduvin, director of the hospital and dean of the faculty of medicine.
* Treasurer Donato Diaz Medina, leader of the bank of Honduras.
* Salvador Paredes.

In 1937, a group of women organized and sponsored the first group of Honduran aid workers; however, they were not yet defined as the Honduran Red Cross. Focused on their requests to the government to obtain a legal status, they  developed activities to benefit the Honduran society. On September 4 of the same year, the president, doctor and general [[Tiburcio Carías Andino|Tiburcio Carias Andino]], in a meeting at the Presidential House of Honduras, granted a well deserved legal recognition to the group, organizing a board of directors. Original members included Adolfina Mejía, Berta García de Saenz Rico, Elia Pineda de Fortín, Ernestina de Landa, Enriqueta Girón de Lázarus, Dr. Guillermo Durón, Dr. Hernán López Alleys, lawyer Héctor Pineda Ugarte, Dr. Humberto Díaz Banegas, Isabel Siqueiros de Pinel, Isolina Lozano de Guilbert, Josefina Mejía, lawyer Jorge Fidel Durón, Dr. Juan A. Mejía, Dr. Manuel Cáceres Vijil, Dr. and future president [[Ramón Villeda Morales|Ramón Villeda Moral]], and lawyer Rubén Álvarez Channels.. By means of Decree No. 475 issued on 6 October 1937, the institution was known officially as the ''Honduran Red Cross''''',''' with the intended function of engaging in humanitarian action in the national territory. In 1941, Lázarus Henrietta, serving as president of the Honduran Red Cross, requested the National Congress of Honduras to issue a law establishing income for the organization. It was issued as the "law of the income of the seal of the Red Cross", so that the organization would receive finances in order to sustain themselves independently and continue providing social services. The economic funds received by the organization would help the organization to sustain itself independently and continue providing social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0827010664}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1937, the original group of volunteers from 1924 were recognized for the first time.

In 1942, the first units were established in  [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Puerto Cortés]], [[Tela]], and [[La Ceiba]]. These units were authorized to retain 40% of donations collected by donors and benefactors and sending the other 60% to the central committee. In the same year, the Infant Consul was founded, with the goal of providing help and support to Honduran children.

In 1950, the organization received its first [[ambulance]], a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] model.

In 1954, the then president of Honduras, Dr. [[Juan Manuel Gálvez]] donated land for the construction of the official headquarters.

In 1978, the official statutes of the Honduran Red Cross were published.

The Honduran Red Cross has had a major impact in several Honduran events, such as the third civil war of 1931, the events of 1954, the [[Football War|War of the Football]] of 1969. Together with [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|ACNUR]] and [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]], they have backed the mobilisation of civilians in the border zones with [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]], as in the natural disasters caused by the [[Hurricane Fifi–Orlene|Hurricane Fifi-Orlene]] of 1971 and [[Hurricane Mitch]], which devastated the north zone and central office of the Central American country in 1998.

== Presidents ==
Former presidents of the Central Committee of the Honduran Red Cross: 
* Enriqueta Girón de Lázarus.
* Cleto Ramón Alvarez.
* Meneca Of Mencía.

=== Paramedics ===
The body of paramedics, staffed by volunteers, receives a basic course in first aid, basic emergency aid, building rescue, mountains aid, rivers aid, etc.

They also receive intensive training in infant nursing, in addition to cardiovascular and pulmonary resuscitation, minor surgeries, dealing with infections, and so on.

=== Regional headquarters ===
The central headquarters of the Honduran Red Cross is in the Concepción neighborhood, 7th street, 1st and 2nd avenue, of [[Tegucigalpa]], M.D.C.

The expansion of the regional headquarters led to the expansion of the red cross into many major Honduran cities, such as: [[Comayagua]], [[Danlí, El Paraíso|Danlí]], [[La Ceiba|The Ceiba]], [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]], [[Santa Bárbara, Honduras|Santa Bárbara]], [[Juticalpa, Olancho|Juticalpa]], [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Santa Rosa de Copán]], and [[Yuscarán]].

== Red Cross Youth Honduras ==
Red Cross Youth Honduras is an auxiliary program of Honduran Red Cross founded on 17 June 1964. It is composed of volunteers aged 6 and up, organized as follows: 6 -12 year old are brigaders; 12–30 year old are juvenile; 30-up are advisors.

Offices of the CRJH (''Cruz Roja Juventud Honduras'') are in in Francisco Morazán, Comayagua, Choluteca, Valley, Olancho, El Paraiso, Cortes, Santa Bárbara, Atlántida, Colón, Intibucá, Yoro and Copán.

{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[criminal law]], '''irresistible impulse''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] by [[excuse]], in this case some sort of [[insanity defense|insanity]], in which the defendant argues that they should not be held [[crime|criminally]] [[Legal liability|liable]] for their [[action (philosophy)|action]]s that broke the [[law]], because they could not control those actions, even if they knew them to be wrong.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|632}} It was added to the [[M'Naghten rule]] as a basis for [[acquittal]] in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|632}} 

In 1994, [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]] was found not guilty when her defense argued that an irresistible impulse led her to cut off her [[Marriage|husband]]'s [[penis]].

The ''[[California Penal Code|Penal Code]]'' of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] states (2002), "The defense of diminished capacity is hereby abolished ... there shall be no defense of ... [[diminished responsibility]] or irresistible impulse..."

The ''policeman at the elbow'' test is a test used by some [[court]]s to determine whether the defendant was [[insanity|insane]] when they committed a crime. It is a variant of the [[M'Naghten Rules]] that addresses the situation in which the defendant knew that what they were going to do was wrong, but had no ability to restrain themself from doing it. The test asks whether they would have done what they did even if a [[police officer]] was standing at their [[elbow]], hence its name.

==Irresistible impulse in English Law==
In [[English Law]] the concept of "irresistible impulse" was developed in the 1960 case R v. Byrne. The appellant (described as a violent sexual psychopath) strangled then mutilated a young woman, it was alleged that Byrne suffered from violent and perverted sexual desires which he found impossible to control. [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker C.J.]] broadened the definition of "abnormality of mind" to include those lacking "the ability to exercise will-power to control acts in accordance with [their] rational judgment".

"Irresistible impulse" can be pleaded only under the defense of [[diminished responsibility]], not under the defense of insanity. Thus it operates only as a [[partial defence]] to murder,&lt;ref&gt;[[Murder in English law#Partial defences]]&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the charge to manslaughter, and giving the judge discretion as to length of sentence and whether [[committal]] would be more appropriate than incarceration.

The '''Isles of Scilly''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|i}}; {{lang-kw|Syllan}} or ''{{lang|kw|Enesek Syllan}}'') is an [[archipelago]] off the southwestern tip of [[Cornwall]]. One of the islands, [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]], is the most southerly point in both [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]], being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[Great Britain|British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].

The population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Cornwall]], and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had [[Council of the Isles of Scilly|a separate local authority]]. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a [[county council]] and today is known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly.

The adjective "Scillonian" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture—particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] (''Tin Isles'') visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much tin.

It is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400–500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as "land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation".&lt;ref&gt;'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L. Bowley&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''{{lang|kw|Ennor}}'' is a contraction of the Old Cornish&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.scillyarchive.com/page/scillonian_dictionary.html Scillonian Dictionary. Accessed 23 December 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|kw|En Noer}}'' (''{{lang|kw|Moer}}'', mutated to ''{{lang|kw|Noer}}''), meaning 'the land'&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; or the 'great island'.&lt;ref&gt;'The Drowned Landscape' by Charles Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the older large island includes:
* A description written during Roman times designates Scilly "{{lang|la|Scillonia insula}}" in the [[grammatical number|singular]], indicating either a single island or an island much bigger than any of the others.
* Remains of a prehistoric farm have been found on [[Nornour]], which is now a small rocky [[skerry]] far too small for farming.&lt;ref name="Thorgrim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dudley, Dorothy. "Excavations on Nor'Nour in the Isles of Scilly, 1962–6", in ''The Archaeological Journal'', CXXIV, 1967 (includes the description of over 250 Roman fibulae found at the site)&lt;/ref&gt; There once was an [[Iron Age Britain]] community here that extended into Roman times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This community was likely formed by immigrants from Brittany, probably the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] who were active in the tin trade that originated in [[mining in Cornwall and Devon|mining activity in Cornwall and Devon]].
* At certain low tides the sea becomes shallow enough for people to walk between some of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scillytoday.com/2013/08/22/scillys-unique-inter-island-walk-sets-off-this-morning/ |title=Scilly’s Unique Inter Island Walk Sets Off This Morning |work=Scilly Today |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possibly one of the sources for stories of drowned lands, e.g. [[Lyonesse]].
* Ancient field walls are visible below the high tide line off some of the islands (e.g. [[Samson, Isles of Scilly|Samson]]).
* Some of the [[Cornish language]] place names also appear to reflect past shorelines, and former land areas.&lt;ref name="Weatherhill"&gt;Weatherhill, Craig (2007) ''Cornish Placenames and Language''. Wilmslow: Sigma Leisure&lt;/ref&gt;
* The whole of [[southern England]] has been steadily sinking in opposition to [[post-glacial rebound]] in Scotland: this has caused the [[ria]]s (drowned river valleys) on the southern Cornish coast, e.g. [[River Fal]] and the [[River Tamar|Tamar Estuary]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Offshore, midway between [[Land's End]] and the Isles of Scilly, is the supposed location of the mythical lost land of [[Lyonesse]], referred to in [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] literature, of which [[Tristan and Isolde|Tristan]] is said to have been a prince. This may be a [[folk memory]] of inundated lands, but this legend is also common among the [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] peoples; the legend of [[Ys]] is a parallel and cognate legend in [[Brittany]] as is that of {{lang|cy|[[Cantre'r Gwaelod]]}} in [[Wales]].

Scilly has been identified as the place of exile of two heretical 4th century bishops, Instantius and Tiberianus, who were followers of [[Priscillian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Priscillianus%20and%20Priscillianism,%20Priscillian |title=Priscillianus and Priscillianism |work=Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of Sixth Century |accessdate=11 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse and Norman period===

[[File:Peter nicolai arbo, olaf tryggvasson king.jpg|thumb|[[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]], who visited the islands in 986. It is said an encounter with a cleric there led him to Christianise [[Norway]].]]
[[File:EmpireNorth.JPG|thumb|At the time of [[Cnut the Great|King Cnut]], the Isles of Scilly fell outside [[Kingdom of England|England's rule]], as did Cornwall and Wales.]]

In 995, [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]] became King Olaf I of [[Norway]]. Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he (supposedly) met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably [[Priscillian]] and a part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]] and their part in the Priscilline heresy. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.

With the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the "[[Exeter]] Domesday" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].

In the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,&lt;ref name="OrkSaga"&gt;Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by Jón A. Hjaltalin &amp; Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''— [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] "went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it."&lt;ref name=OrkSaga /&gt; (Chap LXXIII)

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the three chiefs—Swein, Þorbjörn and Eirik—went out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Suðreyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Maríuhöfn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.&lt;ref name=OrkSaga /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"{{lang|non|Maríuhöfn}}" literally means "Mary's Harbour/Haven". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.

It is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[Æthelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924–939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100–35) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===

[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]
[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]
At the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,
&lt;blockquote&gt;stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&amp;queryType=1&amp;resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock. Addressees: King and council. |accessdate=2014-11-25 |publisher=The National Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William le Poer, coroner of Scilly, is recorded in 1305 as being worried about the [[list of shipwrecks of the Isles of Scilly|extent of wrecking in the islands]], and sending a petition to the King. The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).

It is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].

During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the  absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June. It was during this period that the [[Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years' War]] started between the isles and the [[Netherlands]].

In June 1651, [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Admiral Robert Blake]] recaptured the isles for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]—a gun platform on the west side of Tresco—using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]].

During the night of 22 October 1707, the isles were the scene of [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707|one of the worst maritime disasters]] in British history, when out of a fleet of 21 Royal Navy ships headed from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Portsmouth]], six were driven onto the cliffs. Four of the ships sank or capsized, with at least 1,450 dead, including the commanding [[admiral]] Sir [[Cloudesley Shovell]].

There is evidence for inundation by the tsunami caused by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Banerjee et al. 2001."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=D. |title=Scilly Isles, UK: optical dating of a possible tsunami deposit from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |date=1 December 2001 |volume=20 |issue=5–9 |pages=715–718 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379100000421 |accessdate=30 March 2015 |doi=10.1016/s0277-3791(00)00042-1|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2001QSRv...20..715B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands appear to have been raided frequently by [[Barbary pirate]]s to enslave residents to support the [[Barbary slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml History - British History in depth: British Slaves on the Barbary Coast].

==Governors of Scilly==

{{main|List of Governors of Scilly}}
An early governor of Scilly was [[Thomas Godolphin]], whose son [[Francis Godolphin (1540–1608)|Francis]] received a lease on the Isles in 1568. They were styled ''Governors of Scilly'' and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus John Smith]] acquired the lease from the Duchy for £20,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Smith created the title ''Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly'' for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall. Today, the Dorrien-Smith estate still holds the lease for the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]].

==Geography==
[[File:Scilly Isles Locator Map.png|thumb|Location of the Isles of Scilly (circled)]]
[[File:Scilly wards parishes.png|thumb|The five [[wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards]] (which are also the [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]]) of the Isles of Scilly; red is St Agnes, blue is Bryher, orange is Tresco, green is St Martin's, and grey is St Mary's.]]
The Isles of Scilly form an archipelago of five inhabited islands (six if [[Gugh]] is counted separately from St Agnes) and numerous other small rocky [[islet]]s (around 140 in total) lying {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} off [[Land's End]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|page=340|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands' position produces a place of great contrast; the ameliorating effect of the sea, greatly influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current]], means they rarely have frost or snow, which allows local farmers to grow flowers well ahead of those in mainland Britain. The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time. This is reflected in the landscape, most clearly seen on Tresco where the lush [[Tresco Abbey Gardens|Abbey Gardens]] on the sheltered southern end of the island contrast with the low [[calluna|heather]] and bare rock sculpted by the wind on the exposed northern end.

[[Natural England]] has designated the Isles of Scilly as [[National Character Area]] 158.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/158_Isles_of_scilly_tcm6-32162.pdf ''NCA 158: Isles of Scilly Key Facts &amp; Data''] at www.naturalengland.org.uk. Accessed on 8 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a 2002 marketing campaign, the plant conservation charity [[Plantlife]] chose sea thrift (''[[Armeria maritima]]'') as the "[[floral emblem|county flower]]" of the islands.&lt;ref name="Thorgrim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=7614 |title=Nornour |last=Thorgrim |accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thrift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers-england-islesofscilly.htm |title=County flower of Isles of Scilly |publisher=Plantlife International&amp;nbsp;– The Wild Plant Conservation Charity |accessdate=7 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318142059/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers-england-islesofscilly.htm |archivedate=18 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;(1) &lt;/sup&gt; Inhabited until 1855.

In 1975 the islands were designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a "''teak''" or "''teke''".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, H.W. (1925) ''A New British Animal Discovered in Scilly''. Scillonian 4: 123-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.

===Tidal influx===
The tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St Martin's (requires very low tides). From St Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From Saint Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].

The Isles of Scilly has a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Cfb), and has one of the mildest climates in the United Kingdom. The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|°C|1|abbr=on}} in comparison to London, where it is {{convert|11.6|°C|1|abbr=on}}. Winters are among the warmest in the country due to the moderating effects of the ocean, and despite being on exactly the same latitude as [[Winnipeg]] in Canada, snow and frost are extremely rare. Summers are not as warm as on the mainland. The Scilly Isles are one of the sunniest areas in the southwest with on average 7 hours per day in May. The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-7.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} and the highest was {{convert|27.8|°C|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|title=Extreme Temperatures Around the World- world highest lowest recorded temperatures|publisher=mherrera.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf Met Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |date=24 May 2014 }} ''Fact Sheet - South West England'' page 17&lt;/ref&gt; It has never recorded a temperature below freezing between May and November.

===Local government===

{{See also|Council of the Isles of Scilly}}

Historically, the Isles of Scilly were administered as one of the [[hundreds of Cornwall]], although the Cornwall [[quarter sessions]] had limited jurisdiction there. For judicial purposes, [[High Sheriff|shrievalty]] purposes, and [[Lord Lieutenant|lieutenancy]] purposes, the Isles of Scilly are "deemed to form part of the county of Cornwall".&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act 1972 (1972 c.70) section 216(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago is part of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]&lt;ref name=duchysite&gt;{{cite web |title=Around the Duchy – Isles of Scilly |url=http://www.duchyofcornwall.org/aroundtheduchy_islesofscilly.htm |publisher=Duchy of Cornwall |accessdate=5 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225050839/http://www.duchyofcornwall.org/aroundtheduchy_islesofscilly.htm |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – the duchy owns the freehold of most of the land on the islands and the duke exercises certain formal rights and privileges across the territory, as he does in Cornwall proper.

The [[Local Government Act 1888]] allowed the [[Local Government Board]] to establish in the Isles of Scilly "councils and other local authorities separate from those of the county of Cornwall"... "for the application to the islands of any act touching local government." Accordingly, in 1890 the ''Isles of Scilly Rural District Council'' (the RDC) was formed as a ''[[sui generis]]'' [[Unitary Authority|unitary authority]], outside the [[administrative county]] of Cornwall. Cornwall County Council provided some services to the Isles, for which the RDC made financial contributions. The Isles of Scilly Order 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksro/1930/216/pdfs/uksro_19300216_en.pdf |title=Isles of Scilly Order 1930 |format=PDF |publisher=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; granted the Council the "powers, duties and liabilities" of a [[county council]]. Section 265 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]] allowed for the continued existence of the RDC, but renamed as the ''Council of the Isles of Scilly''.&lt;ref name=iosuatt&gt;{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly Cornwall through time |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10076742&amp;c_id=10171878 |publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk |accessdate=19 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iosrdtt&gt;{{cite web|title=Isles of Scilly RD Cornwall through time |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10026210&amp;c_id=10001043 |publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk |accessdate=19 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506230150/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10026210&amp;c_id=10001043 |archivedate= 6 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unusual status also means that much administrative law (for example relating to the functions of local authorities, the health service and other public bodies) that applies in the rest of England applies in modified form in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030043_en_15#pt6-l1g198 Health and Social Care Act 2003, section 198] and the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/ukpga_19950025_en_14#pt5-pb13-l1g114 Environment Act 1995, section 117].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of the Isles of Scilly is a separate authority to the [[Cornwall Council]] unitary authority, and as such the islands are not part of the administrative county of Cornwall. However the islands are still considered to be part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall.

With a total population of just over 2,000, the council represents fewer inhabitants than many English [[parish councils in England|parish councils]], and is by far the smallest English unitary council. {{As of|2015}}, 130 people are employed [[full-time equivalent|full-time]] by the council&lt;ref&gt;Leijser, Theo (2015) ''Scilly Now &amp; Then'' no. 77 p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; to provide local services (including water supply and [[air traffic control]]). These numbers are significant, in that almost 10% of the adult population of the islands is directly linked to the council, as an employee or a councillor.&lt;ref name=acca2002&gt;{{cite web |title=Council of the Isles of Scilly Corporate Assessment December 2002 |publisher=[[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] |format=PDF |url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Products/CPA-CORP-ASSESS-REPORT/5B3C6E84-EA60-4359-A9F5-4A0FC538812D/IslesofScillyCARpt.pdf |accessdate=21 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council consists of 21 elected councillors — 13 of whom are returned by the [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|ward]] of St Mary's, and two from each of four "off-island" wards (St Martin's, St Agnes, Bryher, and Tresco). The [[Isles of Scilly Council election, 2013|latest elections]] took place on 2 May 2013; all 20 elected were [[Independent (politician)|independents]] (one seat remained vacant).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scilly.gov.uk/council-democracy/elections Council of the Isles of Scilly] Elections&lt;/ref&gt;

The council is headquartered at Town Hall, by The Parade park in [[Hugh Town]], and also performs the administrative functions of the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|AONB]] Partnership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ios-aonb.info |title=Welcome to the Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) |work=Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scillyifca.gov.uk |title=Welcome to the Isles of Scilly Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority |work=Isles of Scilly IFCA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of local government are shared with Cornwall, including [[Healthcare in Cornwall|health]], and the Council of the Isles of Scilly together with [[Cornwall Council]] form a [[Local Enterprise Partnership]]. In July 2015 a [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] deal was announced by the [[Second Cameron ministry|government]] under which Cornwall Council and the Council of the Isles of Scilly are to create a plan to bring health and social care services together under local control. The Local Enterprise Partnership is also to be bolstered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cornwall devolution: First county with new powers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-33542592 |accessdate=27 August 2015 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flags===
[[File:St Mary's Church, Hugh Town.JPG|thumb|The Scillonian Cross flying above [[St Mary's Church, St Mary's|St Mary's Church]] in Hugh Town.]]
Two flags are used to represent Scilly:
* The Scillonian Cross, selected by readers of ''Scilly News'' in a 2002 vote and then registered with the [[Flag Institute]] as the flag of the islands.&lt;ref name="bofflag"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sccross&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scillyarchive.com/2003/04/how_do_you_get_a_scillonian_cross.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411190218/http://news.scillyarchive.com/2003/04/how_do_you_get_a_scillonian_cross.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 April 2013|title=How Do You Get A Scillonian Cross|publisher=Scilly Archive|accessdate=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flaginstitute"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/flags/islesofscilly/|title=Isles of Scilly - The Flag Institute|publisher=The Flag Institute|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adapted version of the old Board of Ordnance flag has also been used, after it was left behind when munitions were removed from the isles. The "Cornish Ensign" (the Cornish cross with the Union Jack in the canton) has also been used.&lt;ref name="bofflag" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cornens&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-corn.html |title=Cornwall (United Kingdom) |publisher=fotw.net |accessdate=16 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117170419/http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-corn.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency services===
The Isles of Scilly form part of the [[Devon and Cornwall Police]] force area. There is a police station in [[Hugh Town]].

The [[Cornwall Air Ambulance]] helicopter provides cover to the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scillytoday.com/2015/06/11/busy-week-for-cornwall-air-ambulance Busy week for Cornwall Air Ambulance] ''Scilly Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands have their own independent fire brigade – the [[Isles of Scilly Fire and Rescue Service]] – which is staffed entirely by retained firefighters on all the inhabited islands.

==Education==
{{Main article|List of schools on the Isles of Scilly}}
Education is available on the islands up to age 16. There is one school, the [[Five Islands School]], which provides primary schooling at sites on St Agnes, St Mary's, St Martin's and Tresco, and secondary schooling at a site on St Mary's. Secondary students from outside St Mary's live at a school boarding house (Mundesley House) during the week. In 2004, 92.9% of pupils (26 out of 28) achieved five or more [[GCSE]]s at grade C and above, compared to the English average of 53.7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/cgi-bin/performancetables/dfe1x2_04.pl?Mode=Z&amp;No=420&amp;Base=b&amp;X=1&amp;Type= School and College Achievement and Attainment Tables 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614020409/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/cgi-bin/performancetables/dfe1x2_04.pl?Mode=Z&amp;No=420&amp;Base=b&amp;X=1&amp;Type= |date=14 June 2008 }} Department for Education and Skills; retrieved 31 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen- to eighteen-year-olds are entitled to a free [[sixth form]] place at a state school or sixth form college on the mainland, and are provided with free flights and a grant towards accommodation. Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.

==Economy==

===Historical context===
Since the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="partnership"&gt;''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001–2004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]
Today, tourism is estimated to account for 85% of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.&lt;ref name="council"&gt;''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="touristboard"&gt;''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.

The islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. “The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out.”&lt;ref name="partnership" /&gt;

Tourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] ("birders") arrive.

====Ornithology====
Because of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.

Scilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called "[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]".

The islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].

===Employment===
The predominance of tourism means that "tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom”. Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.&lt;ref name="partnership" /&gt;

Businesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.&lt;ref name="partnership" /&gt; However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.&lt;ref&gt;J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs ‘out of season’ to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a ‘[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]’.

===Taxation===
The islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===

[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]

St Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island. The island also has [[taxicab|taxis]] and a tour [[bus]]. Vehicles on the islands are exempt from annual [[MOT test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Motor Vehicles (tests) Regulations 1981 (SI 1981/1694)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scilly.gov.uk/Council%20of%20the%20Isles%20of%20Scilly/Planning/IOS%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Strategy%20final.pdf|title=A Sustainable Energy Strategy for the Isles of Scilly|publisher=Council of the Isles of Scilly|date=November 2007|accessdate=21 August 2010|pages=13, 21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118162937/http://www.scilly.gov.uk/Council%20of%20the%20Isles%20of%20Scilly/Planning/IOS%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Strategy%20final.pdf|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scillyonline.co.uk/travel.html |title=Travel Information |publisher=ScillyOnLine |accessdate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roads and streets across Scilly have very few signs or markings, and route numbers (of the three [[A roads in Great Britain|A roads]] on St Mary's) are not marked at all.

Air access to the islands is via [[St Mary's Airport (Isles of Scilly)|St Mary's Airport]]. [[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].&lt;ref name=iossb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012. A new heliport is currently under construction in Penzance and helicopter services to Tresco and St Mary's are expected to commence in 2019 or 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penzanceheliport.co.uk/|title=Isles of Scilly Helicopter from Penzance Heliport|website=Penzance Heliport|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By sea, the [[Isles of Scilly Steamship Company]] provides a passenger and cargo service from [[Penzance]] to St Mary's, which is currently operated by the ''[[Scillonian III]]'' passenger ferry, supported until summer 2017 by the ''[[Gry Maritha]]'' cargo vessel and now by the ''Mali Rose''. The other islands are linked to St. Mary's by a network of inter-island [[launch (boat)|launches]].&lt;ref name=ioss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/sea.htm |title=Isles of Scilly Travel&amp;nbsp;– Travel by sea |publisher=Isles of Scilly Travel |accessdate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Mary's Harbour]] is the principal harbour of the Isles of Scilly, and is located in Hugh Town.

===Tenure===
The [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for [[Hugh Town]] on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949). The duchy also holds {{convert|3921|acre|km2|0}} as duchy property, part of the duchy's landholding.&lt;ref name="landholding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0605/feature3/index.html |title=Prince Charles not your typical radical |author=Sandy Mitchell |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |date=May 2006 |pages=96–115; map ref 104 |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the uninhabited islands, islets and rocks and much of the untenanted land on the inhabited islands is managed by the [[Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust]], which leases these lands from the Duchy for the rent of one daffodil per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://duchyofcornwall.org/newton-park-estate.html |title=Isles of Scilly |publisher=Duchy of Cornwall |accessdate=8 June 2017|quote=In particular, The Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, which manages around 60 per cent of the area of the Isles, including the uninhabited islands, plays an important role in protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Trust pays a rent to the Duchy of one daffodil per year!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust currently has four full-time salaried staff and 12 trustees, who are all residents of the Isles. The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.

Limited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.

Housing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.&lt;ref name="SWHB"&gt;''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;S. Fleming et al., ''“In from the cold” A report on Cornwall’s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

High housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost £5,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of ‘key workers’ and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.&lt;ref name="council" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt;

The limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.&lt;ref name="The Cornishman"&gt;''The Cornishman'', "Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy", 19 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===People===
{{Main article|Cornish people|English people}}

According to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],&lt;ref name=ONS1 /&gt; with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.&lt;ref name=ONS2&gt;{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly – Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&amp;b=276909&amp;c=TR21+0LW&amp;d=13&amp;e=13&amp;g=431427&amp;i=1x1003x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=0&amp;s=1354783435942&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|eastern Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers. By 2005, their numbers were estimated at nearly 100 out of a total population of just over 2,000.&lt;ref name=Guard&gt;{{cite news |title=East Europeans in the Isles of Scilly |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/23/britishidentity.features111 |accessdate=6 December 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Isles have also been referred to as "the land that crime forgot", reflecting lower crime levels than national averages.&lt;ref name="Mawby 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mawby |first1=R.I. |title=The Land that Crime Forgot?

===Sport===
One continuing legacy of the isles' past is [[Cornish pilot gig|gig racing]], wherein fast rowing boats ("gigs") with crews of six (or in one case, seven) race between the main islands. Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed "pilot gigs"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&amp;nbsp;– Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== JKP Philanthropy ==
JKP, under the inspiration, love and guidance of [[Kripalu Maharaj|Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Maharaj]], will continue to strive in its goal to serve more of the hundreds of thousands of people who are in desperate need of welfare. His appointed JKP Presidents are tirelessly moving forward with the goals set out by the founder.

Under the umbrella of JKP, there are three main [[philanthropic]] groups that have been established by [[Kripalu Maharaj|Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj]].

=== JKP Hospitals ===
The first, '''Jagadguru Kripalu Chikitsalaya''' (JKC), a 100% free charitable hospital&lt;ref name=timesofindia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tewari, A. (September 18, 2015).

The setup of JKC started with hospitals setup in [[Kunda, India|Kunda]] (November 2003)&lt;ref name=vrindavanhospital /&gt; and then in Barsana (January 2007)&lt;ref name=vrindavanhospital /&gt; which are both in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. JKC has helped thousands of sick villagers in these remote locations in India due to the lack of medical facilities. It is unimaginable how such an endeavor has saved so many lives. In September 2015, JKC opened its third facility in Vrindavan,&lt;ref name=vrindavanhospital /&gt; housing important medical equipment, doctors and nurses living quarters as well as 100-beds to treat patients. All three hospitals will serve over 450,000 people in Uttar Pradesh ensuring constant medical care through a combination of allopathic, homeopathic, ayurvedic and naturopathic treatments.

=== JKP Education ===

'''James Macadam Hare''' [[FRSE]] [[Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] (1775–1831) was an eminent Scottish physician, closely linked to [[India]], who was employed by  the [[East India Company]].

==Life==
[[File:40 to 45 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|45 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh (on left hand side)]]
He was born on 13 September 1775; the son of Dr James Hare of Calderhall [[FRSE]] FSA, probably at Calderhall, just west of [[Edinburgh]]. His father spent much of his life as a physician in the [[East Indies]].

Hare studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and graduated with a [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1796. He joined the [[East India Company]] in 1802 serving as a surgeon in their Indian Medical Service there until 1814, when he then transferred to be surgeon of the President of Calcutta. He spent much of his time travelling between Scotland and India. In 1813 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Thomas Allan]], [[James Russell (surgeon)|Dr James Russell]] and [[David Brewster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 he served as President of the Medical and Physical Society of [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;Roll of the Indian Medical Service 1615–1930&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1827 and returned to live in [[Edinburgh]]. He died at his home, 45 [[Charlotte Square]]&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1829–30&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh on 12 February 1831.

==Family==
He married Harriet Jackson, daughter of William Jackson. They had a daughter, Maria Anstruther Hare (1805–1829) and ten other children.&lt;ref name="thepeerage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p66710.htm|publisher=thepeerage.com|title=Person Page|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kessler]] in 1978,  is a scenario in which the density of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade where each collision generates [[space debris]] that increases the likelihood of further collisions.&lt;ref name="kessler"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais | title=Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | year=1978 | volume=83 | pages=2637–2646 | doi=10.1029/JA083iA06p02637|bibcode = 1978JGR....83.2637K }}&lt;/ref&gt; One implication is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of [[satellite]]s in specific orbital ranges impractical for many generations.&lt;ref name="kessler"/&gt;

==Debris generation and destruction ==
Every satellite, [[space probe]], and [[manned mission]] has the potential to produce space debris. A cascading Kessler syndrome becomes more likely as satellites in orbit increase in number. As of 2014, there were about 2,000 commercial and government satellites orbiting the earth.&lt;ref name="Lockheed Martin 2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28948367 |title=Lockheed Martin in space junk deal with Australian firm |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are 600,000 pieces of space junk ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;cm to 10&amp;nbsp;cm, and on average one satellite is destroyed each year.&lt;ref name="Lockheed Martin 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IFLS"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516084751/http://www.iflscience.com/space/space-debris-has-chipped-one-isss-windows |url=http://www.iflscience.com/space/space-debris-has-chipped-one-isss-windows |work=[[I Fucking Love Science]]  |deadurl=no |title=Space Debris Has Chipped One Of The ISS's Windows |accessdate=2016-05-16 |archivedate=2016-05-16 |date=2016-05-15 |first=Alfredo |last=Carpineti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used orbits for both manned and unmanned space vehicles are [[low earth orbit]]s, which cover an altitude range low enough for residual [[air drag]] to be sufficient to help keep the zone clear. Collisions that occur in this altitude range are also less of an issue because the directions into which the fragments fly and/or their lower [[specific energy]] often result in orbits intersecting with Earth or having [[apsis|perigee]] below this altitude.

[[Orbital decay]] is much slower at altitudes where atmospheric drag is insignificant. Slight [[atmospheric drag]], lunar [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]], and [[solar wind]] drag can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes where fragments finally re-enter, but this process can take millennia at very high altitudes.

==Implications==
[[File:Space Debris Low Earth Orbit.png|thumb|Image made from models used to track debris in earth orbit]]

The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the [[Cascading failure|domino effect]] and [[Positive feedback|feedback runaway]] wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass [[spall|spall off]] debris from the force of the collision. The shrapnel can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in low earth orbit extremely low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://physics.ucsc.edu/cosmo/Mountbat.PDF| title = Debris and Future Space Activities| accessdate =| author =| last = Primack| first = Joel R.| authorlink =| year = 2002| format = PDF| work =| publisher = Physics Department, University of California| location =| pages =| language =| doi =| dateformat =| quote = With enough orbiting debris, pieces will begin to hit other pieces, setting off a chain reaction of destruction that will leave a lethal halo around the Earth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even a catastrophic Kessler scenario at LEO would pose minimal risk for launches continuing past LEO, or satellites travelling at [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO) or [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO). The catastrophic scenarios predict an increase in the number of collisions per year, as opposed to a physically impassable barrier to space exploration that occurs in higher orbits.

==Avoidance and reduction==
Designers of a new vehicle or satellite are frequently required to demonstrate that it can be safely disposed of at the end of its life, for example by use of a controlled [[atmospheric reentry]] system or a boost into a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html  | title=FCC Enters Orbital Debris Debate |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080506022635/http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |archivedate = 2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In order to obtain a license to provide telecommunications services in the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002 to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |title=FCC Enters Orbital Debris Debate |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724183455/http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |archivedate=2009-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. government regulations require a boost, &lt;math&gt;\Delta{H}&lt;/math&gt;, of ≈300&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/USG_OD_Standard_Practices.pdf | title=US Government Orbital Debris Standard Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed energy-efficient means of [[deorbit]]ing a spacecraft from [[MEO]] is to shift it to an orbit in an unstable [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with the Sun or Moon that speeds up orbital decay.&lt;ref name="Witze2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Witze|first1= A.|title=The quest to conquer Earth’s space junk problem|journal= Nature|volume= 561|issue= 7721|date= 2018-09-05|pages= 24–26|doi= 10.1038/d41586-018-06170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daquin2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Daquin|first1= J.|last2= Rosengren|first2=A.

One technology proposed to help deal with fragments from 1&amp;nbsp;cm to 10&amp;nbsp;cm in size is the [[laser broom]], a proposed multimegawatt land-based laser that could deorbit debris: the side of the debris hit by the laser would [[ablation|ablate]] and create a thrust that would change the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the remains of the fragment until it would re-enter harmlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/debris-00a.html |title=NASA Hopes Laser Broom Will Help Clean Up Space Debris |publisher=SpaceDaily |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential trigger==
The [[Envisat]] satellite is a large, inactive satellite with a mass of {{convert|8211|kg|lb|abbr=on}} that drifts at {{convert|785|km|mi|abbr=on}}, an altitude where the debris environment is the greatest—two catalogued objects can be expected to pass within about 200 meters of Envisat every year&lt;ref name=Kessler /&gt;—and likely to increase. It could easily become a major debris contributor from a collision during the next 150 years that it will remain in orbit.&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;{{cite news | first = Andrea | last = Gini | title = Don Kessler on Envisat and the Kessler Syndrome | date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2012/04/25/don-kessler-envisat-kessler-syndrome/ | work = Space Safety Magazine | accessdate = 2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12419">'''Lebollo la basadi''' also known as female initiation among the Basotho is a [[rite of passage]] ritual which marks the transition of girls into [[womanhood]]. This activity is still practiced in the [[Free State]] province of [[South Africa]] however, not widely. In [[Sesotho]], lebolla means initiation. The Basotho rite of passage ritual, unlike other practices in [[Africa]], does not involve procedures which remove parts of the female genital organ. However, the inner folds of the labia are enlarged &amp; elongated by stretching for a more pleasurable sexual experience. In areas where initiation is still valued, uninitiated girls are ridiculed by society. 

South African children are compelled by its [[constitution]] to attend school. Therefore, many girls do not attend initiation schools resulting in the practice of initiation becoming less popular. Female Basotho initiation is commonly practiced in rural areas, particularly in the eastern [[Free State]].

==Location==
The rite of passage of ‘lebolla’ commonly occurs in rural areas where the Basotho are more traditionally oriented. It occurs on farms and small villages where the resources and environment aid in creating the setting for the rituals. Areas with a higher incidence of female  initiation include [[Ficksburg]] and [[Clocolan]] in the Free State as well as in Butha-Butha and Mphosong in [[Lesotho]]. Elongation of the labia is not done in hospitals or clinics as there is no medical requirement for it.&lt;ref&gt;S du Ploy. Female initiation: Becoming a woman among the Basotho. Masters Dissertation. University of Free State. May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing==
Basotho female initiation schools are planned to correspond with the rising of the [[full moon]]. The full moon symbolizes [[female sexuality]] and [[fertility]] for the [[Basotho people]]. Seasons and favourable conditions are also considered. Some schools take place in October however, many participate in December which allows for scholars to attend during their holiday.

==Age==
The minimum age for a girl to attend initiation school is 12. Ages of initiation school attendance range from 12 to 20 years old however the generally accepted age for girls is between 15 and 18.  The incidence of a girls first menses, ‘[[menarche]]’, is regarded as a positive indication for physical and spiritual readiness for initiation school attendance. While having reached puberty is a good indicator for readiness for joining the initiation school, puberty is not a strict requirement.

==Roles==
A female traditional healer/traditional surgeon called a ‘’ngaka’’ is required for the initiation practice. The traditional healer is found during the planning stage of the initiation. The traditional healer is believed to have more clarity of natural forces and their interaction with the world.  Activities only commence once the ‘ngaka’ arrives. Additional local traditional doctors are sometimes asked to oversee the process however, their presence is not essential.

The promotor, known as ‘monga mophato’ promotes the initiation school thus ‘owns’ the initiation school. Promoters usually devote their entire lives to facilitating initiation schools and become more sought after with more years of experience. The promoter is responsible for supplying food, which includes the slaughtering of animals for ceremonies. It is also the promotor’s responsibility to find a reputable traditional healer. The promoters become renowned for their work and are often requested to present an initiation school. They receive remuneration in the form of meat and money. The instructress,  known as ‘mosuwe’ in Sesotho, takes responsibility for the care and training of the initiates for the duration of the initiation period. They are also responsible for initiate discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Betty J. Harris (1990) Ethnicity and Gender in the Global Periphery: A Comparison of Basotho and Navajo Women. American Indian Culture and Research Journal: 1990, Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The Free State Initiation School Health Act of 2004 (No. 1 of 2004) stipulates criteria and regulations necessary to conduct initiation schools. One of the requirements includes explicit, written permission to host the initiation school and treat initiates by the District Medical Officer. Other requirements include written consent of those over 18 years of age and parental consent for those below the age of 18., a clean bill of health by a primary health care nurse or a medical practitioner. A district Environmental Officer, designated by the MEC, inspects the initiation schools ensuring that there is adequate water supply, hygienic food preparation as well as adequate instruments (if physical circumcision is done). The initiation school may not be held for longer than 2 months and initiates are not to be subject to any form of corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cogta.gov.za/cgta_2016/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DTA-GG-38814-INITIATION-POLICY-FOR-COMMENTS.pdf Accessed 9 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation==
Initiation includes rituals or ceremonies that serve to admit the individual into a certain position in society. The purposes of these rites is to announce genital maturity as well as the change in their social status to ‘woman’. Female initiation often correlates with  puberty which includes the girls first menstruation..The immediate family plays an integral role in the initiation process of the girl by teaching the initiate how to behave as a woman and also ways to enhance the sexual experience in marriage. The initiation of Basotho girls is more likely to occur in societies where polygamy is practiced therefore the ‘immediate’ family would include various households which aids in creating solidarity between all the women of the family. However, female initiation can also occur where [[matriarchy]] or [[bilocality]] is the norm.

Societies where women make a significant contribution to the subsistence of the community tend to have initiation ceremonies for the girls in order to educate the girls as well as communities that she is capable of fulfilling her obligations. Additionally, the ceremony emphasizes the importance of the role of the woman in the community. Families strongly encourage initiation from an early age and young girls often witness the initiation of family members and girls from the broader community.

The initiation process includes the Basotho girls transitioning through different phases.“Phepa” is  a white soil  used by girls on their body and “Pilo”, a black soil, is used as a mask for identification of the different clans. These clans include Bataung, Bahlakoana, Bakoena, Bafokeng, Basiea, and Baphuthing. The initiators  know which tribe is eligible to use a certain soil type or both of them for identification.&lt;ref&gt;S du Ploy. Female initiation: Becoming a woman among the Basotho. Masters Dissertation. University of Free State. May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labial elongation===
The girls are taught to self elongate their [[labia]]. The labia is enlarged through massaging and stretching from the top to the bottom of the labia using the tips of the thumb and the index finger. Different herbs are ground and converted into a paste in order to ease tension while pulling. These herbs are believed to soften and [[lubricate]] the labia to reduce the risk of any skin lacerations. The [[World Health Organization]] classified inner labial elongation as a Type IV female [[genital mutilation]] (non excisional type) in 2002. This was criticized by some scholars such as Gallo, Marian Koster MSc and Dr. Lisa Price of Wageningen University, Netherlands as they believed it should be classified as ‘ethnic genital modification’. This led the WHO amending their classification of it to  "modification" instead of ‘mutilation’ in February 2008. The practice of labial stretching in Basotho women does not violate women's rights as it does not involve physical violence, unless the woman is misled as to the benefits of the practice. 
Basotho girls undergoing initiation assist each other to elongate the labia and are therefore able to compete about who has the longest labia. The girls are told that elongated labia increases sexual pleasure for their future husbands and that elongation increases a woman’s chances of marriage. Some initiates report it being painful however others find pleasure in the practice. Many girls also believe that if they do not elongate their labia, they could experience difficulty giving birth. Due to the sometimes competitive nature of labial elongation, some girls resort in dangerous measures in order to elongate the labia. Some girls have been known to tie a piece of string to the labia and attached a small stone to assist in the pulling and others have been known to use the incorrect herbs resulting in rashes. Many of these alternative practices are done without the supervision of the traditional healers. Girls who experience complications are admitted to hospitals/ clinics.

Possible complications include itching, swelling, minor tears and pain.&lt;ref&gt;Cult Health Sex. 2017 May; 19(5): 616–629.Published online 2016 Dec 6. doi:  10.1080/13691058.2016.1257739 Accessed 9 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Basotho women who have elongated their labia are unable to confirm whether the elongation assisted in the child birthing process as many feel they experience the same as women who did not undergo elongation. Basotho women also report on their husbands having sexual relations with women who have not had their labia elongated and are therefore not convinced of the efficacy of elongated labia lips in sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Martínez Pérez, Mwenya Mubanga, Concepción Tomás Aznar, Brigitte Bagnol. (2015) Zambian Women in South Africa: Insights Into Health Experiences of Labia Elongation. The Journal of Sex Research 52:8, pages 857-867.Accessed 9 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khau, Mathabo. (2012). Female sexual pleasure and autonomy: What has inner labia elongation got to do with it?. Sexualities. 15. 763-777. 10.1177/1363460712454068.Accessed 9 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation dress==
The outfits worn during initiation require much attention. The preparation period for Basotho girls in Lesotho can be lengthy however, in the Free State, the preparation can be done within a day. The girl receives a sheepskin blanket from her maternal uncle or any other male representative. On the first day, the girls usually wear an old linen dress and an old dull blanket. This attire is discarded soon after and is replaced by a cowhide or sheepskin skirt. The girl is also given a veil as well as a grass or reed hoop which grows along the river banks called ‘dikgolokwane’ to wear around the waist. The girls also wear handcrafted clay necklaces. The girl leaves the initiation school wearing an elegant cowhide dress, beads, ornaments, new blankets, colourful towels and red-ochre.

==The initiates==
Initiates are ranked according to a totem position. The most senior initiate is called the ‘Molobe’ followed by ‘Molobenyana’ or ‘Lelate’ and the most junior position is called ‘Senkoyhi’ however, this ranking system is not always applied and its use is area dependent.  The girl initiate may undergo initiation with a female relative including sisters, father’s younger sisters, mother’s younger sister or niece. She may not be in the same initiation school or time as her mother, mother’s older sister or grandmother. In the case that relatives are in the same initiation school, it is customary to place  a knob-stick in the fence of the initiation school entrance. The relatives are also to enter and exit the initiation school from opposite sides of the stick.&lt;ref&gt;Legassic, M 1969. The Sotho-Tswana people before 1800. In Thompson,L.

The '''Mysterons''' are a fictional race of [[extraterrestrials]]. They are the remnants of the original Mysteron race, extraterrestrial life forms that originated in a galaxy other than the Milky Way and maintained their colony on [[Mars]]. They appear in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[science-fiction]] [[Supermarionation]] television series ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' (1967&amp;ndash;68) and ''[[Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet]]'' (2005), symbolised by ubiquitous projected green rings and the deep bass voice of their human convert, [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]].

==Portrayal==

===''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons''===
Hostilities between [[Earth]] and the Mysterons commence following a ''[[Zero-X]]'' expedition on [[Mars]] led by Captain Black of the Earth security organisation Spectrum. The purpose of the mission had been to locate the source of radio signals that Spectrum had detected emanating from the planet. The ''Zero-X'' astronauts discover an alien city complex on the Martian surface. After mistaking a surveillance camera for a weapons placement, Black fears an attack and, in violation of his orders, launches an assault on the complex that destroys it completely. However, the city is almost immediately rebuilt before their eyes as a blue beam of light passes over the ruins.

Identifying themselves as the Mysterons, the aliens claim to have discovered the secret of "reversing matter" (a power later referred to as "retrometabolism"). They have the ability to alter matter (using some sort of [[teleportation]] technology), to heal any physical injury, and to re-create the exact likeness of any object or person &amp;ndash; a power they can exercise only after the original object has been destroyed or the original person killed. Dedicating themselves to a "slow, but nonetheless effective" retaliation for the unprovoked attack on their Martian complex, the Mysterons seize telepathic control of Black and return him to Earth, making him instrumental in avenging the Mysterons by recruiting other persons and objects in a similar fashion.

However, the Mysterons' attempt to assassinate the [[World government in science fiction|World President]] &amp;ndash; for the purposes of which they kill and re-create Spectrum's foremost agent, [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]], as an indestructible doppelganger &amp;ndash; fails when a kidnapping of the president is foiled and the Scarlet reconstruction falls to its apparent death from the top of a tower, later regaining the consciousness of the original, human officer (how this happens is never explained in the series [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]).

The Mysterons themselves are never seen on screen. They broadcast their threats by radio, often disguising their intentions with [[word play]]- such as stating that they will 'Kill Time' when they intend to kill a major Spanish official whose surname is 'Tiempo' (Spanish for 'Time') in the episode "[[Operation Time]]"-, and are represented visually only by twin rings of green light, suggestive of eyes, that they project onto scenes of murder and destruction of their making from which likenesses emerge. The Mysteron likenesses created are impervious to X-Rays- showing up on X-Rays as though they were conventional photographs- and can only be destroyed by massive amounts of electricity. The recreation process they use only requires the subject to be clinically dead before the copy is created; in one episode ([[Treble Cross]]), World Air Force test pilot Major Gravener, who the Mysterons had attacked and copied was later resuscitated in hospital, allowing Spectrum to set a trap for the Mysterons by sending the real Major Gravner out in place of his duplicate.

Anderson originally intended the Mysterons to be more conventional Martians, later choosing to make them effectively invisible so that the series would not feel dated. The ''[[TV Century 21]]'' comic book depicted the Mysterons as both energy beings and a computer collective.

===''Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet''===
The final episode of the re-imagined series, ''[[Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet]]'', reveals a great deal about the Mysterons as they exist in the version of the new series. They live in a city on Mars that is normally hidden from view. The city appears on the surface of Mars for the first time in 2068, during the ill-fated mission commanded by [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] (''[[List of Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet episodes#Instrument of Destruction Part 1|Instrument of Destruction, Part 1]]''). They are categorically stated to be [[energy being]]s, with one being shown to be capable of transforming into the "green rings", and are to some extent individualised &amp;ndash; there is a dissenting faction in the "Mysteron consciousness" (as a member of the faction puts it) that believes that, given time, humans will outgrow their destructive impulses and become more like the Mysterons themselves. Unfortunately for the series' protagonists, this group has virtually no influence, and their only agent dispatched to Earth was quickly de-corporalised and remanded into Mysteron custody by the majority group's primary agent, Black.

The Mysterons were first discovered by Spectrum captains [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]] and Black during an investigation into the source of strange signals emanating from Mars. They appear as a pair of green rings; however, it is not known whether this is the result of technology. The Mysterons claim to be peaceful beings, but wage a "war of nerves" against the people of Earth following Black's devastating assault on the Mysteron city.

The Mysterons possess the ability to reconstruct exact replicas of objects or persons. It is due to this remarkable ability that they are able to re-create their city following Black's attack. They also employ this power from time to time during the "Mysteronisation" process, which imbues the reconstruction (dubbed "replicant" by Spectrum) with the power of "retro-metabolisation" &amp;ndash; the replicant is able to heal completely from almost any injury, including fatal ones. The only known survivor of the process is Scarlet, who retains his retro-metabolism and remains virtually indestructible, an ability which is a great asset in his work.

Mysterons are also able to control the minds of their human victims, whether the subject has been replicated or not. Mysterons make use of hypnosis for short-term control, as demonstrated by the replicant of Commander Lewis on Doctor Gold ("[[List of Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet episodes#"The Homecoming"|The Homecoming]]"). To create a full agent, they use the reconstruction process which leaves them in total control of the victim's body.

The Mysteronisation process alters the replicants at the sub-atomic level and subtly alters their genetic code. It is this alteration of DNA that leaves them vulnerable to detection, and as such all Spectrum personnel are subject to regular DNA checking.

==Reception==
Alasdair Wilkins and Sophie Bushwick of the entertainment website [[io9]] categorise the Mysterons as an example of the "monstrous and evil" variety of [[Martian]] commonly seen in film, television and literature, and rank them second only to the [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|invaders]] of the [[H. G. Wells]] novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1897) for malevolence.&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5862360/where-does-your-favorite-martian-fit-in-io9s-ultimate-martian-field-guide|title=io9's Field Guide to Martians|author1=Wilkins, Alasdair |author2=Bushwick, Sophie |date=23 November 2011|work=[[io9]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=27 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412125056/http://io9.com/5862360/where-does-your-favorite-martian-fit-in-io9s-ultimate-martian-field-guide|archivedate=12 April 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkins and Bushwick describe the Mysterons as "an unfathomable race of probably [[Incorporeality|non-corporeal]] entities";&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; to cultural historian [[Nicholas J. Cull]], they are a species of "invisible" extraterrestrial.&lt;ref name="MediaHistory"/&gt; The tie-in publication ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'', by Chris Bentley, refutes the suggestion that the Mysterons featured in the series are a type of [[energy being]], stating explicitly that they are "[[sentient computers]]" forming a group consciousness, possessing the ability to manipulate matter.&lt;ref name="CompleteBook"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet|year=2001|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-84222-405-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Martian computer complex is the legacy of the original, corporeal Mysteron species – said to be of [[extragalactic]] origin and "masters in the art of computer technology" – who arrived on Mars in the mid–[[2nd millennium BC]] and left the planet at the start of the [[20th century AD]].&lt;ref name="CompleteBook"/&gt;

For Cull, that the Mysterons are unseen makes them all the more "terrifying".&lt;ref name="MediaHistory"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Nicholas J. Cull|Cull, Nicholas J.]] |date=August 2006 | title = Was Captain Black Really Red?

Commenting on the characterisation of the villains in the [[Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet|2005 re-make]], David Garland suggests that the Mysterons' continued focus on "[[Terrorism|terrorising]]" Earth remotely, as opposed to invading it physically, "holds particular contemporary resonance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Garland | first1 = David | editor1-last = Geraghty | editor1-first = Lincoln | title = Channeling the Future: Essays on Science Fiction and Fantasy Television | chapter = Pulling the Strings: Gerry Anderson's Walk from 'Supermarionation' to 'Hypermarionation' | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Scarecrow Press]] | location = [[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]], [[Maryland]] | isbn = 978-0-8108-6922-6 | page = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''naggin''' in Ireland is a 200ml bottle of [[distilled beverage|spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://drinkaware.ie/index.php?sid=11&amp;pid=107 |title=How Many Standard Drinks? |accessdate=2 December 2013 |website=DrinkAware.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major brands of [[vodka]], [[whiskey]], [[rum]], and less often [[gin]], are commonly sold in this size in [[off licence]]s, especially independent (non-[[chain store|chain]]) shops, typically at 37.5% to 40% ABV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinksindustryireland.ie/article.aspx?id=1749|title=New Jägermeister 20cl (naggin) launched|date=10 December 2010|work=DrinksIndustryIreland|quote=This size is unique to the Irish off-trade and holds a considerable and growing share of spirit sales - particularly in the independent off-trade.|accessdate=2 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204001223/http://www.drinksindustryireland.ie/article.aspx?id=1749|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naggins are more common than half-bottles (350ml - known as a "shoulder"), though for the [[long tail|less popular majority]] of products neither size is available, only the 700 mL EU standard bottle size . The naggin bottle is typically the shape of a large [[hip flask]], suitable for placing in a pocket.

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''naggin'' is a variant of ''[[wikt:noggin|noggin]]'', a word of uncertain origin recorded from the seventeenth century and meaning a small quantity of alcohol, usually one [[Gill (unit)|gill]] ({{convert|0.25|imppt|mL}}).

A '''neonatal intensive care unit''' ('''NICU'''), also known as an '''intensive care nursery''' ('''ICN'''), is an [[intensive care unit]] specializing in the care of ill or premature newborn [[infants]]. Neonatal refers to the first 28 days of life. Neonatal care, as known as specialized nurseries or intensive care, has been around since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursesource.org/neonatal.html|title=Nurses for a Healthier Tomorrow|website=www.nursesource.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[United States|American]] newborn intensive care unit, designed by [[Louis Gluck]], was opened in October 1960 at [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]].&lt;ref name="GLUCK1985"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.neonatology.org/classics/nic.nih1985.pdf|last=Gluck|first=Louis|title=Conceptualization and initiation of a neonatal intensive care nursery in 1960|conference=Neonatal intensive care: a history of excellence|date=7 October 1985|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NICU''' is typically [[Director (business)|directed]] by one or more [[Neonatology|neonatologists]] and staffed by [[nurse]]s,&lt;ref name="century"/&gt; [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[Clinical pharmacy|pharmacists]], [[physician assistants]], [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] physicians, [[respiratory therapy|respiratory therapists]], and [[dietitian]]s. Many other [[ancillary]] disciplines and specialists are available at larger units.

The term ''neonatal'' comes from ''neo'', "new", and ''natal'', "pertaining to birth or origin".&lt;ref name="etym"/&gt;

Neonatal [[nurse]] practitioners are advanced practice nurses that care for premature [[Baby|babies]] and sick newborns in [[intensive care unit]]s, [[emergency room]]s, [[delivery room]]s, and special [[clinics]]. [[Preterm birth|Prematurity]] is a risk factor that follows early labour, a planned caesarean section, or [[pre-eclampsia]].

== Nursing and neonatal populations ==
[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|left|A pediatric nurse checking recently born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria]]
Healthcare institutions have varying entry-level requirements for neonatal nurses. Neonatal nurses are [[registered nurse]]s (RNs), and therefore must have an [[Associate of Science in Nursing]] (ASN) or [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN) degree.  Some countries or institutions may also require a [[midwifery]] qualification.&lt;ref name="coinn"/&gt;  Some institutions may accept newly graduated RNs having passed the [[NCLEX]] exam; others may require additional experience working in adult-health or medical/surgical nursing.&lt;ref name="nursesource"/&gt;

Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in neonatal nursing, such as the [[Master of Science in Nursing]] (MSN) and various [[Doctorate in Nursing|doctorates]].  A [[nurse practitioner]] may be required to hold a postgraduate degree.&lt;ref name="coinn"/&gt;  The National Association of Neonatal Nurses recommends two years' experience working in a NICU before taking graduate classes.&lt;ref name="nursesource"/&gt;

As with any registered nurse, local licensing or certifying bodies as well as employers may set requirements for continuing education.&lt;ref name="nursesource"/&gt;

There are no mandated requirements to becoming an RN in an NICU, although neonatal nurses must have certification as a [[Neonatal Resuscitation Program|neonatal resuscitation]] provider.  Some units prefer new graduates who do not have experience in other units, so they may be trained in the specialty exclusively, while others prefer nurses with more experience already under their belt.

Intensive-care nurses undergo intensive [[didactic]] and clinical orientation in addition to their general nursing knowledge in order to provide highly specialized care for critical patients.  Their competencies include the administration of high-risk medications, management of high-acuity patients requiring ventilator support, surgical care, resuscitation, advanced interventions such as [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] or [[hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy]] procedures, as well as chronic-care management or lower acuity cares associated with premature infants such as feeding intolerance, [[phototherapy]], or administering antibiotics. NICU RNs undergo annual skills tests and are subject to additional training to maintain contemporary practice.

== History ==
The problem of premature and congenitally ill infants is not a new one.   As early as the 17th and 18th centuries, there were scholarly papers published that attempted to share knowledge of interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00027988/image_1|title=Digitale Bibliothek - Münchener Digitalisierungszentrum|work=digitale-sammlungen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neonatology.org/classics/cadogan.html|title=Neonatology on the Web: Cadogan - An Essay upon Nursing - 1749|work=neonatology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neonatology.org/pdf/arrault.pdf ABREGE HISTORIQUE DE L’ETABLISSEMENT DE L’HOPITAL DES ENFANS-TROUVES A PARIS]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1922, however, that hospitals started grouping the newborn infants into one area, now called the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jppt.org/attachments/contentmanagers/30/HISTORY%20of%20neonatal%20medicine%20i.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[industrial revolution]], premature and ill infants were born and cared for at home and either lived or died without medical intervention.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/sj.jp.7200377 | last1 = Baker | first1 = J.

S.|last = Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Étienne Stéphane Tarnier|Dr. Stephane Tarnier]] is generally considered to be the father of the incubator (or isolette as it is now known), having developed it to attempt to keep premature infants in a Paris maternity ward warm.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; Other methods had been used before, but this was the first closed model; in addition, he helped convince other physicians that the treatment ''helped'' premature infants.  France became a forerunner in assisting premature infants, in part due to its concerns about a falling birth rate.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

After Tarnier retired, [[Pierre-Constant Budin|Dr. Pierre Budin]], followed in his footsteps, noting the limitations of infants in incubators and the importance of breastmilk and the mother’s attachment to the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/fn.73.3.F193 | last1 = Dunn | first1 = P.

Another factor that contributed to the development of modern neonatology was thanks to [[Martin A. Couney|Dr. Martin Couney]] and his permanent installment of premature babies in incubators at [[Coney Island]].  A more controversial figure, he studied under Dr. Budin and brought attention to premature babies and their plight through his display of infants as sideshow attractions at Coney Island and the World’s Fair in New York and Chicago in 1933 and 1939, respectively.&lt;ref name="neonatology_a" /&gt; Infants had also previously been displayed in incubators at the [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|1897]], [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition|1898]], [[Pan-American Exposition|1901]], and [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition#Medical Contributions|1904]] World Fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Incubator Graduates|last=|first=|date=6 August 1904|work=|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|newspaper=Harper's Weekly|editor-last=Harvey|editor-first=George|location=New York|page=1225|via=harpweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0712-025, Berlin, Krankenhaus "Oskar-Ziethen", Kinderkrankenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0712-025, Berlin, Krankenhaus "Oskar-Ziethen", Kinderkrankenhaus]]
Doctors took an increasing role in childbirth from the eighteenth century onward. However, the care of newborn babies, sick or well, remained largely in the hands of mothers and midwives. Some baby incubators, similar to those used for hatching chicks, were devised in the late nineteenth century. In the United States, these were shown at commercial exhibitions, complete with babies inside, until 1931. Dr A. Robert Bauer MD at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, successfully combined oxygen, heat, humidity, ease of accessibility, and ease of nursing care in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;J Am Med Assoc. 1937;108(22):1874&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the [[Second World War]] that special-care baby units (SCBUs) were established in many hospitals. In Britain, early SCBUs opened in Birmingham and Bristol, the latter set up with only £100. At Southmead Hospital, Bristol, initial opposition from obstetricians lessened after quadruplets born there in 1948 were successfully cared for in the new unit.

Incubators were expensive, so the whole room was often kept warm instead. Cross-infection between babies was greatly feared. Strict nursing routines involved staff wearing gowns and masks, constant hand-washing and minimal handling of babies. Parents were sometimes allowed to watch through the windows of the unit. Much was learned about feeding—frequent, tiny feeds seemed best—and breathing. [[Oxygen]] was given freely until the end of the 1950s, when it was shown that the high concentrations reached inside incubators [[retinopathy of prematurity|caused some babies to go blind]]. Monitoring conditions in the incubator, and the baby itself, was to become a major area of research.

The 1960s were a time of rapid medical advances, particularly in respiratory support, that were at last making the survival of premature newborn babies a reality. Very few babies born before thirty two weeks survived and those who did often suffered neurological impairment. [[Herbert Barrie]] in London pioneered advances in resuscitation of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-08|title=Herbert Barrie|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Barrie&amp;oldid=804381753|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrie published his seminal paper on the subject in ''The Lancet'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrie|first=Herbert|date=March 1963|title=Resuscitation of the newborn|url=|journal=The Lancet|volume=Lancet. 1963 Mar 23;1(7282):650-5.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the concerns at this time was the worry that using high pressures of oxygen could be damaging to newborn lungs. Barrie developed an underwater safety valve in the oxygen circuit. The tubes were originally made of rubber, but these had the potential to cause irritation to sensitive newborn tracheas: Barrie switched to plastic. This new endotracheal tube, based on Barrie's design, was known as the ‘St Thomas’s tube’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dr-herbert-barrie-7kxt7jj6d|title=Dr Herbert Barrie|date=2017-05-08|work=The Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early units had little equipment, providing only oxygen and warmth, and relied on careful nursing and observation. In later years, further research allowed technology to play a larger role in the decline of infant mortality.  The development of [[pulmonary surfactant]], which facilitates the oxygenation and ventilation of underdeveloped lungs, has been the most important development in neonatology to date.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Increasing technology ===
[[File:Neonatal Jacoplane.jpg|thumb|Neonatal intensive-care unit from 1980]]

By the 1970s, NICUs were an established part of hospitals in the developed world. In Britain, some early units ran community programmes, sending experienced nurses to help care for premature babies at home. But increasingly technological monitoring and therapy meant special care for babies became hospital-based. By the 1980s, over 90% of births took place in hospital. The emergency dash from home to the NICU with baby in a transport incubator had become a thing of the past, though transport incubators were still needed. Specialist equipment and expertise were not available at every hospital, and strong arguments were made for large, centralised NICUs. On the downside was the long travelling time for frail babies and for parents. A 1979 study showed that 20% of babies in NICUs for up to a week were never visited by either parent.  Centralised or not, by the 1980s few questioned the role of NICUs in saving babies. Around 80% of babies born weighing less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg now survived, compared to around 40% in the 1960s. From 1982, pediatricians  in Britain could train and qualify in the sub-specialty of neonatal medicine.
[[File:UCIN HCM.JPG|thumb|left|Neonatal intensive-care unit in 2009.]]
Not only careful nursing but also new techniques and instruments now played a major role. As in adult intensive-care units, the use of monitoring and life-support systems became routine. These needed special modification for small babies, whose bodies were tiny and often immature. Adult ventilators, for example, could damage babies' lungs and gentler techniques with smaller pressure changes were devised. The many tubes and sensors used for monitoring the baby's condition, blood sampling and artificial feeding made some babies scarcely visible beneath the technology. Furthermore, by 1975, over 18% of newborn babies in Britain were being admitted to NICUs. Some hospitals admitted all babies delivered by [[Caesarian section]] or under 2500 g in weight. The fact that these babies missed early close contact with their mothers was a growing concern. The 1980s saw questions being raised about the human and economic costs of too much technology, and admission policies gradually became more conservative.

=== Changing priorities ===
[[File:Mom and Premature Baby at Kapiolani.jpg|thumb|A new mother holds her [[Preterm birth|premature baby]] at [[Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women &amp; Children|Kapiolani Medical Center]] NICU in Honolulu, Hawaii]]

NICUs now concentrate on treating very small, premature, or congenitally ill babies. Some of these babies are from higher-order multiple births, but most are still single babies born too early. Premature labour, and how to prevent it, remains a perplexing problem for doctors. Even though medical advancements allow doctors to save low-birth-weight babies, it is almost invariably better to delay such births.
[[File:Premature infant with ventilator.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A premature infant, intubated and requiring mechanical ventilation|A [[Preterm birth|premature infant]] weighing 992&amp;nbsp;grams (35&amp;nbsp;ounces), intubated and requiring [[mechanical ventilation]] in the [[neonatal intensive-care unit]]]]
Over the last 10 years or so, SCBUs have become much more 'parent-friendly', encouraging maximum involvement with the babies. Routine gowns and masks are gone and parents are encouraged to help with care as much as possible. Cuddling and skin-to-skin contact, also known as [[Kangaroo care]], are seen as beneficial for all but the frailest (very tiny babies are exhausted by the stimulus of being handled; or larger critically ill infants). Less stressful ways of delivering high-technology medicine to tiny patients have been devised: sensors to measure blood oxygen levels through the skin, for example; and ways of reducing the amount of blood taken for tests.

Some major problems of the NICU have almost disappeared. [[Exchange transfusions]], in which all the blood is removed and replaced, are rare now. [[Rhesus incompatibility]] (a difference in blood groups) between mother and baby is largely preventable, and was the most common cause for exchange transfusion in the past.  However, breathing difficulties, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and infections still claim many infant lives and are the focus of many new and current research projects.

The long-term outlook for premature babies saved by NICUs has always been a concern. From the early years, it was reported that a higher proportion than normal grew up with disabilities, including [[cerebral palsy]] and learning difficulties. Now that treatments are available for many of the problems faced by tiny or immature babies in the first weeks of life, long-term follow-up, and minimising long-term disability, are major research areas.

Besides prematurity and extreme low birth-weight, common [[disease]]s cared for in a NICU include [[perinatal asphyxia]], major [[birth defect]]s, [[sepsis]], [[neonatal jaundice]], and [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]] due to immaturity of the [[lung]]s. In general, the leading cause of death in NICUs is [[necrotizing enterocolitis]]. Complications of extreme prematurity may include [[intracranial hemorrhage]], chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia (see [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]]), or [[retinopathy of prematurity]]. An infant may spend a day of observation in a NICU or may spend many months there.

Neonatology and NICUs have greatly increased the survival of very low birth-weight and extremely premature infants. In the era before NICUs, infants of birth weight less than 1400&amp;nbsp;grams (3&amp;nbsp;lb, usually about 30 weeks gestation) rarely survived. Today, infants of 500&amp;nbsp;grams at 26 weeks have a fair chance of survival.

The NICU environment provides challenges as well as benefits. Stressors for the infants can include continual light, a high level of noise, separation from their mothers, reduced physical contact, painful procedures, and interference with the opportunity to [[breastfeeding|breastfeed]]. A NICU can be stressful for the staff as well. A special aspect of NICU stress for both parents and staff is that infants may survive, but with damage to the brain, lungs or eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neonatal Intensive-Care Unit|url=http://frankshospitalworkshop.com/equipment/documents/infant_incubators/wikipedia/Neonatal%20intensive-care%20unit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICU rotations are essential aspects of [[pediatrics|pediatric]] and [[obstetrics|obstetric]] residency programs, but NICU experience is encouraged by other specialty residencies, such as [[family practice]], [[surgery]], [[pharmacy]], and [[emergency medicine]].

== Equipment ==

=== Incubator ===
[[File:Baby incubator, A-Y-P, Seattle, 1909..jpg|thumb|upright|An early incubator, 1909.]]
[[File:Inauguración del Hospital Regional de Apatzingán. (20665704886).jpg|thumb|left|Dräger Isolette C2000 at the ''Hospital Regional de Apatzingán'' in  [[Apatzingán]], [[Michoacán]], Mexico.]]
An '''incubator''' (or ''isolette''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/medical/isolette Merriam-Webster dictionary --&gt; isolette] retrieved on September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) is an apparatus used to maintain environmental conditions suitable for a [[neonate]] (newborn baby). It is used in [[preterm birth]]s or for some ill full-term babies.

There is additional equipment used to evaluate and treat sick neonates. These include:

Blood pressure monitor: The blood pressure monitor is a machine that's connected to a small cuff which wrapped around the arm or leg of the patient. This cuff automatically takes the blood pressure and displays the data for review by providers.

Oxygen hood: This is a clear box that fits over the baby’s head and supplies oxygen. This is used for babies who can still breathe but need some respiratory support.

Ventilator: This is a breathing machine that delivers air to the lungs. Babies who are severely ill will receive this intervention. Typically, the ventilator takes the role of the lungs while treatment is administered to improve lung and circulatory function.

Possible functions of a neonatal incubator are:
* Oxygenation, through [[oxygen supplementation]] by head hood or nasal cannula, or even [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) or [[mechanical ventilation]]. [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]] is the leading cause of death in preterm infants,&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez RJ, Martin RJ, and Fanaroff, AA. ''Respiratory distress syndrome and its management.'' Fanaroff and Martin (eds.) Neonatal-perinatal medicine: Diseases of the fetus and infant; 7th ed. (2002):1001-1011. St. Louis: Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt; and the main treatments are CPAP, in addition to administering [[pulmonary surfactant]] and stabilizing the [[blood sugar]], [[blood salt]]s, and [[blood pressure]].
* Observation: Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]], and [[Electroencephalography|brain activity]].
* Protection from cold temperature, infection, noise, drafts and excess handling:&lt;ref name=neonatology&gt;[http://www.neonatology.org/tour/equipment.html neonatology.org --&gt; Equipment in the NICU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413093910/http://www.neonatology.org/tour/equipment.html |date=2009-04-13 }} Created 1/25/2002 / Last modified 6/9/2002. Retrieved on September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Incubators may be described as [[bassinet]]s enclosed in plastic, with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs.
* Provision of nutrition, through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] catheter or [[Nasogastric intubation|NG tube]].
* Administration of medications.
* Maintaining [[fluid balance]] by providing fluid and keeping a high [[air humidity]] to prevent too great a loss from skin and respiratory evaporation.&lt;ref name=humidity&gt;[http://www.biomedexperts.com/Abstract.bme/9684469/Humidity_control_tool_for_neonatal_incubator Humidity control tool for neonatal incubator] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309130749/http://biomedexperts.com/abstract.bme/9684469/humidity_control_tool_for_neonatal_incubator |date=2016-03-09 }} 1998: Abdiche M; Farges G; Delanaud S; Bach V; Villon P; Libert J P, Medical &amp; biological engineering &amp; computing 1998;36(2):241-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''transport incubator'' is an incubator in a transportable form, and is used when a sick or premature baby is moved, e.g., from one hospital to another, as from a [[community hospital]] to a larger medical facility with a proper neonatal intensive-care unit. It usually has a miniature [[medical ventilator|ventilator]], [[cardio-respiratory monitor]], [[Intravenous therapy|IV pump]], [[pulse oximeter]], and oxygen supply built into its frame.&lt;ref name=neonatology/&gt;

== Levels of care ==

The concept of designations for hospital facilities that care for newborn infants according to the level of complexity of care provided was first proposed in the United States in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Pediatrics Vol. 114 No. 5 November 1, 2004 pp. 1341 -1347 {{doi|10.1542/peds.2004-1697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels in the United States are designated by the guidelines published by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]&lt;ref&gt;Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the guidelines are issued by The British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM), and in Canada they are maintained by The Canadian Paediatric Society.

Neonatal care is split into categories or “levels of care”. these levels apply to the type of care needed and is determined by the governing body of the area.

===India===
India has 3-tier system based on weight and gestational age of neonate.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Meharban (2010). ''Care of the Newborn''. pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Level I care====
Neonates weighing more than 1800 grams or having gestational maturity of 34 weeks or more are categorized under level I care. The care consists of basic care at birth, provision of warmth, maintaining [[asepsis]] and promotion of breastfeeding. This type of care can be given at home, subcenter and [[primary health centre]].

====Level II care====
Neonates weighing 1200-1800 grams or having gestational maturity of 30–34 weeks are categorized under level II care and are looked after by trained nurses and pediatricians. The equipment and facilities used for this level of care include equipment for resuscitation, maintenance of thermoneutral environment, intravenous infusion, gavage feeding, phototherapy and exchange blood transfusion. This type of care can be given at first referral units, district hospitals, teaching institutions and nursing homes.

====Level III care====
Neonates weighing less than 1200 grams or having gestational maturity of less than 30 weeks are categorized under level III care. The care is provided at apex institutions and regional perinatal centers equipped with centralized oxygen and suction facilities, servo-controlled incubators, vital signs monitors, transcutaneous monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps etc. This type of care is provided by skilled nurses and neonatologists.

=== United Kingdom ===

The terminology used in the [[United Kingdom]] can be confusing, because different criteria are used to designate 'special' and 'intensive' neonatal care locally and nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss website http://www.bliss.org.uk/different-levels-of-care&lt;/ref&gt;

====Level 1 Neonatal Units====
Also known as 'Special Care Baby Units' (SCBU).  These look after babies who need more care than healthy newborns but are relatively stable and mature.  SCBU might provide tube-feeding, [[oxygen therapy]], [[antibiotics]] to treat infection and [[phototherapy]] for [[jaundice]].  In a SCBU, a nurse can be assigned up to four babies to care for.

====Level 2 Neonatal Units====
Also known as 'Local Neonatal Units', these can look after babies who need more advanced support such as [[parenteral nutrition]] and [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP).  Confusingly, they may also look after babies who need short-term intensive care such as mechanical ventilation.  Babies who will need longer-term or more elaborate intensive care, for example extremely preterm infants, are usually transferred to a Level 3 unit.
Babies in a Level 2 unit may be classified for nursing purposes as 'Special Care', 'High Dependency' (HDU) (in which a nurse will be assigned up to two babies) or 'Intensive care' (where nursing is one-to-one, or sometimes even two-to-one).&lt;ref&gt;Milligan DWA, Carruthers P, Mackley B, Ward Platt MP, Collingwood Y, Wooler L, Gibbons J, Draper E, Manktelow BN. 'Nursing Workload in UK tertiary neonatal units' in Archives of Disease in Childhood published online 30 Jun 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Level 3 Neonatal Units====
Also known as 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units' (NICU) - although Level 2 units may also have their own NICU.  These look after the smallest, most premature and most unwell babies  and often serve a large geographical region.  Therapies such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, [[therapeutic hypothermia]], neonatal [[surgery]] and inhaled [[nitric oxide]] are usually provided in Level 3 Units, although not every unit has access to all therapies..
Some babies being cared for in Level 3 units will require less intensive treatment and will be looked after in HDU or SCBU nurseries on the same site.

=== United States ===
The definition of a neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) according to the National Center for Statistics is a "hospital facility or unit staffed and equipped to provide continuous mechanical ventilatory support for a newborn infant".&lt;ref&gt;Martin JA, Menacker F. Expanded health data from the new birth certificate, 2004. Natl Vital Stat Rep. 2007;55(12):1–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatric updated their policy statement delineating the different levels of neonatal care.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Fetus and Newborn. Levels of neonatal care. Pediatrics. 2012;130(3):587–597. doi:10.1542/peds.2012-1999.&lt;/ref&gt; One major difference in the 2012 updated policy statement from the AAP compared to the 2004 policy statement is the removal of subspeciality nurseries for levels II and III with the addition of a level IV NICU. The four distinct levels of neonatal care defined in the most recent policy statement from the AAP are:
# '''Level I''', Well newborn nursery
# '''Level II''', Special care nursery
# '''Level III''', Neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU)
# '''Level IV''', Regional neonatal intensive-care unit (Regional NICU)

==== Level I (well newborn nursery) ====

Level I units are typically referred to as the well baby nursery. '''Well newborn nurseries''' have the capability to provide neonatal resuscitation at every delivery; evaluate and provide postnatal care to healthy newborn infants; stabilize and provide care for infants born at 35 to 37 weeks’ [[gestation]] who remain physiologically stable; and stabilize newborn infants who are ill and those born less than 35 weeks’ gestation until transfer to a facility that can provide the appropriate level of [[neonatal]] care. Required provider types for well newborn nurseries include [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]], [[Family medicine|family physicians]], nurse practitioners, and other advanced practice registered nurses.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"/&gt;

====Level II (special care nursery)====

Previously, Level II units were subdivided into 2 categories (level IIA &amp; level IIB) on the basis of their ability to provide assisted ventilation including [[continuous positive airway pressure]].&lt;ref name="AAP2004"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Fetus and Newborn. Levels of neonatal care. Pediatrics. 2004;114(5):1341-1347. doi:10.1542/peds.2004-1697.&lt;/ref&gt; Level II units are also known as '''special care nurseries''' and have all of the capabilities of a level I nursery.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"/&gt; In addition to providing level I neonatal care, Level II units are able to:
* Provide care for infants born ≥32-week gestation and weighing ≥1500 g who have physiologic immaturity or who are moderately ill with problems that are expected to resolve rapidly and are not anticipated to need subspecialty services on an urgent basis
* Provide care for infants who are feeding and growing stronger or convalescing after intensive care
* Provide mechanical ventilation for a brief duration (&lt;24 h) or continuous positive airway pressure
* Stabilize infants born before 32-week gestation and weighing less than 1500 g until transfer to a neonatal intensive-care facility
* Level II nurseries are required to be managed and staffed by a pediatrician, however many Level II special care nurseries are staffed by [[Neonatology|neonatologists]] and [[neonatal nurse practitioner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1003865165|title=Guidelines for perinatal care|others=Kilpatrick, Sarah Jestin, 1955-, American Academy of Pediatrics,, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,|isbn=9781610020886|edition= Eighth |location=Elk Grove Village, IL|oclc=1003865165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Level III (neonatal intensive-care unit) ====

The 2004 AAP guidelines subdivided Level III units into 3 categories (level IIIA, IIIB &amp; IIIC).&lt;ref name="AAP2004"/&gt; Level III units are required to have pediatric surgeons in addition to care providers required for level II (pediatric hospitalists, neonatologists, and neonatal nurse practitioners) and level I (pediatricians, family physicians, nurse practitioners, and other advanced practice registered nurses). Also, required provider types that must either be on site or at a closely related institution by prearranged consultative agreement include pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric anesthesiologists, and pediatric ophthalmologists.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"/&gt; In addition to providing the care and having the capabilities of level I and level II nurseries, '''level III neonatal intensive-care units''' are able to:&lt;ref name="AAP2012"/&gt;
* Provide sustained life support
* Provide comprehensive care for infants born &lt;32 wks gestation and weighing &lt;1500 g
* Provide comprehensive care for infants born at all gestational ages and birth weights with critical illness
* Provide prompt and readily available access to a full range of pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists, pediatric anesthesiologists, and pediatric ophthalmologists
* Provide a full range of respiratory support that may include conventional and/or high-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide
* Perform advanced imaging, with interpretation on an urgent basis, including computed tomography, MRI, and echocardiography

==== Level IV (regional NICU) ====

The highest level of neonatal care provided occurs at '''regional NICU's''', or Level IV neonatal intensive-care units. Level IV units are required to have pediatric surgical subspecialists in addition to the care providers required for Level III units.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"/&gt; Regional NICU's have all of the capabilities of Level I, II, and III units. In addition to providing the highest level of care, level IV NICU's:
* Are located within an institution with the capability to provide surgical repair of complex congenital or acquired conditions
* Maintain a full range of pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical subspecialists, and pediatric anesthesiologists at the site
* Facilitate transport and provide outreach education.

'''Nobel Biocare'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NOBN:SW}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company that manufactures [[dental implants]] and CAD/CAM-based individualized prosthetics and is headquartered in [[Kloten]], [[Switzerland]] near the [[Zürich Airport]]. Nobel Biocare in its current form was founded in 2002. It originates in a partnership formed in 1978 between Swedish medical researcher Professor [[Per-Ingvar Brånemark]] and [[Bofors]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] company, to industrialize Brånemark’s discovery of [[osseointegration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osseointegration|url=http://www.branemark.com/Osseointegration.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (the fusing of titanium with bone).

==Field of activity==
The core business of the company is the manufacture of dental implants and related products used to treat tooth loss, such as [[abutments]], crowns and bridges.  The company also sells scanners and software for designing individualized, patient-specific prosthetics. Nobel Biocare also develops software for diagnostics and implant treatment planning, and produces customized, patient-specific, guided-surgery templates for implant placement surgeries. Since the legal training requirements for clinicians who carry out implant treatment vary from country to country, Nobel Biocare runs a training and education program for dental professionals in several countries.

== History ==

===The 1970s and 1980s===
In 1978, the Swedish health authorities approved the insertion of dental implants for clinical purposes, and [[Brånemark]] entered into a partnership with Bofors to industrialize his ideas and bring them to a broader market. A new company, Bofors Nobelpharma (later Nobelpharma), was founded in 1981 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden to commercialize Professor Brånemark’s findings. The company launched a number of new products including abutments, drilling equipment and an instrument kit. In 1982, Brånemark presented his results at the Toronto Conference on Osseointegration in Clinical Dentistry. In the same year, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the use of titanium dental implants in the United States. In 1983, Dr. Matts Andersson developed the Procera® System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procera® System|url=http://www.umich.edu/~nbumictr/Restorative-procera/procera.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of high-precision, repeatable manufacturing of dental crowns. This was a fully automated method for the industrial [[CAD/CAM]] production of dental prosthetics. Nobelpharma acquired the new technology in 1988.

After the FDA approval for titanium implants, in 1983, Nobelpharma USA Inc. was established. The company began selling the Brånemark System in the United States. Subsidiaries Nobelpharma Canada Inc. and Nobelpharma Japan Inc. were established in the same decade, along with other offshoots in France, Spain, Australia, Italy, Germany and the UK. The company made a profit for the first time in 1989. In this year, the [[Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare]] approved the Procera technique.

===The 1990s===
At the turn of the decade, osseointegration, as an observed process, was 25 years old. In 1990, Brånemark System was registered as a trademark in the US. In 1993, in need of further sources of funding to continue its expansion and growth plans, Nobelpharma was listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] in 1994. In 1996, the company changed its name to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare acquired the American implant manufacturer Steri-Oss Inc. in 1998. In the later part of the decade, Nobel Biocare opened a manufacturing plant in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]], USA.

===The new century===
In 2002, the company changed its organizational structure by establishing a domicile in Switzerland with a newly founded group parent company. The primary listing of the shares was changed to the SIX SwissExchange (in 2008, the listing at the OMX Exchange in Stockholm was discontinued). In 2014, [[Danaher Corporation]] bought Nobel Biocare&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nobel-biocare-m-a-danaher-idUSKBN0HA0B420140915&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2015 is no longer listed on the SIX SwissExchange.

==Products==
Nobel Biocare is a market leader in offering solutions from root to tooth, covering dental implants, restorative components, CAD/CAM prosthetics, and biomaterials. Dental implants can replace single or multiple missing teeth. They are placed in a patient’s jaw bone to provide a fixation for any prosthetic add-on, such as a crown, similar to the way the root of a tooth provides firm anchoring. There are several implant types that differ in their shape with their use depending on patients’ medical treatment requirements and the clinician’s preference. Manufacturing plants for dental implants are based in [[Karlskoga]] (Sweden), [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] (USA) and [[Tel Aviv]] (Israel). Under the brand name NobelProcera, Nobel Biocare has a portfolio of dental prosthetic solutions and related components. Manufacturing plants for dental prosthetic solutions are based in [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] (USA) and [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]] (Japan). Nobel Biocare develops software for clinicians for diagnosing patients and planning treatments. In 2005, the company introduced guided surgery to the field of dental [[implantology]].

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}

The '''November Project''' is a free, open-to-the-public exercise group founded in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Brogan|title=November Project|url=http://november-project.com/|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "November Project" comes from the [[Google Docs|Google Doc]] that the founders shared to track their progress in November 2011. While sessions occur year-round, the name stuck.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:November Project at Harvard Stadium, November 2014.jpg|thumb|right|November Project at Harvard Stadium, November 2014]] --&gt;

Founded by Brogan Graham and Bojan Mandaric, both [[Northeastern Huskies#Men's Rowing|Northeastern crew]] alumni, the group was started as a way to keep working out through Boston's cold winter months. The pair made a pact to continue to meet at 6:30&amp;nbsp;am every day through the month of November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=November Project members embrace exercise, one another|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2012/11/15/november-project-free-fitness-model-takes-off-boston/YjZXH4UCjnz8wUuhux5mUO/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|date=November 15, 2012|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Carey|title=Two Guys Walk Into A Bar And A Free Fitness ‘Movement’ Is Born|url=http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2012/11/november-project-free-fitness|publisher=WBUR National Public Radio|date=November 2, 2012|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that original promise, the group has grown to hundreds of members who exercise multiple times a week in a number of cities around the United States, Canada, Asia and Europe. Membership is open and free to the general public. The group employs several recruiting strategies including a blog, a Facebook page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=November Project on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/NovProject}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Twitter account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=@nov_project on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/nov_project}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to various media outlets including ''[[Runner's World]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The November Project Celebrates the December Cover|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/photos/the-november-project-celebrates-the-december-cover|publisher=Runner's World|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniloff|first=Caleb|title=Hugs, Sweat &amp; Cheers|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/hugs-sweat-cheers|publisher=Runner's World|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGoldrick|first=Hannah|title=November Project Pays Back Community by Shoveling|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/november-project-pays-back-community-by-shoveling|publisher=Runner's World|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Boston Globe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Mike|title=Facebook meets boot camp|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2014/02/10/november-project-chance-break-out-ordinary-life-part-something-bigger/SudYFcd8AIrYIjuVUlmfJL/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muther|first=Christopher|title=November Project members embrace exercise, one another|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2012/11/15/november-project-free-fitness-model-takes-off-boston/YjZXH4UCjnz8wUuhux5mUO/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Joshua|title=For some, fitness and camaraderie come first|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/26/cold-and-dark-allston-fitness-christmas/SInP68h3xHnLbcmz3HQI6J/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Carey|title=Two Guys Walk Into A Bar And A Free Fitness ‘Movement’ Is Born|url=http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2012/11/november-project-free-fitness|publisher=WBUR|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group selected specific locations within the city of Boston (as well as immediate communities such as [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) for its workouts. The standard locations include [[Harvard Stadium]] for its stairs, and Corey Hill Outlook Park (also known as "Summit Ave.") in Brookline. As of December 2017, the group can be found in 45 cities across the world.

==Collaborations==
Over the years, November Project has worked alongside fitness brands, most notably [[New Balance]] and [[The North Face]].

=== New Balance ===
In July 2013, New Balance launched an advertising campaign centered around the fitness group. The campaign was titled "Runnovation" and focused on the shift in running from being a solitary sport to a social and group-based activity. “This campaign is built on the strong foundation that we, as a brand, have in driving and supporting innovation in the sport of running,” says Hilary Keates, New Balance director of global marketing and brand management.{{ref|Boston Magazine}}

The advertisements were placed in ''[[Men’s Journal]]'', ''[[Outside Magazine]]'', ''[[Running Times]]'', ''[[Women's Running Magazine|Women's Running]]'', ''[[Competitor magazine|Competitor]]'', ''[[Men’s Health]]'', and ''[[Women’s Health]]''.{{ref|Boston Magazine}}

=== The North Face ===
Beginning on March 31, 2015, The North Face and November Project launched jointly hosted workouts on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. The events are held under the name Mountain Athletics and primarily focus on strength training and conditioning.{{ref|BostInno}}

The workouts are hosted in five cities in the U.S.: San Francisco, Washington D.C., New York, Chicago and Boston. {{ref|BostInno}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3189">'''Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy''' ('''OPIDN'''), also called '''organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy''' ('''OPIDP'''), is a [[neuropathy]] caused by killing of neurons in the [[central nervous system]], especially in the [[spinal cord]], as a result of acute or chronic [[organophosphate poisoning]].

A striking example of OPIDN occurred during the 1930s [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition Era]] when thousands of men in the American South and Midwest developed arm and leg weakness and pain after drinking a "medicinal" alcohol substitute.  The drink, called "[[Ginger Jake]]," contained an adulterated [[Jamaican ginger]] extract containing [[tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate]] (TOCP) which resulted in partially reversible neurologic damage.  The damage resulted in the limping called "jake paralysis" – and also "jake leg" or "jake walk", which were terms frequently used in the blues music of the period.  Europe and [[Morocco]] both experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated [[abortifacient]]s and [[cooking oil]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgan |first1=John P |last2=Penovich |first2=Patricia |title=Jamaica Ginger Paralysis: Forty-seven-year follow-up |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=35 |issue=8 |date=August 1978 |pages=530-532 |doi=10.1001/archneur.1978.00500320050011 |pmid=666613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13629387.2011.610118 |title=The 1959 Moroccan oil poisoning and US Cold War disaster diplomacy |journal=The Journal of North African Studies |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=315–36 |year=2012 |last1=Segalla |first1=Spencer David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disorder may contribute to the [[Gulf War syndrome|chronic multisymptom ilnesses of the Gulf War veterans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-374367-1.00069-0 |chapter=Organophosphorus-Induced Delayed Neuropathy |title=Hayes' Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology |pages=1479–504 |year=2010 |last1=Ehrich |first1=Marion |last2=Jortner |first2=Bernard S |isbn=978-0-12-374367-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2017.08.451 |title=New insights into the organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |volume=381 |pages=153–4 |year=2017 |last1=Qiang |first1=D |last2=Xie |first2=X |last3=Gao |first3=Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact cause of the syndrome is unknown, although it has been associated with inhibition of [[patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6]] (PNPLA6, aka neuropathy target esterase). There is no specific treatment, and recovery is usually incomplete, affecting only [[sensory nervous system]], while motor neutopathy persists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=11&amp;po=29{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanisms, and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of Parkinson's disease is generally [[idiopathy|unknown]], but believed to involve both [[Heredity|genetic]] and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=Lancet2015/&gt; Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves.&lt;ref name=Lancet2015/&gt; There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain [[pesticide]]s and among those who have had prior [[Head injury|head injuries]], while there is a reduced risk in [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smokers]] and those who drink [[coffee]] or [[tea]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barranco Quintana JL, Allam MF, Del Castillo AS, Navajas RF | title = Parkinson's disease and tea: a quantitative review | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19571153 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2009.10719754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the [[substantia nigra]], a region of the [[midbrain]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; This results in not enough [[dopamine]] in these areas.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The reason for this [[cell death]] is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of [[protein]]s into [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]] in the [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=Lancet2015/&gt; Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as [[neuroimaging]] being used to rule out other diseases.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

The movement difficulties found in PD are called [[parkinsonism]] and a number of different disorders feature parkinsonism. "Parkinsonism" is defined as  [[bradykinesia]] (slowness in initiating voluntary movements, with progressive reduction in speed and range of repetitive actions such as voluntary finger-tapping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ling H, Massey LA, Lees AJ, Brown P, Day BL | title = Hypokinesia without decrement distinguishes progressive supranuclear palsy from Parkinson's disease | journal = Brain | volume = 135 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 1141–53 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22396397 | pmc = 3326257 | doi = 10.1093/brain/aws038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in combination with one of three other physical signs: muscular ([[lead-pipe rigidity|lead-pipe]] or [[cogwheel rigidity|cogwheel]]) rigidity, [[tremor]] at rest, and [[Balance disorder|postural instability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/Parkinsonism.pdf|title= Parkinson’s Disease vs. Parkinsonism|author= &lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= |website= |publisher= National Parkinson Foundation|access-date= 22 June 2017|deadurl= yes|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830002033/http://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/Parkinsonism.pdf|archive-date= 30 August 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/147/diagnosis/criteria.html |title= Queen Square Brain Bank diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease| access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and is sometimes called "idiopathic parkinsonism", meaning parkinsonism with no identifiable cause.&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jankovic_book-Epidemiology"&gt;{{cite book |name-list-format=vanc | last = Schrag | first = Anette |chapter=Epidemiology of movement disorders |editor1-last=Tolosa | editor1-first=E | editor2-last= Jankovic | editor2-first=Joseph J. | title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, Maryland |year=2007 |pages= 50–66 |isbn=978-0-7817-7881-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifiable causes of parkinsonism include toxins, infections, side effects of drugs, metabolic derangement, and brain lesions such as strokes. Several neurodegenerative disorders also may present with parkinsonism and are sometimes referred to as "atypical parkinsonism" or [[Parkinson plus syndrome|"Parkinson plus"]] syndromes (illnesses with parkinsonism plus some other features distinguishing them from PD). They include [[multiple system atrophy]], [[progressive supranuclear palsy]], [[corticobasal degeneration]], and [[dementia with Lewy bodies]] (DLB).&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Samii A, Nutt JG, Ransom BR | title = Parkinson's disease | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9423 | pages = 1783–93 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15172778 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16305-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20506312"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nuytemans K, Theuns J, Cruts M, Van Broeckhoven C | title = Genetic etiology of Parkinson disease associated with mutations in the SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, and LRRK2 genes: a mutation update | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 31 | issue = 7 | pages = 763–80 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20506312 | pmc = 3056147 | doi = 10.1002/humu.21277 | origyear = 18 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists sometimes refer to Parkinson’s disease as a [[synucleinopathy]] (due to an abnormal accumulation of [[alpha-synuclein]] protein in the brain) to distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] where the brain accumulates [[tau protein]].&lt;ref name="pmid16489609"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galpern WR, Lang AE | title = Interface between tauopathies and synucleinopathies: a tale of two proteins | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 449–58 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16489609 | doi = 10.1002/ana.20819 | origyear = 17 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between [[tauopathy|tauopathies]] and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is another synucleinopathy and it has close pathological similarities with PD, especially with the subset of PD cases with [[dementia]] known as [[Parkinson's disease dementia]]. The relationship between PD and DLB is complex and incompletely understood.&lt;ref name="pmid19173762"/&gt; They may represent parts of a continuum with variable distinguishing clinical and pathological features or they may prove to be separate diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid19173762"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aarsland D, Londos E, Ballard C | title = Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies: different aspects of one entity | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–9 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19173762 | doi = 10.1017/S1041610208008612 | origyear = 28 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease}}
The most recognizable symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; Non-motor symptoms, which include [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] dysfunction, [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms may be present at the time of diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;

===Motor===
{{Further|Parkinsonian gait}}
Four motor symptoms are considered [[Cardinal sign (pathology)|cardinal]] in PD: tremor, slowness of movement (bradykinesia), rigidity, and postural instability.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jankovic J | title = Parkinson's disease: clinical features and diagnosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 368–76 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18344392 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2007.131045 | url = http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/79/4/368.full | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150819084941/http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/79/4/368.full | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archive-date = 19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common presenting sign is a coarse slow [[tremor]] of the hand at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 [[hertz]] (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is ''pill-rolling'', the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book |name-list-format=vanc | last1=Cooper | first1=G. | last2=Eichhorn | first2=G. | last3=Rodnitzky | first3=R.

[[Bradykinesia]] (slowness of movement) is found in every case of PD, and is due to disturbances in [[motor planning]] of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities at the same time and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lees AJ, Hardy J, Revesz T | title = Parkinson's disease | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9680 | pages = 2055–66 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19524782 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60492-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypokinesia|Rigidity]] is stiffness and resistance to limb movement caused by increased [[muscle tone]], an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; In parkinsonism the rigidity can be uniform ("[[lead-pipe rigidity]]") or ratchety ("[[cogwheel rigidity]]").&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banich"&gt;{{cite book |name-list-format=vanc | last1=Banich | first1=Marie T. | last2=Compton | first2=Rebecca J. |chapter=Motor control | title=Cognitive neuroscience|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage learning|location=Belmont, CA|year=2011 |pages= 108–44|isbn=978-0-8400-3298-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine|page=486 |date=4 January 2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |name-list-format=vanc | last1= Longmore|first1=Murray|last2= Wilkinson|first2=Ian B.|last3= Turmezei|first3=Tom|last4=Cheung|first4=Chee Kay |isbn=978-0-19-856837-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of tremor and increased tone is considered to be at the origin of cogwheel rigidity.&lt;ref name="Jankovic_book-Rigidity"&gt;{{Cite book |name-list-format=vanc | last1=Fung | first1=Victor S.

Davis|location=Philadelphia |pages=856–57 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the progression of the disease, rigidity typically affects the whole body and reduces the ability to move.

[[Balance disorder|Postural instability]] is typical in the later stages of the disease, leading to impaired balance and frequent falls,&lt;ref name="OFP"/&gt; and secondarily to [[bone fracture]]s, loss of confidence, and reduced mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Hallett|author2=Werner Poewe|title=Therapeutics of Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEezGoZ4h7YC&amp;pg=PA417|date=13 October 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-71400-3|page=417|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908154209/https://books.google.com/books?id=fEezGoZ4h7YC&amp;pg=PA417|archive-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instability is often absent in the initial stages, especially in younger people, especially prior to the development of bilateral symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoehn MM, Yahr MD | title = Parkinsonism: onset, progression and mortality | journal = Neurology | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 427–42 | date = May 1967 | pmid = 6067254 | doi = 10.1212/wnl.17.5.427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 40% of people diagnosed with PD may experience falls and around 10% may have falls weekly, with the number of falls being related to the severity of PD.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;

Other recognized motor signs and symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as [[Parkinsonian gait|festination]] (rapid shuffling steps and a [[camptocormia|forward-flexed posture]] when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rajesh Pahwa|author2=Kelly E.

===Neuropsychiatric===
Parkinson's disease can cause [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disturbances, which can range from mild to severe. This includes disorders of cognition, mood, behavior, and thought.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;

Cognitive disturbances can occur in the early stages of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballol N, Martí MJ, Tolosa E | title = Cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson disease | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 22 Suppl 17 | issue = Suppl 17 | pages = S358–66 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 18175397 | doi = 10.1002/mds.21677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cognitive deficit in PD is [[executive dysfunction]], which can include problems with planning, [[cognitive flexibility]], abstract thinking, rule acquisition, [[Inhibitory control|inhibiting inappropriate actions]], initiating appropriate actions, [[working memory]], and [[Attentional control|control of attention]].&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PD timing review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parker KL, Lamichhane D, Caetano MS, Narayanan NS | title = Executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and timing deficits | journal = Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = 75 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24198770 | pmc = 3813949 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2013.00075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cognitive difficulties include [[bradyphrenia|slowed cognitive processing speed]], impaired [[Recall (memory)|recall]] and impaired perception and estimation of time.&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PD timing review" /&gt; Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues.&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"/&gt; Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines.&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PD timing review" /&gt;

A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"/&gt; Up to 78% of people with PD have Parkinson's disease dementia.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomperts SN |title=Lewy Body Dementias: Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia |journal=Continuum (Minneap Minn) |volume=22 |issue=2 Dementia |pages=435–63 |date=April 2016 |pmid=27042903 |pmc=5390937 |doi=10.1212/CON.0000000000000309|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of dementia increases with age and, to a lesser degree, duration of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garcia-Ptacek S, Kramberger MG | title = Parkinson Disease and Dementia | journal = Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 261–70 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27502301 | doi = 10.1177/0891988716654985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dementia is associated with a reduced [[quality of life]] in people with PD and their [[caregiver]]s, increased mortality, and a higher probability of needing [[nursing home care]].&lt;ref name="pmid18175397"/&gt;

Impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive shopping and reckless generosity can be caused by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]] – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).

Behavior and mood alterations are more common in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[apathy]], and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; Establishing the diagnosis of depression is complicated by the fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a [[generalized anxiety disorder]] to [[social phobia]], [[panic disorder]]s and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]s. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.

[[Punding]] in which complicated repetitive aimless [[Stereotypy|stereotyped behaviors]] occur for many hours is another disturbance caused by anti-Parkinson medication.

[[Hallucination]]s or [[delusion]]s occur in approximately 50% of people with PD over the course of the illness, and may herald the emergence of dementia. These range from minor hallucinations – "sense of passage" (something quickly passing beside the person) or "sense of presence" (the perception of something/someone standing just to the side or behind the person) – to full blown vivid, [[Positive visual phenomena#Hallucinations|formed visual hallucinations]] and [[paranoid]] ideation. Auditory hallucinations are uncommon in PD, and are rarely described as voices. It is now believed that psychosis is an integral part of the disease. A psychosis with delusions and associated [[delirium]] is a recognized complication of anti-Parkinson drug treatment and may also be caused by urinary tract infections (as frequently occurs in the fragile elderly), but drugs and infection are not the only factors, and underlying brain pathology or changes in neurotransmitters or their receptors (e.g., acetylcholine, serotonin) are also thought to play a role in psychosis in PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shergill SS, Walker Z, Le Katona C | title = A preliminary investigation of laterality in Parkinson's disease and susceptibility to psychosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 610–1 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9771806 | pmc = 2170290 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.65.4.610 | url = http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9771806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20538500"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman JH | title = Parkinson's disease psychosis 2010: a review article | journal = Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 553–60 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20538500 | doi = 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2010.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In addition to neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms, PD can impair other functions.

Sleep problems are a feature of the disease and can be worsened by medications.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; Symptoms can manifest as daytime [[somnolence|drowsiness]] (including sudden sleep attacks resembling [[narcolepsy]]), disturbances in [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] sleep, or [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; REM behavior disorder (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or DLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YE, Jeon BS | title = Clinical implication of REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Parkinson's Disease | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–44 | date = 1 January 2014 | pmid = 24613864 | doi = 10.3233/jpd-130293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alterations in the [[autonomic nervous system]] can lead to [[orthostatic hypotension]] (low blood pressure upon standing), [[Seborrhea|oily skin]] and excessive sweating, [[urinary incontinence]], and altered sexual function.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; [[Constipation]] and [[Intestinal pseudoobstruction|impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility)]] can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and [[paresthesia]] (tingling and numbness).&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of Parkinson's disease}}

===Environmental factors===
Exposure to [[pesticides]] and a history of head injury have each been linked with Parkinson disease (PD), but the risks are modest. Never having smoked cigarettes, and never drinking caffeinated beverages, are also associated with small increases in risk of developing PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noyce AJ, Bestwick JP, Silveira-Moriyama L, Hawkes CH, Giovannoni G, Lees AJ, Schrag A | title = Meta-analysis of early nonmotor features and risk factors for Parkinson disease | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 893–901 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23071076 | pmc = 3556649 | doi = 10.1002/ana.23687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low concentrations of [[Uric acid|urate]] in the blood [[Serous fluid|serum]] is associated with an increased risk of PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chahine LM, Stern MB, Chen-Plotkin A | title = Blood-based biomarkers for Parkinson's disease | journal = Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders | volume = 20 Suppl 1 | pages = S99–103 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24262199 | pmc = 4070332 | doi = 10.1016/S1353-8020(13)70025-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
[[File:Structure of parkin.png|thumb|Parkin crystal structure]]
Research indicates that PD is the product of a complex interaction of genetic and [[environmental factor]]s.&lt;ref name=Lancet2015/&gt; Around 15% of individuals with PD have a [[First-degree relatives|first-degree relative]] who has the disease,&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt; and 5–10% of people with PD are known to have forms of the disease that occur because of a [[mutation]] in one of several specific genes.&lt;ref name=lesage&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesage S, Brice A | title = Parkinson's disease: from monogenic forms to genetic susceptibility factors | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = R1 | pages = R48–59 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19297401 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddp012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harboring one of these gene mutations may not lead to the disease; susceptibility factors put the individual at an increased risk, often in combination with other risk factors, which also affect age of onset, severity and progression.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt;

Genes implicated in the development of PD include [[Alpha-synuclein|SNCA]], [[LRRK2]], [[Glucocerebrosidase|GBA]], [[Parkin (ligase)|PRKN]], [[PINK1]], [[PARK7]], [[VPS35]], [[EIF4G1]], [[DNAJC13]] and [[CHCHD2]].&lt;ref name=pmid25904081&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalia LV, Lang AE | title = Parkinson's disease | journal = Lancet | volume = 386 | issue = 9996 | pages = 896–912 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25904081 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61393-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNCA gene mutations are important in PD because the protein which this gene encodes, [[alpha-synuclein]], is the main component of the [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]] that accumulate in the brains of people with PD.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt; Mutations in some genes, including SNCA, LRRK2 and GBA, have been found to be risk factors for "sporadic" (non-familial) PD.&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt; Mutations in the gene LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.&lt;ref name="pmid18398010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davie CA | title = A review of Parkinson's disease | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–27 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18398010 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/ldn013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lesage/&gt; A mutation in GBA presents the greatest genetic risk of developing Parkinsons disease.&lt;ref name=pmid25904081/&gt;

Several Parkinson-related genes are involved in the function of [[lysosome]]s, organelles that digest cellular waste products. It has been suggested that some cases of PD may be caused by [[lysosome dysfunction]]s that reduce the ability of cells to break down alpha-synuclein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gan-Or Z, Dion PA, Rouleau GA | title = Genetic perspective on the role of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in Parkinson disease | journal = Autophagy | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 1443–57 | date = 2 September 2015 | pmid = 26207393 | pmc = 4590678 | doi = 10.1080/15548627.2015.1067364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main [[Pathology|pathological]] characteristics of PD are cell death in the brain's [[basal ganglia]] (affecting up to 70% of the [[dopaminergic|dopamine secreting]] neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] [[pars compacta]] by the end of life)&lt;ref name="pmid18398010"/&gt; and the presence of [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]] (accumulations of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]]) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of [[astrocyte]]s (star-shaped [[neuroglia|glial]] cells) and a significant increase in the number of [[microglia]] (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.&lt;ref name="Jankovic_book-Neuropathology"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7881-7|veditors=Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ|location=Hagerstown, MD|pages=271–83|chapter=Neuropathology of movement disorders|author=Dickson DV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five major pathways in the brain connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the [[Motor cortex|motor]], [[Frontal eye fields|oculo-motor]], [[Cerebral cortex#Association areas|associative]], [[Limbic system|limbic]] and [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]] circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit.&lt;ref name="pmid18781672"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeso JA, Rodríguez-Oroz MC, Benitez-Temino B, Blesa FJ, Guridi J, Marin C, Rodriguez M | title = Functional organization of the basal ganglia: therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 23 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S548–59 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18781672 | doi = 10.1002/mds.22062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits are involved in a wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning.&lt;ref name="pmid18781672"/&gt; Scientifically, the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively.&lt;ref name="pmid18781672"/&gt;

A particular conceptual model of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications.&lt;ref name="pmid18781672"/&gt; In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence on a wide range of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibition]] is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce [[hypokinesia]], an overall reduction in motor output.&lt;ref name="pmid18781672"/&gt;  Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing [[dyskinesia]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid18781672"/&gt;

===Brain cell death===
There is speculation of several mechanisms by which the brain cells could be lost.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to [[ubiquitin]] in the damaged cells. This insoluble [[protein]] accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies.&lt;ref name="pmid18398010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20563819"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulz-Schaeffer WJ | title = The synaptic pathology of alpha-synuclein aggregation in dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–43 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20563819 | pmc = 2892607 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-010-0711-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Braak staging]], a classification of the disease based on pathological findings proposed by [[Heiko Braak]], Lewy bodies first appear in the [[olfactory bulb]], [[medulla oblongata]] and [[pontine tegmentum]]; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the [[midbrain]] and basal [[forebrain]] and, finally, the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid18398010"/&gt; These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death and they may be protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., [[oligomer]]s) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and [[Lewy body|Lewy neurites]] may actually be the toxic forms of the protein.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20563819"/&gt; In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. [[Neurofibrillary tangle]]s and [[senile plaques]], characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]], are not common unless the person is demented.&lt;ref name="Jankovic_book-Neuropathology"/&gt;

Other cell-death mechanisms include [[Proteasome|proteasomal]] and [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] system dysfunction and reduced [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] activity.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed in conjunction with the protein inclusions. It may be related to [[oxidative stress]], [[protein aggregation]] and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.&lt;ref name="pmid20082992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirsch EC | title = Iron transport in Parkinson's disease | journal = Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders | volume = 15 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S209–11 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20082992 | doi = 10.1016/S1353-8020(09)70816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
A physician will initially assess for Parkinson's disease with a careful [[medical history]] and [[neurological examination]].&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; People may be given levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on [[autopsy]] is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nice-Diagnosis"&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease| editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians| location=London| year=2006| isbn=978-1-86016-283-1| pages=29–47| deadurl=no| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| archive-date=24 September 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes that can secondarily produce parkinsonism are [[stroke]] and drugs.&lt;ref name="Nice-Diagnosis"/&gt; [[Parkinson plus syndrome]]s such as [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] and [[multiple system atrophy]] must be [[Differential diagnosis|ruled out]].&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes.&lt;ref name=Jankovic2008/&gt; Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself.&lt;ref name="pmid12464118"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poewe W, Wenning G | title = The differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 9 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = 23–30 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12464118 | doi = 10.1046/j.1468-1331.9.s3.3.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic forms with an autosomal [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] or [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] pattern of inheritance are sometimes referred to as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt;

Medical organizations have created [[Medical diagnosis#Diagnostic criteria|diagnostic criteria]] to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, especially in the early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of [[dyskinesia]]s induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibb WR, Lees AJ | title = The relevance of the Lewy body to the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 6 | pages = 745–52 | date = June 1988 | pmid = 2841426 | pmc = 1033142 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.51.6.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When PD diagnoses are checked by autopsy, movement disorders experts are found on average to be 79.6% accurate at initial assessment and 83.9% accurate after they have refined their diagnosis at a follow-up examination. When clinical diagnoses performed mainly by nonexperts are checked by autopsy, average accuracy is 73.8%. Overall, 80.6% of PD diagnoses are accurate, and 82.7% of diagnoses using the Brain Bank criteria are accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizzo G, Copetti M, Arcuti S, Martino D, Fontana A, Logroscino G | title = Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Neurology | volume = 86 | issue = 6 | pages = 566–76 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26764028 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000002350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A task force of the [[The Movement Disorder Society|International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society]] (MDS) has proposed diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s disease as well as research criteria for the diagnosis of [[Prodrome|prodromal]] disease, but these will require validation against the more established criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Postuma RB, Berg D, Stern M, Poewe W, Olanow CW, Oertel W, Obeso J, Marek K, Litvan I, Lang AE, Halliday G, Goetz CG, Gasser T, Dubois B, Chan P, Bloem BR, Adler CH, Deuschl G | title = MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1591–601 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26474316 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berg D, Postuma RB, Adler CH, Bloem BR, Chan P, Dubois B, Gasser T, Goetz CG, Halliday G, Joseph L, Lang AE, Liepelt-Scarfone I, Litvan I, Marek K, Obeso J, Oertel W, Olanow CW, Poewe W, Stern M, Deuschl G | title = MDS research criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1600–11 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26474317 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dopamine-related activity in the basal ganglia can be directly measured with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] scans. A finding of reduced dopamine-related activity in the basal ganglia can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced basal ganglia dopamine-related activity is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.&lt;ref name="pmid20351351"/&gt;

[[Antioxidant]]s, such as [[Vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[Vitamin E|E]], have been proposed to protect against the disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven.&lt;ref name="pmid16713924"/&gt; The results regarding fat and [[fatty acid]]s have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects.&lt;ref name="pmid16713924"/&gt; There have been preliminary indications that the use of [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|anti-inflammatory]] drugs and [[calcium channel blocker]]s may be protective.&lt;ref name="Lancet2015" /&gt; A 2010 [[meta-analysis]] found that [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (apart from [[aspirin]]), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name="Gagne-2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagne JJ, Power MC | title = Anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of Parkinson disease: a meta-analysis | journal = Neurology | volume = 74 | issue = 12 | pages = 995–1002 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20308684 | pmc = 2848103 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181d5a4a3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Management of Parkinson's disease}}
[[File:Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease.png|thumb|Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease]]
There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications, surgery, and [[Physical therapy|physical treatment]] can provide relief and are much more effective than treatments available for other neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, [[motor neuron disease]], and [[Parkinson plus syndrome]]s.  The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are [[L-DOPA|levodopa]] (always combined with a [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor|dopa decarboxylase inhibitor]] and sometimes also with a [[COMT inhibitor]]), [[dopamine agonist]]s and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]]. The stage of the disease and the age at disease onset determine which group is most useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connolly BS, Lang AE | title = Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson disease: a review | journal = JAMA | volume = 311 | issue = 16 | pages = 1670–83 | date = 23–30 April 2014 | pmid = 24756517 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.3654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three stages may be distinguished: an initial stage in which the individual with PD has already developed some disability requiring pharmacological treatment, a second stage associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/743205140|title=Parkinson's Disease : Non-Motor and Non-Dopaminergic Features|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|chapter=The non-motor and non-dopaminergic fratures of PD|others=Olanow, C. Warren., Stocchi, Fabrizio., Lang, Anthony E.|isbn=978-1405191852|oclc=743205140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment in the first stage aims for an optimal trade off between symptom control and treatment side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson's disease| editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians| location=London| year=2006| isbn=978-1-86016-283-1| pages=59–100| deadurl=no| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| archive-date=24 September 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients whose quality of life is impaired by those symptoms. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not really provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Tan LC | title = Revisiting the Medical Management of Parkinson's Disease: Levodopa versus Dopamine Agonist | journal = Current Neuropharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 356–63 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26644151 | pmc = 4876591 | doi = 10.2174/1570159X14666151208114634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second stage the aim is to reduce PD symptoms while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedrosa DJ, Timmermann L | title = Review: management of Parkinson's disease | journal = Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment | volume = 9 | pages = 321–40 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23487540 | pmc = 3592512 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S32302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final stages of the disease, [[palliative care]] is provided to improve quality of life.&lt;ref name="Nice-palliative"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Palliative care in Parkinson's disease | editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions | title=Parkinson's Disease | url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English | publisher=Royal College of Physicians | location=London | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-86016-283-1 | pages=147–51 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English | archive-date=24 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===

====Levodopa====
The motor symptoms of PD are the result of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the [[blood-brain barrier]], so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms of PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt;

Only 5–10% of levodopa crosses the blood–brain barrier. Much of the remainder is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including [[nausea]], vomiting and [[orthostatic hypotension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=10|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/993068595|title=Levodopa pharmacokinetics -from stomach to brain A study on patients with Parkinson's disease.|last=Maria|first=Nord|date=2017|publisher=Linköping University Electronic Press|isbn=9789176855577|location=Linköping|oclc=993068595}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbidopa]] and [[benserazide]] are [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor|dopa decarboxylase inhibitors]] which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oertel WH | title = Recent advances in treating Parkinson's disease | journal = F1000Research | volume = 6 | pages = 260 | date = 13 March 2017 | pmid = 28357055 | pmc = 5357034 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.10100.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levodopa use leads in the long term to the development of complications: involuntary movements called [[dyskinesia]]s, and fluctuations in the effectiveness of the medication.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt; When fluctuations occur, a person can cycle through phases with good response to medication and reduced PD symptoms ("on" state), and phases with poor response to medication and significant PD symptoms ("off" state).&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; Using lower doses of levodopa may reduce the risk and severity of these levodopa-induced complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aquino CC, Fox SH | title = Clinical spectrum of levodopa-induced complications | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–9 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25488260 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A former strategy to reduce levodopa-related dyskinesia and fluctuations was to withdraw levodopa medication for some time. This is now discouraged since it can bring on dangerous side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt; Most people with PD will eventually need levodopa and will later develop levodopa-induced fluctuations and dyskinesias.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt;

There are [[Modified-release dosage (medicine)|controlled-release]] versions of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] and [[bioavailability]] and have not demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation does seem to be more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by [[gastroparesis]]. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====COMT inhibitors====
[[Tolcapone]] inhibits the activity [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT]], an enzyme which degrades dopamine.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; It has been used to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; A similarly effective drug, [[entacapone]], has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt;

====Dopamine agonists====
Several [[dopamine agonist]]s that bind to dopamine receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt; These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldenberg MM | title = Medical management of Parkinson's disease | journal = P &amp; T | volume = 33 | issue = 10 | pages = 590–606 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 19750042 | pmc = 2730785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine agonists include [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[piribedil]], [[cabergoline]], [[apomorphine]] and [[lisuride]].

Though dopamine agonists are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, they are usually effective enough to manage these symptoms in the first years of treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt; Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset.&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt; Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt;

Dopamine agonists produce significant, although usually mild, side effects including [[somnolence|drowsiness]], hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt; Sometimes side effects appear even at a minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician to search for a different drug.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa.&lt;ref name="pmid20123548"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ceravolo R, Frosini D, Rossi C, Bonuccelli U | title = Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: definition, epidemiology, risk factors, neurobiology and management | journal = Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders | volume = 15 Suppl 4 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = S111–5 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20123548 | doi = 10.1016/S1353-8020(09)70847-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.&lt;ref name="pmid15172778"/&gt;

[[Apomorphine]], a non-orally administered dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt; It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous [[Hypodermoclysis|subcutaneous infusions]].&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches ([[lisuride]] and [[rotigotine]]) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.&lt;ref name="Jankovic_book-Pharma"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7881-7|veditors=Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ|location=Hagerstwon, MD|pages=110–45|chapter=Pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease|vauthors=Tolosa E, Katzenschlager R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MAO-B inhibitors====
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]] ([[safinamide]], [[selegiline]] and [[rasagiline]]) increase the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of [[monoamine oxidase B]] (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma"/&gt; Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt;

====Other drugs====
{{Main|Antiparkinson medication}}
Other drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[anticholinergic]]s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments.&lt;ref name="Nice-pharma" /&gt; In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems.&lt;ref name="Nice-NonMotor"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Non-motor features of Parkinson's disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Parkinson's Disease|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86016-283-1|pages=113–33|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|archive-date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the use of [[quetiapine]] for psychosis, [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|cholinesterase inhibitors]] for dementia, and [[modafinil]] for [[excessive daytime sleepiness|daytime sleepiness]].&lt;ref name="Nice-NonMotor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19559160"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hasnain M, Vieweg WV, Baron MS, Beatty-Brooks M, Fernandez A, Pandurangi AK | title = Pharmacological management of psychosis in elderly patients with parkinsonism | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 122 | issue = 7 | pages = 614–22 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19559160 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.01.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[pimavanserin]] was approved for the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Announcements - FDA approves first drug to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease |url=https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm498442.htm |website=www.fda.gov |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doxepin and rasagline may reduce physical fatigue in PD.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elbers RG, Verhoef J, van Wegen EE, Berendse HW, Kwakkel G | title = Interventions for fatigue in Parkinson's disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD010925 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26447539 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010925.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
[[File:Parkinson surgery.jpg|upright|thumb|Placement of an electrode into the brain. The head is stabilised in a frame for [[stereotactic surgery]].]]
Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined.&lt;ref name="Nice-surgery"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Surgery for Parkinson's disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Parkinson's Disease|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86016-283-1|pages=101–11|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|archive-date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient.&lt;ref name="Nice-surgery" /&gt; Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]]  or the [[subthalamic nucleus]].&lt;ref name="Nice-surgery" /&gt;  Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by [[Alim Louis Benabid]] and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a [[Neurostimulation|neurostimulator]], which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe [[wikt:neuropsychiatric|neuropsychiatric]] problems.&lt;ref name="pmid20937936"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, Lozano AM, Volkmann J, Stefani A, Horak FB, Okun MS, Foote KD, Krack P, Pahwa R, Henderson JM, Hariz MI, Bakay RA, Rezai A, Marks WJ, Moro E, Vitek JL, Weaver FM, Gross RE, DeLong MR | title = Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease: an expert consensus and review of key issues | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 165 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20937936 | pmc = 4523130 | doi = 10.1001/archneurol.2010.260 | displayauthors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific [[wikt:subcortical|subcortical]] areas. For example, [[pallidotomy]] involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.&lt;ref name="Nice-surgery" /&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
{{Further|Rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease}}
Exercise programs are recommended in people with Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name=Neuro2011/&gt; There is some evidence that speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality.&lt;ref name="Nice-rehab"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Other key interventions|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Parkinson's Disease|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86016-283-1|pages=135–46|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|archive-date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18181210"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwin VA, Richards SH, Taylor RS, Taylor AH, Campbell JL | title = The effectiveness of exercise interventions for people with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 631–40 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18181210 | doi = 10.1002/mds.21922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular [[physical exercise]] with or without [[physical therapy]] can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life.&lt;ref name="pmid18181210" /&gt; When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dereli EE, Yaliman A | title = Comparison of the effects of a physiotherapist-supervised exercise programme and a self-supervised exercise programme on quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 352–62 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20360152 | doi = 10.1177/0269215509358933 | url = http://cre.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20360152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing [[Hypokinesia|rigidity]], generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension.

Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, but are not limited to improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan|Schmitz|2007|p=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan|Schmitz|2007|p=877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease,  deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan|Schmitz|2007|p=880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise may improve constipation.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; It is unclear if exercise reduces physical fatigue in PD.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Palliative care===

Along with offering emotional support to both the patient and family, palliative care serves an important role in addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for [[feeding tube]], [[non-invasive ventilation|non-invasive ventilator]], and [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]]; wishes for or against [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]; and when to use [[hospice]] care.&lt;ref name="pmid24182372" /&gt; Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.&lt;ref name="pmid20081638" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24195263"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casey G | title = Parkinson's disease: a long and difficult journey | journal = Nursing New Zealand | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 20–4 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24195263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, resulting in [[constipation]] and [[gastroparesis]] (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period than normal).&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties ([[dysphagia]]) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use [[thickening agent]]s for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. [[Gastrostomy]] to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt;

Levodopa and [[protein]]s use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; When they are taken together, this results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive [[Protein (nutrient)|protein consumption]] is discouraged and well balanced [[Mediterranean diet]] is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt; At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.&lt;ref name="pmid19691125"/&gt;

PD invariably progresses with time. A severity rating method known as the [[Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale]] (UPDRS) is the most commonly used metric for clinical study. A modified version known as the MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the [[Hoehn and Yahr scale]] (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.

Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent [[ambulation]] after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; Age is the best predictor of disease progression.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;

Since current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear. Disability is initially related to motor symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poewe W | title = The natural history of Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Neurology | volume = 253 Suppl 7 | issue = Suppl 7 | pages = VII2–6 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17131223 | doi = 10.1007/s00415-006-7002-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication, such as swallowing/speech difficulties, and gait/balance problems;  and also to levodopa-induced complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; All of these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt;

The [[life expectancy]] of people with PD is reduced.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; [[Standardized mortality ratio|Mortality ratios]] are around twice those of unaffected people.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; Cognitive decline and dementia, old age at onset, a more advanced disease state and presence of swallowing problems are all mortality [[risk factor]]s.  On the other hand, a disease pattern mainly characterized by tremor as opposed to rigidity predicts an improved survival.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt; Death from [[aspiration pneumonia]] is twice as common in individuals with PD as in the healthy population.&lt;ref name="pmid17131223" /&gt;

In 2013 PD resulted in about 103,000 deaths globally, up from 44,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name="GDB2013" /&gt; The death rate increased from an average of 1.5 to 1.8 per 100,000 during that time.&lt;ref name="GDB2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 | journal = Lancet | volume = 385 | issue = 9963 | pages = 117–71 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25530442 | pmc = 4340604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl2&amp;pii=S0140673614616822 | author1 = GBD 2013 Mortality Causes of Death Collaborators }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charcot1893.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Martin Charcot]], who made important contributions to the understanding of the disease and proposed its current name honoring [[James Parkinson]]]]
Several early sources, including an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[papyrus]], an [[ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medical treatise, the [[Bible]], and [[Galen]]'s writings, describe symptoms resembling those of PD.&lt;ref name="pmid15568171"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = García Ruiz PJ | title = [Prehistory of Parkinson's disease] | language = Spanish | journal = Neurologia | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 735–7 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15568171 | trans-title = [Prehistory of Parkinson's disease] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Galen there are no references unambiguously related to PD until the 17th century.&lt;ref name="pmid15568171" /&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, several authors wrote about elements of the disease, including [[Franciscus Sylvius|Sylvius]], [[Hieronymus David Gaubius|Gaubius]], [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]] and [[Auguste François Chomel|Chomel]].&lt;ref name="pmid15568171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19892136"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanska DJ | title = Chapter 33: the history of movement disorders | volume = 95 | pages = 501–46 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19892136 | doi = 10.1016/S0072-9752(08)02133-7 | isbn = 9780444520098 | series = Handbook of Clinical Neurology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9380070"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koehler PJ, Keyser A | title = Tremor in Latin texts of Dutch physicians: 16th-18th centuries | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 798–806 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9380070 | doi = 10.1002/mds.870120531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817 an English doctor, [[James Parkinson]], published his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans.&lt;ref name="pmid18175393"/&gt; ''An Essay on the Shaking Palsy'' described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, and the way that the disease progresses over time.&lt;ref name="An Essay on the Shaking Palsy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9399240"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Louis ED | title = The shaking palsy, the first forty-five years: a journey through the British literature | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1068–72 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9399240 | doi = 10.1002/mds.870120638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include [[Armand Trousseau|Trousseau]], [[William Gowers (neurologist)|Gowers]], [[Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson|Kinnier Wilson]] and [[Wilhelm Heinrich Erb|Erb]], and most notably [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid18175393"/&gt; Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia.&lt;ref name="pmid18175393"/&gt; He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.&lt;ref name="pmid18175393"/&gt;

In 1912 [[Frederic Lewy]] described microscopic particles in affected brains, later named "[[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]]".&lt;ref name="pmid18175393"/&gt; In 1919 [[Konstantin Tretiakoff]] reported that the substantia nigra was the main cerebral structure affected, but this finding was not widely accepted until it was confirmed by further studies published by [[Rolf Hassler]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="pmid18175393"/&gt; The underlying [[biochemical]] changes in the [[brain]] were identified in the 1950s, due largely to the work of [[Arvid Carlsson]] on the neurotransmitter dopamine and [[Oleh Hornykiewicz]] on its role on PD.&lt;ref name="pmid18781671" /&gt; In 1997, alpha-synuclein was found to be the main component of Lewy bodies by [[Maria Grazia Spillantini|Spillantini]], [[John Q. Trojanowski|Trojanowski]], [[Michel Goedert|Goedert]] and others.&lt;ref name="pmid20563819"/&gt;

Anticholinergics and surgery (lesioning of the [[corticospinal pathway]] or some of the basal ganglia structures) were the only treatments until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically.&lt;ref name="pmid19892136" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9361073"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guridi J, Lozano AM | title = A brief history of pallidotomy | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 1169–80; discussion 1180–3 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9361073 | doi = 10.1097/00006123-199711000-00029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Levodopa]] was first synthesized in 1911 by [[Casimir Funk]], but it received little attention until the mid 20th century.&lt;ref name="pmid18781671" /&gt; It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD.&lt;ref name="pmid18781671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fahn S | title = The history of dopamine and levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 23 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S497–508 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18781671 | doi = 10.1002/mds.22028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hornykiewicz O | title = L-DOPA: from a biologically inactive amino acid to a successful therapeutic agent | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 23 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 65–70 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12373520 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-001-0111-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s [[deep brain stimulation]] introduced by [[Alim Louis Benabid]] and colleagues at [[Grenoble]], France, emerged as a possible treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid18684199"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coffey RJ | title = Deep brain stimulation devices: a brief technical history and review | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–20 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 18684199 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2008.00620.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
[[File:Pdtulip-aware3-72dpi.jpg|thumb|125px|"Parkinson's awareness" logo with red tulip symbol]]

Fox]] has PD and has greatly increased the public awareness of the disease.&lt;ref name="MJF_TIME"/&gt; After diagnosis, Fox embraced his Parkinson's in television roles, sometimes acting without medication, in order to further illustrate the effects of the condition. He has written two autobiographies in which his fight against the disease plays a major role,&lt;ref name="MJF_guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/11/michael-j-fox-parkinsons|title='It's the gift that keeps on taking'|date=11 April 2009|author=Brockes E|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2010|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008000425/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/11/michael-j-fox-parkinsons|archive-date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared before the [[United States Congress]] without medication to illustrate the effects of the disease.&lt;ref name="MJF_guardian" /&gt; [[The Michael J.

Professional cyclist and Olympic medalist [[Davis Phinney]], who was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's at age 40, started the [[Davis Phinney Foundation]] in 2004 to support Parkinson's research, focusing on quality of life for people with the disease.&lt;ref name=Mac2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="DPF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davisphinneyfoundation.org/dpf/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are|publisher=Davis Phinney Foundation|access-date=18 January 2012|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111054225/http://davisphinneyfoundation.org/dpf/who-we-are/|archive-date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] showed signs of Parkinson's when he was 38, but was not diagnosed until he was 42, and has been called the "world's most famous Parkinson's patient".&lt;ref name="Ali_NN_comment"/&gt; Whether he had PD or [[Dementia pugilistica|parkinsonism related to boxing]] is unresolved.&lt;ref name="Ali_NN"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurologynow/Fulltext/2006/02020/Ali_s_Fighting_Spirit.4.aspx|title=Ali's Fighting Spirit|date=April 2006|journal=Neurology Now|author=Matthews W|volume=2|issue=2|pages=10–23|access-date=2 April 2011|doi=10.1097/01222928-200602020-00004|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090013/http://journals.lww.com/neurologynow/Fulltext/2006/02020/Ali_s_Fighting_Spirit.4.aspx|archive-date=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ali_NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/magazine/ali-still-magic.html |title=Ali: Still Magic |date=17 July 1988 |author=Tauber P |work=The New York Times |access-date=2 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161117151827/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/magazine/ali-still-magic.html |archive-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{See also|Parkinson's disease clinical research}}
There is little prospect of significant new PD treatments in the near future.&lt;ref name="Dimond" /&gt; Currently active research directions include the search for new [[animal model]]s of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell]] transplants and [[neuroprotective]] agents.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;

===Animal models===
PD is not known to occur naturally in any species other than humans, although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research. The appearance of parkinsonism in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic [[opiate]] [[Desmethylprodine|MPPP]] led to the discovery of the chemical [[MPTP]] as an agent that causes parkinsonism in non-human primates as well as in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid6823561"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langston JW, Ballard P, Tetrud JW, Irwin I | title = Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis | journal = Science | volume = 219 | issue = 4587 | pages = 979–80 | date = February 1983 | pmid = 6823561 | doi = 10.1126/science.6823561 | bibcode = 1983Sci...219..979L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide [[rotenone]], the herbicide paraquat and the fungicide [[maneb]].&lt;ref name="pmid19729209"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cicchetti F, Drouin-Ouellet J, Gross RE | title = Environmental toxins and Parkinson's disease: what have we learned from pesticide-induced animal models? | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 9 | pages = 475–83 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19729209 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2009.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Models based on toxins are most commonly used in [[primate]]s.  [[Transgene|Transgenic]] rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed.&lt;ref name="pmid18642640"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harvey BK, Wang Y, Hoffer BJ | title = Transgenic rodent models of Parkinson's disease | journal = Acta Neurochirurgica.

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy typically involves the use of a non-infectious [[virus]] (i.e., a [[viral vector]] such as the [[adeno-associated virus]]) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an [[enzyme]] that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20155994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feng LR, Maguire-Zeiss KA | title = Gene therapy in Parkinson's disease: rationale and current status | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–92 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20155994 | pmc = 2886503 | doi = 10.2165/11533740-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; One of these reported positive results in 2011,&lt;ref name="pmid21419704"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = LeWitt PA, Rezai AR, Leehey MA, Ojemann SG, Flaherty AW, Eskandar EN, Kostyk SK, Thomas K, Sarkar A, Siddiqui MS, Tatter SB, Schwalb JM, Poston KL, Henderson JM, Kurlan RM, Richard IH, Van Meter L, Sapan CV, During MJ, Kaplitt MG, Feigin A | title = AAV2-GAD gene therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, sham-surgery controlled, randomised trial | journal = The Lancet.

===Neuroprotective treatments===
[[File:GDNF.jpg|thumb|Several chemical compounds, such as [[Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor|GDNF]] (chemical structure pictured) have been proposed as neuroprotectors in PD, but their effectiveness has not been proven.]]
Investigations on [[neuroprotection]] are at the forefront of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; Agents currently under investigation include [[apoptosis|anti-apoptotics]] ([[omigapil]], [[CEP-1347]]), [[Glutamic acid|antiglutamatergics]], [[monoamine oxidase]] inhibitors ([[selegiline]], [[rasagiline]]), [[Mitochondrion|promitochondrials]] ([[coenzyme Q10]], [[creatine]]), [[calcium channel blocker]]s ([[isradipine]]) and [[growth factor]]s ([[Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor|GDNF]]).&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; Preclinical research also targets [[alpha-synuclein]].&lt;ref name="Dimond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/no-new-parkinson-disease-drug-expected-anytime-soon/77899336/|title=No New Parkinson Disease Drug Expected Anytime Soon|author=Dimond PF|date=16 August 2010|work=GEN news highlights|publisher=GEN-Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031023451/http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/no-new-parkinson-disease-drug-expected-anytime-soon/77899336/|archive-date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[vaccine]] that primes the human immune system to destroy [[alpha-synuclein]], PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.&lt;ref name="NS1"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428682.000-worlds-first-parkinsons-vaccine-is-trialled.html |title=World's first Parkinson's vaccine is trialled |date=7 June 2012 |work=New Scientist |deadurl=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150423080305/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428682.000-worlds-first-parkinsons-vaccine-is-trialled.html |location= London |archive-date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural transplantation===
Since early in the 1980s, [[fetus|fetal]], [[pig|porcine]], [[Common carotid artery|carotid]] or [[retina]]l tissues have been used in cell transplants, in which dissociated cells are injected into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine-producing cells that have been lost.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;  Although there was initial evidence of [[Mesencephalon|mesencephalic]] dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|double-blind trials]] to date indicate that cell transplants produce no long-term benefit.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeso JA, Rodriguez-Oroz MC, Goetz CG, Marin C, Kordower JH, Rodriguez M, Hirsch EC, Farrer M, Schapira AH, Halliday G | title = Missing pieces in the Parkinson's disease puzzle | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 653–61 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20495568 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to [[dystonia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redmond DE | title = Cellular replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease--where we are today? | journal = The Neuroscientist | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 457–88 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12374430 | doi = 10.1177/107385802237703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stem cell]] transplants are a recent research target, because stem cells are easy to manipulate and stem cells transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys have been found to survive and reduce behavioral abnormalities.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061204123212.htm|title=Stem Cell Research Aims to Tackle Parkinson's Disease|access-date=16 April 2010|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417113530/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061204123212.htm|archive-date=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]].&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt; It has been proposed that effective treatments may be developed in a less controversial way by use of [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s taken from adults.&lt;ref name="pmid20495568"/&gt;

The role of the [[gut–brain axis]] and the [[gut flora]] in Parkinsons became a topic of study in the 2010s, starting  with work in germ-free transgenic mice, in which [[fecal transplant]]s from people with PD had worse outcomes. Some studies in humans have shown a correlation between patterns of [[dysbiosis]] in the gut flora in the people with PD, and these patterns, along with a measure of severity of constipation, could diagnose PD with a 90% specificity but only a 67% sensitivity. As of 2017 some scientists hypothesized that changes in the gut flora might be an early site of PD pathology, or might be part of the pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tremlett |first1=H |last2=Bauer |first2=KC |last3=Appel-Cresswell |first3=S |last4=Finlay |first4=BB |last5=Waubant |first5=E |title=The gut microbiome in human neurological disease: A review |journal=Annals of Neurology |date=March 2017 |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=369–382 |doi=10.1002/ana.24901 |pmid=28220542}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klingelhoefer |first1=L |last2=Reichmann |first2=H |title=The Gut and Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease |journal=International Review of Neurobiology |date=2017 |volume=134 |pages=787–809 |doi=10.1016/bs.irn.2017.05.027 |pmid=28805583|isbn=9780128126035 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Participatient''' is an academic project in the Netherland to use [[eHealth]] to involve patients in decision making during their stay. This project started at Dutch [[Hacking Health]] (DHH) and obtained the 2016 DHH national prize under the name 'Bedpartner'.&lt;ref name="smarthealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smarthealth.nl/trendition/2016/05/26/recap-dutch-hacking-health-2016/|title=Terugblik: Dutch Hacking Health 2016 - TrendITion|website=smarthealth.nl|accessdate=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lumc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lumc.nl/cen/att/1015200/lumc-magazine|website=lumc.nl|title=www.lumc.nl/cen/att/1015200/lumc-magazine|accessdate=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current app has modules with information on the ward and the admission, [[pain medication]], and urinary [[catheter]] use, with the goal to give patients the option to participate and make the hospital stay safer and more pleasant.
The app is designed to encourage communication and awareness in patients and medical staff. This will be evaluated in the PECCA project (Patient Engagement Counter CAUTI with an App), supported by the Netherlands organisation for health research and development (ZonMw).&lt;ref name="zonmw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zonmw.nl/nl/onderzoek-resultaten/preventie/programmas/project-detail/infectieziektebestrijding-2014-2017/reducing-the-risk-of-catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infections-via-a-smartphone-application-for-p/|title=Reducing the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections via a smartphone application for patients – Participatient|website=ZonMw|accessdate=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patuxai''' ([[Lao Language|Lao]]: ປະຕູໄຊ, literally meaning Victory Gate or Gate of Triumph, formerly the Anousavary or Anosavari Monument, known by the French as '''Monument Aux Morts''') is a war monument in the centre of [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]], built between 1957 and 1968. The Patuxai was dedicated to those who fought in the struggle for independence from France. In [[Roman script|romanising]] the name from the [[Laotian language]], it is variously transliterated as Patuxai, Patuxay, Patousai and Patusai. It is also called Patuxai Arch or the Arc de Triomphe of Vientiane as it resembles the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]]. However, it is typically [[Lao people|Laotian]] in design, decorated with mythological creatures such as the [[kinnari]] (half-female, half-bird).&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:fslmDKtPRxAJ:www.vientianetimes.org.la/Site_SeaGames/Tourism_Information/Web/Patuxai_2009.pdf+Patuxay&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=in&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjB2IKxiS2tWNhq-JJEp9e5W8nRJ45A-sXmlqnphX4uMx0ykY1bS0JmTbFfTKgM6TVs22ROB7gOsBrneLKYzmTOrXpI_IkE4aTcd-0rep5LSbiAXiZ9daVS7wVW4WLbZ4-3b-3n&amp;sig=AHIEtbQXhFK0JRklwtRngusSjXei9R5QRg|title=Patuxay Monument Revisited|accessdate=2010-03-30|publisher=Vientiane Times|date=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atiyah&gt;{{Cite book|last=Atiyah|first=Jeremy|author2=Rough Guides|title= Rough guide to Southeast Asia|page=565|accessdate=2010-03-30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRX5zMsCeNgC&amp;pg=PA565&amp;dq=patusai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=59CxS9nsBIrDrAf2ppH3Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=patusai&amp;f=false|publisher= Rough Guides|year=2002|isbn=1-85828-893-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Patuxai 57.jpg|thumb|right|Full view of the Patuxai]]
Patuxai is a compound word, 'Patuu' or 'patu' meaning a "door" or "gateway" and 'Xai', derivative of the [[sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] 'Jaya', which means "victory". Thus it means “Victory Gate”.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;&lt;ref name=patu/&gt; The Patuxai was built during a turbulent period Lao history. It was built when Laos was a [[constitutional monarchy]] and was originally known simply as the "Anousavali" ("memory"), dedicated memory of the [[Laos|Laotian]] soldiers who died during [[World War II]] and the independence war from France in 1949.

The monument was built using American funds and cement actually intended to build a new airport.&lt;ref name="sgold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgoldbach.de/plaintext/laos2005/511094975411ecb1f/5110949765106b114.html|title=Vientiane - Patou Say|publisher=Sgoldbach|accessdate=2010-03-30|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Laotian Government instead built the monument, which earned it the nickname of the "vertical runway".&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fay/&gt;

The monument was designed by Tham Sayasthsena, a Laotian architect. In 1957, his plans were selected out of those submitted by the Public Works Department, the Military Engineering Department, and numerous private architects. Tham received 30,000 kips for his work. The cost of construction was estimated as 63 million kips.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

In May 1975, the communist [[Pathet Lao]] overthrew the coalition government and seized power, ending the ancient monarchy and installing a half-Vietnamese prime minister. They renamed the monument Patuxai in honor of their own victory.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;ref name=patu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9Q2vMGLSO-cJ:www.laopictures.com/patuxay/patuxay.html+Patuxay&amp;cd=39&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in|title=Patuxay In Vientiane|accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diplomat&gt;{{Cite book|title= Laos Diplomatic Handbook|page=138|accessdate=2010-03-30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ8LdXbNzssC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=patuxai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-M2xS8qVE8-wrAf8m9TZAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=patuxai&amp;f=false|publisher= Int'l Business Publications|year=2007|isbn=1-4330-2885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Vientiane Patouxai Laos.jpg|thumb|right|View of the city from Patuxai]]
The Patuxai is at the end of Lang Xang Avenue in the heart of Vientiane. Patuxay Park surrounds the monument.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fay/&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Patuxai Vientiane 2.JPG|thumb|Interior decoration with depictions of the gods [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], and [[Indra]] from left to right]]
The monument has five towers that represent the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence|five principles of coexistence]] among nations of the world. They are also representative of the five Buddhist principles of  “thoughtful amiability, flexibility, honesty, honor and prosperity”.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

[[File:Laos 010.jpg|thumb|right|Archway]]
The monument, as built, has gateways on four sides oriented towards the four cardinal directions. The East-West gateways open to the Long Xang Avenue, which is used during ceremonial national parades. In front of each gate, there is a pond. The four ponds represent the open section of a lotus flower (representing reverence of Laotians to the brave warriors of the nation). The four corners of the gateways are adorned by statues of a [[Nāga|Naga]] King (mythical symbol of Laos), with a depiction signifying spraying of a jet of water (suggesting nature, fertility, welfare and happiness) into the ponds on the ground.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Two concrete staircases wind up from inside the main structure, passing through each floor, right up to the top of the monument. Viewing galleries are provided on the upper floors. The first floor has mainly the offices of the management of the monument; the kiosks dealing with tourist paraphernalia (artefacts, souvenirs and refreshments) are also housed on this floor. The second floor is an important area where a museum is housed, displaying statues and pictures of the iconic heroes and heroines of the country. 
[[File:Patou Xay Laos.JPG|thumb|Complete view from the avenue with musical fountains]]
[[File:Patuxai Honest Note.jpg|thumb|Patuxai (A very honest note)]]
The next level is an open space where four towers are built at the four corners. These towers have been decorated with frescoes of foliage. The towers are also fitted with electric lights, which are switched on during the national day and other important festivals. The small towers, with temple like ornamentation, are designed in the Laotian style and are provided with spires. Each tower has a stairway. Apart from the four corner towers, there is another central larger tower above this floor, which also has a staircase which leads to the top floor that has the viewing platform from where a panoramic view of Vientiane could be seen. A telescope is also fitted at that level to get a view of the city. Plans have been drawn to fit lifts from two diagonal corners of the monument, which are expected to be ready in 2010 when the 450th anniversary of Vientiane as the capital of Laos will be celebrated. On this occasion, the entire monument is proposed to be decorated with flowers and illuminated.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; The monumental building is not fully finished to this day, although the Laotian government have repeatedly authorized new funds.&lt;ref name="sgold"/&gt;

The musical fountain system fitted in the newly developed elegant garden was donated by the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]]. It is a popular feature for visitors and local people who visit the monuments in the afternoons.&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burke|first=Andrew|author2=Justine Vaisutis|title= Laos|page=97|accessdate=2010-03-30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jm4GBvwaF50C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=patuxai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-M2xS8qVE8-wrAf8m9TZAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=patuxai&amp;f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2007|isbn=1-74104-568-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roscommon Hospital Action Committee''' (HAC) is a campaign group established to protest against the downgrading of [[Emergency department|A&amp;E services]] at Roscommon Hospital in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Its chairman is John McDermott. McDermott was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Roscommon–South Leitrim (Dáil constituency)|Roscommon–South Leitrim constituency]] at [[Irish general election, 2011|the 2011 general election]].&lt;ref name=june_2011_protesters_confront_taoiseach/&gt;

In December 2006, the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee criticised what it called the "fudged language" of the [[Health Service Executive]] (HSE) on emergency care at Roscommon Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roscommonherald.ie/news/ojausnql/ |title=Fight for hospital still ‘as real as ever’ |date=13 December 2006 |accessdate=13 December 2006 |work=Roscommon Herald |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415151457/http://www.roscommonherald.ie/news/ojausnql/ |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2010, thousands of people marched through Roscommon to the hospital where they held hands and made a human chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0814/roscommon.html|title=8,000 protest over Roscommon hospital|date=16 August 2010|accessdate=16 August 2010|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] confirmed the downgrading of emergency services at the hospital while visiting Roscommon to open a constituency office for [[Denis Naughten]] on 27 June 2011. He was met by upset protesters.&lt;ref name=june_2011_protesters_confront_taoiseach&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0628/1224299680701.html|title=Protesters confront Taoiseach over decision to cut Roscommon services|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=28 June 2011|first=Michael|last=O'Regan|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; While campaigning ahead of the general election earlier that year, Kenny had been recorded by a journalist promising emergency care would be kept at the hospital if people voted for Naughten and [[Frank Feighan]]. In July 2011, when the downgrading of services had been confirmed and the recording made public, Kenny spoke of his regret for the confusion his words may have caused voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0710/roscommon.html|title=Kenny regrets confusion over Roscommon issue|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee protested at [[Leinster House]] and later at seven bridges over the [[River Shannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0701/roscommon.html|title=Roscommon hospital group plans protests|date=1 July 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2011, members of the Committee participated in a sit-in at the hospital's 24-hour emergency unit as it was to close down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0810/1224302180383.html|title=Pledge to continue hospital protest|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=10 August 2011|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0808/roscommon.html|title=Protest as 24/7 service ends at Roscommon hospital|date=8 August 2011|accessdate=8 August 2011|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt; A banner made from torn sheets hung on the wall outside, saying: "Our Hands Can save Lives but this is death at the hands of Fine Gael and Labour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0809/1224302094285.html|title=Protesters block doors as hospital cuts service|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011|first=Marese|last=McDonagh|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a woman walking her dog discovered files containing the personal details of hundreds of patients from the [[Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar]], in a bin outside Roscommon Hospital she gave them to the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee which passed them on to the Data Protection Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0811/breaking27.html|title=Inquiries into Roscommon files find|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011|first1=Éanna|last1=Ó Caollaí|first2=Marese|last2=McDonagh|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three investigations were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0811/roscommon.html|title=Three inquiries into dumped medical records|date=12 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2011|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexaholics_Anonymous_Logo.jpg|right|Sexaholics Anonymous logo]]

'''Sexaholics Anonymous''' ('''SA''') is one of several [[twelve-step program]]s for compulsive sexual acting-out based on the original Twelve Steps of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. SA takes its place among various twelve-step groups that seek recovery from sexual addiction: [[Sex Addicts Anonymous]], [[Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous]], [[Sexual Compulsives Anonymous]] and [[Sexual Recovery Anonymous]]. Collectively these groups are referred to as "S" groups since all their acronyms begin with that letter: SA, SAA, [[SLAA]], SCA, SRA.

SA helps recovering "sexaholics." According to the group, a sexaholic is someone for whom "[[lust]] has become an addiction."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexaholics Anonymous|year=1989|publisher=SA Literature|isbn=0-9622887-0-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SA distinguishes itself from other S groups by defining sexual [[sobriety]] as no sex with self or with partners other than with one's spouse "in the marriage between a man and a woman",&lt;ref name="Sexaholics Anonymous"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexaholics Anonymous|url=http://www.sa.org/|website=Sexaholics Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt; and progressive victory over lust.

"In defining sobriety, we do not speak for those outside Sexaholics Anonymous. We can only speak for ourselves. Thus, for the married sexaholic, sexual sobriety means having no form of sex with self or with persons other than the spouse. For the unmarried sexaholic, sexual sobriety means freedom from sex of any kind. And for all of us, single and married alike, ''sexual sobriety also includes progressive victory over lust''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexaholics Anonymous|year=1989|publisher=SA Literature|isbn=0-9622887-0-5|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group uses the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous and the book "Sexaholics Anonymous" (often referred to as "The White Book") as a guide. The White Book explains that "the sexaholic has taken himself or herself out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. He or she has lost control, no longer has the power of choice, and is not free to stop."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

==History==
Sexaholics Anonymous was founded by Roy K (in twelve-step fellowships it is customary to refer to members by their first name and the first initial of their last name, in order to preserve their anonymity). SA received permission from AA to use its Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions in 1979.&lt;ref name="Sexaholics Anonymous"/&gt;

Roy K died from cancer on the afternoon of September 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Fond Remembrance|journal=Essay|date=December 2009|page=Cover|url=https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkWNMg0R-XzbgiOo25TkSPZXgUxK|publisher=Sexaholics Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been sexually sober since January 31, 1976.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=K. |first1=Roy |title=Beginnings &amp;hellip; Notes on the Origin and Early Growth of SA |year=2003 |publisher=SA Publications |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group Commitment to Sobriety Definition ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
From the earliest attempts by Roy K to found SA in the 1970s, and throughout the history of SA, some members have sought to change the group’s concept of sexual sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Committee to Investigate Tri-state’s Affiliation|year=1991|url=https://sasobriety.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/tristateaffiliationreport1991.pdf|publisher=Sexaholics Anonymous Tri State Intergroup}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to generalize marriage similar to the [[Twelve steps|12 Step concept from Step 3 of "God as you understand God"]].  It was an attempt to endorse as sexually sober, sexual activity by couples, not legally married, whether they be of the same or opposite sex. The fellowship did not accept this and, as a result, in 1991 some SA members and groups left SA to form [[Sexual Recovery Anonymous]] (SRA), citing the SA sobriety definition’s lack of endorsement of same sex relationships and committed relationships. Murray R, one of the SRA founders had served on the SA General Service Board and had long attempted to change the SA sobriety definition to include committed relationships with either the same or opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=Fall 2001 |title=Murray, A Reluctant Founder |journal=Communique |pages=1, 6, 7 |publisher=Sexual Recovery Anonymous  |url=https://sasobriety.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/sracommunique2001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1991 Roy was writing to the fellowship regarding same-sex acting out. In an article titled Principles Corroborating SA's Interpretation of Sexual Sobriety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Principles Corroborating SA's Interpretation of Sexual Sobriety|journal=Essay|date=June 1991|url=http://www.royk.com/Principles.pdf|publisher=Sexaholics Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy wrote, ''"Ever since attending the April 1986 and 1987 NYC Marathons, I have been examining my own assumptions in the same-sex area. That year I wrote a letter to a same-sex member sharing my thoughts; it now has the title "Recovery Reveals Our False Assumptions." That paper, which follows, gives reasons from within our common recovery experience why I believe we in SA should not endorse or validate, even indirectly, same-sex or "committed relationship" sexualizing in SA."''
In the section titled "The Great Same-Sex Controversy" Roy goes on to explain how society was divided on the "nature vs. nurture" argument about homosexuality, ''"Intense controversies rage about this issue in every area of modern life in highly polarized and publicized passion. It is one of the most explosive political issues of the day. Congress is divided. Religions and churches are divided. The Twelve Step program is divided. The same-sex culture itself is divided. The "experts" are divided. The point here is this: For SA to validate same-sex sexualizing in SA, even indirectly, would have us endorsing a highly controversial biological theory and political movement against our Tenth Tradition. If we validate same-sex sexualizing as normative for the sexaholic in recovery, and it turns out not to be normative, SA will have been promoting an untruth and doing a devilish disservice, supporting the problem instead of recovery. That's an awesome responsibility we're dealing with here—human lives!"''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014173515/http://www.royk.com/Principles.pdf page 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue came up again in the late 1990s.  A survey was held, reaching out to various individual meetings through the regional councils and local Intergroups.  A solid majority of responders felt that the sobriety definition did not require clarification. Agitation on the issue continued due to a perception that the ambiguous nature of the survey questions rendered the results meaningless. The Chair of the SA Delegates Assembly summed up this ambiguity: "I received conflicting opinions about the meaning of the January 1999 vote that we do not need to clarify the SA sobriety definition. Many (probably most) were convinced this vote meant that we are already clear on the meaning of traditional SA sobriety and no further clarification is needed. Others were equally convinced this vote meant that "spouse" and "marriage" could be interpreted as understood by each member. Some were convinced that SA is afraid to "say what it means and mean what it says" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clarification of the Sobriety Definition|journal=Essay|date=Fall 1999|pages=19|url=https://samerecovery.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/essayfall1999.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 1999, the General Delegates Assembly, meeting at an international conference in Cleveland, unanimously voted (9-0) to clarify the definition of "spouse" to be "one's partner in a marriage between a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=K. |first1=Roy |title=Sexaholics Anonymous |date=October 15, 2001 |publisher=SA Publications |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the Cleveland Clarification or the Cleveland Statement of Principle. It was overwhelmingly accepted by the membership at the group, intergroup and regional levels. In 2000 same-sex attracted SA members expressed their support for the Cleveland Clarification in a letter to SA delegates and trustees signed by 66 members from 7 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same sex attracted SA members speak out|url=http://www.samerecovery.com/history.html#Members_speak_out|year=2000|accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates for membership in the SA Board of Trustees, are now required to affirm the SA Sobriety Definition including the Cleveland Clarification.

This controversy continues to circulate within the fellowship. The General Delegate Assembly (GDA) "is the policy making body of SA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SA Service Manual|publisher=Sexaholics Anonymous Inc|page=16|url=http://www.sa.org/docs/servman2014.pdf|accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any Delegate is free to propose a motion at the GDA to debate the SA sobriety definition.  SA Conferences are about recovery, not for debating policy matters like the sobriety definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SA Service Manual|date=2014|publisher=Sexaholics Anonymous Inc|page=32|url=http://www.sa.org/docs/servman2014.pdf|accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essay, the quarterly international SA newsletter, states the principle in its Editorial Philosophy: ''"SA’s sobriety definition is not debated, since it distinguishes SA from other sex addiction fellowships. Essay is not a forum for non-SA sobriety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essay Article Submission| url=http://www.sa.org/submitessay.php|website=Sexaholics Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the SA General Delegates Assembly(GDA) passed a motion further entrenching the [https://samerecovery.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/essayfall1999.pdf 1999 Cleveland Statement of Principle] : ''"In SA's sobriety definition, the term "spouse" refers to one’s partner in a marriage between a man and a woman"''. The motion requires the inclusion of the Statement of Principle in all SA literature on the [http://www.sa.org SA website home page]. Further, the motion declared that “Meetings that do not adhere to and follow …the Statement of Principle … are not SA meetings and shall not call themselves SA meetings” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexaholics Anonymous - Statement of Principle|journal=Essay|date=September 2016|page=32|url=https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkWNMg0R-XzblDdtoJntsZIr3Pd2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SA has attracted a subsection of the same-sex attracted population who seek not to act sexually on such attractions. At the July 2007 SA International Convention a survey was conducted of 176 SA members. Asked the object of their sexual fantasy and acting out, 23% nominated same-sex and a further 7% indicated both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lust Questionnaire Findings|url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/550u6e57iubmt0x/EssayMarch2008.pdf|journal=Essay|date=March 2008|pages=18–19|publisher=Sexaholics Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topic meetings on same-sex issues are held at SA International Conferences and personal stories of same–sex recovery appear in Essay, the official SA quarterly publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex Lust Recovery in SA|url=http://www.samerecovery.com/history.html#Essay_articles}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist other organizations which serve such individuals; see [[Ex-gay]].

==International Conventions==

''All SA &amp; S-Anon conventions from inception to 2016 have been held in the United States, except July 1992 and July 1997 which were both held in Canada. In 2017, the first SA International Convention was held outside North America in Israel, Middle East.''

== Literature ==
SA fully accepts all AA General Conference-approved literature for use in SA meetings, and SA groups frequently read from AA literature in their own meetings. SA adheres closely to the AA model, applying all of AA's principles to lust and sexual addiction, and whereas other members of other S-groups define sobriety for themselves, SA is closer to AA in proposing an understanding of sobriety which requires abstinence and is common to the group.&lt;ref&gt;Jan R.

== Proponents ==
Because SA's sobriety definition has clear roots in Western and Eastern morality, the movement has a great appeal to [[Hindus]], [[Christians]], that is, [[Protestants]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholics]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Laaser, 2004. ''Healing the Wounds of Sexual Addiction''. Zondervan, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Judaism|religious Jews]], [[secular Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Buddhists]], [[atheists]], and [[agnostics]].

== Criticism ==
A psychologist involved in sexual addiction treatment, [[Patrick Carnes]], encourages self-defined sobriety in his writings, saying that a no-masturbation definition of sobriety is only appropriate for some sex addicts and that bottom lines can in fact be modified over time.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Carnes, David L. Delmonico, Elizabeth Griffin (2004). ''In The Shadows Of The Net: Breaking Free of Compulsive Online Sexual Behavior''. Hazelden PES.&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Kort criticizes SA for its pro-heterosexual marriage stance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Kort]]. ''Ten Smart Things -Gay Men Can Do to Improve Their Lives''. Alyson Publishing, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the founder Roy K. knew ahead of time that this was a controversial subject and often wrote letters from a contrarian perspective. "If we come into an SA group where we can define our own sobriety, watch those rationalizations come alive! And if we define our own level of sobriety, that's all we're likely to reach." &lt;ref&gt;Roy K., White Book, SA Literature. 1989. p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9622887-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Roy studied Theology for many years at a Seminary.  He often would leave an SA convention where he was one of the 'keynote speakers' and preach at a church around the corner {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}for those interested in listening to a more evangelical point of view. "We don't claim to understand all the ramifications of sexual sobriety. Some of us have come to believe that there is a deeper spiritual significance in sexual sobriety, while others simply report that without a firm and clear bottom line, our "cunning, baffling, and powerful" sexaholism takes over sooner or later.&lt;ref&gt;Roy K., White Book, SA Literature. 1989. p. 2. {{ISBN|0-9622887-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strolling''' is walking along or through at a leisurely pace.  Strolling is a pastime and activity enjoyed worldwide as a leisure activity.  The object of strolling is to walk at a slightly slower pace in an attempt to absorb the surroundings.

Works featuring the ''[[flâneur]]'', French for a “strolling urban observer”, have appeared in European and American literature since the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Werner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Werner|title=American Flaneur: The Cosmic Physiognomy of Edgar Allan Poe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zj6TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=15 April 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-87985-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The verb form of "stroll" may have originated from a c.1600 [[Cant (language)|Cant]] word. This word may have been derived from the German word ''strollen'', which in itself is a derivative of the German word ''strolchen'', which means "to roam, travel about aimlessly, drift, rove."&lt;ref name="strolchen"&gt;http://www.dictionarist.com/strolchen&lt;/ref&gt; The German noun ''strolch'' refers to any sort of vagabond or rogue.

Before the American Revolution, a stroller was the British word for a vagabond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Kevin|title=1775:A Good Year for Revolution|date=2012|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-02512-1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun stroll came from the verb in 1814. The term "stroller" was coined in the 1920s as a "child’s push-chair.".&lt;ref name="stroll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=stroller&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern-day usage of the word "stroll" does not differ greatly from its older derivatives.

[[File:Strolling mp3.jpg|thumb|Technological advances in strolling.]]

==Health outcomes==
Strolling is not an [[aerobic exercise]].  The body's energy demands whilst strolling do not require extra oxygen.&lt;ref name=FleuryMilfort2004 /&gt;  Physicians therefore do not recommend strolling, but rather recommend more vigorous and aerobic forms of exercise.  The [[American Medical Association]]'s committee on Exercise and Physical Fitness has stated that "walking briskly, not just strolling, is the simplest and also one of the best forms of exercise".&lt;ref name=ReillyBrod2004 /&gt;

Researchers investigating the cognitive benefits to exercise have also concluded that strolling results in no significant gains to cognitive health as people age.  Brisk walking and other everyday activities, such as house work or gardening, have demonstrated significant benefits to prevention of cognitive decline as the population ages.&lt;ref name = "Butler"&gt;Butler, R., Foreete, F., and Greengross, B.S. (2004) Maintaining Cognitive Health in an Aging Society. ''The Journal of The Royal Society for the Promotion of Health''. Vol 124 No3. 119-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers at the Mayo Clinic posit that all activity that is not sleeping, eating, or sports activity still contributes to overall health.  This has been named "Non-exercise activity thermogenesis" (NEAT) and includes everything from strolling to fidgeting in the analysis of energy consumption.  Utilizing NEAT research has generated many ideas about social design of offices, schools, and living spaces to promote any physical activity, such as removing places to sit to promote standing and pacing.&lt;ref name = "NEAT"&gt;James A. Levine, Mark W. Vander Weg, James O. Hill, Robert C. Klesges. (2006) Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis
The Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon of Societal Weight Gain. ''Arterioscler Thrombosis and Vascular Biology''. 26:729-736.&lt;/ref&gt; The body operates at a more balanced  level when strolling.  The heart beat is more balanced.  The blood pressure is well balanced.

==International traditions==
In Spain, a stroll is called a ‘’Paseo’’ and is a popular after-dinner pastime. The participants, whose membership is egalitarian, wear their best clothing. Activities include chatting with neighbors and acquaintances, flirting, and gossiping.&lt;ref name="Kerr2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Kerr|title=Manana, Manana: One Mallorcan Summer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48EJVX0jMY0C&amp;pg=PA47|date=1 May 2004|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-59228-407-8|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several streets in countries with a Spanish cultural history incorporate the word: [[Paseo de la Reforma]] in Mexico City, [[Paseo del Prado, Havana]], [[Paseo de Roxas]] in the Philippines, and Buenos Aires’s [[Paseo La Plaza]].

The '''Swedish healthcare''' system is highly decentralized, and is universal for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/getting-better-value-for-money-from-sweden-s-healthcare-system_082725005676#.WiiR07pFxPY |title=Getting Better Value for Money from Sweden's Healthcare System {{!}} OECD READ edition|website=OECD iLibrary |access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish healthcare system is mainly financed through the public sector, and city councils run public healthcare. A total of 21 councils are in charge with primary and hospital care within the country. Private healthcare is rarity in Sweden, and even those private institutions work under the mandated city councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-sweden-2005/improving-quality-and-value-for-money-in-healthcare_eco_surveys-swe-2005-7-en#.WiiXqLpFxPY#page5|title=Improving Quality and Value for Money in Healthcare {{!}} OECD READ edition|website=OECD iLibrary|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;The city councils regulates the rules and the establishment of potential private practices. Although in most countries care for the elderly or those who need psychiatric help is conducted privately, in Sweden local, publicly funded authorities are in charge of this type of care. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/apr/28/swedish-council-limit-private-profit-healthcare-public|title=Swedish council becomes first to limit private profits in healthcare|last=Orange|first=Richard|date=2015-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish government makes an effort to limit private firms in healthcare. The government takes the precautions to eliminate profit seeking in the welfare/public health sector.

== Inefficiencies ==
The Swedish health system is mainly effective but there are some problems within the system. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-sweden-2005_eco_surveys-swe-2005-en#.WiifnrpFxPY#page19|title=OECD Economic Surveys: Sweden 2005 {{!}} OECD READ edition|website=OECD iLibrary|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased access to primary care is one issue that arises. Most citizens in Sweden go to the hospital for routine check ups. Primary care needs to be made more readily accessible to Swedes instead of them going to hospitals for minor health needs. Another issue is Swedish emergency units are below the minimum safe size. The decentralized healthcare system in Sweden leads to this inefficiency, because of decentralization the counties are granted extreme amount of flexibility. The coordination between counties and municipalities is affected because of this constant shifting and flexibility. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/jan/03/sweden-healthcare-coordinate-oecd|title=Swedish healthcare is the best in the world, but there are still lessons to learn|last=Svanborg-Sjövall|first=Karin|date=2014-01-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary care issues stems from councils. The government has tried to make primary private care more accessible to citizens but the city councils halt this in most counties. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/18/private-healthcare-lessons-from-sweden|title=Private healthcare: the lessons from Sweden|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|date=2012-12-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;The lack of privatized health services leads to a number of the inefficiencies in the system.

== Funding and costs ==
According to OECD the Swedish health system is one of the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/health/sweden-has-excellent-health-care-but-must-improve-care-co-ordination.htm|title=Sweden has excellent health care but must improve care co-ordination, says OECD - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Funding and cost of keeps healthcare affordable and accessible to all Swedish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anell|first=Anders|date=February 2008|title=The Swedish Healthcare System|url=http://www.pnhp.org/PDF_files/LSE_Country_Profiles.pdf|journal=The Commonwealth Fund|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding for Swedish health care comes from central and local taxes. The mandated councils and municipalities have the ability to  levy taxes on citizens. Local taxes equate for about 70% of the budgets for councils and municipalities, while overall 85% of the total health budget come from public funding. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khssocialstudies.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/7/6/4476810/swedish_socialism.pdf|title=Swedish Socialism|last=Rodriguez|first=Linda|date=2009|work=Spinning the Globe: Sweden|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish government takes about half of the workers' paychecks but single payer healthcare and higher pensions than most countries make this cost viable for each citizen. Costs of Swedish health services are affordable and councils are required by the law to set budgets. Doctors and staff members are placed on salary instead of fluctuating financial incentives that doctors and staff in other countries are allowed. The budgeting manages cost control for health needs and eliminates welfare for private firms or employess who provide service within the public sector.

The '''TeenScreen National Center for Mental Health Checkups at Columbia University''' was a national [[mental health]] and [[suicide]] risk screening initiative for middle- and high-school age adolescents. On November 15, 2012, according to its website, the program was terminated. The organization operated as a center in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City]]. The program was developed at Columbia University in 1999, and launched nationally in 2003. Screening was voluntary and offered through doctors' offices, schools, clinics, juvenile justice facilities, and other youth-serving organizations and settings. {{As of|2011|08}}, the program had more than 2,000 active screening sites across 46 states in the [[United States]], and in other countries including [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]].

==Screening program==
===Organization===
The program was developed by a team of researchers at [[Columbia University]], led by  [[David Shaffer]].&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite news |title=Battling a National Killer: TeenScreen Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide |first=Arline |last=Kaplan |url= |newspaper=Psychiatric Times |date=1 March 2006 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to make researched and validated screening questionnaires available for voluntary identification of possible mental disorders and suicide risk in middle and high school students.&lt;ref name=Vanderwerf&gt;{{cite news |title=County studying two new mental health initiatives |first=Linda |last=Vanderwerf |url= |newspaper=West Central Tribune |date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  questionnaire they developed is known as the Columbia Suicide Screen, which entered into use in 1999, an early version of what is now the Columbia Health Screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=150 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002222220/http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=150 |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]], created under the administration of [[George W. Bush]], identified the TeenScreen program as a "model" program&lt;ref name=Kaplan/&gt; and recommended adolescent mental health screening become common practice.&lt;ref name=New&gt;[[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]], ''Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America.'' Final Report. DHHS Pub. No. SMA-03-3832. Rockville, MD: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization launched an initiative to provide voluntary mental health screening to all U.S. teens in 2003. The following year, TeenScreen was included in the national Suicide Prevention Resource Center's (SPRC) list of [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] suicide prevention programs.&lt;ref name=Overview04&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teenscreen.org/images/stories/PDF/2004%20Annual%20Overview.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021001/http://www.teenscreen.org/images/stories/PDF/2004%20Annual%20Overview.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 April 2012 |title=Columbia University TeenScreen Program: Science into Policy, Prevention and Action 2004 Overview |year=2004 |work=TeenScreen.org |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it was included as an evidence-based program in the U.S. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA)'s National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices.&lt;ref name=NREPP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=150 |title=TeenScreen |date=February 2007 |work=National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practice |publisher= |accessdate=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002222220/http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=150 |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the organization launched the  TeenScreen Primary Care initiative to increase mental health screening by pediatricians and other primary care providers, the same year the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] recommended annual adolescent mental health screening as part of routine primary care,  and the [[Institute of Medicine]] recommended expansion of prevention and early identification programs.&lt;ref name=TIP&gt;{{cite news |title=Will students take a mental health test? |first=Laura |last=Landro |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538292146976766 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |2011}}, the program was led by executive director Laurie Flynn, deputy executive director Leslie McGuire and scientific advisor Mark Olfson, M.D., alongside a National Advisory Council of healthcare professionals, educators and advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenscreen.org/about/our-leadership/ |title=Our Leadership |work=TeenScreen.org |accessdate=16 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524033317/http://www.teenscreen.org/about/our-leadership/ |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 15, 2012, TeenScreen has been terminated, will no longer train or register new programs, and will cease all operations by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teenscreen.org/depression-screening/importance-announcement-regarding-the/ |work=TeenScreen.org |title=Important Announcement for Schools &amp; Communities |accessdate=8 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416004729/http://www.teenscreen.org/depression-screening/importance-announcement-regarding-the/ |archivedate=16 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission and locations===
The mission of the TeenScreen National Center was to expand and improve the early identification of mental health problems in youth.&lt;ref name="NREPP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brochure/&gt; In particular, TeenScreen aimed to find young people at risk of suicide or developing mental health disorders so they could be referred for a comprehensive mental health evaluation by a health professional.&lt;ref name=Vanderwerf/&gt; The program focuses on providing screening to young people in the 11-18 age range.&lt;ref name=Brochure&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teenscreen.org/images/stories/PDF/NatCenterBrochure3.11.11.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021210/http://www.teenscreen.org/images/stories/PDF/NatCenterBrochure3.11.11.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 April 2012 |title=TeenScreen National Center Brochure |date=11 March 2011 |work=TeenScreen.org |publisher=TeenScreen National Center |format=PDF |accessdate=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 until 2012, the program was offered nationally&lt;ref name=Overview04/&gt; in schools, clinics, doctors' offices and in youth service environments such as shelters and juvenile justice settings.&lt;ref name="NREPP"/&gt; {{As of |2011|08}}, more than 2,000 primary care providers, schools and community-based sites in 46 states offered adolescent mental health screening through the TeenScreen National Center. In addition, the screening was also being provided in other countries including [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teenscreen.org/programs/local-programs/ |title=Local Programs |work=TeenScreen.org |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415225409/http://www.teenscreen.org/programs/local-programs/ |archivedate=15 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening process===
TeenScreen provided materials, training and technical help through its TeenScreen Primary Care and Schools and Communities programs for primary care providers, schools and youth-serving organizations that provided mental health screening to adolescents.&lt;ref name=Nursing/&gt; A toolkit was provided, including researched and validated questionnaires, instructions for administering, scoring and interpreting the screening responses. Primary care program materials included information on primary care referrals for clinical evaluation.&lt;ref name=Nursing/&gt; In the school and community setting, the screening process was voluntary and required active parental consent and participant assent prior to screening sessions.&lt;ref name=Kaplan/&gt;

The validated questionnaires included items about depression, thoughts of suicide and attempts, anxiety, and substance use.&lt;ref name="NREPP"/&gt; The screening questionnaires typically took up to ten minutes for an adolescent to complete.&lt;ref name=Kaplan/&gt; Once the responses to the questionnaire had been reviewed, any adolescent identified as being at possible risk for suicide or other mental health concerns would then assessed by a health or mental health professional. The result of this assessment determined whether the adolescent could be referred for mental health services. If this was the case, parents were involved and provided with help locating the appropriate mental health services.&lt;ref name="NREPP"/&gt;

==Research, endorsements and responses==
===Recommendations and research===
Mental health screening has been endorsed by the former U.S. Surgeon General [[David Satcher]], who launched a "Call to Action" in 1999 encouraging the development and implementation of safe, effective school-based programs offering intervention, help and support to young people with mental health issues.&lt;ref name="Surgeon General"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calltoaction/recommendations.htm |title=The Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent Suicide, 1999 |year=1999 |work=U.S. Surgeon General |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; TeenScreen is included as an evidence-based program in the U.S. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA)'s National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices as a scientifically tested and reviewed intervention.&lt;ref name="NREPP" /&gt; In addition, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] recommended in 2009 that mental health screening for teenagers be integrated into routine primary care appointments.&lt;ref name=Nursing&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Patricia L. |last2=McGuire |first2=Leslie |year=2011 |title=Incorporating mental health checkups into adolescent primary care visits |journal=Pediatric Nursing |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=137–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been conducted on the effectiveness and impact of mental health screening for young people. In a 2004 systematic evidence review, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found that there were no studies that addressed whether screening as part of primary care reduced morbidity and mortality, nor any information of the potential risks of screening.&lt;ref name="Systematic review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/prevent/pdfser/suicidser.pdf |title=Screening for Suicide Risk: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |date=May 2004 |work=AHRQ.gov |publisher= |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later review, published in 2009, the task force found that there was evidence supporting the efficacy of screening tools in identifying teenagers at risk of suicide or mental health disorders.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20722167 |year=2009 |last1=Williams |first1=SB |last2=O'Connor |first2=E |last3=Eder |first3=M |last4=Whitlock |first4=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of researchers from Columbia University and the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]] completed a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled clinical trial]] on the impact of suicide screening on high school students in New York State from 2002-2004.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15811983 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.13.1635 | volume=293 | issue=13 | title=Evaluating iatrogenic risk of youth suicide screening programs: a randomized controlled trial |date=April 2005  |vauthors=Gould MS, Marrocco FA, Kleinman M, etal | pages=1635–43 | journal=JAMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that students who were given a questionnaire about suicide were no more likely to report suicidal thoughts after the survey than students in the control group who had not been questioned.&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; Neither was there any greater risk for "high risk" students.&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; A subsequent study by the researchers, in 2009, found that screening appeared to increase the likelihood that adolescents would receive treatment if they were at risk for mental health disorders or suicide.&lt;ref name=Gould2&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19858758 |year=2009 |last1=Gould |first1=MS |last2=Marrocco |first2=FA |last3=Hoagwood |first3=K |last4=Kleinman |first4=M |last5=Amakawa |first5=L |last6=Altschuler |first6=E |title=Service use by at-risk youths after school-based suicide screening |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=1193–201 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181bef6d5 |pmc=2891889 |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study published in 2011, involving 2,500 high school students, examined the value of routine mental health screening in school to identify adolescents at-risk for mental illness, and to connect those adolescents with recommended follow-up care. The research, conducted between 2005 and 2009 at six public high schools in suburban Wisconsin, found that nearly three out of four high school students identified as being at-risk for having a mental health problem were not in treatment at the time of screening. Of those students identified as at-risk, a significant majority (76.3 percent) completed at least one visit with a mental health provider within 90 days of screening. More than half (56.3 percent) received minimally adequate treatment, defined as having three or more visits with a provider, or any number of visits if termination was agreed to by the provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=881–91 |doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2011.05.013 |title=Mental Health Screening and Follow-up Care in Public High Schools |year=2011 |last1=Husky |first1=Mathilde M. |last2=Sheridan |first2=Marian |last3=McGuire |first3=Leslie |last4=Olfson |first4=Mark |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate study published in 2011, found that mental health screening was effective at connecting African-American middle school students from a predominantly low-income area with school-based mental health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21559920 |year=2011 |last1=Husky |first1=MM |last2=Kanter |first2=DA |last3=McGuire |first3=L |last4=Olfson |first4=M |title=Mental Health Screening of African American Adolescents and Facilitated Access to Care |doi=10.1007/s10597-011-9413-x |journal=Community mental health journal |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=71–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found evidence to support the addition of mental health screenings for adolescents while undergoing routine physical examinations.&lt;ref name=Husky&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20127189 |year=2011 |last1=Husky |first1=MM |last2=Miller |first2=K |last3=McGuire |first3=L |last4=Flynn |first4=L |last5=Olfson |first5=M |title=Mental health screening of adolescents in pediatric practice |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=159–69 |doi=10.1007/s11414-009-9207-x |journal=The journal of behavioral health services &amp; research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations endorsing adolescent mental health screening have been issued by the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF).&lt;ref name=TIP/&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends assessment of mental health at primary care visits and suggests the use of validating screening instruments. These add to statements and recommendations to screen adolescents for mental illness from the American Medical Association (AMA), the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.&lt;ref name=Nursing/&gt; TeenScreen has been endorsed by a number of organizations, including the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, and federal and state commissions such as the New Freedom Commission.&lt;ref name=Franck&gt;{{cite news |title=Screenings prompt fears of false labels |first=Matthew |last=Franck |url= |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=13 December 2005 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is opposition to mental health screening programs in general and TeenScreen in particular, from civil liberties, parental rights, and politically conservative groups.&lt;ref name=Dejka&gt;{{cite news |title=Can test save lives? |first=Joe |last=Dejka |url= |newspaper=Omaha World-Herald |date=16 September 2008 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the opposition is led by groups who claim that the organization is funded by the pharmaceutical industry;&lt;ref name="Franck" /&gt; however, in 2011, an inquiry launched by Senator [[Charles E. Grassley]] into the funding of health advocacy groups by pharmaceutical, medical-device, and insurance companies demonstrated to Senator Grassley's satisfaction that TeenScreen does not receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Sen. Grassley sent a letter to TeenScreen and 33 other organizations like the American Cancer Society asking about their financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. TeenScreen replied saying they did not accept money from medical companies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senator Prods Medical Non-profits to Disclose More About Industry Contributions |first=Suzanne |last=Perry |url=http://philanthropy.com/blogs/government-and-politics/senator-prods-medical-nonprofits-to-disclose-more-about-industry-contributions/28477 |newspaper=The Chronicle of Philanthropy |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, TeenScreen was criticized following media coverage of a suit filed a local screening program in Indiana by the parents of a teenager who had taken part in screening. The suit alleged that the screening had taken place without parents' permissions.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite news |title=US teenager’s parents sue school over depression screening test |first=Jeanne |last=Lenzer |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/suppl/2005/09/29/331.7519.714-a.DC1 |newspaper=British Medical Journal |year=2005 |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint led to a change in how parental consent was handled by TeenScreen sites. In 2006, the program's policy was amended so that active rather than passive consent was required from parents before screening adolescents in a school setting.&lt;ref name="Franck"/&gt;

==Models of heterogeneity==
There are two models used to explain the heterogeneity of tumour cells. These are the [[cancer stem cell]] model and the [[Somatic evolution in cancer|clonal evolution]] model. The models are not mutually exclusive, and it is believed that they both contribute to heterogeneity in varying amounts across different tumour types.&lt;ref name="Shackleton2009"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:CSC vs stochastic.pdf|thumb|upright=1.5|Ability of cancer cells to form tumours under the cancer stem cell and clonal evolution models of heterogeneity.]]

===Cancer stem cells===
{{main|Cancer stem cell}}
The cancer stem cell model asserts that within a population of tumour cells, there is only a small subset of cells that are [[Tumorigenic|tumourigenic]] (able to form tumours). These cells are termed cancer stem cells ('''CSCs'''), and are marked by the ability to both self-renew and differentiate into non-tumourigenic progeny. The CSC model posits that the heterogeneity observed between tumour cells is the result of differences in the stem cells from which they originated. Stem cell variability is often caused by [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes, but can also result from clonal evolution of the CSC population where advantageous genetic [[mutation]]s can accumulate in CSCs and their progeny (see below).&lt;ref name="Shackleton2009" /&gt;

Evidence of the cancer stem cell model has been demonstrated in multiple tumour types including [[leukemias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

However, the existence of CSCs is still under debate. One reason for this is that markers for CSCs have been difficult to reproduce across multiple tumours. Further, methods for determining tumourigenic potential utilize [[Xenotransplantation|xenograft]] models. These methods suffer from inherent limitations such as the need to control immune response in the transplant animal, and the significant difference in environmental conditions from the primary tumour site to the xenograft site (''e.g.'' absence of required exogenous molecules or cofactors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

These changes give rise to additional subpopulations, and each of these subpopulations has the ability to divide and mutate further. This heterogeneity may give rise to subclones that possess an [[Natural selection|evolutionary advantage]] over the others within the [[Tumor microenvironment|tumour environment]], and these subclones may become dominant in the tumour over time.&lt;ref name="Swanton2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Linear vs branched.pdf|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Branched evolution is more likely to contribute to tumour heterogeneity.]]

Evolution of the initial tumour cell may occur by two methods:

====Linear expansion====

Sequentially ordered mutations accumulate in driver genes, [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor genes]], and [[DNA repair]] enzymes, resulting in clonal expansion of tumour cells. Linear expansion is less likely to reflect the endpoint of a malignant tumour&lt;ref name="Gerlinger2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the accumulation of mutations is stochastic in heterogeneic tumours.

====Branched expansion====

Expansion into multiple subclonal populations occurs through a splitting mechanism.&lt;ref name="Swanton2012" /&gt; This method is more associated with tumour heterogeneity than linear expansion. The acquisition of mutations is random as a result of increased [[Genome instability|genomic instability]] with each successive generation. The long-term mutational accumulation may provide a [[Natural selection|selective advantage]] during certain stages of tumour progression. The [[Tumor microenvironment]] may also contribute to tumour expansion, as it is capable of altering the selective pressures that the tumour cells are exposed to.&lt;ref name="Gerlinger2012" /&gt;

==Types and causes of heterogeneity==
Multiple types of heterogeneity have been observed between tumour cells, stemming from both genetic and non-genetic variability.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic heterogeneity===
Genetic heterogeneity is a common feature of tumour genomes, and can arise from multiple sources. Some cancers are initiated when exogenous factors introduce mutations, such as ultraviolet radiation (skin cancers) and tobacco (lung cancer). A more common source is genomic instability, which often arises when key regulatory pathways are disrupted in the cells. Some examples include impaired [[DNA repair]] mechanisms which can lead to increased replication errors, and defects in the [[mitosis]] machinery that allow for large-scale gain or loss of entire [[chromosome]]s.&lt;ref name="Burrell2013"&gt;{{Cite journal

Mutational tumor heterogeneity refers to variations in mutation frequency in different genes and samples and can be explored by [http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutsig MutSig]. The etiology of mutational processes can considerably vary between tumor samples from the same or different cancer types and can be manifested in different context-dependent mutational profiles. It can be explored by [http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures COSMIC mutational signatures] or [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/mutagene/ MutaGene].

===Other heterogeneity===
Tumour cells can also show heterogeneity between their expression profiles. This is often caused by underlying [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2012" /&gt;
Variation in expression signatures have been detected in different regions of tumour samples within an individual. Researchers have shown that convergent mutations affecting [[(Histone-H3)-lysine-36 demethylase|H3K36]] [[methyltransferase]] [[SETD2]] and histone H3K4 [[demethylase]] [[JARID1C|KDM5C]] arose in spatially separated tumour sections. Similarly, [[Mammalian target of rapamycin|MTOR]], a gene encoding a cell regulatory [[kinase]], has shown to be constitutively active, thereby increasing S6 [[phosphorylation]]. This active [[phosphorylation]] may serve as a [[biomarker]] in clear-cell carcinoma.&lt;ref name="Gerlinger2012" /&gt;

[[Mechanochemistry|Mechanochemical]] heterogeneity is a hallmark of living [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells. It has an impact on [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]]. The heterogeneous dynamic mechanochemical processes regulate interrelationships within the group of cellular surfaces through [[adhesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=G.M.Edelman |title=Topobiology |journal=J.

===Tumour microenvironment===
Heterogeneity between tumour cells can be further increased due to heterogeneity in the [[Tumor microenvironment|tumour microenvironment]]. Regional differences in the tumour (''e.g.'' availability of oxygen) impose different selective pressures on tumour cells, leading to a wider spectrum of dominant subclones in different spatial regions of the tumour. The influence of microenvironment on clonal dominance is also a likely reason for the heterogeneity between primary and [[Metastasis|metastatic]] tumours seen in many patients, as well as the inter-tumour heterogeneity observed between patients with the same tumour type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Implications and challenges==

===Treatment resistance===
Heterogeneic tumours may exhibit different sensitivities to [[Chemotherapy|cytotoxic drugs]] among different clonal populations. This is attributed to clonal interactions that may inhibit or alter therapeutic efficacy, posing a challenge for successful therapies in heterogeneic tumours (and their heterogeneic metastases).&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt;

Drug administration in heterogeneic tumours will seldom kill all tumour cells. The initial heterogeneic tumour population may [[population bottleneck|bottleneck]], such that few drug resistant cells (if any) will survive. This allows resistant tumour populations to replicate and grow a new tumour through the branching evolution mechanism (see above). The resulting repopulated tumour is heterogeneic and resistant to the initial drug therapy used. The repopulated tumour may also return in a more aggressive manner.

The administration of [[Chemotherapy|cytotoxic drugs]] often results in initial tumour shrinkage. This represents the destruction of initial non-resistant subclonal populations within a heterogeneic tumour, leaving only resistant clones. These resistant clones now contain a selective advantage and can replicate to repopulate the tumour. Replication will likely occur through branching evolution, contributing to tumour heterogeneity. The repopulated tumour may appear to be more aggressive. This is attributed to the drug-resistant selective advantage of the tumour cells.

[[File:Treatment bottleneck.pdf|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Drug treatment induces a bottleneck effect, where resistant subclones will survive and propagate to re-form a heterogeneous tumour.]]

===Biomarker discovery===
Due to the genetic differences within and between tumours, [[biomarker]]s that may predict treatment response or prognosis may not be widely applicable. However, it has been suggested that the level of heterogeneity can itself be used as a biomarker since more heterogeneous tumours may be more likely to contain treatment-resistant subclones.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2012" /&gt; Further research into developing biomarkers that account for heterogeneity is still in progress.

=== Model systems ===
Current model systems typically lack the heterogeneity seen in human cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines Lack the Molecular Heterogeneity of Clinical Colorectal Tumors|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1533002811700317|journal = Clinical Colorectal Cancer|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.3816/ccc.2010.n.005|first = James Todd|last = Auman|first2 = Howard L.|last2 = McLeod|pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to accurately study tumour heterogeneity, we must develop more accurate preclinical models. One such model, the [[Patient derived tumor xenografts|patient derived tumour xenograft]], has shown excellent utility in preserving tumour heterogeneity whilst allowing detailed study of the drivers of clonal fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Maintaining Tumor Heterogeneity in Patient-Derived Tumor Xenografts|url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/15/2963|journal = Cancer Research|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 0008-5472|pmc = 4539570|pmid = 26180079|pages = 2963–2968|volume = 75|issue = 15|doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0727|first = John W.|last = Cassidy|first2 = Carlos|last2 = Caldas|first3 = Alejandra|last3 = Bruna}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even this model cannot capture the full complexity of cancer.

==Current strategies==
While the problem of identifying, characterizing, and treating tumour heterogeneity is still under active research, some effective strategies have been proposed, including both experimental and computational solutions.

===Experimental===
* '''Focused approach:''' analyzing a specific genetic [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] or set of loci. This may occur through the detection of allelic imbalances (tumour DNA is compared to germline DNA), amplification of chromosomal regions ([[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]]), and/or sequencing specific genes. This method is used to trace the evolution of a specific mutation of interest, or to confirm a mutation researchers may suspect in a tumour.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt;
** Advantage: Allows for the analysis of specific genes (''i.e.'' driver genes, tumour suppressors). The process is simple with straightforward interpretation of the results. [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] and [[immunofluorescence]] allows focus on tumour cell subtypes.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt;
** Disadvantage: Limited analysis will miss additional important mutations and patterns of clonal expansion. Allelic imbalances may be difficult to verify using microsatellite markers, therefore requiring verification by an independent technique (''i.e.'' FISH). [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] requires large number of cells and is labour-intensive.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt;
* '''Genome-wide approach:''' analyzing the entire genome in tumour samples. This may be done through [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] or [[Comparative genomic hybridization| comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)]] to detect chromosomal abnormalities. Sequencing of tumour biopsies is becoming more common.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt;
** Advantage: Does not rely on prior knowledge to identify variants. [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] identifies regions of large chromosomal abnormalities. [[Comparative genomic hybridization|CGH]] provides unbiased coverage and allows for small-scale allelic imbalances to be detected [[SNP array|(SNP arrays)]]. Sequencing will identify any variants that contribute to tumour heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt;
** Disadvantage: Difficult to determine the functional impact of variants (''i.e.'' neutral or pathogenic). Limited resolution.  [[Karyotype|Karyotyping]] of cultured cells may be biased towards preferential outgrowth of select tumour cell subpopulations. Limited resolution in both methods.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt; The whole-genome approach may generate large amounts of data and be difficult to interpret.
* '''Multiregion sampling strategy:''' generally requires multiple post-surgical tumour samples from separate regions of a microdissected tumour. It is important to avoid contamination of non-malignant cells to ensure an accurate representation of gene expression and genetic composition seen within the tumour cells only. Analysis of tumour DNA within the spatially separated regions allows for the construction of a 3-dimensional evolutionary model of tumour heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="Marusyk2010" /&gt; Multiregional sampling is often used in combination with the genome-wide approach to establish this 3D heterogeneity expansion model.
* '''Longitudinal sampling:''' through tumour progression or treatment progression, obtaining tumour samples during multiple points in time has been utilized in some cases. This has been suggested as a reliable method for tracking clonal evolution.&lt;ref name="Ding2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors= Bai H, Harmancı AS, Erson-Omay AZ, Li J, Coșkun S, Simon M, Krischek B, Özduman K, Omay SB | display-authors = 6 | url = http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3457.html|title = Integrated genomic characterization of IDH1-mutant glioma malignant progression | date = Nov 2015 | journal = Nature Genetics | doi = 10.1038/ng.3457 | pmid=26618343 | pmc=4829945 | volume=48 | issue = 1 | pages=59–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* '''Adaptive therapy''' may be used to prevent further tumour growth by adjusting drug dose and timing of drug administration based on the tumour's response. This strategy is assumed to prevent resistant variants from dominating a tumour. However, more research is required into its applicability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Sequencing===
* '''Bulk tumour sequencing''' can be utilized, where DNA is extracted from a mixture of tumour cells and analyzed all at once. The presence of heterogeneous tumour populations (subclones) introduces additional challenges such as:
** The inability to detect [[mutation]]s in rare subclones. Since these mutations will occur with low frequency in the pooled sample, they may be indistinguishable from background noise. However, many variant callers are being actively developed that are specifically designed for cancer data and aim to identify rare variants present in smaller subclonal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* '''[[Single cell sequencing|Single-cell sequencing]]''' is a new technique that is valuable for assessing tumour heterogeneity because it can characterize individual tumour cells. This means that the entire mutational profile of multiple distinct cells can be determined with no ambiguity. While with current technology, it is difficult to evaluate sufficiently large numbers of single cells to obtain statistical power, single-cell tumour data has multiple advantages, including:
** The ability to construct a [[phylogenetic tree]] showing the evolution of tumour populations. Using whole-genome sequences or [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]-based pseudo-sequences from individual cells, the evolution of the subclones can be estimated. This allows for the identification of populations that have persisted over time, and can narrow down the list of mutations that potentially confer a growth advantage or treatment resistance on specific subclones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Wanda Rutkiewicz''' {{IPA-pl|/ˈvanda rutˈkievitʂ/}} (February 4, 1943 &amp;ndash; May 12–13, 1992) was a [[Poland|Polish]] computer engineer&lt;ref name=martina&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17430437.2016.1175139?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=fcss20 |title=Wanda Rutkiewicz – crossing boundaries in women’s mountaineering |author=Martina Gugglberger |date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mountain climber. She was the first woman to successfully summit [[K2]].

==Early life==
Wanda Rutkiewicz was born in a Polish family in [[Plungė]], Lithuania. After World War II, her family chose [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)|to leave for Poland]], settling in [[Wrocław]] in southwestern Poland's [[Recovered Territories]], where she graduated from [[Wroclaw University of Technology]] as an electrical engineer.

She began climbing on the rocks near the [[Janowice Wielkie]] - Falcon Mountains ({{lang-pl|Góry Sokole}}).

Wanda Rutkiewicz rode [[SFM Junak|Junak]], the heaviest Polish motorcycle, which indirectly contributed to her interest in climbing. One summer day in 1961, it ran out of fuel. She started waving to people passing her vehicle. The man riding the motorcycle which stopped to help was travelling with a colleague Bogdan Jankowski, who had been climbing for two years. This meeting resulted in their climbing of the [[:pl:Góry Sokole|Falcon Mountains]].

==Climbing career==
Her first major expedition was to the [[Pamir Mountains]] with [[Andrzej Zawada]], which she found unpleasent due to fractured relationships with male climbers.&lt;ref name=cul&gt;{{cite web|url=https://culture.pl/en/article/death-before-failure-wanda-rutkiewicz-the-golden-age-of-polish-mountaineering |title=Death Before Failure: Wanda Rutkiewicz &amp; The Golden Age of Polish Mountaineering |date=23 August 2017 |accessdate=15 June 2018 |author=Michael Keller |publisher=Culture.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning began to lead her own expeditions, including a number of all female ones, and became known for a blunt leadership style.&lt;ref name=cul/&gt;

On 16 October 1978, she became the third woman, the first Pole, and the first European woman to reach the summit of [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Jennifer |title=Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women on K2 |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2006 |pages=40 |isbn=978-0-06-058716-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 she became the first woman to successfully climb [[K2]], which she did without supplemental oxygen, as part of a small expedition led by [[Liliane and Maurice Barrard|Lilliane and Maurice Barrard]].

Rutkiewicz's goal was to become the first woman to summit all fourteen of the [[eight-thousanders]]. During her climbing life she successfully summitted the following mountains:

* 1978 - [[Mount Everest]]
* 1985 - [[Nanga Parbat]]
* 1986 - [[K2]]
* 1987 - [[Shishapangma]]
* 1989 - [[Gasherbrum II]]
* 1990 - [[Gasherbrum I]]
* 1991 - [[Cho Oyu]]
* 1991 - [[Annapurna I]]
* 1992 - [[Kangchenjunga]] (uncertain)

==Death==
While climbing Kangchenjunga, 49-year-old Rutkiewicz was last seen alive by Mexican climber [[Carlos Carsolio]]. She was sheltering at high altitude on the north-west face, during her attempted ascent of what would have been her ninth eight-thousander. At that moment Rutkiewicz was physically weakened and not able to make a rational decision that could have saved her life. Carsolio said that he didn't have the mental strength left to convince her to descend because he was weakened as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Jennifer |title=Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women on K2 |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2006 |pages=171–174 |isbn=978-0-06-058716-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was thought that the body was found on the south-west face of the mountain in 1995 by [[Fausto de Stefani]], [[Marco Galezzi]] and [[Silvio Mondinelli]], suggesting that she had climbed up the north-west ridge to a point very close to the summit before falling down the south-west side. However, more detailed analysis of the findings by the Italian climbers, such as colour of clothing and presence of Bulgarian-made tablets with the body, indicate that most likely it was the body of Bulgarian climber [[Yordanka Dimitrova]], who was killed by an [[avalanche]] on the south-west face of Kangchenjunga in October 1994. It is not known if Rutkiewicz summitted Kangchenjunga. If she did so, she would have been the first woman to reach the top of the world's three highest mountains. Rutkiewicz's body has still not been found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24031">'''Work–life interface''' is the intersection of [[Employment|work]] and private life. There are many aspects of one's personal life that can intersect with work including family, leisure, and health. Work–life interface is bidirectional; for instance, work can interfere with private life, and private life can interfere with work. This interface can be adverse in nature (e.g., work-life conflict) or can be beneficial (e.g., work-life enrichment) in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Allen, T. D. (2011). Work–family balance: A review and extension of the literature. In J. C. Quick &amp; L. E. Tetrick (Eds.),'' Handbook of occupational health psychology (2nd ed.).'' (pp. 165–183). Washington, DC US: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominant theories of the relationship==
Several theories explain different aspects of the relationship between the work and family life. Boundary theory and border theory are the two fundamental theories that researchers have used to study these role conflicts. Other theories are built on the foundations of these two theories.

Seven dominant theories have been utilized to explain this relationship on the boundary-border spectrum; These theories are: structural functioning, segmentation, compensation, supplemental and reactive compensation, role enhancement, spillover, and work enrichment model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lavassani, K. M., &amp; Movahedi, P. (2014). DEVELOPMENTS IN THEORIES AND MEASURES OF WORK-FAMILY. ''Contemporary Research on Organization Management and Administration, 2'', 6–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural functionalism===
The roots of this theory can be traced back to the early 20th century, when industrial revolution was separating economic work from the family home. The 19th century’s technological advancements in machinery and manufacturing initiated the separation of work from family. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the first view of work-family theories started to shape. Structural-functionalism as one of the dominant sociology theories of early 20th century was a natural candidate.
The structural functionalism theory, which emerged following WWII, was largely influenced from the industrial revolution and the changes in the social role of men and women during this period.  This theory implies that the life is concerned mainly with two separate spheres: productive life which happens in the workplace and affective life which is at home. Structural functionalism theory believes in the existence of radical separation between work (institution, workplace, or market) and families. According to this theory, these two (workplace and family) work best "when men and women specialize their activities in separate spheres, women at home doing expressive work and men in the workplace performing instrumental tasks” (Kingsbury &amp; Scanzoni, 1993; as cited in MacDermid, 2005: 18).

===Greedy institutions===
It has been argued that the work-family conflicts, in particular role conflicts, can be interpreted in terms of [[Lewis A. Coser]]'s concept of "greedy institutions". These institutions are called "greedy" in the sense that they make all-encompassing demands on the commitment and loyalty of individuals, and tend to discourage involvement in other social spheres.&lt;ref name="coser1974-nach-currie2000-S270"&gt;Lewis A. Coser: ''Greedy Institutions. Patterns of Undivided Commitment.'' The Free Press, New York 1974. Cited after: Jan Currie, Patricia Harris, Bev Thiele: ''Sacrifices in Greedy Universities: are they gendered?'' Gender and Education, 2000, Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 269–291. S. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis A. Coser: ''Greedy Institutions. Patterns of Undivided Commitment.'' The Free Press, New York 1974. Cited after R. Burchielli, T. Bartram: ''Work-Family Balance or Greedy Organizations?'', érudit, 2008, Vol. 63, No. 1, p. 108–133, {{DOI|10.7202/018124ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis A. Coser: ''Greedy Institutions. Patterns of Undivided Commitment.'' The Free Press, New York 1974. Cited after: Asher Cohen, Bernard Susser: ''Women Singing, Cadets Leaving.

Cohen'', Lexington Books, 2014, {{ISBN|978-0-7391-9417-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions such as religious orders, sects, academia, top level sports, the military and senior management have been interpreted as greedy institutions. On the other hand, also the family has been interpreted as a greedy institution in consideration of the demands placed on a caretaker.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Edwards: ''Mature Women Students: Separating Or Connecting Family and Education'', Taylor &amp; Francis 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-7484-0087-4}}, Chapter 4 ''{{'}}Greedy Institutions': Straddling the worlds of family and education''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMseC99ORHIC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Currie, Patricia Harris, Bev Thiele: ''Sacrifices in Greedy Universities: are they gendered?'' Gender and Education, 2000, Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 269–291.&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is involved in two greedy institutions  – be it child care and university, or family and the military,&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Segal: ''The Military And the Family As Greedy Institutions'', Armed Forces &amp; Society (1986), Vol. 13 No. 1, p. 9–38, {{DOI|10.1177/0095327X8601300101}} (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; or others − task and role conflicts arise.

===Segmentation===
Based  on  this theory  work  and  family do  not  affect  each other, since  they  are  segmented  and  independent  from  each  other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The literature also reports the usage of the terms compartmentalization, independence, separateness, disengagement, neutrality, and detachment to describe this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz Jennifer|first1=Higbee Jeanne|title=An Exploration Of Theoretical Foundations For Working Mothers’ Formal Workplace Social Networks|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Economics Research|date=April 2010 |volume=8|issue=4|pages=87–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
In 1979, Piotrkowski argued that according to this theory employees “look to their homes as havens, [and] look to their families as sources of satisfaction lacking in the occupational sphere."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; What distinguishes compensation theory from the previous theories is that, in compensation theory, for the first time, the positive effect of work to family has been recognized.

===Supplemental and reactive compensation===
Supplemental and reactive compensation theories are two dichotomies of compensation theory which were developed during the late 1980s and the early 1990s. While compensation theory describes the behavior of employees in pursuing an alternative reward in the other sphere, supplemental and reactive compensation theories try to describe the reason behind the work-family compensation behavior of employees.

===Role enhancement theory===
According to this theory, the combination of certain roles has a positive, rather than a negative effect on well-being. This theory states that participation in one role is made better or easier by virtue of participation in the other role. Moreover, this theory acknowledges the negative effect of the work-family relationship, in which, only beyond a certain upper limit may overload and distress occur, however, the central focus of this perspective is mainly on the positive effects of work and family relationship, such as resource enhancement.

===Spillover===
Spillover is a process by which an employee’s experience in one domain affects their experience in another domain. Theoretically, spillover is perceived to be one of two types: positive or negative. Spillover as the most popular view of relationship between work and family, considers multidimensional aspects of work and family relationship.

===Work enrichment model===
This theory is one of the recent models for explaining the relationship between work and family. According to this model, experience in one role (work or family) will enhance the quality of life in the other role. In other words, this model tries to explain the positive effects of the work-family relationship.

==Work–family conflict==
{{Main article|Work–family conflict}}
Work and family studies historically focus on studying the conflict between different roles that individuals have in their society, specifically their roles at work, and their roles as a family member.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Work–family conflict is defined as [[role|interrole]] conflict where the participation in one role interfere with the participation in another. Greenhaus and Beutell (1985) differentiate three sources for conflict between work and family: 
# "time devoted to the requirements of one role makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of another" (p.&amp;nbsp;76);
# "strain from participation in one role makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of another" (p.&amp;nbsp;76);
# "specific behaviors required by one role make it difficult to fulfill the requirements of another" (p.&amp;nbsp;76).
Conceptually, the conflict between work and family is bi-directional. Scholars distinguish between what is termed work-to-family conflict (WFC), and what is termed family-to-work conflict (FWC). This bi-directional view is displayed in the figure on the right.
[[File:Work-Family Spillover.png|thumb|alt=Bi-directional relationship of Work-to-Family and Family-to-Work.|Adopted from Lavassani &amp; Movahedi (2014)''[[Work-life interface]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;]]

Accordingly, WFC might occur when experiences at work interfere with family life like extensive, irregular, or inflexible [[Working time|work hours]]. Family-to-work conflict occurs when experiences in the family interfere with work life. For example, a parent may take time off from work in order to take care of a sick [[child]]. Although these two forms of conflict — WFC and FWC — are strongly [[correlation|correlated]] with each other, more attention has been directed at WFC. This may because family demands are more elastic than the boundaries and responsibilities of the work role. Also, [[research]] has found that work roles are more likely to interfere with family roles than family roles are likely to interfere with work roles.

Allen, Herst, Bruck, and Sutton (2000)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; describe in their paper three categories of consequences related to WFC: work-related outcomes (e.g., [[job satisfaction]] or job performance), nonwork-related outcomes (e.g., life or family satisfaction), and stress-related outcomes (e.g., [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[substance abuse]]). For example, WFC has been shown to be negatively related to job satisfaction whereas the association is more pronounced for females.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A., Cordeiro, B. L., &amp; Crouter, A. C. (2005). A longitudinal and multi-source test of the work-family conflict and job satisfaction relationship. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 78'', 305–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of studies investigating the consequences of WFC were interrogating [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] from Western countries, such as U.S. Therefore, the generalizability of their findings is in question. Fortunately, there is also literature studying WFC and its consequences in other cultural contexts, such as [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;Lu, L., Kao, S. F., Cooper, C. L., Allen, T. D., Lapierre, L. M., O`Driscoll, M., Poelmans, S. A. Y., Sanchez, J. I., &amp; Spector, P. L. (2009). Work resources, work-to-family conflict, and its consequences: A Taiwanese–British cross-cultural comparison. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 16'', 25-44.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Pal, S., &amp; Saksvik, P. Ø. (2008). Work–family conflict and psychosocial work environment stressors as predictors of job stress in a cross-cultural study. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 15'', 22–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Lu, Kao, Cooper, Allen, Lapierre, O`Driscoll, Poelmans, Sanchez, and Spector (2009) could  not find any cultural difference related in work-related and nonwork-related outcomes of WFC when they compared [[Great Britain]] and Taiwan. Likewise, Pal and Saksvik (2008) also did not detect specific cultural differences between employees from [[Norway]] and India. Nevertheless, more cross-cultural research is needed to understand the cultural dimensions of the WFC construct.

The research concerning [[Intervention (counseling)|interventions]] to reduce WFC is currently still very limited. As an exception, Nielson, Carlson, and Lankau (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, T. R., Carlson, D. S., &amp; Lankau, M. J. (2001). The supportive mentor as a means of reducing Work–Family conflict. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 59'', 364–381.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that having a [[peer support|supportive]] [[mentor]] on the job correlates negatively with the employee’s WFC. However, other functions of mentoring, like the role model aspect, appear to have no effect on WFC. Therefore, the mechanisms how having a mentor influences the work–family interface remain unclear.

In terms of [[primary intervention|primary]] and [[secondary intervention]] there are some results. Hammer, Kossek, Anger, Bodner, and Zimmerman (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L. B., Kossek, E., Anger, W., Bodner, T., &amp; Zimmerman, K. L. (2011). Clarifying work–family intervention processes: The roles of work–family conflict and family-supportive supervisor behaviors. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 96'', 134–150.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a field study and showed that training [[supervisor]]s to show more family supportive behavior, led to increased physical [[health]] in employees that were high in WFC. At the same time, employees having low WFC scores even decreased in physical health. This shows that even though interventions can help, it is important to focus on the right persons. Otherwise, the intervention damages more than it helps.
Another study (Wilson, Polzer-Debruyne, Chen, &amp; Fernandes, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, M. G., Polzer-Debruyne, A., Chen, S. &amp; Fernandes, S. (2007). Shift work interventions for reduced work–family conflict. ''Employee Relations, 29'', 162–177.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that training employees helps to reduce [[shift work]] related WFC. Additionally, this training is more effective, if the partner of the focal person is also participating. Therefore, integrating the family into the intervention seems to be helpful too.
There are various additional factors that might influence the effectiveness of WFC interventions. For example, some interventions seem more adequate to reduce family-to-work conflict (FWC) than WFC (Hammer et al., 2011). More research is still needed, before optimal treatments against WFC can be derived.

==Work–family enrichment==
{{Main article|Work–family enrichment}}

Work–family enrichment or work–family facilitation is a form of positive spillover, defined as a process whereby involvement in one domain establishes benefits and/or [[resource]]s which then may improve performance or involvement in another domain (Greenhaus &amp; Powell, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Powell, G. N. (2006). When work and family are allies: A theory of work–family enrichment. ''Academy of Management Review, 31'', 72–92.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, involvement in the family role is made easier by participation in the work role (Wayne, Musisca, &amp; Fleeson, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, J. H., Musisca, N., &amp; Fleeson, W. (2004). Considering the role of personality in the work–family experience: Relationships of the big five to work–family conflict and facilitation. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 64'', 108–130. {{doi|10.1016/S0001-8791(03)00035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to work–family conflict which is associated with several negative consequences, work–family enrichment is related to positive organizational outcomes such as job satisfaction and effort (Wayne et al., 2004). There are several potential sources enrichment can arise from. Examples are that resources (e.g., positive [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]) gained in one role lead to better functioning in the other role (Sieber, 1974)&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, S. D. (1974). Toward a theory of role accumulation. ''American Sociological Review, 39'', 567–578. {{doi|10.2307/2094422}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[skill]]s and [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] that are acquired in one role are useful in the other role (Crouter, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Crouter, A. C. (1984). Spillover from family to work: The neglected side of the work–family interface. ''Human Relations, 37'', 425–441. {{doi|10.1177/001872678403700601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, enrichment between work and family is bi-directional. Most researchers make the distinction between what is termed work–family enrichment, and what is termed family–work enrichment. Work–family enrichment occurs, when ones involvement in work provides skills, behaviors, or positive mood which influences the family life in a positive way. Family-work enrichment, however, occurs when ones involvement in the family domain results in positive [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], feeling of success or support that help individuals to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] better with problems at work, feel more confident and in the end being more productive at work (Wayne, et al., 2004).

Several [[:wikt:antecedent|antecedent]]s of work–family enrichment have been proposed. [[Trait theory|Personality traits]], such as [[extraversion]] and [[openness to experience|openness for experience]] have been shown to be positively related to work–family enrichment (Wayne et al., 2004). Next to individual antecedents, organizational circumstances such as resources and skills gained at work foster the occurrence of work–family enrichment (Voydanoff, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Voydanoff, P. (2004). The effects of work demands and resources on work-to-family conflict and facilitation. ''Journal of Marriage and Family, 66'', 398–412. {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-3737.2004.00028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abilities such as interpersonal communication skills are learned at work and may then facilitate constructive communication with family members at home.

==Work-life balance==
{{main article|Work-life balance}}

==The emergence of new family models==
"Our review suggests that most of what is known about Work-Family issues is based on the experiences of heterosexual, Caucasian, managerial and professional employees in family arrangements" (Casper et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;10).

==The role of organization and supervisor==
Research has focused especially on the role of the organization and the supervisor in the reduction of WFC. Results provide evidence for the negative association between the availability of family friendly resources provided by the work place and WFC. General support by the organization aids the employees to deal with work family issues so that organizational support is negatively connected to WFC (Kossek, Pichler, Bodner, &amp; Hammer, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Kossek, E.E., Pichler, S., Bodner, T., &amp; Hammer, L. (2011). Workplace Social Support and Work-Family Conflict: A Meta Analysis Clarifying the Influence of General and Work Specific Supervisor and Organizational Support. ''Personnel Psychology, 64'', 289–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kossek et al. (2011) showed that work family specific support has a stronger negative connection with work family conflict. Interesting results by other researchers show that family friendly organizational culture also has an indirect effect on WFC via supervisor support and coworker support (Dolcoy &amp; Daley, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Dolcos, S., &amp; Daley, D. (2009). Work pressure, workplace social resources and work-family conflict: The tale of two sectors, ''International Journal of Stress Management, 16'', 291–311.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, some research also shows that the utilization of provided resources such as child care support or flexible work hours has no longitudinal connection with WFC (Hammer, Neal, Newson, Brockwood, &amp; Colton, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L., Neal, M., Newson, J., Brockwood, K., &amp; Colton, C. (2005). A Longitudinal Study of the Effects of Dual-Earner Couples’ Utilization of Family-Friendly Workplace Supports on Work and Family Outcomes. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 90'', 799–810.&lt;/ref&gt; This result speaks against common assumptions. Also, the supervisor has a social-support function for his/her subordinates. As Moen and Yu (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Moen, P., &amp; Yu, Y. (2000). Effective work/life strategies: Working couples, work conditions, gender, and life quality. ''Social Problems, 47'', 291–326.&lt;/ref&gt; showed supervisor support is an indicator for lower levels of WFC. Further support for this hypothesis stems from a study conducted by Thompson and Prottas (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, C. A., &amp; Prottas, D. F. (2005). Relationships among organizational family support, job autonomy, perceived control, and employee well-being. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 10'', 100–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping in mind the support function, organizations should provide trainings for the supervisors and conduct the selection process of new employees. Similar as for organizational support, the meta-analysis by Kossek et al. (2011) showed that general supervisor is negatively connected to WFC. Again, work–family-specific supervisor support has a stronger negative connection with WFC. Aside from support by the organization and the supervisor, research points out a third source of work-place support: The coworker. The informal support by the coworker not only correlates with positive aspects such as job satisfaction, but is also negatively associated with negative variables such as WFC (Dolcos &amp; Doley, 2009; Thompson &amp; Prottas, 2005).

In terms of work–family enrichment, supervisors and organizations are also relevant, since they are able to provide with important resource (e.g., skills and financial benefits) and positive affect.

==Research methods to investigate==
A methodological review by Casper, Eby, Bordeaux, Lockwood, and Lambert (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Casper, W. J., Eby, L. T., Bordeaux, C., Lockwood, A., &amp; Lambert, D. (2007). A review of research methods in IO/OB work-family research. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 92'', 28–43.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the research methods used in the area of work-family research from 1980 to 2003. Their main findings are:

· The descriptions of sample characteristics are often inconsistent and leave out essential information necessary to evaluate if generalization is appropriate or not.
&lt;br /&gt;· Samples are mostly homogenous, neglecting diversity regarding racial, ethnic, cultural aspects, and non-traditional families (e.g., [[Single person|single]] or [[homosexuality|homosexual]] parents).
&lt;br /&gt;· The research design of most studies is [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] and correlational. Field settings are predominant (97%). Only 2% use [[experiment]]al designs.
&lt;br /&gt;· [[Statistical survey|Surveys]] are mostly used for data collection (85%) whereas [[Qualitative research|qualitative methods]] are used less often. Measures are mainly derived from one single person (76%) and focus on the individual level of analysis (89%). In this respect, research on, for example, dyads and [[social group|groups]] have been neglected.
&lt;br /&gt;· Simple inferential statistics are preferred (79%) instead of, for example, [[structural equation modeling]] (17%).
&lt;br /&gt;· Regarding reliability aspects, coefficient [[Cronbach alpha|alpha]] is often provided (87%), thereby reaching .79 on average. Pre-existing [[Rating scale|scales]] are often used (69%) containing multi-item measures (79%).

In light of these results, Casper, et al. (2007) give several recommendations. They suggest, for example, that researchers should use more [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] and experimental research designs, more diverse samples, data sources and levels of analysis.

'''Yngve Axel Andreas Larsson''' (January 9, 1917 &amp;ndash; March 22, 2014)&lt;ref name=dn/&gt; was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pediatrician]], [[medicine professor]] and [[diabetologist]].

Yngve Larsson was the fifth child of [[Stockholm]] [[vice mayor]] [[Yngve Larsson]] and Elin Larsson (daughter of publisher [[Karl Otto Bonnier]]). He graduated from [[Uppsala University]] in 1938 and gained his [[Ph.D.]] at [[Karolinska Institute]] in 1956. From 1964 he worked for [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] in [[Addis Abeba]], [[Ethiopia]], first as a professor and 1965-1970 as director of the [[Ethio-Swedish Pediatric Clinic]] (ESPC) at [[Haile Selassie I University]]. In parallel, his wife pediatrician Ulla Larsson established the [[Lideta Maternal and Chlid Health Center]] (or ''Lideta MCH Clinic'') nearby with financing from the Swedish branch of [[Save the Children]]. In the 1970s Yngve Larsson worked in [[Linköping]], Sweden, in charge of [[diabetology]] at [[Linköping University]] and initiating national research in the field.

Yngve Larsson was active in the [[International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes]] (ISPAD) from its first year, and was a member of its Advisory Council in 1981-1984. After retiring in 1983, he worked within [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare]] for several years.

Larsson died from [[natural causes]] on 22 March 2014 in [[Lidingö]]. He was 97 years old.&lt;ref name=dn&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] Kultur|title=Familjeannonser : Yngve Larsson J:r|p=15|date=2 April 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zardip's Search for Healthy Wellness''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] educational [[television]] show from the 1980s intended to teach [[public health]] messages to schoolchildren. Zardip Pacific, played by [[Keram Malicki-Sánchez]], is an alien from a planet whose inhabitants are becoming sick as they do not know how to live a healthy lifestyle.  He takes the form of a boy and ventures to [[Earth]] to report the habits of humans to his home planet. He befriends a group of teenagers, who instruct their new and ignorant friend on topics ranging from nutrition to exercise, all the while unaware of Zardip's true identity.

The show has a cult following among Canadians who attended grade school in the late 1980s and early 1990s, due to memories of watching the [[videocassettes]] in class, or watching the shows as they aired on [[TVOntario]].
