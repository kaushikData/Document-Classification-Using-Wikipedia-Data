{{for|Abu al-Walīd, the medieval rabbi|Jonah ibn Janah}}

'''Abu al-Walid''' ({{lang|ar|ابو الوليد}}) (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Abu al-Waleed''' and also called '''Abu al-Walid al-Ghamdi''' or simply '''Abu Walid''') (1967 – 16 April 2004), was a [[Saudi Arabia]]n of the [[Ghamd]] tribe who fought as a "[[mujahideen|mujahid]]" volunteer in Central Asia, the [[Balkans]], and the [[North Caucasus]]. He was killed in April 2004 in [[Chechnya]] by the [[Russia]]n [[Spetsnaz|federal forces]].

Al-Walid was one of the most prominent Arabs fighting in Chechnya. In 2002 he took over as [[emir]] (commander) of an autonomous unit, composed mostly of non-[[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[mujahideen]], following the death of [[Ibn al-Khattab]] on 20 March 2002.

Abu al-Walid was accused by [[Russia]]ns of terrorist attacks on civilians, and alleged to be an agent of Saudi intelligence, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], or [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]]'s [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="CACI1"/&gt; He never responded to the charges, but condemned abuses by Russian forces in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="AJ1"&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/Archive/Archive?ArchiveID=2405 "Russia warned of new attacks"], Al Jazeera  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130000643/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/Archive/Archive?ArchiveID=2405 |date=30 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==
During his lifetime, al-Walid stayed out of the spotlight. His predecessor, [[Ibn al-Khattab]] (more commonly known as Khattab), was known to have a personal camera crew of two who followed him into combat. Speculation arose about al-Walid's identity, whereabouts and actions, and occasionally there were rumours of his death. A persistent rumour was that he had drowned in June 2002, carried off on his horse after trying to ford a river.&lt;ref name="CACI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=1100 |title=Amir Abu al-Walid and the Islamic Component of the Chechen War |publisher=Central Asia – Caucasus Analyst |accessdate=3 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206130030/http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=1100 |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]]n officials announced his death at least seven times.&lt;ref name="JF1"&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=2899&amp;article_id=23471 "Chechnya's Abu Walid and the Saudi Dilemma"], The Jamestown Foundation;  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325235928/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=2899&amp;article_id=23471 |date=25 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point, even his very existence was deemed doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zjgHIGPC |title=Abu Walid: Fact or Fiction? |work=North Caucasus Analysis| volume=3 |issue= 27 |date=23 September 2002 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2002, his family gave an interview to the Saudi newspaper ''[[Al-Watan (Saudi Arabia)|Al-Watan]]'', telling much about his background.&lt;ref name="AW1"&gt;[http://www.alwatan.com.sa/news/index.asp?issueno=2451 "Interview with Abu Al-Walid's family"], ''Al-Watan'', 23 June 2002 (Arabic)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616120220/http://www.alwatan.com.sa/news/index.asp?issueno=2451 |date=16 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They said his full given name was '''Abd Al-Aziz Bin Ali Bin Said Al Said Al-Ghamdi'''.&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CACI2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=2337 |title=The Killing of Abu al-Walid and the Russian Policy in Chechnya |publisher=Central Asia – Caucasus Analyst |accessdate=3 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206130034/http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=2337 |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Al-Walid was raised in the village of al-Hal, near the city of [[Baljorashi]] in Saudi Arabia’s [[Al Bahah Province]]. In his native village, his father was a well known [[imam]]. The boy was born into a large family as one of eleven sons. His brothers claimed that in his youth, al-Walid had enjoyed acting, reading religious books and studying the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="CACI1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt;

=== Afghanistan, Bosnia and Tajikistan ===
In 1986, when he was 16 years old, al-Walid obtained his parents' permission to participate in [[jihad]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He soon left for the country to join the [[mujahideen]] in their fight against the Russian forces during the [[Afghan-Soviet War]]. The next two years he spent training at the [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], an organization created by [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]. They trained the [[Afghan Arabs|international volunteers]] and distributed funds to Islamic groups. Upon completing his training, al-Walid was assigned to a combat unit where he started fighting. On two occasions he briefly returned to Saudi Arabia, once to have an injury to his left hand treated.

After the end of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghan War]], al-Walid went on to fight in other conflicts in Europe and Asia. In the 1990s, the movement would lead him to the [[Balkans]], where he fought alongside the [[Bosnian Muslims]] in the [[Bosnian War]]; Tajikistan, where he assisted Muslim rebels in the [[Civil war in Tajikistan|Tajik Civil war]]; and eventually to [[Chechnya]], where he joined the band called the Arab mujahideen. This group had been organized by and was being led by [[Ibn al-Khattab]].&lt;ref name="CACI1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CACI2"/&gt;

=== First Chechen War ===
In the [[First Chechen War]], al-Walid served as a [[Naib]] (deputy) in Khattab's unit. He participated in the numerous raids and ambushes that were executed by the IIB, including the April 1996 [[Shatoy ambush]], in which they attacked and destroyed a large Russian armoured column.&lt;ref name="CACI3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/901|title=Unravelling the Links between the Middle East and Islamic Militants in Chechnya|first=Dr. Brian |last=Williams|publisher= Central Asia – Caucasus Analyst| date=12 February 2003|accessdate=5 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101206122329/http://cacianalyst.org/?q=node/901| archivedate= 6 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interwar period and Dagestan War ===
After the war, he remained in Chechnya along with most of the battalion It concentrated on setting up a network of camps in the mountainous South of the country, in which they trained Islamist rebels from throughout the [[Northern Caucasus|region]], and recruits from abroad.&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt;

He married a Chechen woman. They had two children together.&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CACI2"/&gt;

On 22 December 1997 al-Walid participated in a surprise attack on the base of the 136th Armoured Brigade of the Russian Army, stationed in [[Buynaksk]], [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name="JF7"&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=2&amp;issue_id=328&amp;article_id=3598 Chechen Gunmen Attack Russian Army Unit in Dagestan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322132744/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=2&amp;issue_id=328&amp;article_id=3598 |date=22 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This raid contributed to the growing tensions between [[Government of Russia|Moscow]] and the newly formed government of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].

In 1999 he participated in the [[Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade]]&lt;nowiki&gt;’s&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[War in Dagestan|invasion of Dagestan]], which helped catalyze the Second Chechen War. During this conflict, Khattab's first deputy Hakim al-Medani was killed.&lt;ref name="KC4"&gt;{{cite web|author = |url=http://www.kavkaz.org.uk/eng/content/2006/11/29/6608.shtml |title= Heroes Of Jihad In Chechnya |publisher=Kavkaz Center (UK) |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts believe that after al-Medani's death, al-Walid was promoted to the position of first deputy. Before the events of 1999 in Dagestan, al-Walid was a relatively unknown figure outside of Chechnya.

After his incursion, his notoriety began to rise in [[Islamism|Islamist]] circles abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zjgZcwK8 |title=The 'Chechen Arabs': An Introduction To The Real Al-Qaeda Terrorists From Chechnya |work=Terrorism Monitor |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=5 May 2005 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Chechen War ===
In the [[Second Chechen War]], al-Walid continued as Khattab’s deputy to participate in raids and ambushes. In the spring of 2000, he achieved his most important military victories. On 29 February, he led the [[Battle of Ulus-Kert]]. His forces engaged and surrounded an entire company of the [[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]] 76th [[Russian Guards|Guards]] Air Assault Division from [[Pskov]]. The battle lasted for several days and eventually resulted in the total annihilation of the Russian company.&lt;ref name="MilRev1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/JulAug01/JulAug01/bobja01.pdf |title=Military Review; Ulus-Kert: An Airborne Company’s Last stand |publisher=Usacac.army.mil |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2012|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5sau4464d |archivedate = 2010-09-08|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The separatist news agency [[Chechenpress]] reported that only 12 Chechen rebels had been killed in the battle,&lt;ref name="CP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chechenpress.info/english/news/2005/03/08/03.shtml |title=The battle of Ulus-Kert gives no rest to Moscow |publisher=Chechen Press|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Russian sources estimated their losses at up to 300 men. In April 2000, al-Walid successfully attacked the VDV 51st Guards Parachute Landing Regiment from [[Tula, Russia|Tula]].&lt;ref name="CACI1"/&gt;

In the summer of 2001, the late [[Aslan Maskhadov]], then president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, appointed Abu al-Walid commander of the Eastern front.&lt;ref name="CACI3"/&gt;

After Khattab’s death on 20 March 2002, al-Walid assumed command of the IIB. Soon afterwards he released an article through the foreign Mujahideen’s official website al-Qoqaz, in which he explained the circumstances surrounding Khattab’s death. The release of this article also confirmed that he had taken command of the IIB.&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt; Later he also issued [https://archive.org/download/biographyofkhattab2/biographyofkhattab2.mp a video-statement], in which he commented on the death of his predecessor.

On 9 April 2002, al-Walid announced that his forces had shot down the [[Mil Mi-24|Mil Mi-24 ‘Hind’]] gunship and taken its three-man crew prisoner. It had been reported missing for two months. He released the serial number of the helicopter and detailed information about the crew members. On 16 May he issued an ultimatum to the Russian military authorities: threatening to kill the three prisoners if the Russians failed to release 20 Chechens being held in Russian prisons. The Russians did not comply. The online Chechen Islamist news agency, [[Kavkaz Center]], claimed it has unconfirmed information that the crew had been executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zjgpdray |title=CHECHEN REBEL DEADLINE PASSES, CAPTURED PILOTS' FATE UNKNOWN |publisher=Monitor |volume=8 |issue= 99 |date=21 May 2002 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Al-Walid was killed by members of [[Sulim Yamadaev]]’s [[Special Battalions Vostok and Zapad|Special Battalion “Vostok”]] (East)&lt;ref name=hunters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article522637.ece |title=Going in hard with the guerrilla hunters of Chechnya |work=The Sunday Times |date=15 May 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6056CBXQs |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chechnya on 16 April 2004.&lt;ref name=martyr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2004/04/19/2678.shtml |title=Commander Abul Walid has been martyred |publisher=Kavkaz Center |date=19 April 2004 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/605NTPmyc |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are several versions of the circumstances, the most extensive account is derived from a letter written by [[Abu Hafs al-Urduni]], who assumed command of the [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya]].&lt;ref name=urduni&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zjhTrcg6 |title=ABU HAFS AL-URDANI: THE QUIET MUJAHID |publisher=North Caucasus Analysis Volume: 6 Issue: 5 |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that al-Walid was “on tour to all regiments to task them with operations and logistical plans." Members of his party were captured in the village of Tsa-Vedeno, and pro-Moscow security forces determined "his position in a nearby forest.”&lt;ref name=urduni/&gt;

After heavy bombardment of the area, snipers ambushed and killed al-Walid.&lt;ref name=urduni/&gt; Abu al-Walid's brother Ali Al Ghamdi said that Abu al-Walid was ambushed and shot by the Russian Special Forces in the forest near the village of Tsa-Vedeno. Ali said that Abu al-walid's companions were able to hide his body from the Russian forces in the forest then buried him later.
He also said that the information about Abu Al-Walid's being betrayed were wrong and that his brother was shot in a fight with the Russian forces.
Abu al-Walid's will was not to be filmed after his death. [[Vladimir Putin]] rewarded Yamadaev as a [[Hero of the Russian Federation]] at the [[Kremlin]] in the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name=hunters/&gt;

== Allegations of terrorism ==
Russian authorities often accused Khattab, al-Walid and other Arabs fighting in Chechnya, of involvement in terrorism. According to the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]], Al-Walid was responsible for several terrorist attacks, including the [[Russian apartment bombings|1999 apartment bombings]], the [[2002 Kaspiysk bombing]], and planned but never executed [[Biological warfare|bacteriological attacks]] on Russia. He and [[Shamil Basayev]] were also accused of organizing the [[2002 Grozny suicide bombing|suicide-bombing]] of the Chechen Republic's Government headquarters in [[Grozny]] on 27 December 2002.

Only Basayev claimed responsibility for the latter attack, but Russian officials asserted that the “Arab methods” suggested that it was done by “Arab militants trained in Afghanistan”. Al-Walid has been accused of being an agent of [[al-Qaeda]], the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah|Saudi Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="CACI1"/&gt; He never responded to such allegations, and never claimed responsibility for any of these terrorist attacks. He never admitted to being a member of al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Saudi Intelligence.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Al-Walid did comment on other acts of terrorism. On 11 June 2003, the London-based Arabic newspaper ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'' reported on a statement he had released through the al-Qoqaz News Agency. He encouraged the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgents]] to carry out [[suicide attack|suicide operations]]. He was quoted as saying; “According to [my] experience in the Caucasus, such operations will have an effect on American and British troops.”&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt;

[[File:Abu al-Walid 2.jpg|thumb|Abu al-Walid issuing a video statement on [[Al Jazeera]]]]

On 19 November 2003, the [[Qatar]]-based Arabic television network [[Al-Jazeera]] broadcast a video statement in which al-Walid commented on suicide bombings by Chechen women; he claimed the attacks were motivated by fear of rape and brutality by Russian soldiers.&lt;ref name="JF1"/&gt; A translation of this statement is available on [[BBC Monitoring]]; he was quoted as saying; &lt;blockquote&gt;“These women, particularly the wives of the Mujahideen who were [[martyred]], are being threatened in their homes, their honour and everything are being threatened. They do not accept being humiliated and living under occupation. They say that they want to serve the cause of Almighty God and avenge the death of their husbands and persecuted people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2003/11/25/2022.shtml |title=So what did Abu-Walid say? |publisher=Kavkaz Center |date=25 November 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zjfz5FkJ |archivedate=26 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2004, one day before the [[Russian presidential election, 2004|Russian presidential election]], al-Walid released another video statement broadcast by Al-Jazeera. He commented on the Russian strategy of dropping mines in the forested areas from which the Chechen insurgents are carrying out their [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Federal Armed Forces]] and their [[Government of Chechnya|Chechen collaborators]]. He was quoted as saying the following;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The enemies of God drop mines in the forests and God willing, we will return them to the Russians and they will find them on their land and in the midst of their families. (…) But perhaps we may wait a little to see the upcoming elections. If they elect someone who declares war on Chechnya, then the Russians are declaring war against the Chechens and by God we will send them these [mines]... Not only these but also things that did not cross their minds. (…) We will return these to you [Russians]… You will, God willing, see hundreds of people crippled.”&lt;ref name="AJ1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;It is not known whether or not these threats have ever been carried out.

The Amirs of the Arab mujahideen in Chechnya have helped acquire and distribute funds provided by wealthy, [[Salafist]] charities, such as [[al-Haramain Foundation|al-Haramein]].&lt;ref name="CACI3"/&gt; But there has not been solid evidence of links to al-Qaeda or other international terrorist organizations.

Retrieved on 2006-11-14&lt;/ref&gt; was a self-taught [[Finnish people|Finnish]]  weapons designer. Of the 50 weapons he designed, the best known is the [[Suomi KP/-31|Suomi M-31 SMG]]. Other well-known weapon designs of his include the [[Lahti-Saloranta M/26]] LMG, [[Lahti L-35]] pistol, and [[Lahti L-39]] anti-tank rifle. Lahti also designed the [[7,62 ITKK 31 VKT]] anti-aircraft machine gun and the [[20 ITK 40 VKT]] anti-aircraft cannon.

His work is considered decisive in defending Finnish independence and increasing trust in the reliability of domestic weapons produced there.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Aimo Johannes Lahti was born in [[Viiala]] on 28 April 1896, to Evert Williamson Lahti and Ida Sophia Carlsdaughter née Viitanen, the oldest of five boys.&lt;ref name="Liisa Ahokas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Liisa Ahokas|url=http://akaanseutu.fi/2013/07/12/suomi-konepistooli-teki-viialassa-syntyneesta-aimo-lahdesta-maailmankuulun/|title=Suomi-konepistooli teki Viialassa syntyneestä Aimo Lahdesta maailmankuulun|publisher=AKAAN SEUTU |date=12 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a safe and somewhat wild childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaajakallio|1970|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lahti did not enjoy school and left after the sixth year of elementary school. He started working in the Viiala glass factory when he was 13 years old. In the same year, he bought his first weapon, a [[Berdan rifle]], with five [[Finnish mark|marks]] he had earned in the factory. Lahti was fascinated by the rifle’s mechanism and visited local gunsmith ''Säteri'' with whom he examined the weapon closely. Aimo Lahti visited him several times, becoming familiar with weapon mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaajakallio|1970|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lahti served his conscription in central Finland’s regiment during 1918 and 1919. On October 20, 1919, he married Ida Dagmar Lassila (1 December 1890 – 27 October 1968)&lt;ref name="Liisa Ahokas"/&gt; with whom he had a son, Olavi Johannes Lahti. Olavi was later a pilot in the [[Finnish Air Force]] and died in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaajakallio|1970|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Master Armorer in the Finnish Army===
After working for the railway Aimo Lahti joined the [[Finnish Army]] as a Master Armorer in 1921. He was influenced in this decision by Captain Rosenholm. In 1922, he started to design the [[Suomi M-31 SMG]] after examining the Bergmann [[MP18]], which had many design problems and was expensive. The new design was revolutionary because the reliability, accuracy, and rate of fire were excellent. The first 200 Suomi SMGs were produced in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaajakallio|1970|pp=71–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the prototypes were made, he was ordered to work under the control of the Ministry of Defence and to design a light machine gun, which eventually would be the [[Lahti-Saloranta M/26]]. He then improved the [[Mosin–Nagant]] rifle by designing the M/27 "Pystykorva" "[[Spitz]]", named for its foresight guards' resemblance to the dog breed's ears.  This rifle was later issued to the Finnish Army as their service rifle.

In 1932 Lahti and the Ministry of Defence signed two important agreements about Lahti's  earnings and other economic benefits. It also gave the government rights to use and sell his designs.&lt;ref name="Veteraanienperinto" /&gt; In the same year, he got an offer to move to an American weapon company. He was offered a check for 3 million marks and a five percent commission on the weapons that would have been produced in the United States. On the same day the Ministry reformed his older contract. Lahti received more benefits and rights to his inventions and therefore did not feel that moving to the United States was a better offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaajakallio|1970|pp=165–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lahti continued to design weapons until the end of the [[Continuation War]] when the [[Allied Control Commission (Finland)|Allied Control Commission]] questioned him about the lost 30 "[[assault rifle]]s" that he was designing and other topics. The commission made a decision that he would not be allowed to work as a weapon designer anymore. He enjoyed a Finnish Army’s [[Major General]]’s [[pension]] after the age of 50, until his death in 1970 in [[Jyväskylä]] at the age of 74.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaajakallio|1970|pp=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksa Nenadović''' (1749 [[Brankovina]], [[Valjevo]], [[Ottoman Empire]] — 4 February 1804, Valjevo, Ottoman Empire) was ober knyaz of [[Tamnava]]—[[Posavina]] district of Valjevo [[nahiyah]] of the [[Belgrade Pashaluk]].

== Family ==
Aleksa Nenadović was member of Nenadović family from Valjevo. His younger brother was [[Jakov Nenadović]], the first Serbian Interior Minister and voivode (military commander) in the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. His sons were [[Sima Nenadović]] who was a Serbian voivode in the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] and [[Matija Nenadović]] a Serbian archpriest, writer, and a notable leader of the First Serbian Uprising.

== Biography ==

Aleksa Nenadović had business relations with [[Hadži Mustafa Pasha]] who was a vizier of the Belgrade Pashaluk. He also cooperated with [[Peter Ichko]] who saved his life once.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|1997|}}{{quote|U svojim Memoarima prota Mateja Nenadović kazuje, da je i njegov otac, valjevski knez Aleksa, imao od ranije poslovnih veza sa hadži-Mustafom i da je bio prijatelj Petra Ička, koji mu je jednom prilikom i život spasao.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1797 [[sultan]] appointed Mustafa Pasha on position of [[beglerbeg]] of [[Rumelia Eyalet]] and he left Serbia for [[Plovdiv]] to fight against [[Osman Pazvantoğlu|Pazvantoğlu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|1997|}}{{quote|U leto 1797. sultan ga je imenovao za rumeliskog begler-bega i Mustafa je otišao u Plovdiv, da rukovodi akcijom protiv buntovnika iz Vidina i u Rumeliji.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the absence of Mustafa Pasha the forces of Pazvantoğlu together with Jannisaries captured Požarevac and besieged Belgrade fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|1997|}}{{quote|Za vreme njegova otsutstva vidinski gospodar sa janičarima naredio je brz napad i potukao je srpsku i pašinu vojsku kod Požarevca, pa je prodro sve do Beograda i zauzeo samu varoš. }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of November 1797 Aleksa Nenadović together with other ober knezes from [[Valjevo]] [[Ilija Birčanin]] and [[Nikola Grbović]] brought their forces to Belgrade and forced besieging Janissary forces to retreat to [[Smederevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Podrinsko-kolubarski region | publisher=RNIRO "Glas Podrinja" | author=Filipović, Stanoje R. | year=1982 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22+%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0+%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%BC+%22&amp;dq=%22+%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0+%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%BC+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cCjDULSJM8qB4AT8q4GoCA&amp;redir_esc=y | page=60|quote=Ваљевски кнезови Алекса Ненадовић, Илија Бирчанин и Никола Грбовић довели су своју војску у Београд и учествовали у оштрој борби са јаничарима који су се побеђени повукли.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ćorović|1997|}}{{quote|Pred sam Božić stigoše u pomoć valjevski Srbi i sa njihovom pomoću turska gradska posada odbi napadače i očisti grad.

== Death ==

He was killed, decapitated, by forces of four Dahiyah during the event known as [[Slaughter of the Knezes]]. The event triggered a widespread revolt which eventually evolved into the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. According to contemporary sources from [[Valjevo]], the severed heads of Aleksa Nenadović and [[Ilija Birčanin]] were put on some sort of a public display in the central square to serve as an example to those who might plot against the rule of the Dahia.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m0QLAAAAIAAJ History of Servia and the Servian Revolution]-Leopold von Ranke,tran:Louisa Hay Ker p 119-20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baldrick''' is the name of several fictional characters featured in the long-running [[BBC]] historic comedy television series ''[[Blackadder]]''. Each one serves as [[Edmund Blackadder]]'s servant and sidekick and acts as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to the lead character. Each series of ''Blackadder'' is set in a different period in [[British history]], and each Baldrick character (as with the character of Edmund) is a descendant of the Baldrick from the preceding series. Just as Blackadder exists in many incarnations throughout the ages, so does Baldrick; whenever there is a Blackadder there is a Baldrick serving him. They are all portrayed by Sir [[Tony Robinson]] (although in the unaired pilot episode he was played by [[Philip Fox (actor)|Philip Fox]]).

The relationship between Edmund and Baldrick evolves significantly; in [[The Black Adder|the first series of the show]], Baldrick is more intelligent than Blackadder, but this dynamic is reversed in subsequent series, with Baldrick's intelligence decreasing as the show continued. He is the only character other than Edmund Blackadder to appear in every episode of the programme.

'Baldrick' is a real but rare family name. It is Germanic in origin, and has been present in Britain all the way back to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of 1066]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?name=Baldrick |title=Baldrick surname meaning |publisher=SurnameDB |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
The character of Baldrick has become popularly associated with the comedic [[catch phrase]] "I have a cunning plan".&lt;ref name="bbc-quotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=I have a cunning plan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p008rjxc/video/p008tw62/blackadder_i_have_a_cunning_plan/|work=Great Comedy Quotes and Catchphrases |publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  "cunning plans" in question are dreamed up by Baldrick as a solution to a particular problem or crisis and are usually ridiculed scathingly by Blackadder for their implausibility, but Blackadder frequently resorts to using these plans when the situation becomes desperate.

Although Baldrick's main goal is mostly very hidden, with a clever eye it is seen that he makes several attempts throughout history to raise his social standing, similar to Blackadder although the latter had much more success.
*In the first series, Baldrick (a servant in the castle and a dung gatherer at the time) managed to gain favour with Lord Edmund Plantagenet by claiming he witnessed the King giving Edmund a special greeting (sarcastically). Edmund, impressed with Baldrick "admiring" him, appointed him his squire in the Battle of Bosworth Field. Later, when Richard III was killed (by Edmund), Baldrick helped him cover it up and managed to remain in Edmund's service after he became a Prince. Throughout the first series, Baldrick always assists Edmund and keeps him in the illusion he is admired until the last episode where he sadly gets fired and due to having worked years to even get into the castle goes to very low jobs. After Edmund left, he cried (either for losing his status or for actual attachment to the Prince). Baldrick managed to do one last thing for the Prince and with Lord Percy Percy's assistance, killed the Black Seal (the six most evil men in England plus Blackadder's archenemy). Percy accidentally also poisoned the royal family and Edmund. It is unknown what happened to him.
*In the second series, Baldrick's attempts to raise his social status bring much lower results due to his much smaller intelligence. His most visible attempt is in the first episode, where he tries to marry Lord Edmund Blackadder as his bridesmaid (after Kate eloped). Baldrick still has enough intelligence left to admire Blackadder and clearly has desire to please him. Nevertheless, Edmund despises him and even fires him once. This great obstacle was removed for a short period of time when Edmund was kidnapped by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible along with Lord Melchett, thus Baldrick was able to get into the royal court by becoming the Queen's personal pet. A few hours later he was murdered by Prince Ludwig along with Blackadder, Melchett, Queenie, Nursie, and Lord Percy.
*In the third series, S.Baldrick has lost almost all intelligence and apparently has no desire to rise in social standing and claims in the first episode that his goal in life is the acquisition of turnips. Ironically, in the same episode, Baldrick is appointed to the House of Lords by Prince George and thus becomes upper class, one of the greatest achievements of the Baldrick family. He also haggles for a priceless turnip (£400,000). Baldrick's turnip is crushed by Blackadder later and presumably his titles were erased as in the following episodes, he is once more lower class.
*In the fourth series, Private S. Baldrick's intelligence has slightly risen again enough that he desires a rise in social status. He attempts to gain social status in the third episode by marrying General Melchett. This of course does not succeed. He is also more aware of the classes than previous Baldricks (and is apparently a supporter of the [[Russian Revolution]]) and is angry when Blackadder hits him several times (other Baldricks never complain).
*In the Millennium special, S.Baldrick constructs a fake time machine from Leonardo da Vinci's sketches, despite his inability to read (combating this with his experience of constructing Airfix models). Baldrick's intelligence has risen to the level of the second Baldrick again and accidentally makes a real time machine. After a time-travel adventure, Lord Blackadder find England an extension of France, William Shakespeare having designed the ballpoint pen and no knowledge of Robin Hood whatsoever. Edmund takes all the things he gained on his journey (besides Elizabeth I's crown) and after another adventure, gets the idea to alter the timeline to become King. Predictably, Baldrick becomes his Prime Minister, finally becoming what he desired (as did Edmund) and is the second Baldrick to rise to upper class (although after Blackadder's alterations there may be more).

The catchphrase "I have a cunning plan" made its first appearance in the pilot episode, but it is not regularly used until [[Blackadder the Third|the third series]]; Blackadder had mentioned the phrase twice in the first series and Baldrick once. Baldrick had also claimed to have "a plan" in a "cunning" voice on one occasion in ''[[Blackadder II]]''. In the [[Goodbyeee|final episode]] of the last series, ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'', Baldrick announces that he has a cunning plan to save the main characters from "[[going over the top]]", although it is never revealed what this plan might be (other than that it is "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at [[Oxford University]]"). Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely, dismisses it, telling Baldrick "Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan to get out of here by pretending to be mad. I mean, who would have noticed another madman around here?"

A persistent feature among the Baldricks is their lack of sexual preference, which is often played upon for comic effect. Although Baldrick likes women, he sometimes ends up having encounters with other men, such as a sailor in "[[Money (Blackadder)|Money]]" (''[[Blackadder II]]'') in exchange for sixpence and [[Will Scarlet]] (''[[Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth]]''). He also expresses interest in marrying male characters to increase his social status, such as Blackadder in "[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]", Prince George in "[[Amy and Amiability]]" (''[[Blackadder the Third]]'') and [[General Melchett]] in "[[Major Star]]" (''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''). Nonetheless, Baldrick also shows a degree of attraction to women, shown in his conversation with a prostitute in "Money", and in "Amy and Amiability", when he expresses disappointment upon receiving a perfunctory kiss from Blackadder (instead of the voluptuous Lady Sarah Cheapside). Each Baldrick, at various points over the four series, is also willing—and at times eager—to indulge in [[crossdressing]].

The only trait that is actually shared by all Baldricks is complete lack of hygiene and always having filthy, shaggy clothing. All Baldricks also have a different hat in the series (the first one has a [[Phrygian cap]], the second has a [[Tudor bonnet]], the third has a [[tricorne hat]] and the fourth has a [[Lenin cap|Lenin-inspired]] [[peaked cap|trench cap]]). Some Baldricks are also fascinated with turnips, although mainly the third one. The second Baldrick mainly cooked it for dinner and while also finding an amusingly shaped turnip funny while the fourth was in a "Turnip Street Workhouse". However, only the third Baldrick had no other goal in life but the acquisition of turnips. Baldrick proves more intelligent than Blackadder's other companions—such as [[Lord Percy Percy]] or [[George (Blackadder)|George]]—although only slightly. He is, however, often accorded more cruelty and mistreatment than he deserves.

==Character development==

===Pilot episode===
In 1982, prior to the first ''Black Adder'' series, a [[The Black Adder (pilot episode)|pilot episode]] was filmed which featured a number of characters who were later included in the first series. The episode, which was never televised, included an early version of the Baldrick character, played by [[Philip Fox (actor)|Philip Fox]], who is portrayed as slightly stupid in contrast to the intelligent, scheming Prince Edmund. Following this pilot, the writers decided to reverse this relationship when the first televised series was produced, so that Baldrick was the clever [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the idiotic Edmund. In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reflected on this change in characterisation, suggesting that it had been a poor decision and commenting that it was "an interesting example of getting it right first time":&lt;ref name="guardian-pilot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heritage|first=Stuart|title=Sherlock Holmes's smarter brothers: the best pilots that never made it to air |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/may/28/sherlock-holmes-best-pilots-never|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 December 2010|location=London|date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Black Adder''===
{{Main|The Black Adder}}
The medieval Baldrick was probably the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had worked very hard to get – earlier jobs include milking [[pig]]s and mucking out [[Leprosy|lepers]]) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] at the feast before the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with [[Lord Percy Percy|Lord Percy]], toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.

Although cleverer than the Prince, Baldrick, knowing his place in the medieval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This included carrying the decapitated body of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and sleeping with the [[Infante|Spanish Infanta]], Edmund's [[fiancée]], making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.

This Baldrick also has cunning plans that, contrary to most of those of his descendants, mostly work. For instance, when Edmund seeks to kill [[Dougal McAngus]], Baldrick suggests that he gets a cannon, takes McAngus outside, makes him stick his head down the cannon and then blow it off. Edmund scoffs at this, and instead tries to kill McAngus using several different "cunning plans" of his own. After having failed miserably with all of these, he resorts to using Baldrick's original plan, which works.

It is Baldrick who suggests the title "The Black Adder" for Prince Edmund, which his descendants later adopt as a surname.

This Baldrick survived the last episode as he and Lord Percy had poisoned the wine to stop the Black Seal. But Percy poisoned the whole batch, killing the king, the queen, Prince Harry, the entire court and Edmund. He and Percy tried to stop them but they were too late, running in after the credits when everybody was already dead.

The "clever" Baldrick character was abandoned after the first series, becoming steadily more imbecilic with each incarnation.

===''Blackadder II''===
{{Main|Blackadder II}}
The [[Elizabethan]] Baldrick is the servant and [[Indentured servant|bondsman]] to [[Lord Blackadder]]. He has been in Blackadder's family since 1532, when he was two years old. He has a bedroom in Blackadder's house, but has also been forced to sleep in the gutter and on the roof. He has a tendency to eat [[feces|dung]]. While his master treats him with utter contempt, he remains intensely loyal.

This Baldrick is considerably less intelligent than his medieval ancestor, although not as dim as future Baldricks. A kindly soul, Baldrick's lack of formal education is compensated for by his basic streetwise cunning. While his "cunning plans" do sometimes have a strange, twisted and often perverse logic and cunning to them, he is nevertheless incredibly stupid. For example, in the episode "[[Head (Blackadder)|Head]]", Blackadder attempts to teach Baldrick how to add, asking if he had "two beans, and I add two more beans, what does that make?" Baldrick replies, "Some beans", "Three beans... and that one", and "a very small [[casserole]]".

Baldrick loves turnips, a trait that would also be present in his descendants. In the episode "[[Beer (Blackadder)|Beer]]", where he and Percy famously discover a turnip shaped like a [[Phallus|"thingy"]]. Baldrick is particularly delighted by the discovery, because it contrasts with his own "thingy" which is shaped like a turnip. In the same episode Baldrick reveals his recipe for "Turnip Surprise" – "the surprise is: there's nothing in it except the turnip".

===''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years''===
{{Main|Blackadder: The Cavalier Years}}
Baldrick (possibly died 1649) is servant to [[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years|Sir Edmund Blackadder]]. Like his Elizabethan ancestor he moonlights as an executioner, although in his case it is part of a cunning plan to save the life of [[Charles I of England]] by replacing his head with a pumpkin. His plan fails. When Blackadder is about to be captured he quickly disguises himself as a [[Roundhead]] and leaves Baldrick to be killed instead. He is the son of a pig farmer and a [[bearded lady]].

===''Blackadder the Third''===
{{Main|Blackadder the Third}}
The Baldrick of [[British Regency|Regency Britain]] works as an "underscrogsman" (apprentice [[dogsbody]]) to [[Mr. E. Blackadder]], butler to [[George (Blackadder)|Prince George]]. He lives in a pipe in the upstairs [[water closet]] of the Palace.

The third Baldrick is much more noticeably crude and unintelligent than those previous to him and maybe even the most stupid of all four Baldricks. Like his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] ancestor, he is known to eat dung occasionally. He is also more childlike; when asked if he has any distinguishing features, referring to his nose he asserts, "I've got this huge growth in the middle of my face." There is not the slightest sign of "cunning" in any of his plans, which include:
* escaping the [[guillotine]] by waiting until your head has been cut off, then "springing into action" and running "around and around the farmyard, and out the farmyard gate", in the style of a chicken, and
* replacing the burnt first copy of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s [[A Dictionary of the English Language|dictionary]] by taking the string, which has been salvaged, and putting in some new pages. Blackadder clarifies that Baldrick is suggesting that he re-write the entire dictionary in a single night. Blackadder, purely out of desperation, attempts this anyway, before getting stuck at "[[Aardvark]]".

Blackadder also claims that Baldrick has never changed his trousers, and implores him never to do so, for they are, Blackadder claims, akin to [[Pandora's Box]], containing all the evils of the world.

Although he is now on a closer social standing to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same (and possibly more) level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Blackadder punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts him for a few minutes on a spit; grabs him by the shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he "walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely heavy hat"; and promises five minutes of hellish tortures involving a small pencil, surpassing anything possible from Beelzebub over all eternity. However, he does seem to have a higher level of friendship with Blackadder than the other series.

However, despite his noticeable flaws, this Baldrick has more success than any of the others. In an election rigged by Blackadder, he is elected [[Member of Parliament]] for Dunny-on-the-Wold, a [[rotten borough]], although he was intended to be a puppet for Blackadder to manipulate (Blackadder's political opponents succeed in manipulating him instead). He is later made a [[Lord]] by Prince George, and is therefore eligible to sit in the [[House of Lords]] – whether or not he ever does so is another matter, as he is never again referred to by his title after episode 1. Baldrick also succeeds where no Baldrick has succeeded before or since, in calling Blackadder "a lazy, big nosed, rubber-faced bastard".

Baldrick spends the £400,000 he received as a Lord on an enormous turnip ("Well, I had to haggle.") which he refers to as "dream turnip". However, Blackadder later destroys it by crushing it on Baldrick's head.

Baldrick is not given any sort of first name until this third series, when he speculates that it might be "Sodoff", since in childhood when he played in the [[Street gutter|gutter]] when he said to the other [[guttersnipe|snipes]], "Hello, my name's Baldrick," they would reply, "Yes, we know. Sod off, Baldrick!" A diplomatic Blackadder opts to record him as "S. Baldrick". The initial appears to have been adopted by his descendants. In a 1988 episode of ''[[The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow]]'', Baldrick of ''Blackadder the Third'' is on trial during ''Clown Court''. During the "trial" Baldrick reveals that he thinks his name is ''Dropdead'', since people who see him shout out "Drop dead, Baldrick!". The presiding judge, Lord Chief Justice [[Noel Edmonds]], notes the name as "Mr. D. Baldrick".

This particular specimen of Baldrick can also be noted for his definition of "dog": "Not a cat" and "C": "Big, blue wobbly thing what mermaids live in". His command with words is also demonstrated in his "magnificent octopus" (''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''), a semi-autobiographical work that goes "Once upon a time, there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick, and it lived happily ever after."

Baldrick later presented this story to Dr. Samuel Johnson as a replacement for the first dictionary (which he burned by mistake). The story had an unexpected effect on Johnson – he was reminded that he had forgotten to put the word "[[sausage]]" in his dictionary, and ran off in horror.

His heroes are the [[highwayman]] [[List of minor Blackadder characters#Amy Hardwood|"The Shadow"]] and [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]], (or the "Scarlet Pimple" as Baldrick believes his name to be). The former was executed as a result of Blackadder's informing, and the latter was poisoned by him.

This Baldrick grew up in a "haunted hovel", in which a vile, disgusting apparition would slowly make its way into his parents' bed at night. Curiously, this phantom vanished the very day Baldrick left home. In one cunning plan Baldrick tried to chop his mother's head off to solve the problem of her low ceiling.

As mentioned in the episode [[Sense and Senility]], his uncle with the Baldrick surname once played as a "second [[codpiece]]" for the [[Macbeth (character)|leading character]] of ''Macbeth'', but only in the fight scenes. Blackadder concludes that the uncle was a "stunt codpiece" and inquires if he ever had a "large part", to which Baldrick answers that it "depends who was playing Macbeth".

Oddly enough, this Baldrick seems to have a bit of the [[idiot savant]] in him; Baldrick's explanation, although heard from someone else, of why George and Blackadder will be able to trade places is surprisingly smart and articulate, suggesting he might have an amazing memory with words, even if he does not understand what they mean.
{{quote|'''Baldrick:''' You could have someone else fight the duel for you.&lt;br /&gt;
'''George:''' But I'm the Prince Regent! My portrait hangs on every wall.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Blackadder:''' Answer that, Baldrick.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Baldrick:''' Well, my cousin, Bert Baldrick, [[Thomas Gainsborough|Mr. Gainsborough's]] butler's dogsbody, says that all portraits look the same nowadays, since they're painted to a romantic ideal, rather than as a true depiction of the [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] facial qualities of the person in question.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Blackadder:''' Well, your cousin Bert obviously has a larger vocabulary than you, Baldrick.
}}

He also occasionally exhibits a surprising amount of knowledge of current events. When Edmund orders him to hire a horse, he replies: "Hire you a horse? For ninepence? On [[Rosh Hashanah|Jewish New Year]]? In the rain? A bare fortnight after the dreaded horse plague of old London Town? With the blacksmiths' strike in its fifteenth week and the Dorset horse fetishists fair tomorrow?" His reward for this is to be saddled (literally) with the job of horse himself.

Despite his lack of intelligence, though, he was, in ''[[Duel and Duality]]'', able to manipulate Mrs. Miggins' casual conversation about how stupid Prince George was (George himself was present) so that it did not offend George. Additionally, in ''[[Sense and Senility]]'', he warns the Prince of a supposed plot to kill him.

===''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''===
{{Main|Blackadder's Christmas Carol}}
Mr. Baldrick is assistant in [[Ebenezer Blackadder]]'s moustache shop. While still stupid, it seems that having to work for the exceedingly gullible Mr Blackadder has forced him to develop some of the savvy of his earlier ancestors. Unlike his previous (and later) ancestors, he has a simile of his own to match Blackadder's: "I just wish we weren't doing so well in the 'bit-short-of-pressies-and-feeling-a-gullible-prat' ledger." He remains the only person to be fooled by Tiny Tom Scratchit's alleged lameness, however. He is also possibly the only person ever to spell "[[Christmas]]" without getting ''any'' of the letters right (he apparently renders the word as "Kwelfnuve" then "corrects" it to "Kweznuz").

===''Blackadder Goes Forth''===
{{Main|Blackadder Goes Forth}}
[[Private (rank)|Private]] S. Baldrick (presumed dead 1917) is a private in a [[World War I|First World War]] trench, serving under [[Captain Blackadder]] and [[George (Blackadder)|Lieutenant George]]. His hero is [[Lord Flashheart]].

The fourth Baldrick comes from the lowest level of British Edwardian society. Before the war he was scraping a living at the "Turnip Street [[Workhouse]]". Upon the outbreak of hostilities the workhouse formed its own [[pals battalion]] which Baldrick signed up to join. In the final episode he says that all his friends have died, suggesting that he is the last surviving member of the Turnip Street Workhouse Pals.

Equal in foulness to the third Baldrick, Private Baldrick also matches his immediate predecessor in terms of stupidity. His "cunning plans", like those of his Elizabethan ancestor, have an insane, perverse logic to them. Examples include carving his name on a bullet, in relation to the old saying "a bullet with your name on it", his explanation being that if he owns the bullet, it won't ever kill him as he won't ever shoot himself ("shame", comments Captain Blackadder), and the chances of there being two bullets with "Baldrick" on them are "very small indeed". He has also been known to eat cigarettes as seen in the last episode of the series.

He also is the only Baldrick to confront Blackadder after [[Major Star (Blackadder)|being hit]]; he does so on one occasion, and is very conscious of class divisions. While this briefly attracts him to the ideals of [[October Revolution|Bolshevism]], he is just as willing to marry [[General Melchett]] if it allows him to escape his lower-class status. His family seem to worship Lord Flashheart, declaring that they all took up smoking to collect cigarette cards bearing his image and that his grandmother smoked herself to death so they could afford the album.

In the first episode, [[Captain Cook (Blackadder)|''Captain Cook'']], he claims to be the first Baldrick in the entire family tree to have a brilliant plan (becoming cooks for HQ to escape the trenches), giving a speech saying, "Permission to write home immediately sir! This is the first brilliant plan a Baldrick's ever had. For centuries we've tried, and they've always turned out total pig swill! My mum will be pleased as punch." This mood was however, slightly dampened when Blackadder pointed out the minor flaw: Baldrick is "the worst cook in the entire world". He also hates hospitals because his grandfather went into one and when he came out, he was dead. Blackadder then points out that he was also dead when he went in, because he'd been run over by a [[traction engine]].

Private Baldrick's hobbies include [[cookery]]; his specialities include gourmet recipes involving rats.

This Baldrick is also a poet, composing ''The German Guns''. During his time in the trenches, Baldrick also wrote a second poem.

S. Baldrick also does a [[Charlie Chaplin]] impression (although some believe it to be a [[slug]] balancing act, and General Melchett mistook it for a feeble impression of [[Buster Keaton]]).

Apart from during Blackadder's demonstration of slapstick comedy in the same episode, Baldrick generally does not get physically abused by Blackadder, although Blackadder frequently insults Baldrick and his family.

The opening sequence to each episode of series 4 features a ceremonial parade in which the company led by Captain Blackadder marches past General Melchett on a reviewing stand. Baldrick appears as part of the regimental band, splendid in scarlet and blue full dress, but not only walking out of line but also playing that most unmartial of instruments: a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]].

Despite his stupidity, Baldrick delivers a profound speech while in preparation for the "final push", tension is high, and Baldrick demands, "Why can't we just stop sir? Why can't we just say 'no more killing, let's all go home'? Why would it be stupid just to pack it in, sir? Why?" Neither Captain Blackadder nor [[George (Blackadder)|Lieutenant George]] are able to come up with a good answer beyond an attempted accusation of defeatism from George.

Private Baldrick never got to tell the audience his final "cunning plan" to escape the trenches, as he is sent "over the top" before he can reveal it to Blackadder, George and [[Kevin Darling|Captain Darling]], though it possibly involved a splinter on the ladder. However, Baldrick stated that Blackadder was correct in the final plan being "as cunning as a [[fox]] who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at [[Oxford University]]". Blackadder admits that "whatever it was, it was better than my idea of pretending to be mad. Who'd ever notice another mad man round here?" The episode's ending implies that Baldrick is killed in that attack.

===''Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth''===
{{Main|Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth}}
Baldrick is a [[septic tank]] cleaner to the 20th century Lord Blackadder in ''[[Blackadder: Back and Forth]]''. His first appearance is serving Blackadder's [[millennium]] dinner, which he does wearing nothing but an amusing apron, on a whim. His cooking is similar to Private Baldrick's; he prepared dinner by coughing over an avocado. His underpants may date from the 18th century, or in any case smell as though they do, and turn out to be the cause of the [[extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s. Rather surprisingly he builds a working [[time travel|time machine]], making him "the greatest genius who ever lived". Or it would do, if he knew ''how'' it worked and had not just built it using a combination of the plans of Leonardo da Vinci and an apparent skill at building [[Airfix]] models being able to make up for his inability to read the plans. Following his master's rewriting of history, he becomes [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] – and possibly [[dictator]], as the television commentator observes that [[election]]s have been abolished (although how much power he has with Edmund as king is questionable). His intelligence appears to be between that of the medieval Baldrick and the Elizabethan Baldrick. His "cunning plan" was possibly the only plan which a Blackadder ever thought was a good plan, albeit with a slight modification to it.

Also, [[List of fictional Romans|Legionary Baldricus]] is a [[Roman Army|soldier]] under [[List of fictional Romans|Centurion Blaccadicus]] in the [[Roman Britain]] section of ''[[Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth]]'' as part of the forces defending [[Hadrian's Wall]]. He is apparently [[bilingual]] (although it is possible he is a local conscript and does not really understand [[Latin]]). He wears his helmet back to front, and was presumably killed by the attacking "[[Picts|Scots]]".

==Other Baldricks==
* Bert Baldrick, dogsbody to [[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s butler, is mentioned by the third Baldrick as his cousin, who says that Bert says that "all portraits look the same because they're painted to a romantic ideal rather than the idiosyncratic facial features of the person in question." Bert Baldrick, Blackadder observes, must have a far larger vocabulary than Sodoff Baldrick.
* Baldrick, slave to Grand Admiral Blackadder of the Dark Segment in the future section of ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''. He doesn't actually get to do much except stand around in a posing pouch. In an alternate future in which he is the Grand Admiral, he manages to destroy his own forces.
* One of the eight [[Raven]]s at the [[Tower of London]] is named Baldrick, presumably in response to the [[Blackadder]] series.
* The [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] publication of the complete Blackadder scripts (''Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty 1485–1917'') contains "Baldrick's [[Family tree]]", which mainly comprises all the children of a Baldrick being called Baldrick. Occasionally there are some exceptions. Some of the other entries in Baldrick's family tree include the [[common cold]], [[dung beetles]], [[ticks]], [[Earls Court]] (change for Ealing), [[Ruislip]], [[Pot plant]], [[Paul Gascoigne]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and his children [[Ron Reagan|Ronnie]] and Thingie. A [[neolithic]] ancestor by the name of Bad Reek is mentioned as being present at the construction of [[Stonehenge]]. The [[Catherine Parr|sixth wife]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] is also claimed to be a Baldrick, on account of the king being "old, half-mad and suffering from [[syphilis]] at the time, [and so] was happy to get anything he could".
* Uncle Baldrick, who is never seen but who Baldrick says was an actor who played [[Macbeth]]'s second codpiece ("Macbeth wore him in the fight scenes"..."Ah, so he was a stunt codpiece".). When asked if his uncle had "a large part" he replied that it depended on which actor played Macbeth.
* Private S. Baldrick's father, who is never seen but who Baldrick says was a nun (when the judge asked him his profession, he said "None"). His mother is frequently mentioned, and Blackadder says that she is a resident of London Zoo, has a complexion which is worse than Punch, from Punch and Judy, the famous puppet show, and Baldrick is her only human child. His grandfather died from being run over by a [[traction engine]]. His grandmother "smoked herself to death" so that Baldrick's family could afford the album of Lord Flasheart's cigarette cards.
* Robin Baldrick, the medieval Baldrick's father. All that is known about him is that he is a dung gatherer. He is never seen and is only mentioned once, in the opening credits of ''[[The Black Seal]]'' when the narrator referred to Baldrick as "Baldrick, Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer".

==Dynasty==
* [[Legionary Baldricus]] – [[Roman Britain]]
* Robin Baldrick the Dung Gatherer - Middle Ages Baldrick's father
* Baldrick, Bachelor of the Parish of Chigwell – Middle Ages
* Baldrick – Elizabethan
* Baldrick – [[English Civil War]]
* Sodoff, Lord Baldrick – Regency

'''William Franklin Graham Jr.''' (November 7, 1918&amp;nbsp;– February 21, 2018) &lt;!-- DO NOT ADD Billy Graham into here, William Franklin Graham Jr is his birth name --&gt; was an American [[Evangelism|evangelist]], a prominent [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] figure, &lt;!-- This is not an error. Evangelicalism is a movement within Protestant Christianity. An evangelist is a role, such as pastor, priest or janitor. --&gt; and an ordained [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] minister who became well-known internationally in the late 1940s. One of his biographers has placed him "among the most influential Christian leaders" of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Billy Graham stands among the most influential Christian leaders of the twentieth century.|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/billy-graham-9780190683528?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|title=Billy Graham: American Pilgrim|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[preacher]], he held large indoor and outdoor rallies with sermons broadcast on radio and television; some were still being re-broadcast into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swank jr |first=J.

He also hosted the radio show ''[[Hour of Decision]]'' from 1950 to 1954.

According to his website, Graham preached to live audiences of 210 million people in more than 185 countries and territories through various meetings, including [[BMS World Mission]] and [[Global Mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billygraham.org/mediaRelations/bios.asp?p=1 |title=Media: Bios - William (Billy) F.

Graham was a spiritual adviser to U.S. presidents and provided spiritual counsel for every president from the 33rd, [[Harry S. Truman]], to the 44th, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://billygraham.org/story/billy-graham-pastor-to-presidents-2/|title=Billy Graham: Pastor to Presidents|work=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly close to [[Dwight D.

==Early life==
William Franklin Graham Jr. was born on November 7, 1918, in the downstairs bedroom of a farmhouse near [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Bruns2004pp5-14&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruns |first=Roger |chapter=A Farm Boy Becomes a Preacher |pages=5–14 |chapterurl={{Google books|HQvtTF1HSL8C|page=5|plainurl=yes}} |title=Billy Graham: A Biography |publisher=Greenwood Press |series=Greenwood biographies |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-313-32718-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of Scots-Irish descent and was the eldest of four children born to Morrow (née Coffey) and William Franklin Graham Sr., a dairy farmer.&lt;ref name=Bruns2004pp5-14 /&gt; Graham was raised on a family dairy farm with his two younger sisters, Catherine Morrow and Jean and a younger brother, Melvin Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Graham's Mother Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/obituaries/billy-graham-s-mother-dies.html|publisher=The New York Times Archives|date=August 16, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was eight years old in 1927, the family moved about {{convert|75|yd}} from their white frame house to a newly built red brick home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billygrahamlibrary.org/video-graham-family-homeplace/ |title=Billy Graham's Childhood Home |publisher=Billygrahamlibrary.org |access-date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his parents in the [[Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;James E.

Like Tarzan, he would hang on the trees and gave the popular [[Tarzan yell]], scaring both horses and drivers. According to his father, that yelling had led him to become a minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billygraham.org/story/billy-graham-trivia-what-did-billy-graham-read-as-a-child/-'Billy-Graham-Trivia-What-Did-Billy-Graham-Read-as-a-Child |title=Billy Graham Trivia What Did Billy Graham Read as a Child| publisher=billygraham.org| date=August 10, 2015|access-date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was fourteen in 1933, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] ended in December, and Graham's father forced him and his sister, Katherine, to drink beer until they got sick. This created such an aversion that Graham and his sister avoided alcohol and drugs for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="time1993"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nancy |last1=Gibbs |first2=Richard N. |last2=Ostling |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979573,00.html |title=God's Billy Pulpit |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 15, 1993 |access-date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham had been turned down for membership in a local youth group for being "too worldly"&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; when Albert McMakin, who worked on the Graham farm, persuaded him to go and see the evangelist [[Mordecai Ham]].&lt;ref name="cincinnati post" /&gt; According to his autobiography, Graham was converted in 1934, at age 16 during a series of revival meetings in Charlotte led by Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/faq/13.htm |title=Who led Billy Graham to Christ... |publisher=Archives, Billy Graham Center, Wheaton College |access-date=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110513224056/http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/faq/13.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with Reverend Billy Graham|url=http://cmstory.org/billygraham|website=The Charlotte Mecklenburg Story|publisher=Charlotte Mecklenburg Library|access-date=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021132143/http://www.cmstory.org/billygraham|archive-date=October 21, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham attended [[Bob Jones University|Bob Jones College]], then located in [[Cleveland, Tennessee]]. After one semester, he found it too legalistic in both coursework and rules.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; At this time he was influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but [[Bob Jones Sr.]] warned him not to throw his life away: "At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks ... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily."&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt;

In 1937 Graham transferred to the [[Trinity College (Florida)|Florida Bible Institute]] in [[Temple Terrace, Florida]], near [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].&lt;ref&gt;The Institute is now [[Trinity College (Florida)|Trinity College of Florida]] in [[New Port Richey, Florida]]&lt;/ref&gt; He preached his first sermon that year at Bostwick Baptist Church near [[Palatka, Florida]], while still a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkland|first1=Gary|title=Graham's first-ever sermon?

Reverend Billy Graham Memorial Park was later established on the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]], directly east of the 18th green and across from where Graham often paddled a canoe to a small island in the river, where he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1939, Graham was ordained by a group of Southern Baptist clergymen at Peniel Baptist Church in [[Palatka, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://billygraham.org/about/biographies/billy-graham/ |title=Profile: William (Billy) F.

During his time at Wheaton, Graham decided to accept the Bible as the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] word of God. [[Henrietta Mears]] of the [[First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood]] (Hollywood, California) was instrumental in helping Graham wrestle with the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian Camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the [[Big Bear Lake, California|Big Bear Lake area]] in [[southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billy Graham's California Dream |url=http://www.californiality.com/2011/12/billy-grahams-california.html |work=californiality.com |access-date=August 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial there marks the site of Graham's decision.

==Family==
On August 13, 1943, Graham married Wheaton classmate [[Ruth Graham|Ruth Bell]], whose parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, [[L. Nelson Bell]], was a general surgeon.&lt;ref name="satevepost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4151300.html |title=Billy Graham: the world is his pulpit |work=Saturday Evening Post |author=Stoddard, Maynard Good |date=March 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Graham died on June 14, 2007, at the age of 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ruthbellgrahammemorial.org/obituary/|title=Obituary - RUTH BELL GRAHAM|website=ruthbellgrahammemorial.org|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grahams were married for almost 64 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2018/02/21/billy-graham-billy-and-ruth/359224002/|title=Billy Graham: Billy and Ruth|work=Citizen Times|access-date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham and his wife had five children together: Virginia Leftwich (Gigi) Graham (b. 1945), an inspirational speaker and author; [[Anne Graham Lotz]] (b. 1948), runs AnGeL ministries; Ruth Graham (b. 1950), founder and president of Ruth Graham &amp; Friends, leads conferences throughout the US and Canada; [[Franklin Graham]] (b. 1952), serves as president and CEO of the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] and as president and CEO of international relief organization, [[Samaritan's Purse]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samaritanspurse.org/ |title=Samaritan's Purse |publisher=Samaritanspurse.org |access-date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nelson Edman Graham (b. 1958), a pastor who runs East Gates Ministries International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228052237/http://www.eastgates.org/awordfrombg.html |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |url=http://www.eastgates.org/awordfrombg.html |title=East Gates International |publisher=Eastgates.org |access-date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which distributes Christian literature in China.

At the time of his death, Graham had 19 grandchildren, including former pastor [[Tullian Tchividjian]], 41 great-grandchildren and 6 great-great-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World-Renowned TV Evangelist The Rev.

==Ministry career==

While attending college, Graham became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.

From 1943 to 1944, Graham briefly served as pastor of the First Baptist Church in [[Western Springs, Illinois]], which was not far from Wheaton. While there, his friend Torrey Johnson, pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in Chicago, told Graham that his radio program, ''Songs in the Night'', was about to be canceled due to lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson's program with financial support from his congregation. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called ''Songs in the Night'', Graham recruited the [[bass-baritone]] [[George Beverly Shea]] as his director of radio ministry. While the radio ministry continued for many years, Graham decided to move on in early 1945.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1948 at the age of 29, he became president of [[University of Northwestern – St. Paul|Northwestern Bible College]] in [[Minneapolis]] and the youngest president of a college or university in the country, from which he resigned in 1952.&lt;ref name="ABC 2018 Youngest president"&gt;[http://kstp.com/national/christian-evangelist-rev-billy-graham-dies-age-99/4797356/ AP and Hauser, Tom.

Retrieved March 2, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham initially intended to become a [[chaplain]] in the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], but he contracted [[mumps]] shortly after applying for a commission. After a period of recuperation in [[Florida]], he was hired as the first full-time [[evangelism|evangelist]] of the new [[Youth for Christ]] (YFC), co-founded by Torrey Johnson and the Canadian evangelist [[Charles Templeton]]. Graham traveled throughout both the United States and Europe as a YFCI evangelist. Templeton applied to [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] for an advanced theological degree and urged Graham to do so as well, but he declined as he was already serving as the president of Northwestern Bible College.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NvTR05fodqYC ''Farewell to God: My Reasons for Rejecting the Christian Faith''].{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham scheduled a series of [[revival meeting]]s in [[Los Angeles Crusade (1949)|Los Angeles]] in 1949, for which he erected circus tents in a parking lot.&lt;ref name="cincinnati post" /&gt; He attracted national media coverage, especially in the conservative [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst chain]], although Hearst and Graham never met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jcs/39.2.273 |jstor=23919865 |title=When Worlds Collide: Politics, Religion, and Media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=273–95 |year=1997 |last1=King |first1=Randall E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crusade event ran for eight weeks&amp;nbsp;– five weeks longer than planned.

===Crusades===
{{main|List of Billy Graham's crusades}}
[[File:Billy Graham - L0055 860Fo30141612210142 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Graham speaking at a Crusade in [[Oslo]], Norway, 1955]]
From the time his ministry began in 1947, Graham conducted more than 400 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham Crusade, held September 13–21, 1947, in the [[Welsh Auditorium|Civic Auditorium]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], was attended by 6,000 people. Graham was 28 years old. He called them crusades, after the medieval Christian forces who conquered Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward (a practice begun by [[Dwight L. Moody]]). Such people were called inquirers and were given the chance to speak one-on-one with a counselor, to clarify questions and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; During his crusades, he frequently used the [[altar call]] song, "[[Just As I Am (hymn)#Altar Song in the Billy Graham crusades|Just As I Am]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Usborne |date=June 24, 2005 |title=Billy Graham and the Last Crusade |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/billy-graham-and-the-last-crusade-294716.html |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was offered a five-year, $1&amp;nbsp;million contract from [[NBC]] to appear on television opposite [[Arthur Godfrey]], but he had prearranged commitments. He turned down the offer in order to continue his touring revivals.&lt;ref name="satevepost" /&gt; Graham had crusades in [[London]], which lasted 12 weeks, and a [[New York City]] crusade in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1957, which ran nightly for 16 weeks.

====Student ministry====
Graham spoke at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's [[Urbana (conference)|Urbana Student Missions Conference]] at least nine times&amp;nbsp;— in 1948, 1957, 1961, 1964, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1984, and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intervarsity.org/news/billy-graham-intervarsity--new-york-city-1788 |title=Billy Graham, InterVarsity &amp; New York City |publisher=intervarsity.org |date=June 21, 2005 |access-date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each Urbana conference, he challenged the thousands of attendees to make a commitment to follow Jesus Christ for the rest of their lives. He often quoted a six-word phrase that was reportedly written in the Bible of [[William Whiting Borden]], the son of a wealthy silver magnate: "No reserves, no retreat, no regrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/regret.htm |title=William Borden: No Reserves. No Retreats. No Regrets |publisher=Home.snu.edu |access-date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borden had died in Egypt on his way to the mission field.

Graham also held evangelistic meetings on a number of college campuses: at the University of Minnesota during InterVarsity's "Year of Evangelism" in 1950–51, a 4-day mission at Yale University in 1957, and a week-long series of meetings at the University of North Carolina's Carmichael Auditorium in September 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the USA&amp;nbsp;– 1940–1990'' by Keith Hunt and Gladys Hunt, InterVarsity Press, 1991.{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 he was invited by students to lead the mission to Cambridge University, arranged by the [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]], with the London pastor-theologian [[John Stott]] as his chief assistant. This invitation was greeted with much disapproval in the correspondence columns of ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |title=Oliver Barclay |url=https://share.trin.cam.ac.uk/sites/public/Alumni/obituaries/Oliver_Barclay.pdf |newspaper=The Times |location=London |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |date=October 4, 2013 |access-date=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evangelistic association====
In 1950, Graham founded the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] (BGEA) with its headquarters in [[Minneapolis]]. The association relocated to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], in 1999. BGEA ministries have included:
* ''[[Hour of Decision]]'', a weekly radio program broadcast around the world for more than 50 years
* Mission television specials broadcast in almost every market in the US and Canada
* A syndicated newspaper column, ''My Answer'', carried by [[newspaper]]s across the United States and distributed by [[Tribune Content Agency]]&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;{{cite web |title=My Answer from the writings of the Rev. Billy Graham {{!}} Tribune Content Agency |url=https://tribunecontentagency.com/premium-content/advice/my-answer/ |website=Tribune Content Agency |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Decision'' magazine, the official publication of the association
* ''[[Christianity Today]]'' was started in 1956 with [[Carl F. H. Henry]] as its first editor
* Passageway.org, the website for a youth discipleship program created by BGEA
* [[World Wide Pictures]], which has produced and distributed more than 130 films

In April 2013, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started "My Hope With Billy Graham", the largest outreach in its history, encouraging church members to spread the gospel in small group meetings after showing a video message by Graham. "The idea is for Christians to follow the example of the disciple [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] in the New Testament and spread the gospel in their own homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2013/04/new_billy_graham_outreach_host.html |title=New Billy Graham outreach: Hosting 'Matthew parties' to share the gospel |publisher=al.com |access-date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video, called "The Cross", is the main program in the My Hope America series and was also broadcast the week of Graham's 95th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Evangelist Billy Graham to mark 95th birthday with message to America | last=Jenkins | first=Colleen | work=[[Reuters]] | date=October 31, 2013 | access-date=November 6, 2018 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-people-graham/evangelist-billy-graham-to-mark-95th-birthday-with-message-to-america-idUSBRE99U14020131031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil rights movement====

Graham's early crusades were [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]], but he began adjusting his approach in the 50s.{{sfn|Schier|2013|pages=404–5}} During a 1953 rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Graham tore down the ropes that organizers had erected in order to segregate the audience into racial sections. In his memoirs, he recounted that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down "or you can go on and have the revival without me."{{sfn|Miller|2009|pp=13–38}} He warned a white audience, "we have been proud and thought we were better than any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride."{{sfn|Miller|2009|pp=13–38}}

In 1957, Graham's stance towards integration became more publicly shown when he allowed black ministers Thomas Kilgore and [[Gardner C. Taylor]] to serve as members of his New York Crusade's executive committee&lt;ref name=grahammlik/&gt; and invited the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], whom he first met during the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] in 1955,&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; to join him in the pulpit at his 16-week revival in New York City, where 2.3&amp;nbsp;million gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and [[Times Square]] to hear them.&lt;ref name="cincinnati post" /&gt; Graham recalled in his autobiography that during this time, he and King developed a close friendship and that he was eventually one of the few people who referred to King as "Mike", a nickname which King asked only his closest friends to call him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billygraham.org/articlepage.asp?articleid=8423 Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: Gun Fire 45 Years Ago Kills Man that Billy Graham Considered a Friend] Billy Graham.com, April 4, 2013. Retrieved October 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Following King's assassination in 1968, Graham mourned that the US had lost "a social leader and a prophet".&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; In private, Graham advised King and other members of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).&lt;ref name=upppava /&gt;

Despite their friendship, tensions between Graham and King emerged in 1958 when the sponsoring committee of a crusade which took place in [[San Antonio]], Texas on July 25 arranged for Graham to be introduced by that state's segregationist governor, [[Price Daniel]].&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; On July 23, King sent a letter to Graham and informed him that allowing Daniel to speak at a crusade which occurred the night before the state's Democratic Primary "can well be interpreted as your endorsement of racial segregation and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/23-July-1958_ToGraham.pdf |title=To Billy Graham |format=PDF |access-date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham's advisor, Grady Wilson, replied to King that "even though we do not see eye to eye with him on every issue, we still love him in Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/28-July-1958_FromWilson.pdf |title=From Grady Wilson |format=PDF |access-date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Graham's appearance with Daniel dashed King's hopes of holding joint crusades with Graham in the Deep South,&lt;ref name=upppava /&gt; the two still remained friends and King told a Canadian television audience the following year that Graham had taken a "very strong stance against segregation."&lt;ref name=upppava&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBKaYVni9Z8C&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South |page=92 |first=Steven P. |last=Miller |year=2009 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-4151-8 |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham and King would also come to differ on the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; After King's "[[Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence|Beyond Vietnam]]" speech denouncing US intervention in Vietnam, Graham castigated him and others for their criticism of US foreign policy.&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt;

By the middle of 1960, King and Graham traveled together to the Tenth Baptist World Congress of the [[Baptist World Alliance]].&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; In 1963, Graham posted bail for King to be released from jail during the [[Birmingham campaign]], according to Long (2008),{{sfn|Long|2008|pp=150-151}} and the King Center acknowledged that Graham had bailed King out of jail during the [[Albany Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/theme/2179|title=The Archive - The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change|website=www.thekingcenter.org|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although historian Steven Miller told CNN he could not find any proof of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CNN |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/us/billy-graham-mlk-civil-rights/index.html |title=Where Billy Graham 'missed the mark' |date=February 22, 2018 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |first=John |last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham held integrated crusades in Birmingham, Alabama, on Easter 1964 in the aftermath of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church]], and toured Alabama again in the wake of the violence that accompanied the first [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery march]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt;

Following his death, former SCLC official and future Atlanta politician [[Andrew Young]] acknowledged his friendship with Graham and stated that Graham did in fact travel with King to the 1965 European Baptist Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11alive.com/video/news/billy-graham-passes-away-andrew-young-remembers-the-reverend/85-8015124|title=Billy Graham passes away: Andrew Young remembers the reverend|publisher=|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young also claimed that Graham had often invited King to his crusades in the Northern states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/rev-billy-graham-remembered-as-a-friend-to-the-civil-rights-movement|title=Civil rights leader reflects on Billy Graham's impact on Atlanta, movement|first=|last=FOX|publisher=|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham's faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation; he told a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] that integration was necessary primarily for religious reasons: "There is no scriptural basis for segregation," Graham argued. "The ground at the foot of the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross."&lt;ref name="baptisthistory"&gt;{{cite news |title=Billy Graham: an appreciation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87912863.html |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage |date=June 22, 2006 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lausanne Movement====
The friendship between Graham and John Stott led to a further partnership in the [[Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization|Lausanne Movement]], of which Graham was a founder. It built on Graham's 1966 World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin.{{clarify|date=December 2013}} In collaboration with ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Graham convened what ''TIME'' magazine described as "a formidable forum, possibly the widest–ranging meeting of Christians ever held"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |title=Religion: A Challenge from Evangelicals |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879423,00.html |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 5, 1974 |access-date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2,700 participants from 150 nations gathering for the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|International Congress on World Evangelization]]. This took place in Lausanne, Switzerland (July 16–25, 1974), and the movement which ensued took its name from the host city. Its purpose was to strengthen the global church for world evangelization, and to engage ideological and sociological trends which bore on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Graham, Billy |date=July 16, 1974 |title=Why Lausanne? |medium=Audio recording |location=Lausanne, Switzerland |publisher=Billy Graham Center Archives |url=http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/docs/Lausanne/704/graham.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham invited Stott to be chief architect of the [[Lausanne Covenant]], which issued from the Congress and which, according to Graham, "helped challenge and unite evangelical Christians in the great task of world evangelization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stott |first=John |year=1997 |title=Making Christ known: historic mission documents from the Lausanne Movement, 1974–1989 |chapter=Foreword by Billy Graham |location=US |publisher=Wm.

==Multiple roles==
[[File:Billy Graham.JPG|thumb|Graham with his son, Franklin, at [[Cleveland Stadium]], June 1994]]
Graham played multiple roles that reinforced each other. Grant Wacker identifies eight major roles he played: preacher, icon, Southerner, entrepreneur, architect (or bridge builder), pilgrim, pastor and finally his widely recognized status as America's Protestant patriarch, on a par with Martin Luther King and Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;Grant Wacker. ''America's Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation'' Look for the purposes 2014) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham as bridge builder deliberately reached into the secular world. For example, as entrepreneur he built his own pavilion for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=IN70&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/5th_dimension/chapters/credits.htm |title="Man in the 5th Dimension," In 70&amp;nbsp;mm News / The 70&amp;nbsp;mm Newsletter |publisher=In70mm.com |date=March 6, 2005 |access-date=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525223201/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/5th_dimension/chapters/credits.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a guest on a 1969 [[Woody Allen]] television special, where he joined the comedian in a witty exchange on theological matters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xS9f-DI5ag4C&amp;pg=PA52 |title=Love, Sex, Death &amp; The Meaning of Life: The Films of Woody Allen |first=Foster |last=Hirsch |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=52 |year=2001 |isbn=0-306-81017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Cold War]], Graham-the-bridge-builder became the first evangelist of note to speak behind the [[Iron Curtain]], addressing large crowds in countries throughout Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, calling for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Michael and Gibbs, Nancy. [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1627139,00.html "Billy Graham: A Spiritual Gift to All"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', May 31, 2007. Retrieved 2007-24-11.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] era, Graham consistently refused to visit [[South Africa]] until its government allowed integrated seating for audiences. During his first crusade there in 1973, he openly denounced [[apartheid]].{{sfn|Aikman|2007|pages=109–10}} Graham also corresponded with imprisoned South African leader [[Nelson Mandela]] during the latter's 27-year imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crossmap.christianpost.com/news/billy-graham-nelson-mandela-united-by-apartheid-opposition-7290] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211081713/http://crossmap.christianpost.com/news/billy-graham-nelson-mandela-united-by-apartheid-opposition-7290|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Billy Graham in het Feyenoord stadion.ogg|thumb|Billy Graham at the Feyenoord-stadion in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (June 30, 1955)]]
In 1984, he led a series of meetings in the United Kingdom summer, called Mission England, using outdoor [[Association football|football]] (soccer) grounds as venues.

Graham was interested in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre|RAI Convention Center]] in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands. At one revival in [[Seoul]], South Korea, Graham attracted more than one million people to a single service.&lt;ref name="satevepost" /&gt; He appeared in [[China]] in 1988&amp;nbsp;– for Ruth, this was a homecoming, since she had been born in China to missionary parents. He appeared in [[North Korea]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="baptisthistory" /&gt;

On October 15, 1989, Graham received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Graham was the only minister, functioning in that capacity, to receive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-16/local/me-93_1_evangelist-billy-graham |title=Billy Graham Now a Hollywood Star |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 16, 1989 |access-date=November 25, 2012 |first=Sheryl |last=Stolberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 1991, Graham held his largest event in North America on [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, Central Park|the Great Lawn]] of New York's [[Central Park]]. City officials estimated more than 250,000 in attendance. In 1998, Graham spoke at [[TED (conference)]] to a crowd of scientists and philosophers.

On September 14, 2001, only three days after the [[September 11 attacks|World Trade Center attacks]], Graham was invited to lead a service at [[Washington National Cathedral]], which was attended by President [[George W. Bush]] and past and present leaders. He also spoke at the memorial service following the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="baptisthistory" /&gt; On June 24–26, 2005, Billy Graham began what he has said would be his last North American crusade, three days at the [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park]] in New York City. But on the weekend of March 11–12, 2006, Billy Graham held the "Festival of Hope" with his son, [[Franklin Graham]]. The [[festival]] was held in [[New Orleans]], which was recovering from [[Hurricane Katrina]].

Graham prepared one last sermon, ''My Hope America'', released on DVD and played around America and possibly worldwide between November 7–10, 2013, November 7 being his 95th birthday, hoping to cause a revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myhopewithbillygraham.org/what-is-my-hope/? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822005233/http://myhopewithbillygraham.org/what-is-my-hope/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 22, 2012 |title=My Hope With Billy Graham Mission Statement |publisher=My Hope America Website |access-date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life, death, and memorial==
[[File:Billy Graham's memorial service.jpg|thumb|right| President [[Donald Trump]] and First Lady [[Melania Trump]] honor the late Reverend Billy Graham on February 28, 2018.]]
Graham said that his planned [[retirement]] was because of his failing health; he had suffered from [[hydrocephalus]] from 1992 on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/state_region/billy-graham-has-brain-shunt-adjusted/article_b1919452-0c66-560d-8e15-a283bfe48a7a.html|title=Billy Graham has brain shunt adjusted|last=Staff|first=JournalNow|work=Winston-Salem Journal|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, Graham appeared at the groundbreaking for his library in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Then 86, he used a walker during the ceremony. On July 9, 2006, he spoke at the [[Metro Maryland Youth For Christ|Metro Maryland Franklin Graham Festival]], held in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]].

In April 2010, Graham, at 91 and with substantial vision, hearing and balance loss, made a rare public appearance at the re-dedication of the renovated [[Billy Graham Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Funk, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/21/92603/lion-in-winter-billy-graham-hearing.html "Lion in Winter: Billy Graham, Hearing and Sight Failing, Pays a Visit"], ''Charlotte Observer'', April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been controversy over Graham's proposed burial place; he announced in June 2007 that he and his wife would be buried alongside each other at the Billy Graham Library in his hometown of Charlotte. Graham's younger son Ned had argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. Ruth Graham had said that she wanted to be buried not in Charlotte but in the mountains at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove near [[Asheville, North Carolina]], where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother's choice.&lt;ref name="washpostburial"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Family at Cross-Purposes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121201338.html |work=The Washington Post |date=December 13, 2006 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hearld"&gt;{{cite news |title=Graham's wife in coma, close to death; both will be buried at library. |url=http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article12181541.html |work=The Herald |date=June 14, 2007 |access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Patricia Cornwell]], a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction.

==Politics==
After his close relationships with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], Graham tried to avoid explicit partisanship. Bailey says:
:He declined to sign or endorse political statements, and he distanced himself from the Christian right&amp;nbsp;... His early years of fierce opposition to communism gave way to pleas for military disarmament and attention to AIDS, poverty and environmental threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah Pulliam |last=Bailey |title=How Donald Trump is bringing Billy Graham's complicated family back into White House circles |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/01/12/how-donald-trump-is-bringing-billy-grahams-complicated-family-back-into-white-house-circles/ |work=Washington Post |date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="nbcinterv2005"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rev.

Graham worked "behind the scenes" to encourage influential Protestant ministers to speak out against him.&lt;ref name="GIA" /&gt; Graham met with a conference of Protestant ministers in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], during the 1960 campaign, to discuss their mobilizing congregations to defeat Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/transcripts/hour-five.html |title=God in America: 'The Soul of a Nation' |publisher=PBS |quote=Billy Graham convenes a meeting of American Protestant ministers in Montreux, Switzerland, for the purpose of discussing how they could ensure that John Kennedy would not be elected in November |date=October 11, 2010 |access-date=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' program, ''God in America'' (2010), Episode 5, Graham also organized a meeting in September 1960 of hundreds of Protestant ministers in Washington, D.C. to this purpose; [[Norman Vincent Peale]] led the meeting.&lt;ref name="GIA"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/study-guide/five.html Study Guide: ''God in America'', Episode 5, "The Soul of America"] PBS Frontline, October 2010, program available online&lt;/ref&gt; This was shortly before Kennedy's speech on the separation of church and state in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], which was considered to be successful in meeting concerns of many voters.

Graham leaned toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] during the presidency of Richard Nixon, whom he had met and befriended as Vice President under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="worldscollide"&gt;{{cite journal |title=When worlds collide: politics, religion, and media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19592304.html |first=Randall E. |last=King |journal=Journal of Church and State |date=March 22, 1997 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not completely ally himself with the later [[Christian right|religious right]], saying that Jesus did not have a political party.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; He gave his support to various political candidates over the years.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;

In 2007, Graham explained his refusal to join [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Moral Majority]] in 1979, saying: "I'm for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the [[Panama Canal]] or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Merritt |date=February 21, 2018 |title=Billy Graham, the Last Nonpartisan Evangelical? |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/billy-graham-nonpartisan-evangelical.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview, "For Graham, politics is a secondary to the Gospel&amp;nbsp;... When ''Newsweek'' asked Graham whether ministers&amp;nbsp;– whether they think of themselves as evangelists, pastors or a bit of both&amp;nbsp;– should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some&amp;nbsp;– like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'"&lt;ref name="newsweek2006p4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pilgrim's Progress| page= 4 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/46365/page/4 |work=Newsweek |date=August 14, 2006 |access-date=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Graham publicly endorsed the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate, [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name="wapo101112"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/11/billy-graham-to-mitt-romney-ill-do-all-i-can-to-help-you/?wprss=rss_election-2012 |title=Billy Graham to Mitt Romney: 'I'll do all I can to help you' |work=The Washington Post |date=October 11, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2012 |author=O'Keefe, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, apparently in order to accommodate Romney, who is a [[Mormonism|Mormon]], references to Mormonism as a religious cult ("A cult is any group which teaches doctrines or beliefs that deviate from the biblical message of the Christian faith.") were removed from Graham's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/billy-grahams-group-removes-mormon-cult-reference-from-website-after-romney-meeting/comment-page-14/ |title=Billy Graham site removes Mormon 'cult' reference after Romney meeting |publisher=CNN |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/billy-graham-website-mormon-cult-removed_n_1971669.html |title=Billy Graham Website Removes Mormon 'Cult' Reference After Romney Meeting |work=HuffPost |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers have questioned whether the support of Republican and religious right politics on issues such as [[same-sex marriage]] coming from Graham&amp;nbsp;– who stopped speaking in public or to reporters&amp;nbsp;– in fact reflects the views of his son, [[Franklin Graham|Franklin]], head of the BGEA.

===Pastor to presidents===
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] greet Graham at the [[National Prayer Breakfast]] of 1981]]
Graham had a personal audience with many sitting [[president of the United States|US presidents]], from [[Harry S. Truman]] to [[Barack Obama]]&amp;nbsp;– 12 consecutive presidents. After meeting with Truman in 1950, Graham told the press he had urged the president to counter [[communism]] in [[North Korea]]. Truman disliked him and did not speak with him for years after that meeting.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; Later he always treated his conversations with presidents as confidential.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;

Truman was not fond of Graham. He wrote about Graham in his 1974 autobiography ''Plain Speaking'', "But now we've got just this one evangelist, this Billy Graham, and he's gone off the beam. He's...well, I hadn't ought to say this, but he's one of those counterfeits I was telling you about. He claims he's a friend of all the Presidents, but he was never a friend of mine when I was President. I just don't go for people like that. All he's interested in is getting his name in the paper."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Merle (1974) Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman. New York: Putnam. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Billy Graham (1966) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|Graham in 1966]]
Graham became a regular visitor during the tenure of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He purportedly urged him to intervene with federal troops in the case of the [[Little Rock Nine]] to gain admission of black students to public schools.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] convinced Congress to allow Graham to conduct the first [[Worship|religious service]] on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles Atlas with a Halo |url=https://www.religion-online.org/article/charles-atlas-with-a-halo-americas-billy-graham/ |author=Wacker, Grant |date=April 1, 1992 |pages=336–41 |work=The Christian Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower asked for Graham while on his [[death]]bed.&lt;ref name="washpost1991"&gt;{{cite news |title=The President Preacher; In Crisis, White House Turns to Billy Graham |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1044879.html |work=The Washington Post |date=January 18, 1991 |access-date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham met and would become a close friend of Vice President Richard Nixon,&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;{{sfn|Aikman|2010|pp=204–205}} and supported Nixon, a [[Quakers|Quaker]], for the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; He convened an August strategy session of evangelical leaders in Montreaux, Switzerland, to plan how best to oppose Nixon's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] opponent, Senator [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Larry Ingle, ''Nixon's First Cover-up: The Religious Life of a Quaker President''. pp. 101–04, University of Missouri Press, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0-8262-2042-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a registered Democrat, Graham also maintained firm support of aggression against the foreign threat of Communism and strongly sympathized with Nixon's views regarding American foreign policy.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp203-210 /&gt; Thus, he was more sympathetic to Republican administrations.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martinbiopost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Essence of Billy Graham; A Warm but Honest Biography of the Evangelist |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1091805.html |work=The Washington Post |date=October 25, 1991 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 1963, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was impressed by the way Graham had praised the work of his great-grandfather Rev. [[George Washington Baines]], invited Graham to the White House to give him spiritual counseling. After this visit, Johnson frequently would call on Graham for more spiritual counselling as well as companionship. As Graham recalled to his biographer Frady, "I almost used the White House as a hotel when Johnson was President. He was always trying to keep me there. He just never wanted me to leave."&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Aikman |authorlink1=David Aikman |chapter=Lyndon B. Johnson |chapterurl={{Google books|IbufdthAJx4C|page=195|plainurl=yes}} |pages=195–203 |year=2010 |title=Billy Graham: His Life and Influence |isbn=978-1-4185-8432-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In striking contrast with his more limited access with Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy, Graham would not only visit the White House private quarters but would also at times kneel at Johnson's bedside and then pray with him whenever the President requested him to do so. Graham once recalled "I have never had many people do that."&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203 /&gt; In addition to his White House visits, Graham would visit Johnson at [[Camp David]] and occasionally met with the President when he retreated to his private ranch in [[Stonewall, Texas]]. Johnson would also become the first sitting President to attend one of Graham's crusades, which took place in Houston, Texas, in 1965.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203 /&gt;

During the 1964 United States presidential election, supporters of Republican nominee [[Barry Goldwater]] sent an estimated 2 million telegrams to Graham's hometown of [[Montreat, North Carolina]], and sought the preacher's endorsement. Supportive of Johnson's domestic policies, and hoping to preserve his friendship with the President, Graham resisted pressure to endorse Goldwater and stayed neutral in the election. Following Johnson's election victory, Graham's role as the main White House pastor was solidified. At one point, Johnson even considered making Graham a member of his cabinet and grooming him to be his successor, though Graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203 /&gt; Graham's biographer David Aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to Johnson than any other President he had ever known.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp203-210 /&gt;

He spent the last night of Johnson's presidency in the White House, and he stayed for the first night of Nixon's.&lt;ref name="washpost1991" /&gt; After Nixon's victorious [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential campaign]], Graham became an adviser, regularly visiting the White House and leading the president's private worship services.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt; In a meeting they had with [[Golda Meir]], Nixon offered Graham the ambassadorship to [[Israel]], but he refused.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt;

[[File:Barack Obama and Billy Graham.jpg|thumb|Billy Graham meeting with President [[Barack Obama]] in [[Montreat, North Carolina|Montreat]], April 2010]]

In 1970, Nixon appeared at a Graham revival in [[East Tennessee]], which they thought safe politically. It drew one of the largest crowds in Tennessee and protesters against the [[Vietnam War]]. Nixon was the first president to give a speech from an evangelist's platform.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt; Their friendship became strained in 1973 when Graham rebuked Nixon for his post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] behavior and the profanity heard on the [[Nixon White House tapes|Watergate tapes]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} They eventually reconciled after Nixon's resignation.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;

Graham officiated at one presidential burial and one presidential funeral. He presided over the graveside services of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973 and took part in eulogizing the former president. Graham officiated at the funeral services of former First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; and the [[death and state funeral of Richard Nixon]] in 1994.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Graham asserted that he believed President Bill Clinton to be "a spiritual person."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He was unable to attend the state funeral of [[Ronald Reagan]] on June 11, 2004, as he was recovering from hip replacement surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christianity.about.com/od/glossary/p/billygraham.htm |title=Biography of Evangelist Billy Graham |publisher=Christianity.about.com |access-date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was mentioned by [[George W. Bush]] in his eulogy.

On April 25, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] visited Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, where they "had a private prayer."&lt;ref name="nytimes2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama Visits the Rev.

===Relationship with Queen Elizabeth II===
Graham had a friendly relationship with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and was frequently invited by the Royal Family to special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://billygraham.org/story/billy-graham-and-the-queen/|title=Billy Graham Reflects on His Friendship with Queen Elizabeth II|work=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/royals/queen-elizabeth-real-life-friendship-evangelist-billy-graham/|title=The Crown: The Truth Behind Queen Elizabeth's Real-Life Friendship with Evangelist Billy Graham|work=People|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first met in 1955 and Graham preached at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Windsor Chapel]] at the Queen's invitation during the following year. Their friendly relationship may have been because they shared a traditional approach to the practical aspects of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/billy-graham-dead-queen-elizabeth-ii-friendship-us-evangelical-preacher-the-crown-visit-a8221816.html|title=Billy Graham dead: Truth behind Queen Elizabeth II's friendship with the US evangelical preacher|work=The Independent|access-date=January 25, 2018|first=Clarisse |last=Loughrey |date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy views===
Graham was outspoken against [[communism]] and supported the American [[Cold War]] policy, including the [[Vietnam War]]. In a 1999 speech, Graham discussed his relationship with the late [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Il-sung]], praising him as a "different kind of communist" and "one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]." Graham went on to note that although he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|leader]] [[Kim Jong-il]], he had "exchanged gifts with him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2553945.ece Preacher power: America's God squad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817195823/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2553945.ece |date=August 17, 2007}} Independent Article, ''Preacher power: America's God squad'', July 25, 2007;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Graham preached in the [[Soviet Union]] and attended a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the war dead of [[World War II]], when the Soviets were American allies in the fight against [[Nazism]]. He voiced fear of a second holocaust, not against [[Jews]], but "a nuclear holocaust" and advised that "our greatest contribution to world peace is to live with Christ every day."&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Billy Graham trying to avoid offending Soviets", [[United Press International]] story in ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', May 10, 1982, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial views==
===Discussion of Jews with President Nixon===
During the Watergate affair, there were suggestions that Graham had agreed with many of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] opinions, but he denied them and stressed his efforts to build bridges to the Jewish community. In 2002, the controversy was renewed when declassified "[[Nixon White House tapes|Richard Nixon tapes]]" confirmed remarks made by Graham to Nixon three decades earlier.&lt;ref name="nytimes03172002"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/us/billy-graham-responds-to-lingering-anger-over-1972-remarks-on-jews.html Billy Graham Responds to Lingering Anger Over 1972 Remarks on Jews], ''The New York Times'', March 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Captured on the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that [[Antisemitic canard#Accusations of controlling the media|Jews control]] the [[Media of the United States|American media]], calling it a "stranglehold" during a 1972 conversation with Nixon, and suggesting that if Nixon was [[United States presidential election, 1972|re-elected]], they might be able to do something about it.&lt;ref name="bbcregret"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1850077.stm "Graham regrets Jewish slur"], [[BBC]], March 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the tapes were made public, Graham apologized&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061018202154/http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=32770 "Graham Apology Not Enough"], Eric J.

In 2009, more Nixon tapes were released, in which Graham is heard in a 1973 conversation with Nixon referring to Jews and "the synagogue of [[Satan]]". A spokesman for Graham said that Graham has never been an antisemite and that the comparison (in accord with the context of the quotation in the [[Book of Revelation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3:9&amp;version=NIV|title=Revelation 3:9|work=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was directed specifically at those claiming to be Jews, but not holding to traditional Jewish values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628074206/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-06-24-graham-tapes_N.htm|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-06-24-graham-tapes_N.htm |title=In Nixon tapes, Billy Graham refers to 'synagogue of Satan' |first=Cathy Lynn |last=Grossman |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=July 31, 2009 |date=June 24, 2009 |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenism===
After a 1957 crusade in New York, some more fundamentalist Protestant Christians criticized Graham for his [[ecumenism]], even calling him "Antichrist".&lt;ref name="Wirt"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sherwood Eliot |last=Wirt |title=Billy: A Personal Look at Billy Graham, the World's Best-loved Evangelist |publisher=Crossway Books |location=Wheaton, Illinois |year=1997 |page=97 |isbn=0-89107-934-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham expressed [[Inclusivism|inclusivist]] views, suggesting that people without explicit faith in Jesus can be saved. In a 1997 interview with [[Robert Schuller]], Graham said

{{Quote|I think that everybody that loves or knows Christ, whether they are conscious of it or not, they are members of the body of Christ&amp;nbsp;... [God] is calling people out of the world for his name, whether they come from the Muslim world, or the Buddhist world or the non-believing world, they are members of the Body of Christ because they have been called by God. They may not know the name of Jesus but they know in their hearts that they need something they do not have, and they turn to the only light they have, and I think that they are saved and they are going to be with us in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]], ''Evangelicalism Divided'' (2000), pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]], writing from a conservative Protestant standpoint, argues that "Graham's concessions are sad words from one who once spoke on the basis of biblical certainties."&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]], ''Evangelicalism Divided'' (2000), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on women===
In 1970, Graham stated that feminism was "an echo of our overall philosophy of permissiveness" and that women did not want to be "competitive juggernauts pitted against male chauvinists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jesus and the Liberated Woman |first1=Billy |last1=Graham |journal=[[Ladies' Home Journal]] |date=December 1970 |volume=87 |pages=40–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Billy Graham Enters Women's Lib Controversy |date=November 28, 1970 |newspaper=The Kokomo Tribune |page=7 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44885500/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that the role of wife, mother, and homemaker was the destiny of "real womanhood" according to the Judeo-Christian ethic; Graham's assertions, published in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', elicited letters of protest, and were offered as rebuttal to the establishment of "The New Feminism" section of the publication added following sit-in protest at the Journal offices demanding female representation on the staff of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1970.html |title=Feminist Chronicles - 1970 |publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Watching Women's Liberation, 1970: Feminism's Pivotal Year on the Network News |page=112 |url={{Google books|tmtzAwAAQBAJ|page=112|plainurl=yes}} |first1=Bonnie J. |last1=Dow |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-252-09648-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libcom.org/history/1970-feminist-sit-ladies-home-journal |title=1970: Feminist Sit in at Ladies Home Journal |first=ShaKea |last=Alston |date=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ellen Ott |last1=Marshall |chapter=A Matter of Pride, A Feminist Response |pages=79–91 |chapterurl={{Google books|pVAeaDLnCJoC|page=79|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Michael G. |editor1-last=Long |year=2008 |title=The Legacy of Billy Graham: Critical Reflections on America's Greatest Evangelist |isbn=978-0-664-23656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy's daughter Bunny recounts her father denying her and her sisters higher education. As reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/02/21/divorce-drugs-drinking-billy-grahams-children-and-their-absent-father/ |title=Divorce, drugs, drinking: Billy Graham's children and their absent father |first=William |last=Martin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 21, 2018 |access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bunny remembers being groomed for the life of wife, homemaker, and mother. "There was never an idea of a career for us," she said. "I wanted to go to nursing school&amp;nbsp;– Wheaton had a five-year program&amp;nbsp;– but Daddy said no. No reason, no explanation, just 'No.' It wasn't confrontational and he wasn't angry, but when he decided, that was the end of it." She added, "He has forgotten that. Mother has not."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Billy talked his future wife, Ruth, into abandoning her ambition to evangelize in Tibet in favor of staying in the United States to marry him – and that to do otherwise would be "to thwart God's obvious will."&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; After Ruth agreed to marry Billy, he cited the Bible for claiming authority over her, saying, "then I'll do the leading and you do the following."&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

===Views on homosexuality===
Graham regarded [[homosexuality]] as a sin, and in 1974 described it as "a sinister form of perversion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanders|first1=Linley|title=Internet Reacts to Obama Tweet About Billy Graham|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/internet-reacts-to-obama-tweet-about-billy-graham|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=[[Teen Vogue]]|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Tim|title=The complicated legacy of Billy Graham: Gospel or politics?|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2018/02/billy_graham_gospel_politics.html|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he said that he thought AIDS might be a "judgment" from God, but two weeks later he retracted the remark, saying, "I don't believe that, and I don't know why I said it."&lt;ref name=Gjelten&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gjelten|first1=Tom|title='America's Pastor' Billy Graham Dies At 99|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/02/21/136224476/americas-pastor-billy-graham-dies-at-99|access-date=March 2, 2018|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham's stated position was that he did not want to talk about homosexuality as a political issue.&lt;ref name=Gjelten /&gt; Corky Siemaszko, writing for [[NBC News]], noted that after the 1993 incident, Graham "largely steered clear of the subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siemaszko|first1=Corky|title=Franklin Graham followed in his father Billy's footsteps, but took a right-leaning path|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/franklin-graham-followed-his-father-billy-s-footsteps-took-right-n849981|access-date=March 2, 2018|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, however, some commentators called Graham "[[homophobic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Douglas|title=The outpouring of grief for evangelist Billy Graham is disturbing given his homophobic views|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/billy-graham-dead-evangelist-homophobic-barack-obama-justin-welby-a8223561.html|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr Chen Su Lan''' ({{zh|c=陳樹南|p=Chén Shùnán}}; 13 February 1885 – 5 May 1972) was one of the [[Singaporean]] first local medical graduates. He was also an anti-opium fighter, philanthropist and social reformer. He served in a number of important committees including the [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] Management Committee, the Central Midwives Board and the Council of King Edward VII College of Medicine. After the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, he joined the Advisory Council where he spoke out against social ills caused by the war. He founded the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1945 and formed the Chen Su Lan Trust in 1947.

==Early life==
Chen was born in [[Fuzhou]], [[China]] as a third-generation [[Methodist]]. He enrolled at [[Anglo-Chinese College (Fuzhou)|Anglo-Chinese College in Fuzhou]] when he was 15. At a revival meeting led by visiting Bishop Bradford, he pledged to become a preacher one day.

In 1905, he left for [[Singapore]] and enrolled to become one of the first students at the newly opened Straits Federated Malay States Government Medical School (later renamed King Edward VII Medical School, then King Edward VII College of Medicine). He obtained a Licentiate in Medicine at 1910, as part of the first batch of seven graduates. In addition, he also topped that class.

After graduation, he was not only busy with his own practice but he served on a number of important committees, including the [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] Management Committee, the Central Midwives Board and the Council of King Edward VII College of Medicine. He also founded the Alumni Association of the Medical College was elected president of the Malayan branch of the [[British Medical Association]].

==Anti-Opium Fight==
Chen was deeply concerned with the social and health conditions in Singapore. He recognised that [[opium]] addiction was a grim social problem, not helped by the fact that the colonial government monopolised the sale of the drug as means to regulate its use. At the risk of being labelled disloyal to the British, Chen mounted a campaign against opium addiction. He was the president of the Singapore Anti-Opium Society and the director of the Anti-Opium Clinic which he founded in 1933. However, in 1937, the outbreak of war in China caused donations to be diverted to the [[China Relief Fund]] and thus the clinic had to close down.

==Outbreak of the Pacific War==
When the [[Pacific War]] broke out in December 1941, the Japanese army made steady progress in its conquest of the [[Malayan peninsula]]. Chen, who felt that Singapore would fall, decided to flee from the island. On 13 February 1942, he boarded one of the last ships leaving Singapore but unfortunately, the ship was attacked, bombed and set on fire. The passengers abandoned ship and Chen found himself adrift in the cold sea, clinging on to a raft with a few other survivors. During those hours in the water, he re-evaluated his life and realised he had not kept to his childhood commitment to be a preacher. He decided to live fully for God and not himself.

Upon landing on short at a mangrove forest, Chen returned home only to be detained by the [[Kempeitai]] (Japanese military police). An informer had told the Japanese that Chen and other leaders of the [[Methodist Church]] were conspiring against the Japanese government. Although his home was searched, no evidence was found which would incriminate him, and he was released.

==After the Japanese Occupation==
After the war, the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] invited Chen to join the Advisory Council. Chen took the opportunity to speak out boldly against the numerous social problems that had arisen because of the war. To help solve these problems, in 1945, he founded the Chinese [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (now called the Metropolitan YMCA) to help provide demoralised youths with opportunities to rehabilitate themselves.

==Chen Su Lan Trust==
Turning to his personal interest and commitment, he founded the [[Chen Su Lan Trust]] in 1947. The Trust disbursed funds and land to Christian organisations like [[Scripture Union]], and for the founding in 1968 of the Methodist Children's Home which was named after him.

==Writing About His Experiences==
In 1969, Chen published a book entitled ''Pompong and Oxley Rise'', which recounted his childhood days and his experiences during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese Occupation]]. He had been planning to do this since the war as a way to express his gratitude to God. Though he had not fulfilled his commitment to be a preacher in the literal sense, his whole life had been dedicated to serve God through serving the needs of others.

'''David''' "'''Dave'''" '''Karofsky''', often referred to as '''Karofsky''', is a recurring [[fictional character]] from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] musical comedy-drama series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The character is portrayed by actor [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]], and has appeared in ''Glee'' since its [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] episode "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", first broadcast on October 21, 2009. Initially known only by his surname, Karofsky was introduced as a bully and a member of the McKinley High football team who [[Slush (beverage)|slushies]] football captain [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), and who teams with fellow athlete and bully [[Characters of Glee#Azimio|Azimio]] (James Earl) to torment various fellow students, usually members of the school [[glee club]], New Directions. Later in the season, he is identified as a member of the football team, and is a football player in the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]]. Karofsky is revealed to be a [[closeted]] homosexual early in that season, and is still closeted at the end of the season, though he has stopped being a bully, and has won the election for Junior Prom King. He transfers to another school for his senior year, but is outed there and after being bullied by his classmates he attempts suicide, though he is saved by his father.

Karofsky was initially used as an ordinary jock bully, but Adler's acting impressed show co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]; he expanded Karofsky's role in the show's second season by having him especially target gay glee club member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), only to turn out to be gay himself, though closeted. That revelation sparked a wave of reaction from people who thought it was important for ''Glee'' to show "the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted".&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Reviewers have been impressed with Adler's portrayal of Karofsky, including Michael Slezak of ''[[TVLine]]'', who in the second season characterized it as "surprisingly nuanced" and with a "terrific amount of depth", and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} Rae Votta, who wrote in the third season, "As always, Kurt and Karofsky's scenes shine as the strongest in whichever episode they're featured."&lt;ref name="TVLBTW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBRV314"/&gt;

==Storylines==
In the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] of ''Glee'', Karofsky appears in five episodes. He is a jock and a bully, initially a member of the McKinley High hockey team.&lt;ref name="Mash-Up"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mash-Up |episodelink=Mash-Up (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 21, 2009 |season=1 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is first seen in the episode "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", where he [[Slush (beverage)|slushies]] football captain [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]). He reappears in "[[Mattress (Glee)|Mattress]]", teamed with football player [[Characters of Glee#Azimio|Azimio]] (James Earl), and writes on Finn's face with black markers to demonstrate how they will deface the glee club's yearbook photo, which Karofsky does at the end of the episode. By "[[Theatricality]]" he is on the football team with Azimio, and they shove [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) and [[Tina Cohen-Chang]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]) against lockers for wearing [[Lady Gaga]] costumes—part of a glee club assignment—around school.&lt;ref name="Theatricality"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Theatricality|episodelink=Theatricality|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 25, 2010 |season=1 |number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karofsky is featured in the first eleven episodes of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] continuing his bullying ways; in the sixth, "[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]", he especially targets Kurt, who is gay. After he slams Kurt into a locker, Kurt chases after and confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, a stunned Kurt shoves him away, and Karofsky leaves. Kurt and his new gay friend [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]) later try to talk to him about being gay and [[closeted]], but he denies that the kiss happened and soon resumes his bullying.&lt;ref name="Never Been Kissed"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Never Been Kissed|episodelink=Never Been Kissed (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 9, 2010 |season=2 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even threatens to kill Kurt if he tells anyone else about the kiss.&lt;ref name="The Substitute"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Substitute|episodelink=The Substitute (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 16, 2010 |season=2 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt's father [[Burt Hummel|Burt]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]) finds out about the threat, but not the kiss, and Karofsky is soon expelled, but is allowed to return by the school board because no physical violence to Kurt had been witnessed; Kurt transfers to Dalton Academy to get away from him.&lt;ref name="Furt"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Furt |episodelink=Furt|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Carol Banker (director) [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 23, 2010 |season=2 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The football team has clinched a spot in the championship game, but animosity is running high between glee and non-glee members and harming the team's performance; in "[[The Sue Sylvester Shuffle]]", [[Shannon Beiste|Coach Beiste]] ([[Dot Jones|Dot-Marie Jones]]) and glee club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) force the entire football team to join the glee club for a week to settle their differences and dispel their prejudices. Karofsky is praised by Will as a good performer and dancer, but when the hockey team attacks the football team for their low-status glee club activities, Karofsky leads a walkout from the joint rehearsals by all the non-glee members, and Beiste kicks them off the team. On championship night, the team members—except for Karofsky—relent just before the half-time show, which the team and glee club perform together. Karofsky joins in when he sees the crowd's positive reaction to the start of the half-time show, a mashup of "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" and "[[Heads Will Roll (song)|Heads Will Roll]]"; the full team ultimately wins the game. Later, in school, Finn approaches Karofsky about joining the glee club and apologizing to Kurt, but Karofsky rejects his suggestion out of hand, since the championship victory has him back on top of the social ladder.&lt;ref name="Shuffle"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Sue Sylvester Shuffle|episodelink=The Sue Sylvester Shuffle|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=February 6, 2011 |season=2 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karofsky appears in three additional episodes later in the second season. [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) decides in the episode "[[Born This Way (Glee)|Born This Way]]" that she wants to become prom queen; she sees Karofsky and realizes he would be a credible prom king partner moments before she sees him checking out a male student's butt and also realizes he is as closeted as she is. She then blackmails him into teaming up with her as a pretend couple—[[beard (companion)|beards]]—and starting an anti-bullying club, with the purpose of getting Kurt to return to McKinley and New Directions. Karofsky apologizes to Kurt for his bullying in a meeting with Will, [[Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]), and their respective fathers Paul ([[Daniel Roebuck]]) and Burt; Kurt is happy to be able to transfer back.&lt;ref name="Born This Way"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Born This Way|episodelink=Born This Way (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 26, 2011 |season=2 |number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Prom Queen (Glee)|Prom Queen]]", with the prom less than a week away, Karofsky and Santana arrange to guard Kurt at school when they learn he will be bringing Blaine as his prom date; Karofsky tells Kurt, tearfully, that he is sorry for what he did to him. At the prom, Karofsky is voted prom king but Santana is not elected prom queen; instead, an appalled Kurt is written in and wins. As they take the floor for the traditional prom king and queen dance, Kurt suggests that this is Karofsky's chance to come out and "make a difference", but Karofsky is not ready to do so, and walks away.&lt;ref name="Prom Queen"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Prom Queen |episodelink=Prom Queen (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 10, 2011 |season=2 |number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He next appears in the third-season episode "The First Time". He has transferred to another high school from McKinley for his senior year, fearing that he might be outed if he stayed; he sees Kurt in a gay bar, and tells Kurt he has become a regular there and feels accepted.&lt;ref name="First Time"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The First Time|episodelink=The First Time (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 8, 2011 |season=3 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is Kurt's secret admirer for Valentine's Day in the episode "[[Heart (Glee)|Heart]]", and after Kurt gently turns him down, he is recognized by a classmate,&lt;ref name="Heart"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Heart|episodelink=Heart (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Allison Adler|Ali Adler]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=February 14, 2012 |season=3 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later spreads the word to others in the school that Karofsky is gay. In "[[On My Way (Glee)|On My Way]]", he is taunted and bullied by his athletic teammates and by others, at school and using online media, so severely that he attempts to hang himself, but is saved by his father, who finds him in time. Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital where Karofsky tells Kurt his best friend never wants to see him again and how his mother thinks he has a disease and can be "cured". Karofsky, in tears the whole time, again apologizes to Kurt saying he made Kurt's life hell but he couldn't handle it himself, and the two agree to become friends.&lt;ref name="On My Way"&gt;{{cite episode |title=On My Way|episodelink=On My Way (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=February 21, 2012 |season=3 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth season, Karofsky is dating Blaine, but when he finds out that Blaine still loves Kurt they break up on good terms. Karofsky appeared in the series finale at the end where he joined the entirety of the Glee club on stage for their final performance.

[[File:MaxAdler.png|thumb|right|upright|Max Adler portrays Dave Karofsky]]
Dave Karofsky is played by actor [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]], who first appeared in the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] episode "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", initially as a member of the William McKinley High School hockey team.&lt;ref name="Mash-Up"/&gt; Karofsky began as a background character who tormented members of the glee club, and was known only by his surname. So far as Adler knew, his role was for a single episode only,&lt;ref name="RadarOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/04/exclusive-interview-glees-max-adler-bullys-back|title=Exclusive Interview: ''Glee''{{'s}} Max Adler -- The Bully's Back|date=April 27, 2011|first=Neil|last=Woulfe|work= [[RadarOnline]]|publisher=American Media, Inc.|accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he returned once more before the first half of the first season ended, and then three times in the nine episodes of the second half of that season. The last of these, "Theatricality", written and directed by series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]],&lt;ref name="Theatricality"/&gt; proved to be pivotal: Murphy was impressed with his acting and wanted to write more for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mead |first1=Mike |last2= |first2= |date= February 11, 2011 |title=none |journal=[[Gay Times]] |volume= |quote=If you look back at season one we set it up in the Lady Gaga episode when Kurt is particularly attacked by one football player. I thought the actor was so good I wanted to write more. |issue=389 |page= 49|publisher= |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Karofsky begins the second season as an ordinary jock bully, Murphy hinted to Adler that there would be more in store for the character. According to Adler, Murphy approached him at the second-season premiere and said, {{" '}}we just wrote some really good stuff for you for episode six'." The actor recalls, "I had no idea what that meant, until I read it!"&lt;ref name="RadarOnline"/&gt; Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: "I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going out of his way to make other people's lives a living hell".&lt;ref name="HN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/11/glee-bully-max-adler-kisses-and-tells-about-kurt-karofsky.html |title={{-'}}Glee' bully Max Adler kisses and tells about Kurt, Karofsky |last=Nguyen |first=Hanh |date=November 11, 2010 |work=[[Zap2it]] |publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]] |accessdate=November 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115192923/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/11/glee-bully-max-adler-kisses-and-tells-about-kurt-karofsky.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had considered various ideas for Karofsky—"maybe he was jealous of the glee club, maybe he was gay, maybe a million different things"&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/max_adler_uNk8s3hnXocJjHeh7QrVJO |title=Max Adler: 'Glee' has the ability to change how people think |last=Wieselman |first=Jarett |date=April 26, 2011 |work=[[New York Post]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129063928/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/max_adler_uNk8s3hnXocJjHeh7QrVJO |archivedate=November 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—when he got the script for that episode he "was just as shocked as anybody else" when his character kissed Kurt,&lt;ref name="HN"/&gt; though he "thought it was so awesome that they would allow this character to go there."&lt;ref name="RadarOnline"/&gt;

There was a strong reaction from the show's viewers. Adler said, "I've heard from a lot of fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." He wants Karofsky to "accept himself and come out because [he thinks] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, "people do get hope from ''Glee''."&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; He also said, "I think [Ryan Murphy] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/max-adler-lady-gaga-glee?page=0,1 |title=Max Adler Says Performing Lady Gaga on ''Glee'' Would "Blow My Mind{{"-}} |last=Jensen |first=Michael |date=January 20, 2011 |work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]] |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210649/http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/max-adler-lady-gaga-glee?page=0%2C1 |archivedate=May 31, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/01/08/glee-exclusive-gwyneth-paltrow-ladygaga/|title={{-'}}Glee' exclusive: Season 2 to feature more Gwyneth and Gaga!|date=January 8, 2011|first=Tim|last=Stack|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them day in and day out at school", and they dreaded school because of it.&lt;ref name="RadarOnline"/&gt;

In addition to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, other aspects of his personality have been explored. In "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced to spend a week working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the "softer side" of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do.&lt;ref name="Shuffle"/&gt; Adler said, "I feel like that it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Glee-Max-Adler-1028974.aspx|title=''Glee''{{'s}} Max Adler Says He's Prepping for Karofsky's ...

However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter.&lt;ref name="Furt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Born This Way"/&gt; Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in "Born This Way" is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.&lt;ref name="Born This Way"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prom Queen"/&gt;

==Reception==
The first time Karofsky received significant notice from critics was for the second season's sixth episode, "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience as much as it did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own."&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/11/glee-recap-fighting-back-and-first-kisses.html|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Fighting back and first kisses|date=November 10, 2010|first=Amy|last=Reiter|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]]'s Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/11/10/glee-recap-never-been-kissed/|title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: 'Never Been Kissed{{'-}}|date=November 10, 2010|first=Aly|last=Semigran|publisher=MTV|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Holmes (writer)|Linda Holmes]] of [[National Public Radio]] dismissed "Never Been Kissed" as "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and "emotionally unsound".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/11/10/131212955/why-glee-missed-the-mark-with-the-much-hyped-never-been-kissed?ft=1&amp;f=93568166|title=How 'Glee' Missed The Mark With The Much-Hyped 'Never Been Kissed{{'-}}|date=November 11, 2010|first=Linda|last=Holmes|work=Monkey See|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'s}} Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on "[[Furt]]" of the bullying storyline as a "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/11/glee-two-weddings-and-an-anti-bullying-message/66971/|title={{-'}}Glee': Two Weddings and an Anti-Bullying Message|first=Patrick|last=Burns|author2=Fallon, Kevin |author3=Brown, Meghan |work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media Company]]|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", ''[[The A.V.

It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/02/glee-recap-a-post-super-bowl-thriller.html|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: A post-Super Bowl thriller?|first=Amy|last=Reiter|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chris Colfer 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Karofsky's scenes with Kurt (Colfer, ''pictured'') have been praised by reviewers]]
Michael Slezak of ''[[TVLine]]'' complimented "Max Adler's surprisingly nuanced performance" as Karofsky in "Born This Way": "The complex play of emotions in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously came out to him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous."&lt;ref name="TVLBTW"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/04/glee-recap-season-2-episode-18-born-this-way/|title=''Glee'' Recap: Rebels With All Their Flaws|date=April 26, 2011|first=Michael|last=Slezak|work=[[TVLine]]|publisher=[[Mail.com Media]]|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky."&lt;ref name="TVLBTW"/&gt; VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode and the next one where the character appears, "Prom Queen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/born-this-way,55023/|title={{-"}}Born This Way{{"-}}|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|work=[[The A.V.

They're both people trying to do the right thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves".&lt;ref name="AVProm"/&gt; Meghan Brown of ''The Atlantic'' praised Karofsky's "tearful apology to Kurt" in that episode as being "painful and poignant",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/05/glee-captures-the-glorious-awfulness-of-prom/238685/|title={{-'}}Glee' Captures the Glorious Awfulness of Prom|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|author2=Brown, Meghan |work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media Company]]|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Slezak went further: &lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... [Y]ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping ''Glee'' will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="TVLine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/05/glee-recap-season-2-episode-20-prom-queen/|title=''Glee'' Recap: Tears of a Crown|date=May 11, 2011|first=Michael|last=Slezak|work=[[TVLine]]|publisher=[[Mail.com Media]]|accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karofsky's reappearance and interaction with Kurt in the third-season episode "The First Time" received very positive reviews. Anthony Benigno of ''[[The Faster Times]]'' characterized the scene with Kurt and Karofsky as "subtle" and "a home run", and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Abby West called it a "perfect little nuanced scene", while Michael Ausiello of ''TVLine'' said it was his "favorite scene of the episode".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefastertimes.com/tvrecapsandnews/2011/11/08/glee-recap-season-2-episode-5-hey-everybody-were-all-gonna-get-laid/ |title={{-'}}Glee' Recap (Season 2, Episode 5): Hey Everybody, We’re All Gonna Get Laid! |date=November 8, 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Benigno |work=[[The Faster Times]] |publisher=[[Sam Apple]] |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318224001/http://www.thefastertimes.com/tvrecapsandnews/2011/11/08/glee-recap-season-2-episode-5-hey-everybody-were-all-gonna-get-laid/ |archivedate=March 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/glee-season-3-episode-5-sex-virginity-west-side-story/|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Let's Talk About Sex|last=West|first=Abby|date=November 9, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Ausiello |first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|title=''Glee'' Spoiler Alert: 8 Things You Must Know About Next Week's Sex-cellent Episode, 'The First Time{{'-}}|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/11/glee-season-3-episode-5-the-first-time-spoilers/|work=[[TVLine]]|publisher=[[Mail.com Media]]|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next appearance in "Heart", again with Kurt, was described by Slezak as "electric, with Kurt tenderly giving the 'just friends' speech to Dave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2012/02/glee-recap-season-3-episode-13-heart-samuel-larsen/|title=''Glee'' Recap: Crazy, Stupid, Love |first=Michael|last=Slezak|work=[[TVLine]]|publisher=[[Mail.com Media]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'s}} Joseph Brannigan Lynch thought the plot of having Karofsky be Kurt's secret admirer was "vaguely stalker-ish on Karofsky's part, and contrived on the part of the show", and Robert Canning of [[IGN]] predicted that after Karofsky had been seen by his classmate, it would "just be an episode or two before Karofsky gets bullied into thinking about suicide, if not actually taking his own life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1218757p1.html |title=Glee: "Heart" Review |last=Canning |first=Robert |date=February 15, 2012 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/glee-season-13-episode-13-jeff-goldblum/|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Dreadlocks + Jeff Goldblum = Valentine's Day! |last=Lynch|first=Joseph Brannigan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he reviewed the next episode, "On My Way", which featured Karofsky's suicide attempt, Canning stated that his "cynicism [in the "Heart" review] was won over by a powerfully acted and directed story". He also said, "the initial locker room scene was heartbreaking" and "Max Adler's subtle facial expressions were brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1219214p1.html |title=Glee: "On My Way" Review |last=Canning |first=Robert |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Jerome Solon Felder in 1925 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], he was the son of [[Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="Pomus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tamarkini |first=Jeff |title=Heart of the matter |pages= |work=The Phoenix |date=2007-04-03 |url=http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid36818.aspx |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235800/http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid36818.aspx |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Felder became a fan of the blues after hearing a [[Big Joe Turner]] record.  Having had [[polio]] as a boy, he walked with the help of crutches. Later, due to [[post-polio syndrome]], exacerbated by an accident, Felder eventually relied on a wheelchair.

His brother is New York attorney [[Raoul Felder]].

==Career==
Using the [[stage name]] "Doc Pomus", teenager Felder began performing as a blues singer. His stage name was not inspired by anyone in particular; he just thought it sounded better for a blues singer than the name Jerry Felder. Pomus stated that more often than not, he was the only Caucasian in the clubs, but that as a Jew and a polio victim, he felt a special "underdog" kinship with African Americans, while in turn the audiences both respected his courage and were impressed with his talent.  Gigging at various clubs in and around New York City, Pomus often performed with the likes of [[Milt Jackson]], [[Mickey Baker]] and [[King Curtis]]. Pomus recorded approximately 40 sides as a singer in the '40s and '50s for record companies such as Chess, Apollo, Gotham and others.

In the early 1950s, Pomus started writing magazine articles as well as songwriting for artists such as Lavern Baker, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles and Big Joe Turner to earn more money to support a family, after he had married Willi Burke, a Broadway actress.  His first big songwriting break came when he chanced upon the [[Coasters]]' version of his "[[Young Blood (The Coasters song)|Young Blood]]" on a jukebox while on honeymoon.  Pomus wrote the song, then gave it to [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]], who radically rewrote it.  Still, Pomus had co-credit as author, and he soon received a royalty check for $2,500 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1957}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), which convinced him that songwriting was a career direction worth pursuing.  By 1957, Pomus had given up performing for full-time songwriting.  He collaborated with pianist [[Mort Shuman]], whom he met when Shuman was dating Pomus's younger cousin, to write for [[Hill &amp; Range]] Music Co./Rumbalero Music at its offices in New York City's [[Brill Building]].  Pomus asked Shuman to write with him because Pomus didn't then know much about rock and roll, whereas Shuman was familiar with many popular artists of the day. Their songwriting efforts had Pomus write the lyrics and Shuman the [[melody]], although often they worked on both. They wrote the hit songs "[[A Teenager in Love]]", "[[Save The Last Dance For Me]]", "[[Hushabye]]", "[[This Magic Moment]]", "[[Turn Me Loose (Doc Pomus song)|Turn Me Loose]]", "[[Sweets For My Sweet]]" (a hit for [[The Drifters]] and then [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]]), "Go Jimmy Go", "[[Little Sister (Pomus/Shuman song)|Little Sister]]", "[[Can't Get Used to Losing You]]", "[[Suspicion (Terry Stafford song)|Suspicion]]", "[[Surrender (Elvis Presley song)|Surrender]]" and "[[(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame]]".

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Pomus wrote several songs with  [[Phil Spector]] ("Young Boy Blues"; "Ecstasy"; "What Am I To Do?"), Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber ("Young Blood" and "She's Not You"), and other Brill Building-era writers. Pomus also wrote "[[Lonely Avenue]]", a 1956 hit for [[Ray Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman
|work=www.history-of-rock
|accessdate=2007-06-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, in his eleventh-floor, two-room apartment at the Westover Hotel at 253 West 72nd Street, Pomus wrote songs with [[Dr. John]], [[Ken Hirsch (composer)|Ken Hirsch]] and [[Willy DeVille]] for what he said were "...those people stumbling around in the night out there, uncertain or not always so certain of exactly where they fit in and where they were headed." These later songs ("There Must Be A Better World", "There Is Always One More Time", "That World Outside", "You Just Keep Holding On", and "Something Beautiful Dying" in particular)—recorded by [[Willy DeVille]], [[B.B. King]], [[Irma Thomas]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[Dr. John]], [[James Booker]], and [[Johnny Adams]]—are considered by some, including writer [[Peter Guralnick]], musician and songwriter Dr. John, and producer [[Joel Dorn]], to be signatures of his best craft.

The documentary film ''A.K.A. Doc Pomus'' (2012),  conceived by Pomus' daughter Sharyn Felder, directed by filmmaker [[Peter Miller (filmmaker)|Peter Miller]], edited by Amy Linton and produced by Felder, Hechter and Miller, details Pomus' life.

Pomus died on March 14, 1991 from [[lung cancer]], at the age of 65 at NYU medical center in Manhattan.

"Doc's Blues" was recorded by bluesman [[Son Seals]], on Seals' last album, ''Lettin’ Go''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r471514|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lettin' Go |accessdate=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Responsible for [[Lou Reed]]'s introduction to the music industry in the early 1960s, Pomus was one of two friends Reed memorialized on his 1992 album ''[[Magic and Loss]]'' (the other was [[Rotten Rita]]).
*In 1995, [[Rhino Records]] released a [[tribute album]] to Pomus entitled ''Till The Night Is Gone''.  Pomus songs are performed by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], [[Dr. John]], [[Irma Thomas]], [[Solomon Burke]], [[John Hiatt]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Aaron Neville]], [[Lou Reed]], [[The Band]], [[B.B. King]], [[Los Lobos]] and [[Rosanne Cash]].
*In 2010, [[Ben Folds]] and [[Nick Hornby]] named their collaborative album [[Lonely Avenue (album)|''Lonely Avenue'']], on which the song "Doc Pomus" appeared. The lyrics referenced an excerpt from Pomus's uncompleted memoir, February 21, 1984: "I was never one of those happy cripples who stumbled around smiling and shiny-eyed, trying to get the world to cluck its tongue and shake its head sadly in my direction. They’d never look at me and say, 'What a wonderful, courageous fellow.'" The album featured lyrics written by British author Hornby, set to music by American performer Folds. It was released on September 28, 2010.
*[[John Goodman]]'s character in the [[Coen brothers]]' 2013 dramedy ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]'' was loosely inspired by Pomus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Greg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/coens-evoke-ny-folk-scene-hanks-battles-pirates-movies.html |title=Coens Evoke NY Folk Scene; Hanks Battles Pirates: Movies |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pomus' song catalog in the U.S. territory is managed by his son-in-law Will Bratton through Spirit One Music.

Since 1494 the Spaniards had imposed heavy tributes on the Taino population of Hispaniola. In 1495, Taino led by Caonabo raised up in arms but were crushed by [[Bartholomew Columbus]]. Guarionex then opted for accommodation and appeasement but by 1497 the situation had deteriorated further. Guarionex then sided with Spanish rebel [[Francisco Roldán]] and set out to attack the Spaniards. Columbus assembled his troops and attacked Guarionex's camp at night by surprise. The cacique was captured and his warriors dispersed. Guarionex was later released by Columbus and went back to his policy of appeasement. At one point he could not hold to power and fled to the north of the island. The Spaniards captured him there and sent him in chains to [[Spain]] in 1502, but the ship sank during a storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492-1566 | author=David M.

'''Gustavo Bodjedi Envela-Mahua Jr.''' (born January 22, 1968 in [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]]) is an [[Equatorial Guinea|Equatoguinean]] former sprinter, actor, and political hopeful, currently based in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]]. He also holds [[United States|American]] citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exiled Olympian Convict Running To Remove Africa's Longest Ruling Dictator | url = https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/08/01/exiled-olympian-convict-running-to-remove-africas-longest-ruling-dictator| accessdate = 2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and early life==

Envela's father, [[Gustavo Envela-Makongo Sr.]], resigned as Equatorial Guinea's first ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in 1970 due to clashes with the Equatorial Guinean government. In 1970 the family, due to escalating political unrest in their native country, fled into exile and settled in [[Salem, Oregon]].

Growing up in Salem, Envela gained notoriety at an early age as a standout sprinter, setting several national age group records.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} He attended Waldo Middle School and [[Douglas McKay High School]]. While at McKay, he set state records in the 100 (10.49 seconds), 200 (21.33) and the 400 meter dashes (46.78), and took first place in the state meet in each of those events from 1984 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.registerguard.com/news/2006/05/21/d1.sp.bellamy.0521.p1.php?section=columnists The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, USA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sporting distinctions==

Envela went on to run for [[Stanford University]] during his freshman year of college.

===Record participant in the Olympics as sprinter===

Additionally, after becoming the first athlete to compete in the [[Equatorial Guinea at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic games for Equatorial Guinea]] in 1984, he went on to compete in a total of 4 games – 1984, 1988, 1992, and 1996 – setting a record for appearances in the Olympics by a sprinter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/|title=Olympics at Sports Reference|website=Olympics at Sports-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and other activities==

After graduating from Stanford in 1990, instead of pursuing professional sports, he set his eyes on running for president of his native Equatorial Guinea with hopes of establishing freedom of speech, raising the standard of living and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2000/sepoct/articles/olympics.html|title=Stanford Magazine - Article|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Envela scheduled his [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] agenda with the help of lobbyist and onetime deputy [[United States Senate|Senate]] legal counsel, Robert Kelley. In addition, Envela sought the advice of [[James Carville]], ex-[[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] advisor. He also worked with [[Warren Weinstein]] who was once with the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. Envela has recently been a consultant for [[Africa Global]], a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based organization whose past clients include the current Dictator-President of Equatorial Guinea, [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]].

Envela currently lives in [[Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania]], where he is president of [[Voice of Democracy]]. He and his wife Tomiko have two children including a daughter, their first born, Misako, as well as their second born Malaya. Misako is a senior in high school and is active in track like her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=1159369|title=Misako Envela|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=39952|title=Stanford Magazine - Article|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mh.iofc.org/node/25192&lt;/ref&gt; Although his political aspirations seem to have been postponed,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinea-ecuatorial.net/ms/main.asp?cd=ni1611|title=The Crude Politics of Trading Oil; Despite an abysmal record on human rights, EquatorialGuinea is a major U.S. supplier.|last=Ndo|first=Celestino Nvo Okenve|website=www.guinea-ecuatorial.net|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has managed to hold his own in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] with cameo roles in movies such as ''[[Sgt. Bilko (film)|Sgt. Bilko]]'' and an appearance on the TV game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He speaks native [[Fang language|Fang]] with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]] as his second languages.

{{nihongo|'''Hiroyuki Agawa'''|阿川 弘之|Agawa Hiroyuki|extra=}} (December 24, 1920 – August 3, 2015) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[author]]. He was known for his fiction centered on World War II, as well as his biographies and essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=作家の阿川弘之氏が死去　文化勲章受章者、正論執筆メンバー|url=http://www.sankei.com/life/news/150805/lif1508050036-n1.html|publisher=sankei|accessdate=6 August 2015|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary career ==
Agawa was born in [[Hiroshima]], Japan. As a [[high school]] student Agawa was influenced by the Japanese author [[Naoya Shiga]]. He entered the [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] to study [[Japanese literature]]. Upon graduation in 1942, Agawa was [[military conscription|conscripted]] to serve in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], where he worked as an intelligence officer breaking Chinese military codes until the end of the war. He returned to Hiroshima, where his parents had experienced the atomic bomb, in March 1946.

After [[World War II]] Agawa wrote his first short story ''Nennen Saisai'' (Years upon Years, 1946), which was a classic [[I Novel]], or autobiographical novel, recounting the reunion with his parents. It follows the style of [[Naoya Shiga]], who is said to have praised the work. ''August 6'' as Agawa notes in a postscript, combines the stories of friends and acquaintances who experienced the bombing into the testimony of one family. Occupation censorship at the time was strict, but the story passed because, the author later observed, "it made no reference to the problems of after-effect and continued no overt criticism of the U.S." Agawa came to popular and critical attention with his ''Citadel in Spring'' ({{nihongo2|春の城}}, 1952), which was awarded the [[Yomiuri Prize]]. (He later revisited the same theme of his experiences as a student soldier in ''Kurai hato'' (Dark waves, 1974)). ''Ma no isan'' (Devil's Heritage, 1953), a documentary novel, is an account of the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a young Tokyo reporter, handling, among other topics, the death of his Hiroshima nephew and survivors' reactions to the Atomic bomb Casualty Commission, the U.S. agency that conducted research on atomic victims.

Agawa's four major biographical novels are ''[[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto Isoroku]]'' (山本五十六, 1965), ''[[Mitsumasa Yonai|Yonai Mitsumasa]]'' (米内光政, 1978), ''[[Shigeyoshi Inoue|Inoue Seibi]]'' (井上成美, 1986), and ''[[Naoya Shiga|Shiga Naoya]]'' (志賀直哉, 1994). His other major works include ''Kumo no bohyo'' (Grave markers in the clouds, 1955), and ''Gunkan Nagato no shogai'' (The life of the warship Nagato, 1975).

Agawa was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] (Bunka Kunsho) in 1999.

He is the father of [[Sawako Agawa]], popular author and TV personality, and [[Naoyuki Agawa]], professor of law at [[Keio University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3583">'''Isaac Eastey''' (November 27, 1627 in [[Freston, Suffolk|Freston]], England, died June 11, 1712 in [[Topsfield, Massachusetts]]) was the husband of [[Mary Eastey]], who was executed during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] of 1692. Isaac and Mary were both highly respected members of the Salem Village Church, and the community in general. Isaac played a significant role in the witch trials, which is often overlooked in history. Despite being one of the primary reasons for Mary's accusation, he desperately tried to clear his wife's name and put an end to the trials altogether.

== Early life ==
Isaac had been a highly prosperous farmer throughout his life, which resulted in a large and upscale home with a generous owning of land and property. Isaac Eastey, along with his father-in-law Jacob Towne, were lifelong enemies of the [[Putnam family]] (who were later the main accusers in the witch trials). The tension between the two powerful families originated with bitter warfare over the ownership of woodland. Isaac and Jacob at one point snuck onto Putnam property and chopped several of their trees down. This, and several other similar incidents, led to a full on, physical confrontation between a band of Putnam men and several Eastey men. However the Putnam clan outnumbered Isaac Eastey and his group, and the Putnams proclaimed a victory. Despite this, the feuding over land ownership between the Easteys and Putnams would last nearly a century. In 1655, Isaac Eastey married Mary Towne. The couple raised eleven children together, with only three of them surviving into adulthood: Isaac Jr. (1656–1714), Joseph (1657–1739), and Sarah (1660–1749).

== His wife's accusation and eventual execution ==

[[Ann Putnam|Anne Putnam Jr.]], [[Mercy Lewis]], and several other young "afflicted" girls in Salem Village viciously accused Mary Eastey of being a [[witch]]. The girls claimed Mary's specter would bite and choke them, appear to them at night along with [[Satan]] and demand they sign his [[grimoire|black book]], and (along with her sisters [[Rebecca Nurse]] and [[Sarah Cloyce]]) would regularly attend satanic ceremonies held in [[Boston]], that Mary was geographically able to participate in due to her ability to fly upon sticks, which the Devil granted her in return for her soul. Residents of [[Salem Village]], Topsfield, and other neighboring towns were shocked to learn a woman of such pious character was accused of being a witch. However, townsfolk were well aware of the bitterness and hostility the Putnams held against Isaac Eastey, and Mary's father, Jacob. This, along with Mary's mother having a long-standing reputation of practicing witchcraft, are what most likely led to her accusation. Isaac, along with his and Mary's friends, family and neighbors, all vigorously tried to defend Mary during her examination and trial, but did not succeed. Isaac's wife Mary was hanged on September 22, 1692.

== Later life ==
Isaac  and his family did receive compensation of 20 pounds, from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] government, after Mercy Lewis admitted she wrongfully accused Mary of being a witch in 1711.

'''Jeanie Boulet''' is a [[fictional character]] from the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.  She was portrayed by [[Gloria Reuben]] as a recurring character midway in the first season, then as a regular from season 2 onwards. Reuben left the series in the 6th season, but in 2008 (season 14) she reprised the role for one episode.

Jeanie is [[HIV]]-positive.  Along with ''[[General Hospital]]''{{'}}s [[Robin Scorpio]], she is one of the only regular characters in American television history to contract HIV without eventually being killed off by the writers.

==Creation and development==
Introduced in season 1, episode 14 "Long Day's Journey", Jeanie Boulet was initially a recurring character involved in the story arc of the regular character Dr [[Peter Benton]] (played by [[Eriq La Salle]]). During the first season, Jeanie's storyline centred on her adulterous affair with Benton, which developed after he employed her to care for his senile mother — Jeanie was unhappy in marriage to a philandering husband named Al (played by [[Wolfgang Bodison]] and [[Michael Beach]]). Benton was depicted as a talented, "self-assured" but "brooding", defensive and serious doctor.&lt;ref name="jeanie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n13_v91/ai_19127749 |title=Eriq Lasalle and Gloria Reuben help make 'ER' a top-rated TV series - Cover Story |publisher=''Jet'' |date=1997-02-17 |accessdate=2008-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515064904/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n13_v91/ai_19127749 |archivedate=2006-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, Jeanie was portrayed as emotional, caring and sensitive. Reuben has described Jeanie as "strong-willed, sharp and intelligent, but, [she] has a dry sense of humor. She knows exactly what she's doing professionally, but she has a nurturing side, too."&lt;ref name="jeanie"/&gt; The personality differences between the characters lead to several clashes on-screen initially, as both have different ideas about what's best for Benton's ailing and progressively senile mother. In episode 20 "Full Moon, Saturday Night", Jeanie orders for Benton's mother to be held in restraints to prevent injury; Furious, Benton removes the restraints, leading her to fall from her bed. Benton and Jeanie grow closer as he subsequently accepts her guidance on how to care for his mother.

In his book, ''Bedside Manners: George Clooney and ER'', author Sam Keenleyside comments on the scenes, saying that the storyline was poignant, but that "it gets lost in all the machinations of the rest of the show."&lt;ref name="bedside"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[George Clooney]], Sam Keenleyside|title= Bedside Manners: George Clooney and ER|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KdY6gcAol98C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=jeanie+boulet+ER#PPA204,M1|year=1998|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of a blossoming romance saw a change in Benton's disposition over the following episodes, Keenleyside notes that he "seems to be thawing [...] It's well-worth asking what's brought all this on, and the answer seems to be — if his dinner with Jeanie is any indication — that he's a young doctor in love. Whether he continues his nice-guy routine while he plays second fiddle to Jeanie's husband remains to be seen, but giving Benton a love-interest, no matter how ill-fated, will offer his character some much needed life outside the hospital."&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; As the first season drew to a close in episode 25 "Everything Old is New Again", Benton is shown to be keen for their relationship to progress, asking Jeanie to leave her husband; by contrast Jeanie is reticent and pulls away, leaving the future of their relationship unclear. According to Keenleyside, this was a deliberate "loose thread [...] left dangling to pull [viewers] back on to [their] sofas next season." He predicts, "expect to see them together next September; that way the writers can gloss over all the messy in-between stuff and get right to the romance for the new season."&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt;

Jeanie progressed to regular character status by season 2. As the season came under way, it was revealed that her affair with Benton still continued, unbeknown to her husband, leaving Benton's [[authoritarian personality]] "uncomfortably weakened" as the third member of a [[love triangle]].&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; When Jeanie refused to leave her husband, the relationship ended on bad terms, setting up the next chapter in Jeanie's story as she finds employment as a Physician Assistant (PA) at the serial's focal setting of County Hospital's ER. This leads to hostilities from a dishevelled Benton, who proceeds to make her working life a "living hell", until she confronts him.&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; In summary of the plot, Keenleyside noted that "it's nice to see Jeanie being allowed to move beyond the quiet forcefulness that has thus far marked her relationshsip with Peter, and it's even better to see Benton with his tail between his legs for a change."&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; As season 2 progressed, Jeanie was given storylines independent of Benton, allowing further character development as she interacts between other characters, staff and patients. This move was praised by Keenleyside, who commented, "this brief look at Jeanie, free from Benton's brooding presence, indicates that ''ER'' is definitely the place for her character. If she's allowed to continue to develop her own character, instead of being forced into Benton's background, she could become a complement to [Dr] [[John Carter (ER)|Carter]]. Like Carter, she cares about her work, but she's not afraid to stand up for herself — especially when Benton is in her way."&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; However, he does note that Jeanie is perhaps "thrust to the forefront too mechanically. She is forced to carry a heavier story load than her character is capable at this point."&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; Episode 21 of season 2, "Take These Broken Wings", marked the beginning of one of Jeanie's notable storylines when her husband Al was admitted to the ER and subsequently diagnosed as [[HIV positive]]. As the second season drew to a close, Jeanie's HIV status was left in question, as was Dr Benton's.

In the opening episode of season 3, "Dr. Carter, I Presume?", ''ER'' writers dropped the "requisite bombshell" that Jeanie had tested positive for HIV, while Benton had tested negative.&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt; Jeanie decides to manage her illness in secrecy, refusing to divulge her status to her employers, a decision Benton disapproves of and he attempts to have her banned from treating patients with open wounds, although he falls short of revealing her secret. Jeanie's decision not to reveal her serostatus to her employers was the result of an encounter with a seropositive patient in the AIDS outpatient ward at County Hospital. The man, realizing Jeanie worked at the hospital, urged her to seek treatment for her HIV elsewhere, due to negative repercussions that may occur in the workplace. As a result of this, Jeanie is forced to pay for her HIV cocktail medication herself.

In addition to the professional and medical implications of Jeanie's health status, the romantic implications were also explored later on in season 3. Keenleyside comments, "[Jeanie's] quietly reluctant decision not to go out with the friend of a patient hits just the right tone, registering not only her disappointment at having to pass up this opportunity, but also her realization that she may never be able to accept another. The counterpart to this scene, provided by Benton's tantalizing encounter with his former girlfriend, Carla, drives home the pain of [Jeanie's] situation very powerfully, although a deeper look at the romantic challenges facing people with HIV would still be very much welcome."&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt;

==Storylines==
Jeanie Boulet was first introduced in season 1 as a recurring character. She was the physical therapist hired by Dr. [[Peter Benton]] to care for his aging mother.  Jeanie, who was married at the time, soon began a romantic relationship with Benton but things fizzled when she could not make a decision about her marriage.  She reappeared as a series regular a few episodes later in season 2, as a new physician assistant at the County General ER.  Toward the end of the season, her husband Al was admitted to the hospital and it was discovered that he had contracted [[HIV]].  Jeanie and Al had been separated since the beginning of the season, but he may have contracted the virus years earlier as he had slept with other women during the time they were married.

Jeanie got tested for HIV and urged Benton, her recent lover, to undergo testing as well.  In the season 3 premiere it was revealed that Benton did not have the virus; Jeanie, however, was HIV-positive.  Benton questioned whether Jeanie should still be working in the ER, but he later accepted that she would be able to take appropriate precautions and supported her decision to remain at County.  Later in the series, Jeanie and Peter actually became somewhat close, with Jeanie helping Peter cope with the realization that his son Reese was deaf.

During season three, Jeanie embarked on her first romantic relationship since her HIV diagnosis, with a doctor from Infectious Diseases named Greg Fischer.  However, during this time she also rekindles her closeness with Al and eventually Dr. Fischer breaks up with her upon finding out about the reunion.  Jeanie and Al move back in together and renew their relationship.  In season four, Al loses his job when an accident at the job site forces him to admit to his coworkers (and friends) that he is HIV positive.  Al gets another job in Atlanta during the 4th season and plans to move; Jeanie declines to join him, and they part ways once more. Al was never seen on the show again but Jeanie bitterly references him in Season 5 when she learns she has contracted Hepatitis C and is sure Al is responsible; however, when she goes off to confront him over the phone Al faxes her accurate medical records which show he does NOT have that illness (this helps explain in a much later-run return by Jeanie why she has specific and emotional information about what has happened to Al since then).

It is also at this time that Jeanie develops a strong friendship with [[Kerry Weaver]]. Jeanie had initially been afraid that Weaver might terminate her position at County if she found out about Jeanie's HIV status. This turned out not to be the case, and Weaver laid out restrictions under which Jeanie would be allowed to continue treating patients while HIV positive.  Kerry and Jeanie's friendship was tested when Kerry was forced to fire Jeanie for budgetary reasons.  Jeanie accused Kerry of trying to fire her over her HIV status, as Jeanie had been forced to break one of her workplace restrictions in order to treat a trauma patient earlier, and threatened to sue the hospital for discrimination.  Dr. Anspaugh gave Jeanie her job back to avoid the lawsuit, and Jeanie and Kerry eventually settled their difference.

In season four Jeanie becomes the part-time private care giver of Scott Anspaugh (portrayed by [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]]), the son of [[List of secondary doctors in ER#Donald Anspaugh|Dr. Donald Anspaugh]]. Scott is battling [[B-cell lymphoma]] and is battling depression. Only Jeanie seems to be able to raise his spirits and inspire hope in him. The two develop a strong friendship over a five episode arc which sadly ends in Scott's death.

Early in season six, Jeanie adopts an [[HIV|HIV positive]] baby boy called Carlos after his mother dies in the hospital, and marries a police officer named Reggie Moore.  She tries to stay on at County and parent her child, but eventually decides to leave County in order to spend more time with her family. The final episode Jeanie appeared in was the sixth episode of season six, which was entitled "The Peace of Wild Things" in November 1999. She left with a standing offer from Kerry Weaver to return to County and her old job.  However, she never returned to work at County.

In the Season 14 episode "Status Quo", Jeanie Boulet briefly returned to the ER after 8 years in January 2008 when her son Carlos suffers a head injury during [[Physical Education]] class. Initially it is believed that he is fine; however, a CT Scan revealed that he had a growth on his brain. This is customarily a sign that HIV infection has progressed into an AIDS condition. Boulet didn't find any of her old colleagues she knew (like her friend Dr. [[Kerry Weaver]]) working there anymore and was only identified by Nurses Haleh Adams and Chuny Marquez. After initially having difficulty adjusting to the changes in her former workplace she permitted full treatment and came to support the decisions of the new staff of the ER—including new Attending Dr. [[Gregory Pratt]] with whom she initially had difficulty agreeing. It was partly because of her return and inspiration that Dr. Pratt was convinced to continue his job at County, as he had earlier given his two weeks notice of resignation when the hospital board dismissed his efforts to take on a leadership role in the ER.

In the time between her last appearance and return Jeanie and her husband Reggie have undergone a [[Legal separation|separation]] and have [[joint custody]] of their son. Jeanie also remains a [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselor]] for young people with HIV Status.  Her clinics—one on the North side of Chicago and another on the South—have become her personal mission and her time-consuming commitment to them contributed to the end of her marriage. She reveals to Pratt that her son helps to drive her and her cause to help others with HIV infection and that she doesn't know how she will cope if he were to die. She also reveals that her ex-husband Al died two years earlier from his HIV/AIDS condition, severely emaciated to a weight of only 78 pounds and apparently demented as he was unable to even recognize her.

==Critical reception==
Jeanie Boulet's return to the series as a guest character in 2008 was well received by television critics. A reviewer from ''New York Entertainment'' commented that her return was like a "welcome throwback to the days when it seemed like every episode forced Jeanie to process some piece of world-shattering news." The return storyline was described as a "classic Jeanie Boulet moment, as filtered through the show's new blunt-instrument writers [...] it was like it was 1995 all over again." Discussing Reuben's portrayal of the character, the reviewer said, "There's always been great pleasure in Reuben's beautiful, open face in moments like that; she played those scenes to the hilt, creating in us a great sympathy for her character [...] We couldn't stand to watch her suffer so, but we couldn't stop watching her suffer, and we died a little with every hurt the producers hit her with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/no_one_suffers_like_jeanie_bou.html|title= ‘ER’: No One Suffers Like Jeanie Boulet|publisher=''New York Entertainment'' | date = 2008-01-04| accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the program-makers' decision to give Jeanie HIV was an attempt to draw attention to the illness to the [[black (people)|black]] community, particularly black women.&lt;ref name="alias"&gt;{{cite book |author= Stacey Abbott, Simon Brown|title= Investigating Alias: Secrets and Spies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2l4SArs1z3kC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=Jeanie+Boulet+ER#PPA110,M1|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris Publishers|isbn=1-84511-405-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeanie — like the majority of female AIDS cases in America at the time in 1997 — was black, heterosexual, and acquired HIV from a long-term partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Nancy Goldstone, Nancy Goldstein and Jennifer L. Manlowe|title=The Gender Politics of HIV/AIDS in Women|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-3093-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been noted that some viewers may have been offended that out of all the sexually active characters in their serial, Jeanie — whose private life had not been extensively portrayed at that point — contracted the virus.&lt;ref name="alias"/&gt;

Aspects of the HIV storyline have been criticized, specifically that little airtime was dedicated to dramatizing clinical procedures determining whether Jeanie had been exposed to HIV. When Jeanie discovered that her husband had AIDS in the second season finale, Jeanie has a blood test and sends it off for analysis to see if she also had the virus; however, viewers were not shown the multiple clinical procedures involved in the testing, and the following episodes concentrated on post-test rituals.&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Janine Marchessault]], Kim Sawchuk|title= Wild Science: Reading Feminism, Medicine and the Media|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=skTkq9R5LscC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=jeanie+HIV#PPA146,M1|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-20430-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamel Ouali''' (born 15 December 1971) is a [[France|French]]-[[Algeria]]n choreographer.

==Biography==
Kamel Ouali was born in [[Paris]]. He is from an [[Algeria]]n Kabyle family of twelve children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrj.fr/artistes/kamel-ouali|title=Kamel Ouali: biographie, dernières news et clips - NRJ.fr|website=NRJ.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he was spotted by Angela Lorente of [[TF1]] and by Cédric Naimi. He appeared in 1989 in JOKER Promotion and in "French Kiss" (Happy Music/Sony) and in 1990 joined the Latino Party group accompanying [[Sylvie Vartan]] in her shows at [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] in Paris in January and February 1991.

Kamel Ouali also appeared on very high-profile music videos, notably in [[Cheb Khaled]]'s "Chebba" (1993) and in [[Takfarinas]] hit "Zaama Zaama".

He is a dance teacher at the Dance Academy of [[Paris]] and at the Conservatories of La Courneuve and Saint Denis.

He took part in some French musicals like ''[[Les Dix Commandements (musical)|Les Dix Commandements]]'' (French 2000 production of The [[Ten Commandments]]) as choreographer of the show and in ''Autant en Emporte le Vent'' (French Gerard Presgurvic 2003 adaptation of [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'') with staging and choreography by Ouali.

In September 2005 he created his own debut musical, produced by [[Dove Attia]] and [[Albert Cohen (producer)|Albert Cohen]], ''[[Le Roi Soleil (musical)|Le Roi Soleil]]'' (The [[Sun King]]). The same year, he was the choreographer of ''Dances with Robots'' for the French [[theme park]] [[Futuroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gala.fr/stars_et_gotha/kamel_ouali|title=Kamel Ouali - La biographie de Kamel Ouali avec Gala.fr|last=Média|first=Prisma|website=Gala.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show opened on 5 April 2006.

In 2009 he worked on the musical ''Cléopâtre, la dernière reine d'Égypte'' ([[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], Last Queen of Egypt).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lejdd.fr/JDD-Paris/Actualite/Cleopatre-entre-en-Seine-81059/ Le JDD.com: Cléopâtre entre en Seine]&lt;/ref&gt; with lead role by [[Sofia Essaïdi]].

It was considered a first as it portrayed the two lead characters Dracula and Mina in non-singing and uniquely dancing roles.

==In popular culture==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9131">'''Lynn DeJac Peters''' (November 20, 1963 – June 18, 2014) was an American woman from [[Buffalo, New York]], who spent 13 years in prison for the murder of her daughter before her conviction was vacated in 2007, making her the first woman to be exonerated of murder on the basis of [[DNA evidence]]. She successfully sued the state of New York for wrongful conviction.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bovsun|first1=Mara|title=Mom wrongly jailed in daughter's death|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/mom-wrongly-jailed-daughter-death-article-1.1847291|accessdate=June 8, 2017|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Crystallynn Girard==

DeJac's daughter Crystallynn Girard, 13, died near midnight on February 13, 1993, or in the early hours of February 14. She was found naked on her bed and medical examiner ruled that she had been strangled. Crystallynn had cocaine in her system, but the medical examiner determined it was not enough to kill her.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt;

The night of Crystallynn's death, DeJac and her boyfriend of two months, Dennis Donohue, went to a bar and had a large fight, after DeJac discovered he had paid someone to have her followed. DeJac told the police that Donohue had stalked her and murdered her daughter.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Carolyn|title=Teen dead, Mom jailed, but something isn't right|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/27/news/adna-mystery27|accessdate=June 8, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another man, Wayne Hudson, who had a history of criminal offenses, claimed that DeJac confessed to him that she had murdered her daughter. Donohue was given immunity to testify against DeJac after he passed a [[polygraph test]]. During the trial, prosecutors attacked DeJac's troubled past, which included having Crystallynn when she was just 16, promiscuity and a drinking problem.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1192007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staba|first1=David|title=DNA Evidence Frees a Woman Convicted of Killing Her Daughter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/nyregion/29mother.html|accessdate=June 8, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994, DeJac was convicted of second-degree murder for her daughter's death and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. According to her lawyer, she had been convicted of the murder of her daughter based primarily on evidence from a neighbor who claimed DeJac had confessed the murder. There was no physical or forensic evidence implicating DeJac. DeJac was pregnant with twin boys during the trial and gave birth in jail, and later married their father, Chuck Peters, while still in prison. Prison officials did not allow her any visitation with her newborn children because she continued to proclaim her innocence.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt;

DeJac caught a break when Detective Dennis Delano moved to the Buffalo homicide division and began investigating cold cases. He reviewed the unsolved case of Joan Giambra, who in September 1993 was murdered and her 11-year-old daughter nearly killed, strangled and left for dead on top of her mother's body. Another cold case, the 1975 murder of Carol Reed, was also similar. Like Crystallynn, Reed and Giambra were found naked on their backs, strangled. Additionally, all three were connected to Donohue.  Donohue and Reed lived in the same apartment building at the time of her death in 1975, and Giambra had casually dated Donohue before breaking up with him shortly before her murder.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="third"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esmonde|first1=Donn|title=On third try, justice system gets Donohue|url=http://buffalonews.com/2008/05/14/on-third-try-justice-system-gets-donohue/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|work=The Buffalo News|date=May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hudson recanted his testimony that DeJac had confessed to Crystallynn's murder, but he was seen as an unreliable witness. At the same time, however, new forensic analysis revealed the presence of Donohue's DNA at the crime scenes for both Crystallynn and Giambra.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warner|first1=Gene|title=DeJac, absent but 'happy,' awaits her fate After 2 sides argue, judge to decide next week on request for new trial|url=http://buffalonews.com/2007/11/20/dejac-absent-but-happy-awaits-her-fate-after-2-sides-argue-judge-to-decide-next-week-on-request-for-new-trial/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|work=The Buffalo News|date=November 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osorio|first1=Sharon|title=Families of DeJac and Murder-Victim Joan Giambra Share an Eerie Connection.|url=http://www.wkbw.com/news/local/11903466.html|accessdate=June 8, 2017|publisher=WKBW|date=July 9, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718072727/http://www.wkbw.com/news/local/11903466.html|archivedate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2007, DeJac conviction was overturned based on the physical evidence linking the murder to Dennis Donohue. Donohue cannot be tried for the death of Crystallynn Girard, however, as he was granted immunity at her trial. In September 2007, he was arrested for Giambra's murder, 13 years after her death.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt; In May 2008, a jury took only six hours to convict him for Giambra's murder. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.&lt;ref name="third"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman sues over wrongful murder conviction|url=http://www.upi.com/Woman-sues-over-wrongful-murder-conviction/74441290706216/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=UPI|date=November 25, 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Innocence Project]], DeJac is the first woman to be exonerated of murdering someone on the basis of DNA evidence. A previous case had involved the reversal of the conviction of Paula Grey, who had been convicted as an accomplice to murder, but was cleared when the conviction of the principals was reversed.&lt;ref name="nytimes1192007"/&gt;

Nevertheless the  [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] prosecutor was quoted as saying he planned to retry DeJac for second-degree [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wivb.com/Global/story.asp?S=7424496 Live Interview with Lynn Dejac &amp; What's Next] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130230058/http://www.wivb.com/Global/story.asp?S=7424496 |date=2007-11-30 }}, WIVB.com; accessed May 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the prosecutor dropped the case after consulting with a new forensic pathologist, who announced that Crystallynn had died of a cocaine overdose. Both Detective Delano and DeJac were outraged and insisted that Crystallynn was murdered by Donohue, and that the trace amounts of cocaine found could have been transferred by Donohue during her murder. "My daughter was murdered," DeJac said. "There's no question my daughter was murdered."&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt; &lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

DeJac's lawyer, Steven M. Cohen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganwillig.com/content/pages/steven-m-cohen|title=Steven M. Cohen website|publisher=HoganWillig|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; represented DeJac in her civil suit against the state of New York and secured a $2.7 million settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/13/lynn-dejac-peters_n_2122595.html|title=Lynn DeJac Peters, NY Woman, To Get $2.7 Million For Wrongful Conviction|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Carolyn|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-woman-get-27m-wrongful-conviction|title=NY woman to get $2.7M for wrongful conviction|publisher=Bigstory.ap.org|date=2012-11-13|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also filed a $30 million federal lawsuit against Erie County and the city of Buffalo. A journalist for ''The Buffalo News'' commented, "The district attorney's office — in a monumental blunder — granted lifetime immunity to Donohue, who should have been a prime suspect. Instead, DeJac was arrested, convicted and wrongfully imprisoned for 14 years in her daughter's strangulation."&lt;ref name="third"/&gt;

==Death==
One month after DeJac received her $2.7 million settlement, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. On June 18, 2014, DeJac died at her home in Buffalo, aged 50. She was survived by her husband and three children. According to her attorney and family, the federal lawsuit Erie County and the city of Buffalo is going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carolyn Thompson|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2014/06/19/lynn-dejac-peters-wrongly-convicted-daughter-death-dies/AIGDKf78eWah0q1TwoidIL/story.html|title=Lynn DeJac Peters, wrongly convicted of daughter's death, dies at 50|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=2014-06-20|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mahmud Kanti Bello was born on 14 January 1945, and is of [[Hausa people|Hausa]] origin. He received a Bachelor of Engineering degree from [[Ahmadu Bello University]] in [[Zaria]], [[Kaduna State]] in Northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name=nassnig/&gt;

==Career==
[[image:NigeriaKatsina.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Katsina State]] in [[Nigeria]]]]
Mahmud Kanti Bello was elected as a [[Katsina]] senator in 2003 on the [[All Nigeria Peoples Party]] (ANPP) platform. In the 2004 local elections in his state, he protested strongly against electoral fraud which resulted in [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP) candidates being returned. However, in 2007 he successfully ran for reelection on a PDP slate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In a statement in January 2009, Bello lashed out against governors who withhold local government funds, releasing them only at their convenience, including the governor of his state, [[Ibrahim Shema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2009, South-South senators initiated a motion to demand dismissal of Minister of Petroleum, [[Rilwan Lukman]], and [[Mohammed Barkindo]] of the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]], on the basis of alleged anti-Niger Delta policies. Senator Bello opposed the motion on a point of order, without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2009, Bello was the Nigerian Amir-Hajj for the Nigerian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. He broke a record where for the first time in over 20 years all the pilgrims left on time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/sen-mahmud-kanti-bello-buried-katsina/|title=Sen.

'''Mamed Khalidov''' ({{lang-rus|Мамед Магомедович Халидов|Mamied Magomedowicz Chalidow|mɐˈmʲɛt maɣɔmʲɛdɔvʲit͡ʂ xɐˈlʲidəf}}; {{lang-pl|Mamed Chalidow}} {{IPA-pl|ˈmamɛt xaˈlidɔf|}}; born 17 July 1980 in [[Grozny]]) is a Russian-born Polish retired [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] of [[Chechens|Chechen]] ethnicity. He is best known for competing in the [[Middleweight (MMA)|Middleweight]] division of Polish MMA promotion [[Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki|KSW]]. He is a former [[Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki#Middleweight Championship|KSW Middleweight Champion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightmatrix.com/mma-ranks/middleweight/|title=Fight Matrix - Current MMA Rankings »    Middleweight|website=www.fightmatrix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mamed Khalidov was born in [[Chechnya]], [[Russia]]. He began practicing [[Kyokushin]] around age of 12 or 13 where he also holds black belt in. At age of 17 he fled from his homeland to [[Poland]] and continued practicing kyokushin while adding other combat styles on his repertoire such as [[Taekwondo]], [[Shotokan]] [[Wrestling]] and [[Boxing]] soon after his arrival. He also became competitive in all sports. Later he also became interested about becoming mixed martial artist and went training [[Mixed martial arts]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Combat Sambo]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] and [[Grappling]].

==Mixed martial arts career==
As of December 2011, Khalidov has fought eleven times under the KSW banner, though never featuring in a tournament, instead fighting individually such opponents as Daniel Tabera and [[Matt Lindland]].

Khalidov made his US debut with [[EliteXC]] on their October 10, 2008 [[ShoXC]] card against American [[Jason Guida]].&lt;ref name="EliteXC adds Miller, Lapsley, Beerbohm, Khalidov to Oct. 10 ShoXC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/5314/elitexc-adds-miller-lapsley-beerbohm-khalid-to-oct-10-shoxc.mma|title=EliteXC adds Miller, Lapsley, Beerbohm, Khalidov to Oct. 10 ShoXC|accessdate=2008-09-21|publisher=Mmajunkie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After almost two hard-fought rounds, Khalidov stopped Guida on the feet with an unanswered torrent of punches.

Following the collapse of EliteXC, Khalidov has expressed interest in a hasty return to KSW, as previously outlined by his signing with ProElite in favor of nonexclusive contract status.  Due to a broken hand, Khalidov was unable to return for KSW X on December 12, 2008.  Following his recovery, he fought [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] veteran [[Daniel Acacio]] at KSW XI on 15 May, knocking him out in 1:10 minutes of the first round to win the newly created KSW Light Heavyweight Championship.

Khalidov signed a three-fight deal with World Victory Road Sengoku and his first appearance for the promotion was on the November 7th card against Sengoku middleweight champion [[Jorge Santiago]].  Although, the fight was not a title bout,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmajunkie.com/news/16478/jorge-santiago-to-face-mamed-khalidov-in-sengoku-11th-battle-non-title-affair.mma ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016053407/http://mmajunkie.com/news/16478/jorge-santiago-to-face-mamed-khalidov-in-sengoku-11th-battle-non-title-affair.mma |date=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalidov defeated Santiago via first-round TKO. A rematch of the bout was held at World Victory Road Presents: Sengoku Raiden Championships 12 on March 7, 2010 for the [[List of Sengoku champions#Middleweight Championship|Middleweight Championship]], which Khalidov lost via controversial unanimous decision.

At KSW XIII Mamed fought [[Ryuta Sakurai]] to a draw. Sakurai secured a kimura early in the first round, but Khalidov escaped. During the rest of the fight he had 6 submission attempts including 4 guillotine chokes, 1 ankle lock and 1 heel hook, but couldn't force the tap from Sakurai.

Mamed Khalidov was expected to face [[Thales Leites]] and later [[Matt Lindland]] at KSW XV&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmaheadliner.com/.../former-ufc-thales-leites-may-replace-lindland-vs-khalidov-at-ksw-15]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629011135/http://www.mmaheadliner.com/.../former-ufc-thales-leites-may-replace-lindland-vs-khalidov-at-ksw-15 |date=June 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, both fighters were pulled from the card. Instead, Khalidov faced [[James Irvin (fighter)|James Irvin]] at the event and won via submission at 0:33 into the first round.  He eventually faced Lindland at KSW 16 in May 2011 and won via submission in the first round.

Khalidov was originally scheduled to face [[Paulo Filho]] at KSW 17. However, Filho was forced out of the bout due to him going into rehab for a drug addiction and he was replaced by [[Jesse Taylor]]. Khalidov won the fight via submission (kneebar) in the first round.

Khalidov next competed against former UFC fighter [[Rodney Wallace (fighter)|Rodney Wallace]] on May 12, 2012 at KSW 19.  He won the fight via KO in the first round.

On December 1, 2012 he defeated [[Kendall Grove]] and won the fight via submission (achilles lock). Khalidov next faced Melvin Manhoef at KSW 23 on June 8, 2013, winning the fight by front choke in the first round.

On July 30, 2018 it was announced that Khalidov had vacated his middleweight championship belt in order to pursue a rematch against KSW Light Heavyweight champion [[Tomasz Narkun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/7/30/17628724/mamed-khalidov-vacates-ksw-middleweight-title-four-man-tournament-set-to-crown-new-champion|title=Mamed Khalidov vacates KSW middleweight title, four-man tournament set to crown new champion|author=Shaun al-Shatti|publisher=mmafighting.com|date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 2018, it was announced that the rematch will happen at [[2018 in Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki#KSW 46: Narkun vs. Khalidov 2|KSW 46: Narkun vs. Khalidov 2]] on December 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Mamed-Khalidov-Tomasz-Narkun-Scheduled-for-Rematch-at-KSW-46-on-Dec-1-143665|title=Mamed Khalidov, Tomasz Narkun Scheduled for Rematch at KSW 46 on Dec. 1|author=Tudor Leonte|date=October 9, 2018|publisher=sherdog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalidov lost the rematch via unanimous decision and retired from the sport in the cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/12/1/18121447/ksw-46-results-mamed-khalidov-retires-following-second-loss-to-tomasz-narkun|title=KSW 46 results: Mamed Khalidov retires following second loss to Tomasz Narkun|author=Peter Carroll|date=December 1, 2018|publisher=mmafighting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied art at [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]],
{{when|date=January 2017}} [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]],{{when|date=January 2017}} and the [[University of Munich]],{{when|date=January 2017}} and afterward worked in advertising. In 1935 she left Germany for [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil to escape [[Nazism]] – and to meet Hans Reyersbach, a salesman and another German Jew from Hamburg, who had been a family friend.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt; They married in 1935 and moved to [[Paris, France]], in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meister, Carol|title= H. A. Rey |year=2001 |isbn=1-57765-481-1 |oclc=45413500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbpgELqGhb4C&amp;pg=PA12 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Paris, Hans's animal drawings came to the attention of French publisher, who commissioned him to write a children's book. The result, ''[[Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys]]'', is little remembered today, but one of its characters, an adorably impish [[monkey]] named [[Curious George]], was such a success that the couple considered writing a book just about him. Their work was interrupted with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. As [[Jew]]s, the Reys decided to flee Paris before the Nazis seized the city. Hans built two bicycles, and they fled Paris just a few hours before it fell. Among the meager possessions they brought with them was the illustrated manuscript of ''Curious George''.

The Reys' odyssey brought them to the [[Spain|Spanish]] border, where they bought train tickets to [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]]. From there they returned to Brazil, where they had met five years earlier, but this time they continued to [[New York City]]. The books were published by 
Houghton Mifflin in 1941, though certain changes had to be introduced because of the technology of the time. Hans and Margret originally planned to use watercolors to illustrate the books, but since they were responsible for the color separation, he changed these to the cartoon-like images that continue to feature in each of the books. (A collector's edition with the original watercolors was released in 1998.)&lt;ref name="watercolors"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Original Curious George|author=H.A. Rey

|publisher=HMH Books| edition=Collector's|year=1998
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8E8cKIcVwkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Curious George'' was an instant success, and the Reys were commissioned to write more adventures of the mischievous monkey and his friend, the Man with the Yellow Hat. They wrote seven stories in all, with Hans mainly doing the illustrations and Margret working mostly on the stories, though they both admitted to sharing the work and cooperating fully in every stage of development. At first, however, Margret's name was left off the cover, ostensibly because there was a glut of women already writing children's fiction. In later editions, this was corrected, and Margret now receives full credit for her role in developing the stories.

Margret and her husband moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1963, in a house close to [[Harvard Square]]. Following her husband's death in 1977, Margret continued writing, and in 1979 she became a Professor of Creative Writing at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. From 1980 she collaborated with [[Alan Shalleck]] on a series of short films featuring Curious George and on more than two dozen additional books.

In 1989 Margret Rey established the Curious George Foundation to help creative children and prevent cruelty to animals. In 1996, she made major donations to the [[Boston Public Library]] and [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]]. She was also a long-time supporter of the [[Longy School of Music]].

Rey died of a [[heart attack]] on December 21, 1996.

==Collected papers==

The [[de Grummond Children's Literature Collection]] in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, holds more than 300 boxes of Rey papers dated 1973 to 2002.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt;

Dr. Lena Y. de Grummond, a professor in the field of library science at [[The University of Southern Mississippi]], contacted the Reys in 1966 about USM's new children's literature collection. H.&amp;nbsp;A. and Margret donated a pair of sketches at the time. When Margret Rey died in 1996, her will designated that the entire literary estate&lt;!-- and more, evidently --&gt; of the Reys would be donated to the de Grummond Collection.

'''Mazdak''' ({{lang-fa|مزدک}}, [[Middle Persian]]: 𐭬𐭦𐭣𐭪, also '''Mazdak the Younger'''; died c. 524 or 528) was a [[Zoroastrian]] ''[[mobad]]'' (priest), [[Iran]]ian reformer, prophet and religious activist who gained influence during the reign of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] emperor [[Kavadh I]]. He claimed to be a prophet of [[Ahura Mazda]] and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs. He has been seen as a [[socialism|proto-socialist]].&lt;ref name="Manfred"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Manfred, Albert Zakharovich|year=1974|title=A Short History of the World|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|volume=1|page=182|others=(translated into English by Katherine Judelson)|oclc=1159025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mazdakism==
Mazdak was the chief representative of a religious and philosophical teaching called Mazdakism,  which he viewed as a reformed and purified version of [[Zoroastrianism]],&lt;ref name="ya56"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Yarshater, Ehsan|year=1983|title=Cambridge history of Iran The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods|volume=2|pages=995&amp;ndash;997|isbn=978-0-521-24693-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cosmo&gt;[http://azargoshnasp.net/famous/babak_khorramdin/teachingsmazdakshaki.pdf Shaki, Mansour. 1985. The cosmogonical and cosmological teachings of Mazdak.] Papers in Honour of Professor Mary Boyce, Acta Iranica 25, Leiden, 1985, pp. 527–43.&lt;/ref&gt; although his teaching has been argued to display influences from [[Manichaeism]] as well.&lt;ref name="ya56"/&gt; Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion of Sassanid Persia, and Mazdak himself was a [[mobad]] or Zoroastrian priest, but most of the clergy regarded his teaching as [[heresy]]. Information about it is scarce and details are sketchy, but some further details may be inferred from the later doctrine of the [[Khurramites]], which has been seen as a continuation of Mazdakism.&lt;ref name="ya56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shaki, Mansour|year=1978|title=The social doctrine of Mazdak in the light of middle Persian evidence|journal=Archív Orientálni|volume=46|issue=4|pages=289&amp;ndash;306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Some sources claim that the original founders of this sect lived earlier than Mazdak. These were another mobad, [[Zaradust-e Khuragen]]&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Esposito, John L.|authorlink=John Esposito|year=2003|chapter=Mazdakism|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=198|isbn=978-0-19-512558-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (distinct from the founder of Zoroastrianism, [[Zoroaster]], Middle Persian ''Zardusht'') and/or a Zoroastrian philosopher known as Mazdak the Elder, who taught a combination of [[altruism]] and [[hedonism]]: "he directed his followers to enjoy the pleasures of life and satisfy their appetite in the highest degree with regard to eating and drinking in the spirit of equality, to aim at good deeds; to abstain from shedding blood and inflicting harm on others; and to practise hospitality without reservation".&lt;ref name="ya56" /&gt; This doctrine was further developed by the much better-known Mazdak the Younger, son of Bāmdād.

At later stages the conservative Zoroastrian opposition accused Mazdak's followers of heresy and with abhorrent practices such as the sharing of women, for which scholars have found no evidence. Mazdak's followers are considered to be the first real socialists in human history by their emphasis on community property and community work with benefits accruing to all.&lt;ref name="Manfred" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wherry, Rev. E. M.|year=1882|title=A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran comprising Sale's translation and Preliminary Discourse|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ushAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 66]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological tenets===
Like both Zoroastrianism (at least as practised at the time) and [[Manichaeism]], Mazdakism had a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] [[religious cosmology|cosmology]] and worldview.&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; This doctrine taught that there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, tainting everything except God. Light is characterized by knowledge and feeling, and acts by design and free will, whereas Darkness is ignorant and blind, and acts at random. Mankind's role in this life was, through good conduct, to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. But where Manichaeism saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.

In addition, Mazdakism is reported, in one late work, to have distinguished three elements (Fire, Water, Earth), and four Powers (Discernment, Understanding, Preservation and Joy, corresponding to the four chief officials of the Sassanid state &amp;ndash; the Chief Mobad (''Mobadan Mobad''), the Chief [[Herbad]], the Commander of the Army and the Entertainment Master), seven Viziers and twelve Spiritual Forces. When the Four, the Seven and the Twelve were united in a human being, he was no longer subject to religious duties. In addition, God was believed to rule the world through letters, which held the key to the Great Secret that should be learned. This description suggests that Mazdakism was, in many ways, a typical [[Gnosticism|Gnostic sect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=1007&amp;ndash;1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical and social principles===
Two distinguishing factors of Mazdak's teaching were the reduction of the importance of religious formalities—the true religious person being the one who understood and related correctly to the principles of the universe—and a criticism of the strong position of mainstream clergy, who, he believed, had oppressed the Persian population and caused much poverty.

Mazdak emphasised good conduct, which involved a moral and ascetic life, no killing and [[vegetarianism]] (considering meat to contain substances derived solely from Darkness), being kind and friendly and living in peace with other people.

In many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social [[revolution]], and has been referred to as early "[[communism]]".&lt;ref name="Quran" /&gt; He and his followers were also advocates of [[free love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rehatsek|first1=Edward|authorlink1=Edward Rehatsek|title=Christianity in the Persian Dominions, from its beginning till the fall of the Sasanian dynasty|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay|date=1 January 1878|volume=13|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7aRSFhKUrgC&amp;pg=PA75|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bombay.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mazdak, God had originally placed the means of subsistence on earth so that people should divide them among themselves equally, but the strong had coerced the weak, seeking domination and causing the contemporary inequality. This in turn empowered the "Five Demons" that turned men from Righteousness – these were Envy, Wrath, Vengeance, Need and Greed. To prevail over these evils, justice had to be restored and everybody should share excess possessions with his fellow men. Mazdak allegedly planned to achieve this by making all wealth common or by re-distributing the excess,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crone, Patricia|year=1991|title=Kavad’s Heresy and Mazdak’s Revolt|journal=Iran (Journal of Persian Studies)|publisher=British Institute of Persian Studies|volume=29|pages=21–40|url=http://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Mazdak.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unclear how he intended to organize that in terms of regulations and to what extent his position has been caricatured by hostile sources.&lt;ref name=ya1000&gt;{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=999&amp;ndash;1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostile sources mostly dwell on the alleged "sharing" of women, the resulting sexual [[promiscuity]] and the confusion of the [[line of descent]]. Since the latter is a standard accusation against heretical sects, its veracity has been doubted by researchers; it is likely that Mazdak took measures against the widespread [[polygamy]] of the rich and lack of wives for the poor.&lt;ref name=ya1000 /&gt;

==Followers==
Mazdak's teaching acquired many followers, to the point when even King [[Kavadh I]], ruling from 488 until 531, converted to Mazdakism. He also reportedly sponsored its adoption by the Arab vassal kingdom of [[al-Hirah]], entailing the deposing of the previous king al-Mundhir by the [[Kindah|Kindite]] chief al-Harith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Yarshater, Ehsan|chapter=The Persian presence in the Islamic world|editor=Hovannisian, Richard G. |editor2=Sabagh, Georges|year=1998|title=The Persian Presence in the Islamic World|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=4&amp;ndash;125, [https://books.google.com/books?id=39XZDnOWUXsC&amp;pg=PA28 page 28]|isbn=978-0-521-59185-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanam, R. 2005. Encyclopaedic ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia: A–I: Volume 1. P.441&lt;/ref&gt;

With the King's backing Mazdak could embark on a program of social reform, which involved pacifism, [[anti-clericalism]] and aid programs for helping the [[poverty|poor]]. Mazdak had government warehouses opened to help the poor. He also had all the Zoroastrian fire temples closed except the three major ones.

==Opposition to and purge of Mazdak's adherents==
Fear among the [[nobility]] and Zoroastrian clergy grew so strong that King Kavadh was overthrown in 496, but he managed to regain the throne three years later with the help of the [[Hephthalite Empire]].
Scared by the resistance among the powerful, he chose to distance himself from Mazdak. He allowed [[Anushiravan]] to launch a campaign against the Mazdakites in 524 or 528, culminating in a massacre of most of the adherents – including Mazdak himself – and restoring orthodox Zoroastrianism as the state religion.&lt;ref name="Quran" /&gt; Various fictionalized accounts&lt;ref name=yarfict&gt;{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|page=994}}&lt;/ref&gt; specify the manner of execution: for example, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' states that 3000 Mazdakites were buried alive with the feet upwards in order to present Mazdak with the spectacle of a "human garden", whereas Mazdak himself was hanged upside down and shot with countless arrows; other stories specify other torturous methods of execution. Anushiravan then proceeded to implement his own far-reaching social and administrative reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|page=1022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mazdakite ruler of al-Hirah was also overthrown{{by whom|date=July 2016}} and the previous king restored to power.

==Jewish tradition==
A Jewish tradition relates a slightly different story. The [[Exilarch]] of Babylon, [[Mar-Zutra II]], rallied the Jewish community and their allies, who defeated Mazdak and established an independent Jewish kingdom in [[Mahoza]] that lasted for seven years&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
(495–502).

==Legacy==
A few Mazdakis survived, and settled in remote areas. Small pockets of Mazdakite societies are said to have survived for centuries after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. Their doctrines probably mixed with radical currents of [[Shia Islam]], influencing them and giving rise to later powerful revolutionary-religious movements in the region. The cult of [[al-Muqanna|al-Muqanna‘]], who claimed to be the incarnation of God and had followers among the Mubaiyyidah sect of Zoroastrianism and even some Turks, upheld the laws and institutes of Mazdak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.iium.edu.my/intdiscourse/index.php/islam/article/viewFile/252/234 Al-Bīrūnī: Father of Comparative Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th century, the [[Khurramites]], an egalitarian religious sect possibly originating from Mazdakism, led a revolt under the leadership of [[Babak Khorramdin]] against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and successfully defended large territories against the Caliphate's forces for some twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=1003&amp;ndash;1004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Batiniyya]], [[Qarmatians]] and other later revolutionary currents of Islam may also be connected to Mazdakism and were often equated with it by contemporary authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=1022&amp;ndash;1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish scholar Abdülbâkî Gölpınarlı sees even the [[Qizilbash]] of the 16th century – a radical Shi'i movement in Persia which helped the [[Safaviyya]] establish [[Twelver]] Islam as the dominant religion of Iran – as "spiritual descendants of the [[Khurramites]]" and, hence, of the Mazdakites.&lt;ref name="S-G"&gt;Roger M. Savory ''(ref. Abdülbâkî Gölpınarlı),'' [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], "[[Kizilbash|Kizil-Bash]]", Online Edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt; "Mazdakist" eventually seems to have become a standard derogative label attached by pre-modern Persian and Arabic authors to any radical egalitarian movement in subsequent Iranian history.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan David. 2007. The Mongols. p.&amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; While medieval Muslim historiography primarily focused on the "socialist" aspects of Mazdak, Zoroastrian tradition, on the other hand, remembers Mazdak above all as a dangerous heretic and enemy of the true faith (''[[Zand-i Wahman yasn]]'' 2:1), a threat comparable to [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] and [[Muhammad]] (''[[Denkard]]'' 3:345).

The author of the ''[[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]'', writing as late as the 17th century, claims to have met individual adherents of Mazdakism who practised their religion secretly among the Muslims and preserved the ''Desnad'', a book in [[Middle Persian]] containing the teachings of Mazdak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avesta.org/dhalla/history5.htm M.N. Dhalla: History of Zoroastrianism (1938), part 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D15501050%26ct%3D0 Dabestan-e Mazaheb]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pageantry==
===Česká Miss 2012===
Nikola first tried her luck in the world of pageantry via Česká Miss but she was unplaced.&lt;ref name=Model&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Česká Miss 2014===
Nikola once again tried to become a beauty queen again at Česká Miss. But this time, she won the internet votes that gave her the right to earn the title of Blesk Česka Miss Earth 2014. Weeks before the finals night, Nikola suffered from her injured foot where she got while they were in [[Mauritius]].

By winning Miss Earth Czech Republic, Nikola flew to the [[Philippines]] in November to compete with almost 100 other candidates to be [[Alyz Henrich]]'s&lt;ref name=miss1&gt;{{cite news|last=Blanco|first=Eunice|title=Alyz Henrich of Venezuela is Miss Earth 2013|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2013/12/07/1265550/alyz-henrich-venezuela-miss-earth-2013|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miss2&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Venezuela's Alyz Henrich wins Miss Earth 2013|url=http://lifestyle.in.msn.com/fashion/venezuelas-alyz-henrich-wins-miss-earth-2013-1|accessdate=9 December 2013|newspaper=[[MSN]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; successor as [[Miss Earth]].

As a Miss Earth delegate, an environmental advocacy is must. When she was asked about her advocacy for the pageant, she answered, "For a cleaner and healthier world, I'm willing to give up everything that negatively affects the environment – I personally use public transport, which certainly promotes healthier air in the city where I live." Nikola also added, "Ecological lifestyle means for me regular waste management, use of public transport, limiting the use of household chemicals when cleaning, organic food shopping in specialty stores or at farmers markets."

When she was asked about what to promote in her country, [[Czech Republic]], Nikola answered her country's architecture and history. Nikola also said that Czech Republic is surrounded by "...mountains, nature preserves and national parks." She also mentioned about her people's kind hearts and traditions that they love to show to all people from different walks of life. 

At the conclusion of the pageant, she was unplaced. The [[Miss Earth 2014]] title was won by [[Jamie Herrell]] of the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=me2014a&gt;{{cite news|last=Locsin|first=Joel|title=Pinay bags Miss Earth 2014 title|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/390377/lifestyle/peopleandevents/pinay-bags-miss-earth-2014-title|accessdate=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[GMA Network]]|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=me2014b&gt;{{cite news|last= Жигарева|first=Гертруда |title=Россиянка получила титул "Мисс огонь" на конкурсе "Мисс Земля" (in Russian)|url=http://www.mk.ru/social/2014/11/30/rossiyanka-poluchila-titul-miss-ogon-na-konkurse-miss-zemlya.html|accessdate=30 November 2014|newspaper=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=me2014c&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Miss Earth 2014 Crown Goes To Miss Philippines|url=http://www.travelerstoday.com/articles/15107/20141129/miss-earth-2014-crown-goes-philippines.htm|accessdate=29 November 2014|newspaper=Travelers Today|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left school aged 14 or 15 and obtained employment at a clothes stall, later moving on to teach cooking lessons at his local soup kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verita.net/?mode=download&amp;file_id=60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1987 Peter Bryan lived in the Flying Angel, Custom House, [[East London]]. It was here that he attempted to throw another resident from his sixth floor window. There was a struggle and his intended victim escaped, leaving Bryan with a deep gash to the head. The initial attack by Bryan was totally unprovoked. The victim was questioned by the police about the gash on Bryan's head but no further action was taken by the police against the victim or Bryan. 
He was later sent to [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] in 1994 after admitting the unlawful killing of 20-year-old shop assistant Nisha Sheth, who was beaten to death with a hammer in 1993. By February 2001 the nursing staff thought he had made considerable progress in regard to his "behaviour, attitude, maturity, relationships, anger and insight." Bryan was transferred from Rampton in June 2001 to the John Howard Centre after a six-month trial leave project agreed by the [[Home Office]]. He was released into the care of a psychiatrist and social worker.&lt;ref name="nydailyNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2009/09/03/2009-09-03_series_of_blunders_frees_cannibal_peter_bryan.html|title=Series of blunders frees schizophrenic cannibal Peter Bryan, who kills 2 more people|last=Hazlett|first=Alexandra|date=3 September 2009|publisher=NY Daily News|accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After applying to a Mental Health Review Tribunal in 2002, he was moved to the Riverside Hostel in north London where he was allowed door keys and could come and go as he pleased. Psychiatrists and social workers were remarking that there had been a "continued improvement" in his behaviour.
In October 2003 psychiatrists noted there had been "a continued improvement in his mental state" and talked of plans for a move to more independent accommodation.
In November 2003 his mental health social worker wrote to the Home Office stating that matters had settled down and there were no further concerns. It was thought that he "did not present any major risks."

In January 2004 social workers applied for the transfer of Bryan to "low–support accommodation"; instead, Bryan was transferred to an open psychiatric ward at [[Newham General Hospital]] for his safety after allegations that he had indecently assaulted a 16-year-old girl close to the hostel.
In February 2004 he walked out of the mental health unit in [[Newham]], East London, and killed friend Brian Cherry.
Police were called after neighbours heard screams, and weapons, including a hammer, were found strewn around the flat. When police caught up with him, he was cooking the dead man's brain in a frying pan.

Bryan was remanded to [[Broadmoor Hospital]] after appearing in court over Mr Cherry's death. Two months later, while on remand in Broadmoor, Bryan killed his third victim, fellow patient Richard Loudwell, aged 60. He battered him on the head and tied a ligature around his neck. Mr Loudwell died in hospital later that day. Bryan said that if he had not been interrupted he would have eaten Loudwell's flesh.

===Trial===
On 15 March 2005, Bryan pleaded guilty at the [[Old Bailey]] to two manslaughters on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Judge Giles Forrester said: "You killed on these last two occasions because it gave you a thrill and a feeling of power when you ate flesh."

Bryan, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is a self-confessed cannibal, was committed to Broadmoor Hospital for treatment.

'''Richard Derrick''' was born in [[Torrance, California]] in 1961, and is a lifelong resident of nearby [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]].  He began playing music at an early age, starting with [[piano]] at age four, [[guitar]] at age ten, then learning both [[drum]]s and [[bass guitar]] at 15.  Attempts to find like-minded musicians in and around San Pedro became frustrating, and by 1982 Derrick began spending more time in Los Angeles, performing in various musical settings.

In 1984 Derrick became roommates with [[The Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] singer/guitarist [[D. Boon]], and they began playing together informally with [[Crane (musician)|Crane]], who played trumpet and sang on a few Minutemen records.  The trio called themselves ''Cosmic Joke'', but public performance was limited to two private parties.

Derrick and Crane continued performing together, and in 1987, after several attempts with different musicians, they began working as a duo under the name ''Another Umbrella'', which utilized extended delay guitar loops, pre-recorded instruments, slide shows, and a strong emphasis on improvisation.  This went against the grain of what was popular in Los Angeles clubs at the time, but they did perform regularly around town and on radio, most notably at The Museum Of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles.  Other musicians who performed with Another Umbrella include keyboardist Paul Roessler and flutist/vocalist Emily Hay.

In 1997, two weeks after the final Another Umbrella show, Derrick began performing with drummer Bob Lee and a core of revolving musicians (including [[Nels Cline]] and [[Joe Baiza]]) under the name ''Solo Career'', a side-project which lasted until 2002, performing whenever the musicians' schedules allowed.

Between 1992 and 1994 Derrick produced concerts in Los Angeles for [[Canterbury Scene]] musicians [[Kevin Ayers]], [[Richard Sinclair]], [[Gilli Smyth]] and [[Tim Blake]].  In 1998 and 2000 Derrick organized and financed two California mini-tours with Ayers, eventually releasing the best of this material on the ''Alive In California'' CD through his own [[Box-O-Plenty Records]].

Derrick has also released the best of the home recordings with Boon as ''[[D. Boon and Friends]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/d-boon-in-the-present-tense/2279/ |title=D. BOON IN THE PRESENT TENSE |last=King |first=Chris |date=October 30, 2003 |work=[[LA Weekly]] |accessdate=31 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006224031/http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/d-boon-in-the-present-tense/2279/ |archivedate=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the sole album by Solo Career, ''Season Finale'', which features artwork by British artist [[Paul Whitehead]] (best known for his art on the [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] albums ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'', ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' and ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'').

In 2005 Derrick began to experience symptoms of what was eventually diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, most likely as the result of head injuries sustained during an assault at a San Pedro record store in 1990.  With most of the flexibility in his left-hand fingers now gone, he is unable to play guitar, bass or drums at his former level.  As he was still able to play basic guitar chords, he joined several friends from the Los Angeles music scene to perform a tribute to [[Pink Floyd]] founder [[Syd Barrett]], which they called A Room Of Musical Tunes.  A one-off performance in September 2006 was eventually followed by two performances in May 2007 and January 2009.

In the summer of 2007, Derrick went through his entire recording archive and edited the highlights for posterity, ending up with 70 hours of music.  The first of these recordings to be publicly available are seven hours of music (spread out over eleven albums) by Another Umbrella, released exclusively on digital downloads with no discs being pressed, in March 2008.

Derrick remains active on the Los Angeles music scene, although on more of a behind-the-scenes level.  Derrick closed down Box-O-Plenty Records in June 2011.

'''John Ross McLean''', the 11th of 12 children of a Northern Manitoba minister and farmer, was born in the small prairie village of Ethelbert in 1905. He became a [[Canadians|Canadian]] journalist and [[civil servant]]. In the latter role he served as the Commissioner of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) in the 1940s, having previously been instrumental in the foundation of the Board the previous decade.

==Early years==
In the 1920s McLean studied at [[Brandon University|Brandon College]], and then later at the [[University of Manitoba]].&lt;ref name="nfbbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/ross_mclean/|title=NFB Profiles - Ross McLean|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806214629/http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/ross_mclean|archivedate=August 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining his [[Master of Arts|MA]] from Manitoba in 1927, he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt; After completing his academic career in 1931, he moved to work in the [[United States]], for the Unemployment Relief Commission of [[Northern Illinois]].&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt; In 1932 he returned to Canada, working for the Association of Canadian Clubs and also engaging in a journalistic career.&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt; He wrote for ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'' and ''[[Canadian Forum]]'' magazines, and in 1935 became the [[National Liberal Federation]]'s editor of publications.&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt;

==National Film Board==

In 1936 he was appointed the personal secretary to the [[High Commission of Canada in London|Canadian High Commissioner the United Kingdom]], [[Vincent Massey]].&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt; In 1938 Massey and McLean discussed how unimpressed they were by the standard of films produced by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]] Motion Picture Bureau.&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/historique/about-the-foundation|title=1939|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604075927/http://www.nfb.ca/historique/about-the-foundation/|archivedate=June 4, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLean had seen and admired the work of British [[documentary film]]-maker [[John Grierson]], and suggested to Massey that he should persuade the Canadian government to allow Grierson to compile a report into its film-making activities.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt; This report led, in 1939, to the formation of the new National Film Board, with Grierson in charge.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt;

In the same year that the NFB was established, Grierson hired McLean to serve under him as the Assistant Film Commissioner.&lt;ref name="forbidden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIyH_DLYhoIC&amp;pg=PA190|page=190|first=Karl F.|last=Cohen|chapter=Blacklisted Animators|year=1997|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=0786420324}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arguments with the government over the content of several films, Grierson resigned his position as Government Film Commissioner in 1945.&lt;ref name="fortyfive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/history/1940-1949/#year-1945|title=1945|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the turbulent postwar years, McLean succeeded Grierson as Commissioner, initially on an interim basis but from January 1947 as an official appointment.&lt;ref name="fortyseven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/history/1940-1949/#year-1947|title=1947|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLean was faced with several problems during his time in charge, including budget cuts, a reduction in staffing and conflicts with the dominant [[Cinema of the United States|United States film industry]].&lt;ref name="fortyseven"/&gt;

McLean's greatest problem, however, came from the government's fear of [[communism]] within the NFB.&lt;ref name="fortynine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/history/1940-1949/#year-1949|title=1949|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an atmosphere of heightening Cold War tensions with a government minister suggesting that certain NFB employees were engaged in Communist activities, a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] investigation was instigated into communism at the Board. Several employees were deemed "security risks", but following the findings of the investigation, McLean refused to fire any staff members.&lt;ref name="fortynine"/&gt; He believed that the political beliefs of his staff were irrelevant as long as it did not interfere with their work.&lt;ref name="forbidden"/&gt; In December 1949, McLean was informed that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in January.&lt;ref name="fortynine"/&gt; Ralph Foster, then assistant commissioner, resigned in protest. Several other members of McLean's staff threatened to resign as well, but he dissuaded them from doing so as he did not want the NFB to be harmed.&lt;ref name="fortynine"/&gt;

McLean's nephew, [[Grant McLean (film producer)|Grant McLean]], had begun working as a [[film director]] at the NFB during his uncle's time there. Grant, whose own NFB career spanned nearly three decades, described his uncle as a very philosophic person who believed very much in the concept of film and public information. He went on to serve as interim Commissioner himself during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/mclean_grant_1921-2002.html|title=McLean, Grant (1921-2002)|first=Christine|last=Ramsey|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-1950==
In 1950, McLean moved to Paris with his wife and young son to head the film division at the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), a position he was to hold until 1957. He returned to Canada as a writer and broadcaster, contributing to a number of publications. Then in 1960 he assumed the post of research director at the Broadcast Board of Governors which later became the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), where he eventually took on the role of special policy advisor, a post he was to hold until he retired in 1973.

==Family==

Ross married Beverley Bell Cosh and they had two children, Digby  and Yolande.&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt;

In an interview with the Toronto Star, Digby was reported as saying that his father was intensely nationalistic, and that he was perhaps best known for having stood up to U.S. film interests during his NFB tenure.  Yolande remarked that her father loved history, read voraciously and travelled widely, sometimes forgetting to tell his family his next destination. Fluent in several languages, Mr McLean taught himself French by translating the Bible. In later life, McLean suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="nfbbio"/&gt; He died July 26, 1984 in [[Ottawa]], several weeks after Beverley, who died on May 17 the same year.

They practiced their profession in the seaport of [[Yumurtalık|Aegeae]], then in the [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province of Syria]].

Accepting no payment for their services led to them being named ''Anargyroi'' (from the Greek Ανάργυροι, "the silverless" or  "[[Holy Unmercenaries|Unmercenaries]]"); it has been said that, by this, they attracted many to the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04403e.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: "Sts. Cosmas and Damian"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lives==
[[Image:Gerard Seghers, Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian (17th century).jpg|left|thumb|''Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian'', by [[Gerard Seghers]], 17th century, Private collection, U.S.]]
Nothing is known of their lives except that they suffered martyrdom in Syria during the persecution of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]. 
According to Christian traditions, the twin brothers were born in Arabia and became skilled doctors.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

[[Saladino d'Ascoli]], a 15th century Italian physician, claims that the medieval electuary, a pasty mass consisting of a drug mixed with sugar and water or honey suitable for oral administration,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/electuary&lt;/ref&gt; known as opopira,&lt;ref&gt;Opopira magna, a pharmaceutical preparation from the Antidotarius magnus [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3325340 NCBI PubMed, in German, Daems WF, Ledermann F.]&lt;/ref&gt; a complex compound medicine used to treat diverse maladies including paralysis, was invented by Cosmas and Damian.&lt;ref&gt;Saladino d'Ascoli, "Compendium Aromatariorum", In: ''Mesue cum expositione mondini super canones vniuersales. ac etiam cum expositione Christophori de honestis in antidotarium eiusdem...'' Venecia, per Bonetum Locatellum Bergomensem. 1 abril 1495, fol. 323v: "Oppopira dicitur a succo &amp; igne. oppo enim grece latine succus &amp; pir grece latine ignis: inde oppopira idest succus ignitus &amp; hoc electuarium compositum est a sanctissimis medicis cosmas &amp; damiano."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Diocletian Persecution|persecution]] under [[Diocletian]], Cosmas and Damian were arrested by order of the [[Prefect]] of [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]], one Lysias who is otherwise unknown, who ordered them under [[torture]] to recant. However, according to legend they stayed true to their faith, enduring being hung on a cross, stoned and shot by arrows and finally suffered execution by [[beheading]]. Anthimus, Leontius and Euprepius, their younger brothers, who were inseparable from them throughout life, shared in their martyrdom.

[[Image:Pope Felix presents church to Cosmas and Damian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Felix IV]] presents Saints Cosmas and Damian with [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|the basilica]] he [[consecration|rededicated]] to them.]]

As early as the 4th century, churches dedicated to the twin saints were established at [[Jerusalem]], in [[Egypt]] and in [[Mesopotamia]]. Devotion to the two saints spread rapidly in both East and West. [[Theodoret]] records the division of their reputed relics. Their relics, deemed miraculous, were buried in the city of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrus]] in Syria. Churches were built in their honor by Archbishop [[Archbishop Proclus of Constantinople|Proclus]] and by Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565), who sumptuously restored the city of Cyrus and dedicated it to the twins, but brought their purported relics to [[Constantinople]]; there, following his cure, ascribed to the intercession of Cosmas and Damian, Justinian, in gratitude also built and adorned their church at Constantinople,&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1150 Foley OFM, Leonard. "Sts. Cosmas and Damian", ''Saint of the Day'', (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a celebrated place of pilgrimage. At Rome Pope [[Felix IV]] (526–530) rededicated the Library of Peace (''Bibliotheca Pacis'') as a [[basilica]] of [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] in the [[Imperial forums|Forum of Vespasian]] in their honour. The church is much rebuilt but still famed for its sixth-century mosaics illustrating the saints.

What are said to be their skulls are venerated in the [[convent]] of the [[Order of Poor Ladies|Clares]] in Madrid, where they have been since 1581, the gift of Maria, daughter of [[Emperor Charles V]]. They had previously been removed from Rome to [[Bremen]] in the tenth century, and thence to [[Bamberg]]. 
Other skulls said to be theirs were discovered in 1334 by [[Burchard Grelle]], [[Erzstift Bremen|Archbishop of Bremen]]. He "personally 'miraculously' retrieved the relics of the holy physicians Cosmas and Damian, which were allegedly immured and forgotten in the choir of the [[Bremen Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Original emphasis. Omission not in the original. {{ISBN|978-3-9801919-8-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grelle claimed the relics were those Archbishop [[Adaldag]] brought from Rome in 965. The cathedral master-builder Johann Hemeling made a shrine for the relics, which was finished around 1420. The shrine,made from carved oak wood covered with gilt and rolled silver is considered an important mediaeval gold work.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Elmshäuser, "Der werdende Territorialstaat der Erzbischöfe von Bremen (1236–1511): I.

The two heads remained in Bremen and came into the possession of the small Roman Catholic community. They were shown from 1934 to 1968 in the Church of St. Johann and in 1994 they were buried in the crypt.&lt;ref&gt;(Wilhelm Tacke: St. Johann in Bremen - erine 600jährige Geschichte - von den Bettelbrüdern bis zu den Pröpsten, Bremen 2006, S. 172ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine is now shown in the [[Jesuit]] [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|church of St Michael]] in [[Munich]]. At least since 1413 another supposed pair of skulls of the saints has been stored in [[Stephansdom|St Stephens's Cathedral]] in Vienna. Other relics are claimed by the [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] in [[Venice]].

[[Image:CosmasDamianfraangelico.jpg|thumb|right|The martyrdom of Saints Cosmas and Damian by [[Fra Angelico]] ([[Musée du Louvre]], Paris).]]

The martyr twins are invoked in the [[Canon of the Mass]]&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt; in the prayer known as the ''Communicantes'' (from the first Latin word of the prayer): "In communion with the whole Church, they venerate above all others the memory of the glorious ever-virgin Mary, Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ, then of blessed Joseph, husband of the Virgin, your blessed Apostles and Martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, ...John and Paul, ''Cosmas and Damian'' and all your Saints: grant through their merits and prayers that in all things we may be defended by the help of your protection." They are also invoked in the [[Litany of the Saints]], and in the older form of the Roman rite, in the [[Collect]] for Thursday in the Third Week of Lent, as the [[Station days|station church]] for this day is [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]].

Their [[feast day]] in the [[General Roman Calendar]], which had been on September 27, was moved in 1969 to September 26, because September 27 is the ''dies natalis'' ("day of birth" into Heaven) of Saint [[Vincent de Paul]], now more widely venerated in the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada it has been moved to Sept. 25 (as Sept. 26 is the Feast of the Canadian Martyrs in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;http://nlo.cccb.ca/images/stories/pdfs/nationallitcalender2016_01_27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sts Cosmas and Damian are regarded as the patrons of physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists and are sometimes represented with medical emblems.

[[File:French - Double Capital Depicting Saints Cosmas and Damian (Guild of Barber-Surgeons) - Walters 27572.jpg|thumb|right|Cosmas and Damian are depicted as [[supporter]]s of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|arms]] of the guild of barber-surgeons carved into a [[capital (architecture)|capital]], 15th century, from the Carmes monastery in [[Trie-sur-Baïse]] in southwestern [[France]].  The inscription reads, "Saints Cosmas and Damian pray for us".]]

In [[Brazil]], the twin saints are regarded as protectors of children, and September 27 is commemorated, especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], by giving children bags of candy with the saints' effigy printed on them and throughout the entire state of Bahia where Catholics and adepts of [[Candomble|Candomblé]] religion offer typical food such as [[Caruru (food)|caruru]].
The ritual consists of first offering the food to seven children that are no older than seven years old and then having them feast while sitting on the floor and eating with their hands. Only after all children have finished can the guests enjoy the food that is being offered. The Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, in [[Igarassu, Pernambuco|Igarassu]], [[Pernambuco]] is Brazil's oldest church, built in 1535.

In the UK St Damian is the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] side supporter in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[British Dental Association]].

Sts. Cosmas &amp; Damian are venerated every year in Utica, New York at St. Anthony's Parish during the annual pilgrimage which takes place on the last weekend of September (close to the Sept. 27 feast day). There are thousands of pilgrims who come to honor the saints. Over 80 busloads come from Canada and other destinations. The 2-day festival includes music (La Banda Rosa), much Italian food, masses and processions through the streets of East Utica. It is one of the largest festivals honoring saints in the northeast USA.

==Eastern Christianity==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
[[Image:MHS ss Damian i Kosma XVII w p.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Saints Cosmas and Damian (17th century, Historic Museum in [[Sanok]], Poland).]]
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], and the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], Saints Cosmas and Damian are venerated as a type of saint known as [[Unmercenary Physicians]] ({{lang-el|ἀνάργυροι}}, ''anargyroi,'' ''"without money"''). This classification of saints is unique to the Eastern Church and refers to those who heal purely out of love for God and man, strictly observing the command of Jesus: "Freely have you received, freely give." («Δωρεὰν ἐλάβετε, δωρεὰν δότε...» {{Bibleverse||Matthew|10:8|KJV}}) While each of the Unmercenaries has his own [[feast day]]s, all are commemorated together on the first Sunday in November, in a feast known as the [[Synaxis]] of the Unmercenary Physicians.

The Orthodox celebrate no less than three different sets of saints by the name of Cosmas and Damian, each with their own distinct [[feast day]]:

*'''Saints Cosmas and Damian of Cilicia (Arabia)''' ([[October 17 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|October 17]]) Brothers, according to Christian legend they were beaten and beheaded together with three other Christians: Leontius, Anthimus, and Eutropius.
*'''Saints Cosmas and Damian of Asia Minor''' — alternately, '''of Mesopotamia''' ([[November 1 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|November 1]]) Twin sons of [[Saint Theodota]]. Died peacefully and were buried together at [[Thereman]] in Mesopotamia.
*'''Saints Cosmas and Damian of Rome''' ([[July 1 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 1]]) Brothers, according to Christian tradition they were [[martyr]]ed outside Rome by a jealous pagan physician during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Carinus]] (283–284).

Orthodox [[icon]]s of the saints depict them vested as laymen holding medicine boxes. Often each will also hold a spoon with which to dispense medicine. The handle of the spoon is normally shaped like a cross to indicate the importance of spiritual as well as physical healing, and that all cures come from God.

'''Wael Khalil''' ({{lang-ar|وائل خليل}}) is an Egyptian political activist known for his criticism of the Mubarak regime, his activity during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and his blog WaELK.net which covers government, activism and sports.

==Personal life==
Khalil is a software engineer by trade.&lt;ref name="ahram2005"/&gt;

==Early activism==
Wael Khalil joined the [[Revolutionary Socialists (Egypt)|Revolutionary Socialists]] in 1992 but left them in 2011 after Hosni Mubarak resignation by few weeks. Khalil began his activism in 2000 as part of the Egyptian anti-war and anti-globalisation movement.&lt;ref name="ahram2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/748/eg9.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Egypt &amp;#124; Voices of dissent |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=29 June 2005 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that political reform is rooted in the anti-war and Palestine solidarity movements.&lt;ref name="thestar2006"&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/1/worldupdates/2006-01-01T001411Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_-229981-1&amp;sec=worldupdates&lt;/ref&gt; He also believes that dictatorship leads to imperialism.&lt;ref name="ahram2005"/&gt;

He was a protester from the Egyptian opposition movement [[Kefaya]].&lt;ref name="thestar2006"/&gt;  He also co-founded the 20 March Popular Campaign for Change.&lt;ref name="ahram2005"/&gt;

In 2006 he criticized Egyptian police after at Sudanese refugees were killed at a squatter camp in Cairo. He said, "When you kill little babies, things have changed...We will try you, and you won't be able to travel abroad again."&lt;ref name="thestar2006"/&gt;

==Al Ahram photo scandal==

In September 2010 Khalil reported on an altered photograph in [[Al-Ahram]] in which editors had changed the position of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] from the back of a row of heads of state to the front. On his blog ''Waelk.net'' Khalil posted the photoshopped image alongside the original taken by Associated Press, which showed Mubarak actually behind Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]], Jordanian [[King Abdullah II]], and United States President [[Barack Obama]] at a media event at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijnet.org/stories/egyptian-blogger-discovers-doctored-photo-state-run-newspaper |title=Egyptian blogger discovers doctored photo in state-run newspaper |publisher=IJNet |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11313738 |title=BBC News - Egyptian newspaper under fire over altered photo |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Egyptian Chronicles'' blog commented, "The photo scandal of the week which is making headlines worldwide is another triumph to the Egyptian blogosphere as the one who discovered from all the world is Egyptian follow blogger Wael Khalil...I repeat the one who discovered is Wael Khalil...Who said that blogs are losing their power in Egypt !!??"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zeinobia |url=http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2010/09/al-ahrams-way-to-photoshop-of-horror.html |title=Egyptian Chronicles: Al Ahram’s Way to Photoshop of Horror |publisher=Egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 Egyptian revolution==
Khalil was active during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] and its aftermath.

In May 2011 Khalil spoke out for a second wave of protests in support of a "Friday of rage" against the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] (SCAF). In an editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Khalil's criticisms of the SCAF focused on rumors about pardoning Mubarak and members of his regime, physical or violent reactions of security forces during protests, the army's use of military trials against civilians, use of trials against protesters and 'normal citizens', and he also noted the prior successes which resulted from large protests in [[Tahrir Square]]. He wrote, "The call for a 'second revolution' chimes with a growing restlessness and impatience at the pace of developments and the overall performance of the governing Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)....We will be out again in Tahrir Square on Friday 27 May in order to assert that the interim power respect our rights and demands. The Egyptian people have earned their right to control the future of this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/27/egypt-second-friday-of-rage |title=Why we are holding Egypt's second 'Friday of rage' &amp;#124; Wael Khalil &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 27 May 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 [[Al-Ahram]] profiled Khalil's presence at a meeting with Prime Minister [[Essam Sharaf]], along with four other activists, which prompted a debate on Twitter about whether or not the activists represented to growing protests. Seven demands, agreed upon by several organisations, were presented to Sharaf.  The meeting happened while in Tahrir square protesters gathered in their second major wave of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/16325/Egypt/Politics-/Chronicles-of-a-sitin-Day-.aspx |title=Chronicles of a sit-in: Day 4 - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 Budget policy==
[[File:Wael Khalil speaking at Tweet Nadwa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wael Khalil speaking at Tweet Nadwa about the 2011 Budget]]
In a June 2011 editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Khalil criticized support from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), which included a $3 billion loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Werr |first=Patrick |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/05/us-egypt-imf-idUSTRE7541AA20110605 |title=Egypt seals $3 billion IMF accord |publisher=Reuters |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said, "But many people, myself included, were unhappy with this news and the impact such a loan will have on deepening the country's debt and mounting debt servicing burden."&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/07/egypt-imf-loan |title=Egypt's IMF-backed revolution? No thanks &amp;#124; Wael Khalil &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalil equated help from the bank with "neoliberal[ism]", "imperialism", and the politics of the Mubarak regime. He blamed such policies for economic stagnation, deterioration, and growing inequality under Mubarak. Khalil cited IMF ex-employee and Mubarak regime finance minister [[Youssef Boutros-Ghali]], who was sentenced to prison for corruption. He said, "I believe that this country's future lies not with the same highly paid, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats of the IMF, nor with their sacred indicators of budget deficits and market economics. Our future lies with a new home-grown economics that caters for the majority of Egyptians, the schools where their children are educated, the hospitals where they receive healthcare, and the jobs that guarantee them decent and honourable living."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ben |first=Danny |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=226639 |title=By rejecting IMF loan Egypt risks undermin... JPost - Middle East |publisher=Jpost.com |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Khalil criticized a proposed increase in Egypt's [[minimum wage]] as insufficiently large. Khalil said the new wage, while "an improvement" represented an "example of the priority of the government to lean on the poor and working majority in order to protect the interests of businessmen and the established elite."&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegyptcivil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/human-a-civil-rights/revised-minimum-wage-still-too-low-activists-argue.html |title=Revised minimum wage still too low, activists argue |publisher=Thedailynewsegypt.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalil also supported the proposed budget's decreasing of the deficit but criticized the means to do so which he said put more burden on workers and pensioners rather than raising capital gains taxes. Khalil said, "We need to continue mass demonstrations to pressure the government, [because] it won’t stop with just the budget and the decision on minimum wage, but they will continue leaning on workers, on the country’s weakest side."&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegyptcivil"/&gt;

Khalil argued that in the movement for reform social rights were necessary as well as political rights. He said, "We must not only mobilize people, but also debate and explain specifically why social justice is important for [Egypt]. You cannot really say that you want democracy, and then after that you’ll [work to] get social justice. No. If you do it in this order, you’ll end up with nothing."&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegyptcivil"/&gt;

'''Women in Fiji''' live in or are from the [[Fiji|Republic of Fiji]]. On March 8, 2007, ''The Fiji Times ONLINE'' described Fijian women as playing an important role in the fields of economic and social development in Fijian society. The women of the Republic of Fiji are the "driving force" in health service as nurses and medical doctors. They are also key players and managers in the tourism and entertainment industries, as well as teachers in the field of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roles women play|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?ref=archive&amp;id=58379|publisher=The Fiji Times ONLINE|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article ''Women's work and fertility in Fiji'', "the presence of very young children and larger family sizes contribute to the low level of labour force participation of Fijian and Indian women in Fiji."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rakaseta|first=Vilimaina L.|title=Women's work and fertility in Fiji|url=http://www.pacifichealthdialog.org.fj/Volume%202/No1%20Population,%20Women%20Development/Original%20Papers/Women's%20work%20and%20fertility%20in%20Fiji.pdf|work=Pacific Health Dialog Vol. 2 No. 1|publisher=Original Papers|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By culture and tradition, a woman in Fiji lives in a paternalistic and patriarchal society wherein she has a secondary role at home performing household chores that include cooking meals and  cleaning the house. As community and village members women are treated as subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The traditional Fijian|url=http://www.fijibure.com/tradition.htm|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eating customs==
By tradition, most of the cooking is performed by Fijian women. Indo-Fijian cuisine may include food made from starch and involves the use of relishes made from vegetables. If available, meat and fish are also eaten. Flatbread may be made from locally grown rice or from imported flour. Traditional Indo-Fijian eating custom requires that women eat separately from men. For religious reasons Hindu Indo-Fijians avoid consuming beef and Muslim Indo-Fijians avoid consuming pork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Anthony R.|title=Fiji|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/Fiji.html|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence against women ==
{{Main|Violence against women in Fiji}}

'''Étienne Maurice Gérard, 1er [[Count|Comte]] Gérard''' (4 April 1773{{spaced ndash}}17 April 1852) was a French general, statesman and [[Marshal of France]]. He served under a succession of French governments including the ''ancien regime'' monarchy, the Revolutionary governments, the Restorations, the [[July Monarchy]], the [[First French Republic|First]] and [[Second French Republic|Second Republics]], and the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] (and arguably the [[Second French Empire|Second]]),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}} becoming Prime Minister briefly in 1834.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born at [[Damvilliers]], in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], he joined a [[French Revolutionary Army|battalion of volunteers]] in 1791, and served in the [[Campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars|campaigns of 1792–1793]] under Generals [[Charles François Dumouriez]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]. In 1795, he served [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]] as [[aide-de-camp]]. In 1799 he was promoted ''[[Squadron (army)|chef d'escadron]]'', and in 1800 [[colonel]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

===Rise to prominence===
He distinguished himself at the battles of [[battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[battle of Jena|Jena]], and was made [[Brigadier General]] in November 1806, and for his conduct in the [[battle of Wagram]] he was created a [[baron]] of the [[First French Empire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

In the [[Peninsular War|Spanish campaign of 1810 and 1811]], Gérard gained special distinction at the [[battle of Fuentes de Onoro]]; and in the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|expedition to Russia]] he was present at the [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|battle of Smolensk]] and the [[battle of Valutino]], and displayed such bravery and ability in the [[battle of Borodino]] that he was made ''[[Général|général de division]]''. He won further distinction in the disastrous retreat from Moscow.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

===Campaigns of 1813–1814===
In the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|campaign of 1813]], in command of a [[Division (military)|division]], he took part in the [[battle of Lützen (1813)|battle of Lützen]] and the [[battle of Bautzen]], as well as in the operations of [[Étienne-Jacques-Joseph-Alexandre MacDonald|Marshal Macdonald]], and at the [[battle of Leipzig]] (in which he commanded the XI Corps) he was gravely wounded. After the battle of Bautzen, he was created by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] a [[count]] of the Empire.
In the [[Six Days Campaign]] of 1814, and especially at [[Battle of La Rothière|La Rothière]] and the [[battle of Montereau]], he won still greater distinction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

===Restoration and July Revolution===
After the first [[Bourbon Restoration]], he was named by [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] Grand Cross of the [[Legion of Honor]] and [[Order of Saint Louis|chevalier of St Louis]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

During the [[Hundred Days]], Napoleon made Gérard a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]] and placed him in command of the IV Corps of the Army of the North. In this capacity Gérard took a brilliant part in the [[battle of Ligny]], and on the morning of 18 June he was foremost in advising [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] to march to the sound of the guns to aid the emperor at [[battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Having failed in this he took part in the [[battle of Wavre]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

Gérard retired to [[Brussels]] after the fall of Napoleon, and did not return to France until 1817. He sat as a member of the Restoration's [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1822–1824, and was re-elected in 1827.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

Gérard took part in the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, after which he was appointed minister of war and named a [[Marshal of France]]. On account of his health he resigned the office of [[List of Defense Ministers of France|War Minister]] in the following October.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

===Belgian campaign and later distinctions===
However, in 1831 he took the command of the Northern Army, and was successful in forcing the army of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] to withdraw from [[Belgium]] (''see [[Belgian Revolution]]''). In 1832 he commanded the besieging army in the famous [[Siege of Antwerp (1832)|scientific siege]] of the citadel of [[Antwerp]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

He was again chosen war minister in July 1834,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}} and served as [[List of Prime Ministers of France|Prime Minister]] of the [[July Monarchy]],&lt;ref name="napoleon.org"&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/fr/salle_lecture/biographies/files/Gerard_Maurice.asp «GERARD, MAURICE-ETIENNE (1773-1852), GÉNÉRAL, MARÉCHAL»], from the website napoleon.org&lt;/ref&gt; but resigned in the following October. In 1836 he was named grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour in succession to [[Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|Marshal Mortier]], and in 1838 commander of the National Guards of the [[Seine (département)|Seine]] ''[[département]]'', an office which he held until 1842. He became a [[Senate of France|senator]] of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] in 1852 (before it was formally instituted), and died in the same year, aged 79.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=764}}

==Marriage and descendants==
Gérard married Rosemonde de Valence. Their granddaughter was [[Rosemonde Gérard]].&lt;ref name="napoleon.org"/&gt;
