'''109 Washington Street''' is a five-story [[tenement]] on the Lower West Side of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], within the area once known as [[Little Syria]]. Due to demolitions connected to the construction of the [[Brooklyn Battery Tunnel]] and the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], it stands as the last tenement on a portion of lower [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] that has been estimated by Kate Reggev to have contained around 50 tenements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reggev|first1=Kate|title=105-107 and 109 Washington Street|url=https://savewashingtonstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/105-107-and-109-Report-Save-Washington-Street.pdf|website=Save Washington Street|page=24|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], its proximity to the [[World Trade Center site]] made it the subject of some media attention, including a nationally syndicated radio story about the experiences of its residents on the day of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;''109 on 9-11: An Audio Documentary''. PRI. August/September 2003. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, community officials,&lt;ref&gt;[http://savewashingtonstreet.org/2012/10/20/community-board-one-resolution-on-109-washington-street-tenement/ Community Board One Resolution. April 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; activists, and preservationists have advocated for its designation as a landmark as part of a mini-historical district with the connected buildings of [[St. George's Syrian Catholic Church]] and the [[Downtown Community House]].

== Previous structures ==
A four-story, brick “public store” that received goods from the piers on [[West Side Highway|West Street]] stood at 109 [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] since the early 1820s, if not before; several other nearby buildings on Washington Street at Nos. 97, 101, and 103 were also commercial structures serving the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;New York City Board of Health. ''A History of the Proceedings of the Board of Health, of the City of New-York...'' New York: P &amp; H Van Pelt, 1823; Jones, Andrew A. ''Jones' Digest: Being a Particular and Detailed Account of the Duties Performed by the Various Offices Belonging to the Custom-House Departments of the United States''. New York: G.F. Hopkins &amp; Son, 1835. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, public stores in large cities like New York housed goods coming directly from the wharves so that they could be appraised before being brought to the individual shops or markets where they would be sold. Owned at the time by [[Samuel Swartwout]], a wealthy land speculator, an 1837 fire at the store led to a valuation of its goods at approximately $300,000, including pipes of [[Lime (fruit)|lime juice]]; boxes of glass; cases of [[wine]], [[brandy]], and [[gin]]; boxes of [[cigars]]; and cases of [[Cordial (medicine)|cordials]].&lt;ref&gt;New York City Department of Finance, Conveyance Liber #6, Prior to 1917, Block 45-54; United States Congress House. “Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury.” ''House Documents, 27th Congress, Third Session''. January 19, 1843. p. 2; “Domestic: Fire and Loss of Life.” ''The Boston Recorder''. 9 June 1837. American Periodicals, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1850s, the property housed a residential building that was occupied by [[Irish diaspora|Irish and Irish-American]] families throughout the 1860s and 1870s; beginning in the 1870s and 1880s, [[German American|German immigrants]] joined the Irish population. Common occupations were servants, sailors, cooks, machinists, laborers, longshoremen, and barbers.&lt;ref&gt;“To The Anniversary folks.” ''The New York Daily Tribune''. 13 May 1857, p. 7; U.S. Census, New York, New York. 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

== “Old Law” Tenements ==
Tenement buildings are by legal definition a multi-family building housing more than three families, according to the [[Tenement House Law of 1867]]; the later association of tenements with lower-income, immigrant families is believed to have stemmed from the typical 25-foot-wide lots in New York City, creating narrow apartments with little access to light and ventilation except for in the front rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Information in this section is based on the following sources: Dolkart, Andrew. ''Biography of a Tenement House in New York City''. Santa Fe: The Center for American Places, 2006; Stern, Robert A.M. ''New York 1900''. New York: Rizzoli International Publications, Inc, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Most tenement houses built before the first tenement law in 1879, also known as the “old law,” were constructed with little to no building regulations; after 1879, the typical shape of tenements shifted to the “dumbbell” apartments, where three-foot wide light shafts on either side of the structure were an attempt at providing light and air to the inner rooms. Unfortunately, this did not provide the desired access to air and light but rather created what essentially became garbage shafts and fire flues and did little for residents in the way of privacy from neighbors in the buildings next door. 1901 saw the [[New York State Tenement House Act|second wave of tenement reform]], with requirements addressing both access to lighting for interior rooms, slightly larger air shafts, and indoor [[toilet]] facilities; many of these reforms became requirements for preexisting tenements that had to be brought up to code. Stylistically, the “old law” tenements tended to be four- or five-story [[Brick|red brick]] structures with stone or [[terra-cotta]] window details and a [[neo-Grec]] pressed metal [[cornice]]; later “new law” tenements could be up to six stories with brick and glazed terra-cotta trim, often with [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] or [[Classical architecture|Classical]], strongly projecting details.

In 1881, the existing pre-1879 tenement was sold in [[foreclosure]] for $5,000 and then subsequently resold that same year to Lawrence O’Connor, resident of 115 Washington Street and employee at a local liquor store.&lt;ref&gt;“The Real Estate Market: Recorded Real Estate Transfers.” ''The New York Times''. 4 March 1881. p. 6; New York City Department of Finance, Conveyance Liber #6, Prior to 1917, Block 45-54; U.S. Census, New York, New York, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the tenement construction during the late 19th century was carried out by local entrepreneurs with a small amount of savings who sought an opportunity to become landowners and landlords; these entrepreneurs, like the Irish-born Lawrence O’Connor, typically were members of the same ethnic or religious groups as those who would occupy the tenement.&lt;ref&gt;Dolkart, Andrew. ''Biography of a Tenement House in New York City''. Santa Fe: The Center for American Places, 2006. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later in 1885, O’Connor demolished the existing brick building and hired architect John P. Lee to construct an “old law” tenement of five stories, with a storefront and perhaps two or three apartments on the ground floor and four three-room apartments on each of the  upper floors. Typical of most tenement buildings constructed after the 1879 “old law” regulations and before the 1901 “new law” requirements, No. 109 Washington Street was designed for 19 apartments, each with two windows in the largest of the three rooms and little to no light or ventilation in the other rooms, except for a narrow three-foot wide [[airshaft]] on the southern wall as required by the “old law” of 1879. An airshaft was never constructed on the northern side of the building, perhaps, according to Kate Reggev,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reggev|first1=Kate|title=105-107 and 109 Washington Street|url=https://savewashingtonstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/105-107-and-109-Report-Save-Washington-Street.pdf|website=Save Washington Street|page=19|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the tenement at 111 Washington Street that was a front-and-rear style tenement in 1885 and thus had a small courtyard in the middle of the lot, providing some access to air and light for its neighbors.

Most of the tenements further south on Washington Street were of a lower class, considered “foul,” while the tenements further north on Washington Street near Rector Street, like No. 109, were for the slightly better-off immigrants and were viewed as “better class,” most likely because they were newer than the many converted warehouses and rowhouses further down on Washington Street.&lt;ref&gt;Childe, Cromwell. “Exiles of the Orient: Queer Types Found in New York's Syrian Quarter.” ''The Washington Post''. 21 August 1899. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a pervasive building type in the area, these “old law” tenements were “low, red brick tenements whose fronts [were] scrawled over with [[fire escapes]]” and consisted of apartments of three or four rooms and “whose rears opened down into desolately dark courts.”&lt;ref&gt;“A Bit of Syria Between the Skyscrapers: Lower New York.” ''The Baltimore Sun''. 22 March 1931, p. SM 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most other tenements in Little Syria, No. 109 Washington Street had a commercial space of two large rooms on the ground floor. Although there is little documentation of the tenement’s early inhabitants or the use of the ground floor storefront, three Syrian immigrants ran cigar factories at 57 and 109 Washington Street in 1894 and were caught for fraudulently putting on revenue stamps for tax purposes on their products.&lt;ref&gt;The majority of the census records from New York in 1890 (the first year that census record would be available for this 1885 tenement) were lost in a fire. Records from 1900 are the earliest ones to account for residents of the current structure at 109 Washington Street; “Notes From the Courts.” ''The New York Times''. 21 August 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1910s, the space was occupied by Pedro Caram, an immigrant from Syria, who specialized in the exportation of [[cotton]] and [[silk]] goods, hardware, dry goods, tools, shoes, and jewelry to [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Benjamin Olney. ''American Exporters' Export Trade Directory''. New York: Johnston Export Publishing Company, 1912. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917, Caram’s business was in trouble, and the storefront was occupied in the early 1920s by another merchant of Syrian descent, Leon Labe, who sold silk and cotton textiles, including silk [[kimonos]], [[embroidery]], [[curtain]]s, [[hosiery]], and [[sweaters]] to the [[Dutch West Indies]], [[Peru]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]], [[Honduras]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;“Business Troubles.” ''The New York Times''. 10 April 1917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Benjamin Olney. ''American Exporters' Export Trade Directory''. 6th Edition. New York: Johnston Export Publishing Company, 1920. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, a retailer selling glass occupied the ground floor store.&lt;ref&gt;Sperr, Percy Loomis.

== Inhabitants ==
Beginning in the mid- to late-1880s, Washington Street near Rector Street began to see an influx of immigrants from the Middle East, but No. 109 in particular remained largely populated by Irish and German immigrants. By the turn of the century, the buildings adjacent to No. 109 were home to [[Greek American|Greek]], Turkish/Syrian, [[Russian American|Russian]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[German American|German]], [[Austrian American|Austrian]], [[Welsh American|Welsh]], [[Norwegian American|Norwegian]], [[English American|English]] and Irish immigrants. Most of the Syrians, often referred to as Turks because of their Turkish passports from when Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria were part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], lived with extended family—brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles. Their occupations ranged from machinists, peddlers, cigar makers, shoemakers, and grocers to the occasional dealer of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, New York, New York. 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were sometimes employed as dressmakers or embroiderers.

No. 109 was home to 37 people in 1900, roughly 75% of whom were Irish or first generation Irish-American; the rest were German or first-generation German-Americans, and most males worked as laborers, longshoremen, truck drivers, or bank clerks. Depending on the family, women were also sometimes employed, usually as scrubwomen in the nearby office buildings of the new skyscrapers in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].&lt;ref&gt;US Census, New York, New York. 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, about 60% of the block’s 47 families (196 people) were Syrian immigrants; Greeks and Egyptians also began to move into the area, but the tenement at 109 Washington Street was inhabited by 34 residents of Irish, Hungarian, or Austrian origin.&lt;ref&gt;New York State Census, New York, New York, 1905; Miller, Lucius Hopkins. ''A study of the Syrian population of greater New York.'' [New York?: s.n., 1904?]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1910, the number of occupants of 109 Washington Street doubled to over 60 people as the Austrian-Hungarian, Irish, [[Scottish American|Scottish]], Russian-Lithuanian, Italian, and [[Slovak American|Austrian-Slovak]] families took in lodgers of their own respective ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, New York, New York. 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase, according to Kate Reggev,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reggev|first1=Kate|title=105-107 and 109 Washington Street|url=https://savewashingtonstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/105-107-and-109-Report-Save-Washington-Street.pdf|website=Save Washington Street|page=21|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be due to the large numbers of immigrants that arrived in the community during the decade spanning 1900 to 1910, or could also be due to improvements made to the structure in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;New York City Department of Building, Alteration #1044-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wave of immigrants arriving in New York around the turn of the century, there was a heightened demand for housing and the Department of Buildings sought to improve the conditions of the “old law” tenements throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, perhaps improving the conditions only to have the structures filled with even more inhabitants than before.&lt;ref&gt;“Tenements.” in ''The Encyclopedia of New York City, Second Edition''. Kenneth T. Jackson, ed. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010. p. 1289-1290.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, only one of the original Irish families was still living in the tenement, and the influx of newer immigrants from [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]] who arrived in the United States between 1905 and 1915 is evident in the Czech-Slovak, Austrian, and Austrian-Slovak residents of the building.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, New York, New York. 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the tenement was home to Czech-Slovak, Irish-American, [[Polish American|Polish]], and German families and lodgers who worked as elevator runners, file clerks at a bank, dishwashers in a restaurant, watchmen in an office building, furniture painters, waiters, seamen, telephone electricians, porters, wholesalers, and cooks in restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, New York, New York. 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar demographics are seen again in 1940, but with fewer residents—only 40 people lived in the building, perhaps indicative of the changing nature and decrease in population of the neighborhood. The building’s inhabitants, hailing from [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, [[Yugoslavia]], and the United States (with many native-born New Yorkers), worked as porters, salesmen at a cigar store, longshoremen, dishwashers, accountants, and bakers. Women, as well, were often employed, typically as office cleaners in nearby office towers or as waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, New York, New York. 1940. ED 131-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

109 Washington Street was a typical example of a tenement in Little Syria both in its construction and in the wide range of its residents: it housed hundreds of people of more than thirteen nationalities in the first sixty years of the building’s existence—Austrian, Slovak, Scottish, Irish, [[Hungarian American|Hungarian]], Russian, [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanian]], Italian, Polish, Czech, German, Yugoslavian, and American. Because no Syrian residents have been documented through census records at 109 Washington Street, this could, according to Kate Reggev,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reggev|first1=Kate|title=105-107 and 109 Washington Street|url=https://savewashingtonstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/105-107-and-109-Report-Save-Washington-Street.pdf|website=Save Washington Street|page=22|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps speak to the tendency for building owners to rent apartments to people of the same ethnicity—the O’Connors, of Irish background, may have purposely avoided housing Syrian immigrants despite their large numbers in the area, or they may simply not have been residents at 109 Washington Street at the time of the census. While a similar tenement in New York City’s [[Lower East Side]], another significant immigrant enclave, would most likely have had a higher occupancy rate, Washington Street was home to a wider range of nationalities and ethnicities and truly represented a melting pot of backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Dolkart, Andrew. ''Biography of a Tenement House in New York City''. Santa Fe: The Center for American Places, 2006. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 16 four-, five-and six-story brick residential buildings and tenements that lined Washington Street between Rector and Carlisle Street in the 1910s, No. 109 was among the taller, newer structures on the street and had a projecting metal-framed [[bay window]] storefront.&lt;ref&gt;Dolkart, Andrew. ''Biography of a Tenement House in New York City''. Santa Fe: The Center for American Places, 2006. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The architect of the tenement, John P. Lee, had his offices at 168 East 89th Street and was perhaps the same John P. Lee, president of the Builders League in the early 20th century. He frequently acted as a consultant and representative of the Builders League regarding amendments to the Tenement House Law of 1901, and, if in fact the architect of 109 Washington Street and several other tenements, he would have been very familiar with the building type.&lt;ref&gt;“Mayor Hears Protests Against the Charter.” ''The New York Times''. 14 April 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Windows of 109 Washington Street -- Image c. 2012..JPG|thumb|Windows of 109 Washington Street, 2012]]

The five-story, four-bay running-bond brick tenement building at 109 Washington Street was constructed in 1885 to be a residential structure that extends nearly all the way back to its rear lot line. The original windows were most likely three-over-three [[Sash window|double-sash windows]] and have what appear to be molded [[brownstone]] sills and lintels with neo-Classical inspired swags reliefs. The painted sheet-metal, neo-Grec cornice held up by projecting brackets has a matching sheet-metal [[belt course]] just below the cornice; both are painted a brown color to resemble the [[cast iron]] window trim. These architectural details were most likely purchased from builder’s yards but the subtle swag detail and the use of decorative finishings on the windows, as opposed to lintels and sills with no ornamentation at all, indicates at least some desire to provide ornamentation on the façade.&lt;ref&gt;Dolkart, Andrew. ''Biography of a Tenement House in New York City''. Santa Fe: The Center for American Places, 2006. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; A belt course of [[slate]] or [[bluestone]] runs through the upper edge of the windows on each floor, and a [[fire escape]] on the façade of the building has been extant on the building beginning some time prior to 1907; the current fire escape was most likely preceded by another one, due to holes in the masonry of the facade where the previous escape would have been attached. The fire escapes were typically used to air out bedding, dry laundry, or store large items such as basins or baths.&lt;ref&gt;Dolkart, Andrew. ''Biography of a Tenement House in New York City''. Santa Fe: The Center for American Places, 2006. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Floor plan of 109 Washington Street.jpg|thumb|Floor plan of second, third, fourth, and fifth residential floors for the 1907 alteration by John J. O’Connor]]
The apartments of No. 109 Washington Street were divided into three rooms: a front room or parlor having access to the two windows in the front or rear of the building, a kitchen located in the middle room, and a small bedroom situated in the center of the structure, either across from or next to the staircase. Each apartment was entered through the kitchen, which had doors leading to either the bedroom or the parlor. The entrance on the ground floor was located on the north side of the building, and the stairs were accessed via a long, narrow hallway.

The building has been through two alterations. Originally intended for 19 families when it was built in 1885, 109 Washington Street was home to roughly 35 to 40 people at any given time through the turn of the century; beginning in 1910, the number roughly doubles, with 67 occupants in 1910, 60 in 1920, and 56 in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Buildings, New York City. New Building #466-*85; US Census, Manhattan, New York. 1910, 1920, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, the building was brought up to code outlined in the 1901 Tenement House Law, carried out at No. 109 by John J. O’Connor, an architect and relative of the owner. The 1907 changes included blocking out and flooring over the existing light shaft and creating a new one that would measure five feet by five feet, adding two shared toilets on each floor next to the new light shaft, and inserting windows on interior partition walls in the apartment for light and ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;New York City Department of Building, Alteration #1044-07.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later date, the exterior windows were replaced, in some cases in a haphazard manner, and the original metal and glass bay window storefront has been replaced with a tacked-on storefront.

The tenement remained in the O’Connor family for over 70 years following Lawrence O’Connor’s purchase of the property; in 1955, O’Connor descendants sold the property to Finkenstadt Realty, and through the new owner Robert Ehrich, further improvements were made to the building.&lt;ref&gt;“Village Holdings Go To New Buyers.” ''The New York Times''. 18 July 1955. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the first floor store was equipped to prepare food and was converted into a [[Delicatessen|deli]], while two new toilets on the north side of the building were added on each of the residential floors.&lt;ref&gt;New York City Department of Buildings, Alteration #1023-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground floor has since remained a food service location, housing various restaurants including Marino’s [[Pizza]] in the 1980s and currently Budtharasa [[Thai cuisine|Thai Food]]. Aside from the replaced windows and the changed storefront, the building looks remarkably similar to the way it did over one hundred years ago.

== September 11, 2001 attacks ==
Because of the tenement's proximity to the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and its unusual status in the neighborhood, its residents experienced [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] in a unique way that received media attention after the attacks. In 2003, [[Public Radio International]] syndicated the program "109 on 9-11: An Audio Documentary" about the building and about the day of the attacks. In the piece narrated by Jack Cadwallader, residents Eddie Metropolis, Jim Pedersen, Roxanne Yamashiro, Nancy Keegan, Lesley McBurney, Erwin Silverstein, Flavio Rizzo, and Veruska Cantelli present their memories.&lt;ref&gt;"109 on 9/11." [[Public Radio Exchange]]. Produced by Esther Regelson. [http://www.prx.org/pieces/1686-109-on-9-11 Audio recording].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation effort ==
Because of the major [[eminent domain]] actions and demolitions in the neighborhood, collections of current and former residents and historic preservationists have advocated for the protection of 109 Washington Street as a New York City landmark. [[Manhattan Community Board 1|Community Board One]] has passed a resolution encouraging the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] to hold a hearing on this question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://savewashingtonstreet.org/2012/10/20/community-board-one-resolution-on-109-washington-street-tenement/ Community Board One Resolution. April 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, as reported by the ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David. "Little Syria (Now Tiny Syria) Finds New Advocates."

'''80 South Street''' is a residential [[skyscraper]] proposed for construction in [[New York City]]. The building was planned for construction in [[Lower Manhattan]], and designed by renowned Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]]. However, the project was cancelled on April 16, 2008 in the wake of a declining real estate market.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/04162008/business/sky_cubes_meltdown_106788.htm|last=Weiss|first=Lois|title='Sky Cubes' Meltdown: Calatrava Downtown Residential Project Dead|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2008-04-18|publisher=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new design of the building is without the spire, decreasing the tower to 826 feet, was planned to finish in 2016. [[China Oceanwide Holdings Limited]] acquired 80 South Street in March 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC Seaport Redevelopment Commands $390M|url=https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/nyc-seaport-redevelopment-commands-390m/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plans to create a 113-story tower.

== Original design ==
The design of the building consisted of 12 four-story cubes stacked on top of one another, cantilevered off a central concrete column standing above an 8-story base.  The slender concrete core would contain elevators, fire stairs and risers for plumbing and power. The base was intended to hold a cultural space, such as a museum. The lowest two cubes would hold offices, while the upper 10 cubes were planned to serve as individual residences. Each private cube would consist of about {{convert|10336|sqft|m2|0}} of area, as well as an outdoor garden. The residences each had a cost starting at {{US$|29 million|link=yes}}, with the top cube costing {{US$|59 million}}, making them some of the most expensive condominiums in New York City. However, in 2014, he started a new design of 80 south street to propose for construction in New York City.

The building had a planned roof height of {{Convert|826|ft|m}}, and the central core was planned to extend as a spire to {{Convert|1123|ft|m}}. The tower was originally conceived as the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|3rd-tallest building]] in New York City (after the [[Empire State Building]] and the [[Bank of America Tower (New York City)|Bank of America Tower]]).

== History ==
The design for 80 South Street was first released to the public in 2003. Santiago Calatrava has stated that he took the idea for the building from a sculpture he created in 1985. 80 South Street received approval for construction from the City of New York in February 2005; the site on which it was planned to be constructed is currently occupied by a six-story red brick building.

Although 80 South Street had been approved by the city, the project was later cancelled in April 2008. The building did not sell any of its 10 multimillion-dollar residential cubes; the developer of the project also listed the declining U.S. real estate market as a factor in its cancellation.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

The existing building, including the side door entrance on Fletcher Street, was used as the set for API headquarters in the short-lived AMC series RUBICON, filmed in 2010.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is the largest in its field in Iceland and the 9th largest in the [[Nordic countries]]. Advania has corporate clients in the public and private sector. It provides a wide range of IT-services, platforms, cloud [[solution]]s and support to multinational enterprises, governments, big, small and medium-sized businesses.

==History==
Advania traces its roots to three Nordic countries, [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. Over a long period of time each country generated a component of what eventually was braided into one company, Advania AB, in 2012.

=== The first branch was EJS ===
In 1939 the Icelandic entrepreneur Einar J. Skúlason founded '''EJS''', an office equipment repair workshop in Reykjavik. He soon expanded his business, opened a store and started importing office machinery, cash registers etc.  During [[World War II]] the company also repaired guns and [[lighter]]s. EJS eventually became a dominant IT business in Iceland. In 1952 the [[Icelandic Government|Icelandic government]] and the city of [[Reykjavík|Reykjavik]] founded '''Skýrr''', an IT company whose purpose was to take a leading role in computing and recordkeeping in Iceland. The company was privatized in 1995 and later became the core element in a group of companies – including EJS – that merged under the Skýrr brand.

=== The Swedish branch was next to evolve ===
In 1971 the IT company Nokia Elektronic AB – later renamed Datapoint Svenska AB – was founded in Sweden. The company sold [[Datapoint]] computer terminals but later became a network pioneer and a key system integrator in Sweden. In 2003 Datapoint merged with Virtus AB, an IT-company which was founded in 1994 and grew rapidly. Virtus soon became a key player in the Swedish market, focusing on [[Microsoft]] based solutions and offering storage &amp; backup services. In 2003 one the strongest and most comprehensive system integrators in Sweden was created when Datapoint and Virtus merged. The new company was named Kerfi AB.

=== And the Norwegian was third ===
In 1991 Merkantildata Applikasjon was founded in Norway, originally as a business unit within Merkantildata (later ATEA). The company focused on implementing ERP solutions in the Nordic market, industry solutions for retail, property management, logistics, legal and transport &amp; waste management. In 2000 the company changed its name to Hands and was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In 2005 Hands was unlisted, as it was acquired by the Icelandic company Kögun which later merged with Skýrr (see above). Despite changes in ownership Hands kept its Norwegian identity and acquired Nett.2.3 and Completo in 2005.

In 2012 Advania AB was born, when Skýrr from Iceland, Kerfi from Sweden and Hands from Norway merged and became a key challenger in the Scandinavian IT-market.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Since then four companies have been acquired and merged with Advania, the listed Swedish IT company Caperio included.

== Business Areas ==
[[File:Advania HQ.jpg|thumb|The Advania offices in Reykjavik, Iceland.]]
Advania focuses on these four main business areas:

=== Managed Services ===
Advania offers a variety of managed services where clients can offload specific IT operations.

=== IT Infrastructure &amp; Integration ===
Advania offers [[solution]]s for IT infrastructure, integration projects, consultancy and product support. Advania has data center solutions, IT platform projects, virtualization [[solution]]s, [[solution]]s focused on identity and access, as well as development, integration, and support of both software and hardware.

'''Alan Gibbs''' (born 1939) is a New Zealand-born businessman, entrepreneur and art collector. After a successful business career in New Zealand, which made him one of that country's wealthiest individuals, he relocated to London in 1999. He retains strong links to New Zealand through his development of [[Gibbs Farm]], one of the world's leading [[sculpture park]]s. He is the founder of '''Gibbs Amphibians''', based in Detroit, Michigan, [[Nuneaton]], UK, and [[Auckland]], New Zealand, which pioneers high-speed [[amphibious vehicle]] technologies.

==Early life==
Alan Gibbs was born in [[Christchurch]], the son of Theodore Nisbet Gibbs and Elsie Gibbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Goldsmith| first=Paul| title=TN Gibbs| year=2002| publisher=David Ling| location=Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an accountant, [[tax adviser]] and businessman. He was chairman of a 1951 Royal Commission on Taxation. The family moved to [[Wellington]] in 1947 and Alan attended [[Wadestown Primary School]], [[Wellesley College (New Zealand)|Wellesley College]] and [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]]. He undertook three out of four years of an engineering degree at [[Canterbury University]], before switching to economics, completing a BA in 1961. The following year he gained an MA in Economics from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].

==New Zealand business career==
Gibbs went to London in 1963 as Third Secretary in the [[High Commission of New Zealand, London|New Zealand High Commission]], returning to New Zealand in 1965 to work in the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Prime Minister's department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Goldsmith| first=Paul| title=Serious Fun: the life and times of Alan Gibbs| year=2012| publisher=[[Random House]]| location=Auckland| isbn=978-1-86979-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left soon after with a dream to build what he promoted as the first New Zealand car, the [[Anziel Nova]]. In New Zealand's then highly regulated economy he failed to gain the necessary import licences to build the cars, and abandoned the scheme in 1970 after a four-year battle. Gibbs then moved to Sydney for two years, where he worked as a [[merchant bank]]er, returning to set up the [[Chase (bank)|Chase]]-[[National Australia Bank|NAB]] merchant bank in Auckland in 1972. After an early retirement in 1975, he established Gibbs, Saint and Co. in 1977, specialising in corporate advisory work. This later became Gibbs Securities Ltd. 
 
Gibbs' career took off in 1979 when, with three other investors, he purchased Tappenden Motors Ltd. They [[liquidated]] it profitably over the next few years. Gibbs then gained stakes in Atlas Majestic Industries, Bendon and [[Ceramco]], three prominent New Zealand public companies which he merged in 1986 and 1987 and that was liquidated in 1989. Meantime, in 1985 he and Trevor Farmer made a successful $114 million takeover bid for the publicly listed transport and security company Freightways Ltd. In early 1990 the [[Fourth Labour Government]] confirmed it would sell the [[Telecom Corporation of New Zealand]]. Together with merchant banker [[David Richwhite]], Gibbs brokered the $4.25 billion winning bid for the company, which when subsequently floated became the largest company on the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]]. As part of the deal, Gibbs became a director and he and Farmer took a 5 per cent holding in the company. Following a second round of restructuring, led by Gibbs, this holding proved very valuable.

Also in 1990 Gibbs and Farmer invested in and worked with [[Craig Heatley]] to develop [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky TV]], New Zealand's first [[pay television]] company. Gibbs sold most of his New Zealand assets in the late 1990s, retaining Gibbs Farm and an interest in Viaduct Harbour Holdings, the owner of a new waterfront precinct in downtown Auckland and a property portfolio in Wellington with Andrew Wall.

==Political activism==
Having been a member of the New Left Club at Canterbury University, Gibbs had converted to strongly-held [[free-market]] views by the late 1970s. He became a strong supporter of [[Roger Douglas]], the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] in the reforming Fourth Labour Government, 1984–90. Gibbs was appointed chairman of the NZ Forestry Corporation, which in 1987 corporatised the old [[New Zealand Forest Service]]. The loss-making department was restructured and transformed into a profitable [[Government-owned corporation#New Zealand|State Owned Enterprise]]. He was also appointed chairman of the Hospital and Related Services Taskforce, with a brief to recommend reforms for the underperforming public hospital service. Their suggestions, which focused on introducing an internal market into the system, were not taken up by the Labour government but were partially implemented by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|next National Government]].

Gibbs also founded the [[Centre for Independent Studies]] in New Zealand and was an active member of the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]]. He is a member of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], founded by the Austrian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Gibbs was active in the establishment of [[ACT New Zealand]], a [[libertarian political party]] that was formed in 1994. ACT won seven seats in the parliament after the first election under proportional representation in 1996, and has continued to be represented in Parliament since.

==Art and sculpture collection at Gibbs Farm==
Gibbs is one of New Zealand's leading [[art collector]]s, and since 1991 has been establishing a sprawling {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}} sculpture park at [[Gibbs Farm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gibbsfarm.org.nz/| title=Gibbs Farm official website| year=2010| accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://venturebees.com/sculpture-in-the-gibbs-farm/| title=Sculpture in the Gibbs Farm| publisher=VentureBees| date=4 August 2012| accessdate=20 September 2012| author=Haseeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is located on [[Kaipara Harbour]] on New Zealand's [[North Island]], {{convert|50|km}} north of Auckland in the [[Rodney District|Rodney district]].

Among the art works installed on The Farm are monumental pieces by contemporary artists including [[Daniel Buren]], [[Neil Dawson]], [[Marijke de Goey]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Anish Kapoor]], [[George Rickey]], [[Richard Serra]] and [[Bernar Venet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistedsifter.com/2012/07/the-sculptures-of-gibbs-farm-new-zealand/ The Incredible Sculptures of Gibbs Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robgarrettcfa.com/content/2009/06/01/the-farm-alan-gibbs "The Farm"] by Rob Garrett - retrieved 15 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==High speed amphibians==
[[File:UoC graduation April 2014 42.JPG|thumb|Gibbs receiving an honorary doctorate from [[University of Canterbury]] Chancellor [[John Wood (diplomat)|John Wood]] in April 2014]]
Frustrated by the extreme tidal nature of the [[Kaipara Harbour]], that forms the western boundary of his farm, Gibbs began experimenting with [[amphibious vehicle]]s in the early 1990s. In 1997 he began to develop the concept in Detroit. Gibbs relocated the project to the United Kingdom in 1999. He partnered with Neil Jenkins who became CEO and based the operation at Nuneaton. Over the next four years they developed the concept to the point that the [[Aquada]], the world's first road-legal, high-speed amphibian, was shown to the public in September 2003. In June 2004 [[Richard Branson]] drove an Aquada to break the record for an amphibious [[English Channel#Notable channel crossings|crossing of the English Channel]]. In 2007 a new division of the business was set up in Detroit. A major R &amp; D program has been undertaken in Auckland since 2004. Two new high-speed amphibians, the [[Humdinga]] and the [[Gibbs Phibian|Phibian]], were released in Washington in 2012, and a third, the [[Quadski]], arrived on the market in early 2013.

==Personal==
Gibbs was married to Jennifer Gore (now Dame [[Jenny Gibbs]]) for 33 years. They have three daughters, Amanda, Debbi and Emma, and one son, Thane.

'''Alan "Mo" Morris''' (1942– 1 April 2007) was an [[Australia]]n [[advertising agency|advertising]] creative executive, a [[copywriter]] who enjoyed particular success in the 1970s and 80s. Together with his long-time business partner [[Allan Johnston (advertiser)|Allan Johnston]], he formed the Australian [[advertising agency]] [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo]] which enjoyed much local and some international success in the 1980s and whose name survives today as Publicis Mojo, an Australian subsidiary of the [[France|French]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[advertising]] and communications company holding [[Publicis Groupe]].

==Advertising pedigree==
Morris' father Carl Morris was one of the Australian servicemen who upon return from [[World War II]] formed the Melbourne ad agency United Service Publicity - he was the agency's Production Manager. The US agency group Needham Harper Steers entered the Australian market in 1967 by taking a stake in [[DDB Worldwide#DDB in Australia|United Service Publicity]] and changed its name in 1972 to USP Needham, whose lineage can be directly traced to today's Melbourne office of [[DDB Worldwide]]. Alan Morris' brother Don Morris [[Order of Australia|AO]] is also an advertising executive and the two worked together at a number of points in their careers with Don being significantly involved in the life of the [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo]] agency.

==Career==
Morris' first job was as a copywriter in Canada while travelling. On his return to Australia he joined Rogers Holland and Everingham and then Mullins Clarke and Ralph, where he was creative director and had a shareholding.&lt;ref name="Alarcon"&gt;{{cite news | last = Alarcon | first = Camille | date = 3 May 2007 | url = http://www.bandt.com.au/news/46/0c04b446.asp | title = Yabber merges to form Big Red | work =  | publisher = B &amp; T Magazine | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606031707/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/46/0c04b446.asp | archive-date = 6 June 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s he took to freelancing and at one point was teamed with writer Allan Johnston at Hertz Walpole in Sydney. Together they had immediate success as a team working on campaigns for Hertz Walpole's clients [[Meadow Lea]] margarine ("You oughta be congratulated") and [[Tooheys]] beer ("How do you feel?"). In 1975 started their own consultancy and continuing to work on such accounts as they grew their business.&lt;ref name="Hertz Walpole history" &gt;[http://www.mjwadvertising.com.au/about_history.php Hertz Walpole history ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 their creative consultancy became the full-service ad agency [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo]] and Meadow Lea &lt;ref name ="WorldToday"/&gt; and Tooheys &lt;ref name = "SMHJan"/&gt; amongst other clients, signed with the new shop.

During the 1980s Mojo was the hottest creative agency in Sydney and Mo and Jo had success jointly authoring [[World Series Cricket]]'s "[[C'mon Aussie C'mon]]" &lt;ref name = "SMHJan"&gt;{{cite news |first= Julian |last= Lee |authorlink= |title= Doing very nicely, thanks Jan |url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/27/1098667826105.html|work= |publisher= Sydney Morning Herald |date= 28 October 2004 |accessdate= 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later  the [[Tourism Australia|Australian Tourism Commission's]] spot with [[Paul Hogan]]'s instruction to put another "[[Shrimp on the barbie]].&lt;ref name="BakerBendel"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Baker  | first = Bill  | authorlink = and Peggy Bendel  | issue = Summer 2005  | url = http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm  | title = Come and Say G’Day!  | journal = Travel Marketing Decisions  | publisher = The Association of Travel Marketing Executives  | accessdate = 2007-12-21  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104153701/http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm  | archive-date = 4 November 2007  | dead-url = yes  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mojo approach to TV advertisements used a colloquial and irreverent style, often with a catchy jingle  to simple accompaniment. Contrasting against the clipped and British-imitating style of voice presenters on Australian TV up till that point, Mojo ads highlighted Australian idiom and its laconic accent. Ads such as “I’m as Australian as [[Ampol]]”, “Hit ‘em with the Old Pea Beau” (insectide), “Everybody loves [[Speedo]]”, “I Can Feel a [[Castlemaine XXXX|Fourex]] Coming on”, “Every Amco tells a Story” (for Amco jeans) all came out of the Mojo agency in the 1980s. The use of [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]]'s [[I Still Call Australia Home]] to promote [[Qantas]] was developed at Mojo in the late 1980s and until 2011 this campaign concept was still used by Qantas and its ad agencies.&lt;ref name ="WorldToday"&gt;{{cite news |first= Daniel |last= Hoare |authorlink= |title= Tribute to an advertising legend |url= http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s1888748.htm |work= The World Today |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date= 3 April 2007 |accessdate= 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1987 Mojo was acquired by the Melbourne based publicly listed agency Monaghan Dayman [[Phillip Adams|Adams]] Limited and became MojoMDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Phillip H. |last= Dougherty |authorlink= |title= Mojo Office In New York Wins 2 Jobs |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/09/business/the-media-business-advertising-mojo-office-in-new-york-wins-2-jobs.html |work= |publisher= The New York Times |date= 9 May 1988 |accessdate= 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resultant merged business maintained its listed status until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delisted.com.au/Company/5526/MOJO%20MDA%20GROUP%20LIMITED Mojo &amp; MDA listing status&lt;/ref&gt; The Mojo MDA Group had offices in London, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore and affiliates throughout Asia. In 1988 [[Advertising Age]] named it as International Agency of the Year.&lt;ref name="Alarcon"/&gt;

In August 1989 the Mojo MDA Group  was Australia's largest ad agency with billings of $180million and was acquired by the Los Angeles agency [[TBWA\Chiat\Day|Chiat\Day]]. The merger was unsuccessful and in 1992 Chiat/Day sold off Mojo to [[Draftfcb|Foote, Cone &amp; Belding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/tbwa-chiat-day?cat=biz-fin Answers.com - TBWA/Chiat/Day - company history]&lt;/ref&gt; In later international dealings which saw [[Draftfcb|FCB]] acquired by the [[Interpublic Group]], the Australian Mojo offices were sold to [[Publicis Groupe|Publicis]].

Morris had a successful stint at Singleton [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] from the mid to late '90s. In 1999 he teamed up again with Johnston back at Hertz Walpole when Jim Walpole offered them both a shareholding and that agency was at that point renamed "Morris Johnston Walpole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjwadvertising.com.au/about_history.php Hertz Walpole history]&lt;/ref&gt; The re-unification failed to set the advertising world on-fire and in 2002 the veterans accepted an offer for sale from the Japanese multinational communications group [[Hakuhodo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bandt.com.au/news/mo-jo-walpole-sell-to-japan8217s-hakuhodo{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sale to Hakuhodo&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he started an agency named "Yabber" with his brother Don and with TV personality [[Jamie Durie]].&lt;ref name="Alarcon"/&gt; A year later Morris lost his ongoing battle with cancer.

==Personal life==
Alan Morris was at one point married to the Australian television actress and screenwriter [[Judy Morris]]. He has a daughter Michaela Morris with Judy and sons Asher and Ronnie with his long-time wife Lissa.

==Accolades==
Together with Johnston, Morris was acknowledged by his peers with admissions to the Halls of Fame of ''Campaign Brief'' (magazine) in 2006 and the Australian Writer and Art Directors Association in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaignbrief.com/2009/08/award-hall-of-fame-honours-the.html AWARD Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Morris &amp; Johnston were included in the inaugural 12 inductees to ''Ad News'' magazine's, Australian Advertising Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaffa.com.au/adnewsAOTY/halloffame.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213230823/http://www.yaffa.com.au/adnewsAOTY/halloffame.html |archivedate=13 February 2011 }} Ad News Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the Advertising Federation of Australia awarded its AFA Medallion to Mo and Jo describing the pair as "the [[Lennon &amp; McCartney]] of Australian advertising".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bandt.com.au/news/mojo-awarded-afa-medallion {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120718124157/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/mojo-awarded-afa-medallion |date=18 July 2012 }} AFA Medallion&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrej Babiš''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈandrɛj ˈbabɪʃ}}; born 2 September 1954) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] politician of [[Slovak people|Slovak]] origin who has been the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]] since December 2017, and previously served as [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic|Minister of Finance]] and Deputy Prime Minister for the Economy from January 2013 to May 2017. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and entrepreneur.

Babiš was born in [[Bratislava]] in present-day [[Slovakia]], and moved to the Czech Republic following the [[Velvet Revolution]]. The [[List of Czechs by net worth|second richest man in the Czech Republic]] with an estimated net worth of about $4.04&amp;nbsp;billion according to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]],&lt;ref name="Bloomberg net worth"/&gt; he is a former CEO and sole owner of the [[Agrofert]] group, which owns two of the largest Czech newspapers, ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'' and ''[[Lidové noviny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/zpravodajstvi/c1-61586990-andrej-babis-konci-ve-vedei-firmy-agrofert|title=Končím ve vedení Agrofertu, tvrdí Babiš. Majitelem ale zůstává, sám si podepsal výpověď|date=20 January 2014|work=[[Hospodářské noviny]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš has led ANO 2011 since founding it in 2012 as a protest movement against [[The Establishment|established politics]]. He has been a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (MP) since 2013. Babiš was sacked from the [[Bohuslav Sobotka's Cabinet|government]] by Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] on 24 May 2017 after a month-long [[2017 Czech government crisis|coalition crisis]] triggered by allegations that Babiš avoided paying taxes as CEO of [[Agrofert]] in 2012.

Following the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative election]], which resulted in a [[hung parliament]] with no possible coalitions, Babiš was appointed Prime Minister on 6 December 2017 and a week later formed a [[Andrej Babiš' First Cabinet|minority government]] composed of [[ANO 2011|ANO]] party members and [[Independent politician|independents]]. He became the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic#Statistics|oldest]] and wealthiest person ever to assume the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|premiership]], as well as the first Prime Minister in the history of the Czech Republic to be from a different party than [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] or [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]]. On 16 January 2018, his government lost [[Motion of no confidence|motion of confidence]] vote (78 MPs for while 117 against) in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and he resigned the following day. His [[Andrej Babiš' Second Cabinet|second cabinet]], confirmed by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 July 2018, is the first government since the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of Communism in 1989]] to rely on [[confidence and supply|support]] from the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/czech-communists-return-to-government-as-power-brokers|title=Czech communists return to government as power brokers|last=Tait|first=Robert|date=2018-07-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš had been under investigation by both [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech Police]] and [[European Anti-fraud Office|OLAF]] from 2015 to 2017 amid allegations that an anonymous company he controlled unlawfully received €2m [[European Regional Development Fund|subsidy]] from the [[European Union]]. In September 2017, he was stripped his [[parliamentary immunity]] after a police request in connection with the case and Babiš was formally charged on 9 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/czech-election-front-runner-charged-with-subsidy-fraud/|title=Czech election front-runner charged with subsidy fraud|date=9 October 2017|work=POLITICO|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Anti-Fraud Office|OLAF]] concluded its investigation in December 2017 stating it has found irregularities and endorsed the steps taken by the [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/eu-antifraud-office-finds-irregularities-in-payments-allegedly-obtained-by-czech-pm|title=EU antifraud office finds 'irregularities' in payments allegedly obtained by Czech PM|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2018-01-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his re-election in the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 election]] he regained his parliamentary immunity and the Chamber of Deputies voted again to lift it on 19 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-politics/czech-lower-house-votes-to-lift-immunity-of-prime-minister-idUSKBN1F81EH|title=Czech lawmakers lift PM Babis's immunity amid fraud allegations|date=19 January 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as alleged fraud, Babiš is the subject of sustained criticism from political opponents and the media regarding a number of issues, including conflict of interest, his past role in the [[StB|communist secret police]], and allegations of intimidation of opponents. Despite this, Babiš remains one of the most popular politicians in the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/05/29/uk-czech-politics-spying-idUKKBN0OE17820150529?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|title=Czech court clears ex-PM's aide in scandal that toppled government|date=30 May 2015|agency=Reuters|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/10/21/czech-donald-trump-set-becoming-next-prime-minister/787285001/|title='Czech Donald Trump' set on becoming next prime minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/czech-voters-hand-euroskeptic-babis-big-victory/|title='Czech Trump' Babiš claims big victory|date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/czech-trump-adrej-babis-poised-to-deliver-latest-blow-to-eu-order-20171017-gz2y27.html|title='Czech Trump' Andrej Babis poised to deliver latest blow to EU order|first=Nick|last=Miller|date=18 October 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career ==
Babiš was born on 2 September 1954 to a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] family in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]). His father, a diplomat and member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], represented [[Czechoslovakia]] during the negotiation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in [[Geneva]] and as a consultant at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financninoviny.cz/zpravy/e15-cz-miliardar-babis-koupil-ringier-za-ctyri-miliardy-korun/955114|title=E15.cz: Miliardář Babiš koupil Ringier za čtyři miliardy korun|date=24 June 2013|publisher=e15.cz – Finanční noviny (originally [[ČTK]])|language=Czech|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.sk/clanok/155805/rebricek-miliardarov-babis-je-medzi-najbohatsimi-ludmi-sveta.html|title=Rebríček miliardárov: Babiš je medzi najbohatšími ľuďmi sveta! |date=12 March 2010|publisher=[[Nový čas]]|language=Slovak|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is nephew of Ervin and [[Viera Scheibner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anobudelip.cz/cs/o-nas/blogy/12512/muj-podrobny-zivotopis|title=Můj příběh|last=Babiš|first=Andrej|publisher=[[Action of Dissatisfied Citizens|ANO 2011]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Slavkay, Michal Kaličiak: Významní slovenskí geológovia. Bratislava : Veda, 2000, p. 399. {{ISBN|80-224-0639-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš spent part of his childhood abroad, and was educated in Paris and [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=Politico /&gt; Later, he studied at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Bratislava and continued to the [[University of Economics in Bratislava|University of Economics]], where he studied [[international trade]]. In 1978, after graduating, he joined the Slovak communist controlled international trade company, ''Chemapol Bratislava'', which later became ''Petrimex''. In 1985 he was appointed as the organisation's representative in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="e15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nazory.euro.e15.cz/profily/zemedelstvi-andrej-babis-ovladl-s-nekolika-akciemi-ovladne-politiku-s-par-tisici-podporovatelu-722171|title=Zemědělství Andrej Babiš ovládl s několika akciemi.

== Business career ==
[[File:Chodovec, Klíčova a Pyšelská, Agrofert.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of Agrofert in [[Chodov (Prague)|Chodov]], Prague.]]
Babiš returned from Morocco to Czechoslovakia in 1991, after the [[Velvet Revolution]],&lt;ref name=Politico /&gt; and settled in the [[Czech Republic]] after the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. 

In January 1993, Babiš became managing director of a newly established Petrimex subsidiary operating in the Czech Republic, [[Agrofert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reflex.cz/clanek/zpravy/52406/legenda-o-svatem-andrejovi-reflex-odhaluje-zapomenute-informace-o-babisove-zbohatnuti.html|title=Legenda o svatém Andrejovi.

Petrimex later fired Babiš and sued him, unsuccessfully, for allowing the firm's stake in Agrofert to be diluted.&lt;ref name="respekt"/&gt; Soon thereafter, Babiš emerged as the 100% owner of Agrofert.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bne.eu/content/story/comment-why-next-czech-pm-surrounding-himself-police-and-spooks |title=Why is the next Czech PM surrounding himself with police and spooks? |website=Bne.eu |date=14 November 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the initial financing for Babiš's takeover of Agrofert from Petrimex was still undisclosed as of the start of 2016,&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; although Babiš has said that the money came from his Swiss former schoolmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2017/10/czech-trump-shoots-power-rise-and-rise-andrej-babi |title=The Czech Trump shoots for power: the rise and rise of Andrej Babiš |last=Anderson |first= Robert|date=21 October 2017 |website=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Babiš gradually developed Agrofert into one of the largest companies in the country,&lt;ref name="respekt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respekt.cz/respekt-in-english/the-richest-czech-keeps-a-secret|first=Jaroslav|last=Spurný|title=The richest Czech keeps a secret|date=13 May 2002|publisher=respekt.cz|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting as a wholesale and trading firm, but later acquiring various agricultural, [[food processing]], and [[Chemical industry|chemical]] companies. In 2011 Agrofert Holding consisted of more than 230 companies,&lt;ref name=ar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233127/http://www.agrofert.cz/f/?2124%2Fvyrocni-zprava-2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in the Czech Republic, [[Slovakia]], and [[Germany]]. It is the [[List of companies of the Czech Republic#Largest by revenue|fourth largest]] company in the Czech Republic by revenue, exceeding [[CZK]] 117&amp;nbsp;billion. The history of Agrofert, detailed in a book by the journalist [[Tomáš Pergler]], is closely linked to its control of the Czech petrochemicals industry. One reviewer of the book said the account "captures much of what has led Czechs to the conviction that they live in a corrupted, clientist country – and (paradoxically) then to vote for the ANO movement."&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; When Babiš entered politics he resigned as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], but remained sole owner until February 2017, when he was legally obliged to put his companies in [[Trust law|trust]] in order to remain as [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name=ar/&gt;

While Babiš's business activities initially focused mainly on agriculture,&lt;ref name="e15"/&gt; he later acquired a large empire of media companies. In 2013, Agrofert purchased the company [[MAFRA]], publisher of two of the biggest Czech newspapers, ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' and ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'', and operator of the [[Óčko]] television company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/ekonomika/232763-babis-koupil-mafru-do-obsahu-novin-zasahovat-nebude-rika-jeho-mluvci/|title=Babiš koupil Mafru.

== Political career ==
[[File:Andrej Babis Sebastian Kurz 2015 (16330390570).jpg|thumb|Babiš with Austrian Foreign Minister [[Sebastian Kurz]] in February 2015]]
In 2011, Babiš founded his party, [[ANO 2011]], "to fight corruption and other ills in the country's political system".&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/business/16648-babiss-purchase-of-mafra-raises-questions-of-motives.html|title=Babiš's purchase of Mafra raises questions of motives|last=Bardsley|first=Daniel |date=3 July 2013|publisher=Prague Monitor|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party contested the [[Czech legislative election, 2013|legislative elections in October 2013]] and emerged as the second largest party, with 47 seats (of 200) in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]]. The American political consulting firm, [[Penn Schoen Berland]], was credited with the party's successful result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140409005938/en/PSB%E2%80%99s-Alex-Braun-Awarded-2014-Campaign-Excellence#.VS3E0_nF8RN |title=PSB's Alex Braun Awarded the 2014 Campaign Excellence Award for International Campaign Consultant of the Year |publisher=Business Wire |date=9 April 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenka Zlámalová |url=http://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-22742060-obamuv-vzestup-se-podoba-zelenym |title=Alexander Braun: Obamův vzestup se podobá zeleným &amp;#124; |website=Hospodářské noviny |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent [[Bohuslav Sobotka's Cabinet|coalition government]], formed of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]], ANO, and the [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|Christian Democrats]], Babiš served as the [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/255713-ministerstvo-financi-bude-nakonec-ridit-babis/|title=Ministerstvo financí bude nakonec řídit Babiš|last=Matyášová|first=Veronika |date=22 December 2013|publisher=[[Czech Television]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure in this role, Babiš introduced controversial policies such as electronic registration of sales, known as EET, proposed reverse charging of [[value-added tax]], and VAT control statement for companies. His critics claimed he was tightening regulations on [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] and [[sole proprietorship]] while turning a blind eye to big corporations, to the benefit of his own [[Agrofert]] holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.respekt.cz/komentare/tri-miliardy-od-babise-pro-babise|title=Tři miliardy od Babiše pro Babiše|last=Spurný|first=Jaroslav|work=[[Respekt]]|language=Czech|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he stated many times that he would like to be the next [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]] if ANO 2011 led the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-64253570-andrej-babis-chce-byt-pristim-premierem-a-proto-se-cini-je-stale-vice-videt-v-zahranici|title=Andrej Babiš chce být příštím premiérem, a proto se činí.

In May 2015, after the government's decision to extend reduced taxation of biofuels (a segment of the fuel market controlled significantly by companies in the Agrofert portfolio), the opposition initiated a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] against the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312308-opozicni-top-09-ods-a-usvit-navrhnou-vysloveni-neduvery-vlade/|title=Opoziční TOP 09, ODS a Úsvit navrhnou vyslovení nedůvěry vládě|date=21 May 2015|publisher=Czech Television|language=Czech|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May 2015 while speaking to the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], Babiš said that he was forced to enter politics because of "corrupted opposition" (referring to the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]]) that "created him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312823-babis-kalouskovi-ja-si-neznicim-jmeno-pro-nejake-drobne/ |title=Babiš Kalouskovi: "Já si nezničím jméno pro nějaké drobné" |date=26 May 2015 |publisher=Czech Television |language=Czech |accessdate=26 May 2015 |quote=Vy jste zapomněli, že jste mě stvořili – vy, zkorumpovaná pravice.

In September 2015, deputy prime minister Babiš called for [[NATO]] intervention against human trafficking in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/finance-minister-andrej-babis-calls-on-nato-to-destroy-human-smugglers-ships|title=Finance Minister Andrej Babiš calls on NATO to destroy human smugglers’ ships|website=Radio Prague|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After talks on the migrant crisis with NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]], Babiš said that "NATO is not interested in refugees, although Turkey, a NATO member, is their entrance gate to Europe and smugglers operate on Turkish territory".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-minister-babis-criticises-nato-s-stance-on-refugees/1256815 Czech minister Babis criticises NATO´s stance on refugees]".

===2017 government crisis===
Andrej Babiš was sacked from the [[Bohuslav Sobotka's Cabinet|government]] by Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] on 24 May 2017 after a month-long [[2017 Czech government crisis|coalition crisis]] triggered by allegations that Babiš avoided paying taxes as CEO of [[Agrofert]] in 2012.

[[File:V4 leaders Dec17.jpg|thumb|Andrej Babiš during his first full day in office with [[Visegrád Group|Visegrad Group]] leaders on 14 December 2017 at the [[European Council]].]]
Following the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 election]] to the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], in which [[ANO 2011]] won with 29% of the vote, and won 78 out of 200 seats, President [[Miloš Zeman]] asked Babiš to form a government. The [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and other parties refused to join a coalition government with Babis, citing the ongoing criminal investigation into alleged EU subsidy fraud and, as a result, on 27 October 2017 Babiš announced that he would try to form a [[minority government]]. [[Freedom and Direct Democracy]] (SPD) and the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]] voiced their willingness to join the government, but were refused by Babiš.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/babis-nova-vlada-mensinova-ano-odbornici-zeman-f4y-/domaci.aspx?c=A171027_111406_domaci_kop|title=Babiš navrhne menšinovou vládu ANO doplněnou o nestranické odborníky|date=2017-10-27|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2017, Babiš was appointed the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]]. He assumed the office on 13 December 2017, when his government took full control of the [[Government of the Czech Republic|executive government]]. He is the only incumbent head of government to be charged with a crime by the [[Police of the Czech Republic|Czech police]] and prosecutor, as well as both the oldest and the wealthiest Prime Minister in the country's history, and the first Prime Minister from a party other than [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] and [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]]. 

During his first days in office, he attended the [[European Council]] summit dealing with fiscal responsibilities, [[Brexit]] and [[European migrant crisis|migration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/aktualne/premier-babis-discussed-the-future-of-the-euro-area-and-brexit-progress-with-european-statesmen-162296/|title=Premier Babiš discussed the future of the Euro Area and Brexit progress with European statesmen {{!}} Government of the Czech Republic|website=www.vlada.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke on the phone with new Polish Prime Minister [[Mateusz Morawiecki]] regarding the [[Polish Constitutional Court crisis, 2015|invocation of the Article 7]] by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/aktualne/premier-babis-spoke-on-the-phone-with-the-polish-prime-minister-morawiecki-162424/|title=Premier Babiš spoke on the phone with the Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki {{!}} Government of the Czech Republic|website=www.vlada.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His government carried out personnel changes at the ministries, [[České dráhy|Czech Railways]] and the [[Správa železniční dopravní cesty|Railway Infrastructure Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/458692-babisova-vlada-bez-duvery-vymenila-vetsinu-ridiciho-vyboru-ceskych-drah.html|title=Babišova vláda bez důvěry vyměnila většinu řídicího výboru Českých drah|work=Novinky.cz|access-date=2018-01-03|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2018, Babiš's cabinet lost a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] by 117 votes to 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muller|first1=Robert|title=Czech PM Babis battles fraud charges as cabinet loses confidence vote|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-government-confidence/czech-pm-babis-battles-fraud-charges-as-cabinet-loses-confidence-vote-idUSKBN1F42QF?il=0|website=Reuters|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, his cabinet approved the [[European Fiscal Compact]] and sent it to the Chamber of Deputies for further approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/ekonomika/2390659-vlada-po-sesti-letech-schvalila-pristoupeni-k-fiskalnimu-paktu-eu-hlasi-se-k|title=Vláda po šesti letech schválila přistoupení k fiskálnímu paktu EU.

[[File:Informal dinner of EU heads of state or government (40347583080).jpg|thumb|Babiš with Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]], 16 May 2018]]

After losing the confidence vote, Babiš's administration continued to carry out personnel changes, meeting with criticism from the opposition. Minister of Health [[Adam Vojtěch]] fired [[Svatopluk Němeček]], a former Minister and head of the University Hospital in [[Ostrava]], as well as the director of the [[Bulovka Hospital]]. Minister of Industry and Trade [[Tomáš Hüner]] and Minister of Interior [[Lubomír Metnar]] fired the heads of [[CzechInvest]] and [[Česká pošta|Czech Post]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/2400022-personalni-zmeny-bez-duvery-vlada-ma-na-uctu-uz-nekolik-vysokych-hlav|title=Personální změny bez důvěry.

In March 2018, Babiš ordered three [[Russia]]n diplomats to leave the country in a show of solidarity with the [[United Kingdom]] after a former Russian double agent [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Sergei Skripal was poisoned]] in [[Salisbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech Republic expels three Russian diplomats |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/czech-republic-expels-three-russian-diplomats |work=Radio Prague |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that there had been "no moral or political justification" for the post-war [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of ethnic Germans]] from Czechoslovakia. Babiš responded: "I reject this characterisation – especially when we recall the horrors of [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], [[Lidice]], [[Ležáky]] and the killing of our paratroopers. I have the feeling that there is some internal political struggle in Germany now, and it is very unfortunate that old wounds are opening because of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Merkel calls Sudeten German expulsion “immoral”, drawing Czech ire |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/merkel-calls-sudeten-german-expulsion-immoral-drawing-czech-ire |work=Czech Radio |date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2018, Babiš reached a coalition agreement with the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]]. The new cabinet took office after winning a confidence vote on 12 July 2018, with support from the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1337401/world|title=Czech government wins confidence vote backed by Communists|date=12 July 2018|work=Arab News|access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== State Security Police (StB) agent ===
According to the documents of the [[National Memory Institute (Slovakia)|National Memory Institute]] in Slovakia, Babiš collaborated with the State Security Police ([[StB]]) of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|communist Czechoslovakia]], under the [[code name]] agent Bureš. He denies the accusations, and in 2012 sued the institute for [[defamation]]. In January 2018, the Bratislava regional court ruled definitively that Babiš was an StB agent. This final court case may not be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/2389540-babis-definitivne-prohral-soud-se-slovenskymi-historiky-zda-byl-ve-svazcich-stb|title=Babiš definitivně prohrál soud se slovenskými historiky, zda byl ve svazcích StB oprávněně|work=ČT24|access-date=2018-02-13|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20759872/babis-definitivne-prehral-sud-s-upn-o-tom-ci-ho-moze-evidovat-v-zvazkoch-stb.html|title=Babiš definitívne prehral súd, ÚPN ho eviduje vo zväzkoch ŠTB oprávnene|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=domov.sme.sk|access-date=2018-02-13|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve unrelated cases investigated by StB from 1982 to 1985 were associated with the code name Bureš, according to the Slovak National Memory Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echo24.cz/a/iuFqu/babisuv-soud-kvuli-stb---agent-bures-figuruje-ve-12-spisech|title=Babišův soud kvůli StB – agent Bureš figuruje ve 12 spisech|date=15 May 2014|publisher=Echo24.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš appeared once at the court during the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/260344-babis-se-pry-s-stb-nespolcil-vedome-soud-odrocen-na-duben/|title=Babiš se prý s StB nespolčil vědomě, soud odročen na duben|date=30 January 2014|publisher=CT24.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court in [[Bratislava]] issued a ruling on 26 June 2014 that there was insufficient evidence to put Andrej Babiš on a list of intentional cooperators with [[StB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/slovak-court-says-andrej-babis-wrongly-labeled-communist-agent-1403787683|title=Court Says Andrej Babis Wrongly Labeled Communist Agent|date=26 June 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slovakpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/eu-news/39817-slovak-press-criticizes-babis-court-decision|title=Slovak press criticizes Babiš court decision Slovak|date=27 June 2014|work=The Prague Post|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was criticised in the Slovak press,&lt;ref name="slovakpress"/&gt; and the National Memory Institute announced it would appeal to a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/06/26/slovak-court-czech-finance-minister-andrej-babis-was-not-communist-era-secret/|title=Slovak court: Czech Finance Minister Andrej Babiš was not a communist-era secret police agent|date=26 June 2014|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2015, Bratislava's County Court upheld the verdict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/316219-potvrzeno-babis-ve-svazcich-stb-byt-nema/|title=Potvrzeno: Babiš ve svazcích StB být nemá|date=30 June 2015|publisher=[[ČT24]]|language=Czech|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in October 2017 the Slovak Constitutional Court upheld the National Memorial Institute's appeal, annulling the earlier court decisions and finding that Babiš had been an agent of the former communist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/slovak-court-annuls-rulings-that-andrej-babis-wrongly-appeared-as-stb-agent|title=Slovak court annuls rulings that Andrej Babiš wrongly appeared as StB agent|date=12 October 2017|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|language=English|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Babiš has also been accused of using his StB background and Communist Party connections to enrich himself.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Babiš has denied that he was a StB collaborator, but his close associates include Czech lawyer Libor Široký, now chairman of Agrofert's supervisory board, who is reportedly also a former member of one of the StB units most closely linked to the Soviet KGB.&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{cite web|last=Drda |first=Adam |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/andrej-babis-czech-oligarch/ |title=Andrej Babiš – Czech oligarch – Politico |website=[[politico.eu]] |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=April 2018}} who accuse him of KGB connections also point to his alleged support for the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]], and his opposition to international sanctions against Russia.{{cn|date=April 2018}} When a Lebanese arms dealer with alleged Russian connections was released by Czech authorities instead of being extradited to the United States, and it was revealed that every official involved in the release was an ANO party member or was associated with Babis, he was again accused of having an allegiance to Russia.&lt;ref name="dailycaller.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gabriel|last=Meyr |url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/10/czech-prime-minister-defends-release-of-hezbollah-terror-suspect/ |title=Czech Prime Minister Defends Release of Hezbollah Terror Suspect |work=The Daily Caller |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/1585445|title=Politiky rozhodnutí soudu o Babišovi a StB nepřekvapilo {{!}} ČeskéNoviny.cz|website=www.ceskenoviny.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reflex.cz/clanek/rozhovory/85037/andrej-babis-byl-tajnym-spolupracovnikem-stb-vedome-rika-slovensky-badatel-sivos.html|title=Andrej Babiš byl tajným spolupracovníkem StB vědomě, říká slovenský badatel Sivoš - Reflex.cz|work=Reflex.cz|access-date=2018-02-13|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://domaci.eurozpravy.cz/politika/215517-smutne-premierem-by-nemel-byt-estebak-politici-na-verdikt-o-babisovi-reaguji-dost-drsne/|title=Smutné, premiérem by neměl být estébák.

In March 2015, Babiš condemned Russia's [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/363482-rozdeleni-ukrajiny-by-bylo-jako-obetovani-ceskoslovenska-z-roku-1938-mini-babis.html Rozdělení Ukrajiny by bylo jako obětování Československa z roku 1938, míní Babiš]" (in Czech). Novinky. 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 [[Anne Applebaum]], a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist specializing in Russian and Eastern European affairs, listed Babiš among several Eastern European leaders who she considered to be agents of influence for Putin's Russia. Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', she suggested that old labels from Soviet Communist days, such as "useful idiots" and "fellow travelers", were no longer adequate to describe Babis and the other figures she had named. To illustrate her point, she listed several quotes from each leader that sounded very similar to each other and to the arguments broadcast at the same time by official Russian news sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Applebaum |first=Anne |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/neither-agents-of-influence-nor-useful-idiots/2015/10/16/73fdc478-7423-11e5-8248-98e0f5a2e830_story.html |title=Russia's new kind of friends |work=The Washington Post |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babiš responded to Applebaum with a letter to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stating that he had no friends in Russia and was an American ally. US journalist [[Gabriel Meyr]] challenged those claims by citing three examples of actions Babiš has taken that have furthered Russian policy goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabriel Meyr |url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/01/putin-hiding-under-a-czech-candle/ |title=Putin Hiding Under A Czech Candle |work=The Daily Caller |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[Government of the Czech Republic|Czech government]] loan guarantee to a Russian company with a record of defaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlidacipes.org/miliardove-ztraty-z-obchodu-s-ruskem-vyresime-slibuje-ceb-i-egap/ |title=Miliardové ztráty z obchodů s Ruskem vyřešíme, slibuje ČEB i EGAP |publisher=HlidaciPes.org |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by a close friend of [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.e15.cz/byznys/finance-a-bankovnictvi/egap-se-zarucil-za-dvoumiliardovy-uver-na-vyvoz-technologii-do-ruska-1242118 |title=EGAP se zaručil za dvoumiliardový úvěr na vývoz technologií do Ruska &amp;#124; E15.cz |publisher=Zpravy.e15.cz |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the Czech Finance Ministry's continued racing of the thoroughbred horses owned by Chechen President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], a close ally of Putin, even though he is under international sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia-insider.com/en/2015/03/11/4312 |title=Czech Officials on Holy Quest to Prevent Chechen Leader from Horse-Profiteering |publisher=Russia-insider.com |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final example was that Babis had disclosed in 2007 that Agrofert was negotiating to purchase gas from the Czech subsidiary of [[Gazprom]] instead of its German supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alena Adámková |url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-20716430-babisuv-agrofert-uvazuje-o-zmene-dodavatele-plynu |title=Babišův Agrofert uvažuje o změně dodavatele plynu &amp;#124; |work=Hospodářské noviny |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, on the day commemorating the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|Communist takeover in 1948]], hundreds of protesters opposed to Babiš gathered in [[Wenceslas Square]] to protest that Babiš was advancing an agenda that would infringe Czech freedoms, described by leaders of the protest as a quiet revolution, happening in gradual steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguemonitor.com/2016/02/26/finmins-opponents-warn-his-creeping-freedom-restriction |title=FinMin's opponents warn of his creeping freedom restriction |publisher=Prague Monitor |date=26 February 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged son kidnapping ===
In November 2018, Seznam News television aired an interview with Babiš' son Andrej Babiš Junior (born 1982) in which he alleged he was kidnapped by his father's associate in order to thwart corruption inquiry regarding [[Andrej Babiš#EU subsidies fraud|Stork's Nest Farm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/czech-pm-andrej-babis-accused-of-kidnapping-son-to-avert-corruption-inquiry-60jtxs63v|title=Czech PM Andrej Babis accused of kidnapping son to thwart corruption inquiry|website=thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/czech-pm-andrej-babis-future-hangs-in-balance-after-sons-kidnap-claims|title=Czech PM's future hangs in balance after son's kidnap claims|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš Junior was quoted as saying he had been held in [[Crimea]], [[Kaliningrad]], [[Moscow]] and [[Kryvyi Rih]] in Ukraine to stop him from giving statement to the police about his involvement in the case. Prime Minister Babiš denied the kidnapping but admitted that his son entered Crimea, among others, while saying that his son suffers from [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46194329|title=Andrej Babis: Czech PM denies son was kidnapped|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/prulomove-svedectvi-v-kauze-capi-hnizdo-slonkova-a-kubik-vypatrali-zmizeleho-babisova-syna-60198?utm_source=Seznamzpravy_static&amp;utm_medium=babisuv-syn-doporucene-clanky&amp;utm_campaign=doporucene-clanky-special|title=Průlomové svědectví v kauze Čapí hnízdo.

===Partnership with Zeman===
Babiš has been linked closely to President [[Miloš Zeman]] since at least 2001, when Zeman was [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]], and his business interests are alleged to have benefited from the association. In 2001, Zeman oversaw the sale of [[Unipetrol]], a state-owned chemical company, to Babiš. Babiš pulled out of the sale, but later oversaw the sale of the firm to a Polish company. According to Polish reports, the sale was accompanied by substantial bribery, although Babis denies any bribes were paid.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192124/http://www.wprost.pl/ar/76068/Unipetrol-bez-lapowki-aktl/|title=Unipetrol bez łapówki? aktl. – WPROST|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unipetrol deal is cited often as evidence of a strong partnership between Babiš and Zeman that persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|trans-title=Zeman and Babiš have bad news for Sobotka. He won't like it.|title=Zeman a Babiš mají pro Sobotku špatnou zprávu.

=== Conflicts of interest ===
[[File:Ing Andrej Babis.png|thumbnail|right|Connections between companies in the AGROFERT portfolio]]
Babis has been criticized by media and opposition politicians for his alleged [[conflict of interest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/325603-kalousek-babis-nebude-na-ministerstvu-ve-stretu-zajmu-jen-na-zachode.html|title=Kalousek: Babiš nebude na ministerstvu ve střetu zájmů jen na záchodě|date=25 January 2014|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|language=Czech|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1126672097-otazky-vaclava-moravce/215411030501004/|title=Otázky Václava Moravce|work=Česká televize|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Minister of Finance and the owner of companies subsidized by EU funding programmes. During a visit to the Czech Republic in March 2014, the German [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Ingeborg Gräßle]] expressed concern that someone with such a personal financial interest simultaneously being a leading representative of a state, could not guarantee to the EU that its resources are properly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/europoslankyne-kritizuje-babisuv-stret-zajmu-flg-/domaci.aspx?c=A140327_141015_domaci_jav|title=Europoslankyně: Babiš je ve vážném střetu zájmů, měl by se vzdát firem|date=27 March 2014|work=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article in the political newspaper ''[[Politico]]'' commented that "the Czech Republic is now a paradox: a society disgusted with corruption has given huge power to a man whose business interests amount to the biggest conflict of interest in the country’s post-1989 history."&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt;

In May 2015, Babis's alleged financial irregularities and accusations from the public and the opposition that he had promoted his companies in [[Government procurement in the European Union|government procurements]] triggered a [[Czech Republic Government Vote of No Confidence, 2015|vote of no confidence against the Bohuslav Sobotka's government]], called by the opposition parties [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]], [[TOP 09]], and [[Dawn of Direct Democracy|Dawn]]. The motion was defeated by 47-105.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312883-opozice-s-vyslovenim-neduvery-sobotkove-vlade-neuspela/|title=Opozice s vyslovením nedůvěry Sobotkově vládě neuspěla|date=26 June 2014|publisher=[[ČT24]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2015, a retired senior American intelligence officer published an opinion article using Babiš as an example of a corrupt politician with conflicts of interest and probable ties to Russia. In the article, he speculated whether United States government investigations into bribery and corruption in FIFA may herald more aggressive investigation of other corrupt practices. The article mentioned that several investigations had been launched by a team of police and prosecutor, which were questionable cases that did not hold up in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/05/do-fifa-arrests-presage-further-investigations-in-europe/2/|title=Do FIFA Arrests Presage Further Investigations in Europe?|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation ===
Babiš has a reputation for surrounding himself with senior police officers, security agents, and former Communist informers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In June 2015, Babiš provoked controversy when a member of parliament, Ladislav Šincl of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (ČSSD), criticised a change in policy from the Finance Ministry on a bill reducing commissions for life insurance mediators in the Chamber of Deputies, and alleged that the benefits to Babiš's business interests may be the cause of the change.&lt;ref name="Čtk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-cssd-wants-finmin-babis-to-apologise-for-stb-like-conduct/1228928|title=Czech CSSD wants FinMin Babis to apologise for "StB-like" conduct|author=ČTK|work=ceskenoviny.cz|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2015, Babiš met with Šincl and accused him of corruption and taking bribes from businessman and senator [[Ivo Valenta]], owner of the Synot gambling group. According to witnesses, Babiš brought to the meeting a folder marked with a yellow note labelled ''Šincl'', and started shouting at Šincl that he knew Šincl took bribes from Valenta and was corrupt. He later moved onto his family and Šincl's former jobs.&lt;ref name="ihned.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ihned.cz/c1-64188810-babisovy-metody-pripominaji-stb-stezuje-si-cssd-babis-neomluvim-se-sincl-lze|title=Babiš po jednání koaliční rady: Se Šinclem se sejdu, omlouvat se ale nebudu|work=Hospodářské noviny|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2015, Babiš admitted he had a folder with Šincl's name, but denied intimidation, saying, "It's not the materials. It's articles from the media. Do the media write lies? I just showed what the media writes, I think they do their job well. When I go to a meeting, I prepare myself so I know who I am dealing with". Babiš's coalition partners [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]] (Šincl's party) and [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|KDU-ČSL]] demanded an apology, but Babiš refused, saying that Šincl had lied about him in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]]. Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]], also the chairman of ČSSD, called a coalition meeting on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/315035-babis-sinclovi-se-neomluvim-informace-o-nem-jsem-cerpal-z-medii/ |title=Babiš: Šinclovi se neomluvím, informace o něm jsem čerpal z médií |date=18 June 2015 |publisher=[[ČT24]] |accessdate=18 June 2015 |quote=Nejsou to materiály.

Když jdu na nějaké jednání, tak se připravím, abych věděl, s kým jdu jednat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Šincl described Babiš' tactic, of reading potentially damaging facts about him from a file marked with his name, was reminiscent of StB tactics.&lt;ref name="novinky.cz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Čtk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihned.cz"/&gt; [[Miroslav Kalousek]], the first deputy chairman of the opposition party [[TOP09]], also accused Babiš of using StB practices, which Babiš denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.cz/en/section/news/finance-minister-babis-under-fire-for-sincl-incident|title=Finance Minister Babiš under fire for Šincl incident|date=18 June 2015|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MF Dnes leaked tapes ===
On 1 May 2017, Twitter account @skupinasuman posted a tape of Babiš's private conversations with an unknown number of people, in which he labelled Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Lubomír Zaorálek]] as an "idiot" and attacked investigative journalist Sabina Slonková, among others. On 3 May 2017, a video on YouTube alleged that Andrej Babiš had interfered with the editorial independence of ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'', the nation's largest quality newspaper by circulation, owned by Babis's trust. In conversation with MF Dnes journalist [[Marek Přibil]] he discusses the date of publication of damaging stories about Minister of Interior [[Milan Chovanec]] and Minister of Health [[Miloslav Ludvík]]. On the tape, Babiš is recorded instructing Přibil to tell František Nachtigall, the director of strategic development, about when and how to publish the stories.

=== Comments about Lety concentration camp ===
On 1 September 2016, while visiting [[Varnsdorf]], a city with large [[Romani people in the Czech Republic|Romani population]], Babiš said: "What those idiots [journalists] write in newspapers, that the [[Lety concentration camp|camp in Lety]] was a concentration camp, that is a lie, it was a [[labor camp]], people who didn't work ended up there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/babis-na-romech-parazituje-pritom-se-o-ne-nikdy-nezajimal-re/r~5e1850de711511e6888a0025900fea04/ |title=Sobotka: Babiš se o Romy nikdy nezajímal, teď na nich parazituje.

Kdo nepracoval, šup a byl tam. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babiš's comments were heavily criticized by both coalition partners and opposition MPs calling on him to resign. Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] condemned the remarks on Facebook, saying that "between [[populism]] and extremism there is a thin line and Babiš crossed it" and asked him to "properly apologize and visit Lety to learn about history of our state."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

Minister for Human Rights and Equal Opportunities [[Jiří Dienstbier Jr.|Jiří Dienstbier]] called for Babiš to step down as Finance Minister and First Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.cz/en/section/news/finance-minister-apologises-for-comments-about-romanies-and-lety-camp|title=Finance Minister apologises for comments about Romanies and Lety camp|date=2 September 2016|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of both opposition parties, [[Petr Fiala]] from [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] and [[Miroslav Kalousek]] from [[TOP 09]] also called for Babiš to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://echo24.cz/a/iuQ75/musi-odejit-zadaji-politici-hlavu-babise-za-zpochybnovani-holocaustu|title=Musí odejít, žádají politici hlavu Babiše za zpochybňování holocaustu
|date=2 September 2016|publisher=Echo24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media criticism==
''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine gave Babis the nickname ''Babisconi'', a portmaneau of his surname and the surname of former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the subject of numerous political and financial scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/10/now-the-czechs-have-an-oligarch-problem-too-andrej-babis/|title=Now the Czechs Have an Oligarch Problem, Too|date=10 April 2015|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Babiš threatened to sue the magazine, but has never done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/308183-babis-jde-do-boje-s-americkym-listem-snuska-lzi-na-objednavku-z-ceska/|title=Babiš jde do boje s americkým listem: Snůška lží na objednávku z Česka|date=17 April 2015|publisher=[[ČT24]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the Swiss weekly ''[[L'Hebdo]]'' published an article entitled: "Why do Czech Oligarchs Buy Unprofitable Media Outlets?" examining the purchase of media companies by several Czech business people, and also their connections with Francophone Switzerland. The article focused much of its attention on Babiš, and his purchase of media outlets in the Czech Republic. The author pointed out that Babiš had claimed to invest in ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'' only for profit, but had given no answer when told it was an unprofitable investment, and went on to accuse journalists at Babis's newspapers of doing his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebdo.ch/hebdo/cadrages/detail/oligarques-tch%C3%A8ques-pourquoi-ils-aiment-la-presse-et-la-suisse-romande|title=Oligarques tchèques: pourquoi ils aiment la presse... et la Suisse romande|work=hebdo.ch|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''Politico'', Adam Drda expressed the view that Andrej Babis is associated with the decline of Czech democracy more than any other single person.&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt;

[[File:Monika Babišová a Andrej Babiš 2015.JPG|thumb|Andrej Babiš with his then-partner (now wife) Monika in 2015]]
Andrej Babiš was a winner of the Green Pearl prize for the anti-ecological comment of the year 2013:
"We all gave a shit about democracy once. How to explain that regarding the construction of a new highway, (someone has the right to talk about) a badger, an ecological terrorist and that each mayor wants an exit (to his town)."&lt;ref&gt;https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/ropakem-roku-je-milos-zeman/r~043c4414cbed11e399e0002590604f2e/ Winners of the anti-ecologic prizes (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Babiš' first wife was physician Beata (later Beatrice) Adamičová, a schoolmate, who he married in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Babiš : příběh oligarchy|last=Pergler|first=Tomáš|publisher=Mladá fronta|year=2014|isbn=9788020434456|edition=První vydání|location=Praha|pages=|language=Czech|oclc=899728531}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Adriana (born 1979) and Andrej (born 1982), both of whom were involved in the [[Andrej Babiš#EU subsidies fraud|Stork's Nest case]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hlidacipes.org/babisovy-deti-jako-bili-kone-sveho-otce/|title=Babišovy děti jako bílí koně svého otce?

From 1984 to 1985, Cuomo was a New York assistant district attorney, and briefly worked at the law firm of Blutrich, Falcone &amp; Miller.

== Secretary of HUD ==
[[File:HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cuomo as HUD Secretary]]
Andrew Cuomo was appointed to the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] as Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development in 1993, a member of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration.&lt;ref name="HUD" /&gt; After the departure of Secretary [[Henry Cisneros]] at the end of Clinton's first term under the cloud of an FBI investigation,&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite news | last =Evans | first =Judith | title =HUD's Cisneros to Leave a Legacy of Public Housing Reform | work =[[The Washington Post]] | page =E01 | date =November 30, 1996 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/cisneros/stories/cis113096.htm | accessdate =January 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuomo was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] to succeed him as [[Secretary of HUD]]. Cuomo served as Secretary from January 1997 until the Clinton administration ended in 2001.&lt;ref name="HUD" /&gt;

In 2000, Cuomo led HUD efforts to negotiate an agreement with the United States' largest handgun manufacturer, [[Smith &amp; Wesson]], that required Smith &amp; Wesson to change the design, distribution and marketing of guns to make them safer and to help keep them out of the hands of children and criminals.&lt;ref name="HUD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.hud.gov/secretaries/cuomobio.cfm |title=Andrew M.

These included new rental assistance subsidies, reforms to integrate public housing, higher limits on mortgages insured by the [[Federal Housing Administration]], a crackdown on housing discrimination, expanded programs to help homeless people get housing and jobs, and creation of new [[Empowerment Zone]]s.

Pinto, former chief credit officer at Fannie Mae, said "they should have known the risks were large. Cuomo was pushing mortgage bankers to make loans and basically saying you have to offer a loan to everybody."&lt;ref name="Fairbanks" /&gt; But others disagree with the assessment that Cuomo caused the crisis. [[Dean Baker]], co-director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], said Cuomo "was a contributor in terms of him being a cheerleader, but I don't think we can pin too much blame on him."&lt;ref name="Fairbanks" /&gt;

According to libertarian author and critic [[James Bovard]], Cuomo was obsessed with changing HUD's image, as Cuomo declared, "The PR is the important thing I do ... Eighty percent of the battle is communications." He championed a new program called Community Builders, created without appropriation by Congress, for 800 new HUD employees with computers to be paid as much as $100,000. In a June 16, 1999, speech, Cuomo declared that one purpose of the program was to fight against HUD's abolition. In August 1999, Community Builders distributed a letter to community groups to fight against proposed tax cuts. One HUD official declared that Community Builders were seen as "Democratic [[ward heeler]]s who act as a pipeline between Democratic city officials, party leaders, and the administration and the [[Democratic National Committee]]." In 1998, Clinton-appointed HUD Inspector General Susan Gaffney testified to a Senate committee that she was the victim of "'escalating' attacks on her office by Cuomo and 'his key aides,' including cooked-up charges of racism, insubordination, malfeasance, and general dirty-dealing." In 1999, Gaffney's office concluded that "most (15 out of 19) Community Builders' goals were activities rather than actual accomplishments." and that Cuomo's initiatives "had a crippling effect on many of HUD's ongoing operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Bovard | authorlink=James Bovard | year= 2000 | title= Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse Of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years | publisher= St. Martin's Press | location= New York | id=0-312-23082-6 | pages= 182–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2002 New York gubernatorial election ==
{{see also|New York gubernatorial election, 2002}}
Cuomo first ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York in 2002. He was initially the favorite for nomination and led in fund-raising and polls, but his campaign took serious damage after a [[gaffe]] when Cuomo said (in reference to the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]) "[[George Pataki|Pataki]] stood behind the leader. He held the leader's coat. He was a great assistant to the leader. But he was not a leader. Cream rises to the top, and [[Rudy Giuliani]] rose to the top." His remarks were widely derided; even his father, former Governor [[Mario Cuomo]], later admitted it was a blunder.&lt;ref name="Dreher"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rod|last=Dreher |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/dreher/dreher090402.asp|title=Where the Son Doesn't Follow|work=[[National Review]]|date=September 4, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020910104631/http://www.nationalreview.com/dreher/dreher090402.asp|archivedate=September 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the state convention, Cuomo withdrew from consideration after concluding that he had little chance of support as opposed to the favored party candidate, [[New York State Comptroller|State Comptroller]] [[Carl McCall]].&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite news| first=Bill| last=Schneider| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/06/ip.pol.umbrella/index.html|title=Let a political connection be your umbrella?|work=Inside Politics|publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319094326/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/06/ip.pol.umbrella/index.html|archivedate=March 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCall went on to lose the general election to [[George Pataki]].

== New York Attorney General ==
=== Election ===
{{main|New York attorney general election, 2006}}
Cuomo declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for [[New York State Attorney General]] in 2006, and on May 30, 2006, captured the Democratic Party's endorsement, receiving 65% of the delegates. Though Cuomo won the endorsement, former [[New York City Public Advocate]] [[Mark J. Green]], two-time candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]] [[Charlie King (politician)|Charlie King]], also earned places on the Democratic [[primary election|ballot]].&lt;ref name="Hicks"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan P.|last=Hicks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/nyregion/31ag.html|title=Cuomo Wins Democrats' Backing in Primary Race for Attorney General|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 31, 2006|accessdate=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; King dropped out of the race before the primary and endorsed Cuomo.&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews022610"&gt;{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Benjamin|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/02/sharpton-praises-paterson-wont.html|title=Sharpton Praises Paterson, Won't Endorse Cuomo Today | location=New York |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=February 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303002407/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/02/sharpton-praises-paterson-wont.html|archivedate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuomo won the primary with a majority of the vote, defeating his nearest opponent by over 20%. Clinching the Democratic party nomination was considered a significant rebound following his unsuccessful and unpopular 2002 gubernatorial campaign and at the nominating convention, June O'Neill, the Democratic chairwoman of [[St. Lawrence County]], called him "New York's own Comeback Kid."&lt;ref name="Hicks" /&gt; He won the [[general election]] against the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] [[District attorney]] [[Jeanine Pirro]] on November 7, 2006, winning 58% of the vote.

==== Police surveillance, 2007 ====
{{main|Eliot Spitzer political surveillance controversy}}
On July 23, 2007, Cuomo's office admonished the [[Eliot Spitzer|Spitzer administration]] for ordering the State Police to keep special records of then-Senate majority leader [[Joseph Bruno]]'s whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City.&lt;ref name="nyt072307"&gt;{{cite news|first=Danny|last=Hakim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/nyregion/23cnd-spitzer.html|title=Spitzer's Staff Misused Police, Report Finds|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 23, 2007|accessdate=July 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the discretion of top officials of the Spitzer administration, the [[New York State Police]] created documents meant to cause political damage to Bruno.&lt;ref name="ijour072307"&gt;{{cite news|first=Cara |last=Matthews |url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070723/NEWS01/70723006/1002 |title=Cuomo: Spitzer aides used state police to try to damage Bruno |work=[[The Ithaca Journal]] |date=July 23, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://m.lohud.com/detail.jsp?key=62289&amp;full=1 |archivedate=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer responded by accepting responsibility and issuing an apology to Bruno.&lt;ref name="nyt072307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="siadv"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sally |last=Goldenberg |url=http://blog.silive.com/advanceupdate/2007/07/report_governor_office_compil.html|title=Report: Governor's office compiled, leaked data on Bruno |work=[[Staten Island Advance]] |date=July 23, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Student loan inquiry, 2007 ====
In 2007, Cuomo was active in a high-profile investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities. Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to a "preferred lender," which resulted in the borrowers' incurring higher interest rates. This led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities. Many universities also rebated millions of dollars in fees back to affected borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2007-04-10-cuomo-student-loan-probe_N.htm |title=Cuomo: School loan corruption widespread|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=April 8, 2008| date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Doug|last=Lederman|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/05/15/texas|title=The First Casualty|publisher=Inside Higher Education|date=May 15, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CuomoAckerman.jpg|thumb|240px|Cuomo with Representative [[Gary Ackerman]]]]

==== Usenet, 2008 ====
On June 10, 2008, Cuomo announced that three major Internet service providers ([[Verizon Communications]], [[Time Warner Cable]], and [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]]) would "shut down major sources of online [[child pornography]]" by no longer hosting many [[Usenet]] groups. Time Warner Cable ceased offering Usenet altogether, Sprint ended access to the 18,408 newsgroups in the [[alt.* hierarchy]], and Verizon limited its Usenet offerings to the approximately 3,000 [[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big 8]] newsgroups. The move came after Cuomo's office located 88 different newsgroups to which child pornography had been posted.&lt;ref&gt;Rosencrance, Lisa.

==== 2008 Obama remarks ====
In 2008, Cuomo said of the Democratic Party candidate [[Barack Obama]], who was running against [[Hillary Clinton]], the candidate Cuomo supported: "You can't shuck and jive at a press conference."  Cuomo received criticism from some for his use of the phrase. [[Roland S. Martin|Roland Martin]] of [[CNN]] said that "'[[shuckin' and jivin']]' have long been words used as a negative assessment of African Americans, along the lines of a 'foot-shufflin' [[Negro]].'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/11/martin-shucking-and-jiving-and-the-campaign-trail/ "Martin: 'Shucking and jiving' and the campaign trail"], CNN Political Ticker – CNN.com Blogs, January 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corruption and fraud investigations, 2009 ====
Cuomo investigated a corruption scandal, "fraudulent scheme to extract kickbacks", which involved New York investigators, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], and [[state attorney general|attorneys general]] in dozens of states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/business/15leuschen.html Go-Between Tied Funds to Carlyle]. New York Times, May 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, Cuomo launched a suit against the [[United Homeless Organization]], a New York charity. He charged that the majority of the group's income was not used to provide services to the homeless, but was diverted to the founders for unrelated personal expenses.&lt;ref name="nyp_20091123"&gt;{{citation | title=Homeless beggar jars a sham: AG | publisher=[[New York Post]] | date=2009-11-24 | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/suit_put_cork_in_it_jugheads_GvF3qaHCib8Xh5AY86i68O?offset=16#comments#ixzz0Xmpl4OA1 | accessdate=2009-11-24 | first1=Melissa | last1=Klein | first2=Kevin | last2=Fasick | first3=Chuck | last3=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Judge [[Barbara R.

In the November 2, 2010, general election, Cuomo faced Republican [[Carl Paladino]], a [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]-based businessman who had been heavily supported by the [[Tea Party movement]]. Cuomo won the election for governor by a landslide, winning 62.6% of the vote. Paladino performed strongly in his native Buffalo area, while Cuomo performed well in the Eastern part of the state as well as downstate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article187686.ece "Long Islanders put Paladino to test as their cup of tea," ''Buffalo News'', September 12, 2010.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208193115/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article187686.ece |date=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a low voter turnout, Cuomo won by a comfortable margin; however, his margin of victory was smaller than it had been in his 2010 victory. Astorino won most of upstate New York, but was overwhelmed in [[New York City]]. Cuomo was sworn in for second term as [[Governor]].

His approach was described by the press as "muscular". [[Tom Libous]], the Republican State Senate deputy majority leader, said, in 2013, "When I share something he doesn't like, he gets very quiet. He stares at you."&lt;ref name=NYm/&gt;

For his 2018 re-election bid, Cuomo accepted being on top of the ballot line for the Independence Party, a list that featured numerous Republicans, including ardent Trump supporters. Cuomo's presence on the top of the ballot line may boost the vote shares of the Republicans on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/nyregion/cuomo-independence-line-ballot-governor-election.html|title=Third-Party Line Will Feature Governor Cuomo, and a Slew of Republicans|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 15, 2018, anti-sex trafficking bill-signing event, Cuomo said: "We're not gonna make America great again. It was never that great. We have not reached greatness.

In 2014, Politico reported that Cuomo had been actively involved in the formation of the [[Independent Democratic Conference]] three years earlier, which gave control of the State Senate to Republicans.&lt;ref name="idc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/05/another-cuomo-noninterference-story-falls-apart-049022|title=Another Cuomo noninterference story falls apart|last1=Zeff|first1=Blake|publisher=Politico|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been accused of failing to bridge the rift between the IDC and the Democratic caucus in the Senate despite being able to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/nyregion/cuomo-stewart-cousins-new-york-senate-democrats.html|title=Tensions Flare as Cuomo Confronts Democratic Rift|last1=Goldmacher|first1=Shane|date=9 August 2017|website=The New York Times|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it was reported that the [[Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption|Moreland Commission]], a committee established by Cuomo to root out corruption in politics, was directed away from investigations that could be politically damaging.&lt;ref name="moreland"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-and-the-short-life-of-the-moreland-commission.html|title=Cuomo's Office Hobbled Ethics Inquiries by Moreland Commission|last=Craig|first=Susanne|date=July 24, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuomo later abruptly and controversially disbanded the Commission.&lt;ref name="moreland" /&gt; Federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched an inquiry into Cuomo's dealings with the anticorruption panel and concluded that "after a thorough investigation," there was "insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/nyregion/in-moreland-commission-inquiry-insufficient-evidence-to-prove-a-crime.html|title=Cuomo Won't Face Federal Charges Over Moreland Ethics Panel|last=Weiser|first=Benjamin|date=2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Cuomo announced &lt;ref name="announced"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/nyregion/new-york-state-is-set-to-loosen-marijuana-laws.html|title=New York State Is Set to Loosen Marijuana Laws|last=Craig|first=Susanne|date=January 4, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of restrictive measures to make [[medical marijuana]] available to 20 designated hospitals for the treatment of cancer and glaucoma.

In August 2017, the Cuomo administration awarded more than $7 million - financed with money from large bank settlements - in grants to New York colleges to offer courses to New York prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/nyregion/cuomo-to-give-colleges-7-million-for-courses-in-prisons.html|title=Cuomo to Give Colleges $7 Million for Courses in Prisons|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|date=2017-08-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Cuomo proposed reforms that would "reduce delays during trials, ban asset seizures in cases where there has been no conviction and make it easier for former convicts to get a job after leaving prison."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/nyregion/cuomo-ending-cash-bail-state-of-the-state.html|title=Cuomo, in Bid to Help Poor, Proposes Ending Cash Bail for Minor Crimes|last=Jr|first=James C.

==== Gun control ====
On January 15, 2013, Cuomo signed into law the first state [[gun control]] bill to pass after the December 14, 2012, [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in neighboring Connecticut.&lt;ref name=Glaser130115&gt;{{cite news |last=Glaser |first=Howard |date=January 15, 2013 |title=Cuomo Gun Safety Legislation Passes NY State Senate With Bipartisan Support, Assembly Action Today |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-glaser/cuomo-gun-safety-legislation_b_2476419.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NY SAFE Act]] was described as the toughest gun control law in the United States.&lt;ref name=Walshe130115&gt;{{cite news |last=Walshe |first=Shushannah |date=January 15, 2013 |title=New York Passes Nation's Toughest Gun-Control Law |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-state-passes-toughest-gun-control-law-nation/story?id=18224091 |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |publisher=[[ABC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act came under criticism, and the [[National Rifle Association]] called it draconian. The New York State Sheriffs' Association issued a statement supporting tougher penalties for illegal use of firearms, but criticizing several aspects of the legislation, including a magazine limit of seven rounds and a "too broad" definition of assault weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheriff's response to NY SAFE Act |url=http://www.nysheriffs.org/articles/sheriffs%E2%80%99-response-ny-safe-act |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129224050/http://www.nysheriffs.org/articles/sheriffs%E2%80%99-response-ny-safe-act |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-29 |publisher=New York State Sheriff's Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2013, Cuomo signed an amendment to the NY SAFE Act that exempts retired police officers from some of the act's ownership restrictions.&lt;ref name=Weaver130715&gt;{{cite news |last=Weaver |first=Teri |date=July 15, 2013 |title=Gov.

==== Hurricane Sandy ====
After [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012, Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in New York state.&lt;ref name="NYTimes110512"&gt;{{cite news |author1=David Halbfinger |author2=Thomas Kaplan |author3=Wendy Ruderman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/nyregion/after-hurricane-sandy-efforts-to-help-the-displaced-vote.html |title=Officials Rush to Find Ways for the Storm-Tossed to Vote |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 2012 |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appointed a [[Moreland Commission|commission]] to examine the responses of New York utilities to damage caused by the storm.&lt;ref name="NYT_Moreland"&gt;{{cite news |title=Suffering on Long Island as Power Agency Shows Its Flaws |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/nyregion/long-island-power-authoritys-flaws-hindered-recovery-efforts.html |work=The New York Times |date=November 13, 2012 |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy ensued when the Cuomo administration used $140 million, including $40 million of federal disaster relief funds, to pay for the broadcast of national TV ads promoting "New New York" slogans outside New York in an attempt to attract new business investment to the state.&lt;ref name="adcampaign"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hakim|first=Danny|title=Ad Effort Selling State as a Business Haven Is Criticized|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/nyregion/new-york-states-ads-to-attract-business-also-draw-complaints.html|accessdate= June 4, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Eliana|title=Andrew Cuomo Launches Ad Campaign to Lure Businesses to N.Y.|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/347489/andrew-cuomo-launches-ad-campaign-lure-businesses-ny|accessdate= June 4, 2013|newspaper=The National Review|date=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been critical of the effort, including former New York governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], who called the ads "fluff" and "a waste of taxpayer money".&lt;ref name="adcampaign" /&gt;

==== Hydraulic fracturing ====
In June 2012, the Cuomo administration said it was considering lifting a state ban on the practice of [[hydraulic fracturing]] (also known as "fracking")&lt;ref name=nym&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/fracking-2012-9/|title=Fracklash|work=New York|date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stimulate the economy in [[upstate New York]]. But critics said that fracking in Upstate New York could contaminate the water supply of New York City, New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nofracking.com/|title=Stop fracking, and save our water, land, and air!|date=September 16, 2014|publisher=nofracking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2014/02/18/hearing-on-ny-energy-plan-attracts-fracking-critics/5589917/|title=Hearing on NY energy plan attracts fracking critics|date=February 18, 2014|publisher=Democrat &amp; Chronicle|author=Campbell, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a long-awaited study started years earlier, New York State health officials cited "significant public health risks" associated with fracking, and on December 17, 2014, the Cuomo administration announced a ban of hydraulic fracturing in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html|title=Citing Health Risks, Cuomo Bans Fracking in New York State|date=December 17, 2014|work=The New York Times|author= Kaplan, Thomas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York City Subway ====
In June 2017, after a series of subway disasters, Cuomo declared a "state of emergency" for the [[New York City Subway]] system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/new-york-subway-system-failure-delays.html|title=How Politics and Bad Decisions Starved New York's Subways|last=Rosenthal|first=Brian M.|date=2017-11-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-29|last2=Fitzsimmons|first2=Emma G.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=LaForgia|first3=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', a series of New York City mayors and New York governors, including Cuomo, were partly at fault for the worsening quality of the subway system and inflated construction costs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under the Cuomo administration, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] repeatedly diverted tax revenues earmarked for the subways, paid for services that there was no need for and spent on subway projects that did not boost service or reliability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, the MTA was saddled with debt and could not undertake investments into overhauling outdated and inefficient subway infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cuomo also directed the MTA to spend on projects that the heads of the MTA did not consider to be priorities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One reason why the New York City subway system is so expensive is due to exorbitant labor costs; according to several M.T.A. officials who were involved in negotiating labor contracts, Cuomo pressured the MTA to accept labor union contracts that were extremely favorable to workers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' noted that Cuomo was closely aligned with the union in question and had received $165,000 in campaign contributions from the union.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported, "Cuomo had steered clear of the M.T.A. during his first years in office, but in his second term he took an intense interest. He placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. He badgered transit leaders about the construction of the [[Second Avenue Subway|Second Avenue subway]] on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And over the objections of some board members, he canceled several M.T.A. capital projects to make room for his own priorities. According to high-ranking current and former M.T.A. officials, the moves interfered with the authority's plans to address the rising delays."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Public college and university tuition ====
On April 18, 2017, Cuomo signed the New York State 2018 fiscal year budget. It included the [[Excelsior Scholarship]], a provision that families making less than $125,000 in 2019 could have free tuition at all [[State University of New York|SUNY]] and [[City University of New York|CUNY]] universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/nyregion/new-yorks-free-tuition-program-will-help-traditional-but-not-typical-students.html|title=New York's Free-Tuition Program Will Help Traditional, but Not Typical, Students|last=Chen|first=David W.|date=2017-04-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ny.gov/programs/tuition-free-degree-program-excelsior-scholarship|title=Tuition-Free Degree Program: The Excelsior Scholarship|date=2016-12-27|work=Welcome to the State of New York|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some education experts including [[Sara Goldrick-Rab]]&amp;nbsp;say it won't help the poorest students and that the requirement that recipients live and work in New York after graduating is counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shakingnews.com/blog/2017/04/13/free-college-whats-catch-excelsior-scholarship/|title=Free College?

==== Public employees ====
On July 16, 2011, Cuomo finalized a five-year deal with the Public Employees Federation to end pay raises, implement furlough days, and require additional contributions to health insurance accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Thomas|title=Union Yields on Benefits in Deal With Cuomo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/nyregion/to-save-jobs-union-approves-big-concessions-in-deal-with-cuomo.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 17, 2011|pages=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Cuomo stated his top goal in 2012 is the reduction of [[Public employee pension plans in the United States|public employee pensions]].&lt;ref name="NYT interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Thomas|last2=Barbaro|first2=Michael|title=Cuomo Says Curbing Public Pension Benefits Will Be His Top Goal in '12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/nyregion/cuomo-says-he-wants-to-tackle-pension-changes-in-2012.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 14, 2011|pages=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Same-sex marriage ====
[[File:Andrew Cuomo 2013.jpg|thumb|Cuomo at New York City's [[Gay Pride]] in 2013]]
In keeping with a campaign promise, Cuomo signed same-sex marriage legislation on June 24, 2011, following an "intense public and private lobbying campaign", and later called for all states to do the same.&lt;ref name="GayMarriage"&gt;{{cite news |first=Reid |last=Epstein |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57749.html |title=Cuomo signs New York gay marriage bill |work=[[Politico]] |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuomo was lauded for his efforts to pass same-sex marriage legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/gov-andrew-cuomo-honored-empire-state-pride-agenda-key-gay-marriage-figures-missing-article-1.967831 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Gossip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/nyregion/cuomo-fund-fills-with-money-from-thankful-gay-donors.html | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Kaplan | title=Cuomo Fund Fills With Money From Thankful Gay Donors | date=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/nyregion/gov-andrew-m-cuomo-calls-for-same-sex-marriage-in-all-states.html | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Kaplan | title=Gov.

==== START-UP NY ====
In July 2016, the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, released a report indicating that the state's flagship business tax incentive program, called START-UP NY, had generated 408 jobs since its inception in 2014. Ads promoting the program have cost at least $53 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2015/04/07/watchdog-start-ny-ads-cost-taxpayers/25429449/|title=Watchdog: Start-Up NY ads cost taxpayers $53M|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The START-UP NY annual report was delayed three months in 2016, leading some lawmakers, such as Assemblyman Schimminger, to call the delays "curious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/08/cuomos-economic-development-chief-defiantly-faces-down-start-up-ny-questions-104467|title=Cuomo economic development chief responds defiantly to Start-Up NY questions|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taxes ====
Cuomo was praised for his 2011 restructuring of the New York State tax code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/93839/tax-code-agreement-react-o-mat/ |title=Capitol Confidential » Tax code agreement React-O-Mat |publisher=Blog.timesunion.com |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norwoodnews.org/id=5056&amp;story=bronx-pols-get-behind-cuomos-tax-plan/ |title=Bronx Pols Get Behind Cuomo's Tax Plan |publisher=Norwood News |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/governor_andrew_cuomo_hears_ho.html |title=Governor Andrew Cuomo hears hosannas for New York deal on tax reform |publisher=SILive.com |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also criticized for including tax increases for high earners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/andrew_lip_service_yJpWH4ySvPeGnFzqRDGNTL | work=New York Post | first=E.J. | last=McMahon | title=Andrew's lip service | date=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes120611" /&gt; and for allegedly requesting a unanimous Assembly vote in favor of the proposal and threatening to campaign against Assembly members who voted "no"&lt;ref name="timesunion1"&gt;{{cite web|author=JIMMY VIELKIND, Capitol bureau |url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Governor-to-Assembly-GOP-Vote-for-tax-code-2391075.php |title=Governor to Assembly GOP: Vote for tax code unanimously or risk seats |publisher=Times Union |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a charge he denied.&lt;ref name="timesunion1" /&gt; Cuomo also received criticism from voices on the left who felt that the tax reform was insufficient.&lt;ref name="NYTimes120611"&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Kaplan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/nyregion/cuomo-and-legislative-leaders-agree-on-tax-deal.html |title=Albany Tax Deal to Raise Rate for Highest Earners |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corporate incentives ====
Cuomo has been a long support of providing tax and other incentives to attract business to locate in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-launches-new-york-open-business-marketing-initiative| title=Governor Cuomo Launches "New York Open for Business" Marketing Initiative| accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bizjournals.com/albany/morning_call/2015/08/cuomo-says-ny-tax-incentives-are-a-necessity.html| title=Cuomo says New York tax incentives are a necessity for attracting businesses| accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Amazon Cuomo}} He even joked in 2018 that he would be willing to change his name to "Amazon Cuomo" if [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] located their "[[Amazon HQ2]]" in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-governor-jokes-amazon-cuomo-name-change-hq2-2018-11| title=New York's governor jokes he'll change his name to 'Amazon Cuomo' to win the HQ2 bid hours before a report that New York City will be home to one of the company's new headquarters| accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His strong position on this has received criticism saying that the costs to the state are not worth the possible benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.governing.com/gov-institute/voices/col-tax-incentives-hidden-costs-business-friendly-policies.html| title=Tax Incentives’ Bipartisan Folly| accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://nypost.com/2018/10/31/cuomos-amazon-offer-is-a-sick-joke-on-new-york/| title=Cuomo’s Amazon offer is a sick joke on New York| accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon decided on two "major corporate outposts" in New York City and [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]—instead of a single second headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/technology/amazon-hq2-headquarters.html| title=Amazon Announces New York and Virginia as HQ2 Picks| accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women's issues ====
In 2013, Cuomo called for the passage of a Women's Equality Act.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/transcript-governor-andrew-m-cuomos-2013-state-state-address | title=Transcript of Governor Andrew M.

On the final day of the 2013 legislative session, following the Senate Republican Conference's continued refusal to vote on the full Women's Equality Act, Senator Jeff Klein, leader of the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), offered the abortion plank of the Act as a hostile amendment to another bill.&lt;ref name="State of Politics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2013/06/klein-offers-hostile-abortion-amendment-fails/| title=Klein Offers Hostile Abortion Amendment, Fails (Updatedx2)|work = State of Politics | date=June 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was defeated by a narrow margin of 32-31; all 30 Senate Republicans voted against the abortion amendment, as did Democratic Sens. Ruben Diaz and Simcha Felder.&lt;ref name="State of Politics"/&gt; The Senate proceeded to pass the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women's Equality Act as separate bills, and the 2013 legislative session came to an end without any portion of the WEA becoming law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-approves-women-equality-agenda|title=Senate Approves Women Equality Agenda|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

==== Voting rights ====
In April 2018, Cuomo announced that he would restore the voting rights of parolees through an executive order.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/nyregion/felons-pardon-voting-rights-cuomo.html|title=Cuomo Plans to Restore Voting Rights to Paroled Felons|last=Wang|first=Vivian|date=2018-04-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuomo said that he would consider restoring the voting rights of all parolees (more than 35,000), and would also enfranchise new parolees throughout his term.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Public Housing ====
In the winter of 2018, Cuomo responded to a class-action lawsuit brought against the [[New York City Housing Authority]] by attorney [[Jim Walden (lawyer)|Jim Walden]] on behalf of a group of public housing tenants. The suit was the first of its kind and called upon NYCHA to immediately address decrepit and unhealthy conditions in public housing units across New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/nyregion/nycha-lawsuit-nyc-housing.html|title=Tenants Sue New York City Housing Authority: 'We Have Let Other People Speak for Us for Too Long'|last=Mays|first=Jeffery C.|date=2018-02-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the invitation of Walden, Cuomo toured a public housing project in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/03/11/cuomo-to-meet-nycha-tenants-after-declaring-emergency/|title=Cuomo to meet NYCHA tenants after declaring emergency|date=2018-03-11|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early April, Cuomo appointed an independent monitor to oversee NYCHA on an emergency basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/nyregion/cuomo-nycha-state-of-emergency.html|title=Cuomo Creates Monitor to Oversee Repairs to City's Public Housing|last=Ferré-Sadurní|first=Luis|date=2018-04-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-10|last2=Goodman|first2=J.

=== Appointee donations controversy ===
On his first day in office, Cuomo renewed an executive order signed by Eliott Spitzer which prohibited Governors of New York from receiving donations from gubernatorial appointees.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/nyregion/cuomo-fund-raising-ethics-appointees.html|title=In Spite of Executive Order, Cuomo Takes Campaign Money From State Appointees|last=Goldmacher|first=Shane|date=2018-02-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-24|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Brian M.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Armendariz|first3=Agustin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A February 2018 investigation by ''The New York Times'', however, revealed that the Cuomo administration had quietly reinterpreted the order, and that Cuomo had collected $890,000 from 24 of his appointees, as well as $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of appointees.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some donations were made to Cuomo just days after the donor was appointed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In March 2018, ''The New York Times'' reported that Cuomo had rewritten the disclaimer language on his campaign website for the executive order barring donations from appointees.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/nyregion/cuomo-appointee-donations-campaign-finance.html|title=Cuomo, in Writing, Reinterprets Fund-Raising Ban on Appointees|last=Goldmacher|first=Shane|date=2018-03-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-30|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Brian M.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website added two caveats whereby some gubernatorial appointees are allowed to donate to the Governor, which ''The Times'' said could potentially lead to more donations from appointees to the Governor.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Cuomo campaign returned $2,500 donation from one appointee who was in violation of the new disclaimer, but still retains the approximately $890,000 raised from other appointees.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Remarks about conservatives ===
In a January 17, 2014, interview with Susan Arbetter on [[WCNY-FM|WCNY]]'s ''The Capital Pressroom'', Cuomo stated:

{{quote|[New York Republicans] are searching to define their soul, that's what's going on. Is the Republican party in this state a moderate party or is it an extreme conservative party? ... The Republican Party candidates are running against the SAFE Act — it was voted for by moderate Republicans who run the Senate! Their problem is not me and the Democrats; their problem is themselves. Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that's who they are and they're the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that's not who New Yorkers are. If they're moderate Republicans like in the Senate right now, who control the Senate — moderate Republicans have a place in their state. George Pataki was governor of this state as a moderate Republican, but not what you're hearing from them on the far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/203801/cuomo-extreme-conservatives-have-no-place-in-the-state-of-new-york/|title=Cuomo: 'Extreme conservatives … have no place in the state of New York'|work=Capitol Confidential}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This remark received a major reaction in the conservative media.

The [[New York State Democratic Committee]], which is headed by Cuomo, supported his remarks and reiterated them in a May 2014 statement responding to a speech by [[Rob Astorino]], who was running against him in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 gubernatorial election]]: "Tea Party Republicans have done enough damage in Washington, today's speech made it abundantly clear that we don't need them here in New York."&lt;ref&gt;Reisman, Nick (May 15, 2014).

'''Anti-corporate activism''' holds that the influence of [[big business]] [[corporation]]s is a detriment to the [[public good]] and to the [[democratic process]].

==Disagreements with corporations==
{{confusing|section|date=June 2018}} 
{{refimprove|date=June 2018}} 
[[Activists]]{{Who|date=March 2012}} argue that corporate globalization corresponds to a displacement in the transition from a highly industrial-based economy to one where trade development is connected with the [[financial deregulation]] on the basis of circulation of capital. An increasing number of diverse societies have been changed to [[free market|free-market]] structure, leading to displacement. As this expansion has occurred, market-governed regulation has outrun the grasps of the state. Opponents of corporate globalization hold that the government needs greater power to control the markets, that income inequality is increasing, and that corporations have gained too much power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abeles |first=Marc |title=Globalization, Power, and Survival: an Anthropological Perspective |pages=484–486 |journal=[[Anthropological Quarterly]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |publisher=Institute for Ethnographic Research |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[political left]], activists against [[corporate power]] and influence support a decreased [[income gap]] and improved [[Equity (economics)|economical equity]].

==Counter-arguments==
{{Section OR|date=March 2012}}
The defenders of corporations such as [[Ron Arnold]] highlight that governments do legislate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DiscoverTheNetwork|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=6898|website=DiscoverTheNetwork.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that restrict the actions of corporations (see [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]) and that lawbreaking companies and executives are routinely caught and punished, usually in the form of monetary fines.

In addition, from the perspective of [[business ethics]] it might be argued{{By whom|date=March 2012}} that chief executives are not inherently more evil than anyone else and so are no more likely to attempt unethical or illegal activity than the general population. Large multi-national corporations do continue to attempt to erode governmental regulations through in-house or contracted lobbyists who work closely with State and Federal legislators. So as corporate laws continue to lean in their favor, corporate members have improved portals to drive up company profits.

==Alliances==
Anti-corporate activists may often ally themselves with other activists, such as [[environmental activist]]s or [[animal-rights|animal-rights activist]]s in their condemnation of the practices of modern organizations such as the [[McDonald's Corporation]] (see [[McLibel]]) and forestry company Gunns Limited (see [[Gunns 20]]).

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books (Naomi Klein's 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'' being a well-known example) and films such as ''The Corporation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorporation.com/index.php ''The Corporation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609023424/http://www.thecorporation.com/index.php |date=June 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have to a certain extent supported anti-corporate politics.

==Art activism==

==Anti-corporate web sites==
In June 2008, [[Condé Nast Publications]] released an article entitled "The Secret Seven" which it listed the top seven anti-corporate web sites which include: [[WikiLeaks]], [[Mini-Microsoft]], [[Wal-Mart Watch]], [http://www.hobb.org/ HomeOwners for Better Building], Brenda Priddy and Company (automotive spy photos) and finally Apple Rumor Sites [[AppleInsider]] and [[MacRumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Anti-Corporate-Websites |title=The Secret Seven |publisher=Condé Nast Publications |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730011448/http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Anti-Corporate-Websites |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Dotcom-Confidential|title=Dotcom Confidential|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New digital media==
{{Advert|section|date=July 2018}}
Media and digital networking have become important features of modern anti-corporate movements. The speed, flexibility, and ability to reach a massive potential audience has provided a technological foundation for contemporary network social movement structure. As a result, communities and interpersonal connections have transformed. The [[internet]] supports and strengthens local ties, but also facilitates new patterns for political activity. Activists have used this medium to operate between both the online and offline political spectrums.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Juris |first=Jeffrey S. |title=The New Digital Media and Activist Networking |pages=191–199 |journal=The Annals of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=599 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Email lists, web pages, and open editing software have allowed for changes in organization. Now, actions are planned, information is shared, documents are produced by multiple people, and all of this can be done despite differences in distance. This has led to increased growth in digital collaboration. Activists can presently build ties between diverse topics, open the distribution of information, decentralize and increase collaboration, and self-direct networks.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;

==Rise of anti-corporate globalization==

Close to fifty thousand people [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|protested]] the WTO meetings in Seattle on November 30, 1999. Labor, economic, and environmental activists succeeded in disrupting and closing the meetings due to their disapproval of corporate globalization.  This event became a symbol as anti-globalization networks emerged and became strengthened.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;
The experiences from the protests were distributed throughout the internet via emails and websites. Anti-corporate globalization movements have also expanded through the organization of mass mobilizations, including the anti-WTO protests, which were remarkably successful. In the United States, these movements reemerged after less attention was given to the war in Iraq, resulting in an increase in mass mobilizations.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;

'''Broadway''' (officially known as '''Prakasam Salai''', after the freedom fighter [[T. Prakasam]]) is one of the historical thoroughfares of the commercial centre of [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The road runs north–south connecting [[China Bazaar Road, Chennai|China Bazaar Road]] in the south with Ibrahim Sahib Street (Old Jail Road) in the north. The road divides George Town into Muthialpet and Peddanaickenpet.

Up until the 16th century, the road and the surrounding region, being near the coast, had many sand ridges. As the sea level rose, it inundated these regions, where several lagoons and ridges were left behind when the sea withdrew. The sandy ridges remained places of safety, where settlements were established. Several valleys ran around the ridges, which rose up to about 12&amp;nbsp;feet in height. Some of these valleys served as drainage channels. Until the late 18th century, the area on which the present day's road lies remained one such unwanted drainage channel,&lt;ref name="CMDA_StructureOfChennai"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; known then as Atta Pallam. Much of the area was owned by [[Stephen Popham]], a former British [[member of parliament|MP]] and later the advocate general in [[Calcutta]], who moved to Madras in 1778. He is credited with establishing a modern police force in the city in 1782.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"&gt;{{cite news

The area where the [[Government General Hospital, Chennai|General Hospital]], Madras United Club and the [[Park Town, Chennai|Park Town]] post office stand today was then a hill known locally as Narimedu (literally 'mound of foxes'), which was named 'Hoggs Hill' by the British. When the British considered it as a security threat to [[Fort St. George]] and decided to level the area, Popham negotiated with them to buy the earth removed from the hill to fill the ditch. The thoroughfare thus created came to be known as 'Popham's Broadway'.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt;

By the 1890s, the road became known for two food establishments, the first of which was that of P. Venkatachellum, whose condiments and chutneys were popular in [[England]]. He is credited with the creation of [[Mulligatawny|mulligatawny soup]] from the local recipe of ''milagu rasam'' (''milagu thanni''). The other restaurant was Harrison's, established in 1891, which today is a contemporary hotel in [[Nungambakkam]].&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt;

The road was also home to the city's first private hospital run in the 1900s by physician T. A. Sankaranarayanan,&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt; decades before the advent of the [[Apollo Hospitals]], the country's first modern corporate hospital, established in 1983.

==The present-day road==
Today, the road has morphed into one of the most important commercial streets of George Town. Several commercial establishments, especially those of opticians, have their shops on this street.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt; The [[Broadway bus terminus]], the largest bus terminus of the [[Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai)|Chennai Metropolitan Transport Corporation]], is located on the southern end of the road.

The road will also house the Mannadi Metro Rail station of the [[Chennai Metro Rail]] under construction.

The '''Business Journalist of the Year Awards''' are widely recognised{{whom|date=November 2016}} as the most important global awards for business writers and [[broadcasting|broadcaster]]s. They are the only awards for business writers that are open to [[journalist]]s of all nationalities, and the only awards to cover the entire spectrum of business and financial reporting.

The Business Journalist of the Year Awards (first presented in 1999) were created because [[business information]] had become a global commodity paying little heed to national borders. In a world where goods, services, money and knowledge move ever more freely from one domain to another, the source of business information is no longer relevant - only its quality matters. That's the spirit these awards were created in, and the spirit in which they have grown.

The Business Journalist of the Year Awards are judged exclusively by journalists and governed by the World's leading business editors. The Editors' Committee comprises Martin Dickson, Deputy Editor of the ''[[Financial Times]]''; [[Robert Peston]], business editor at [[BBC|the BBC]]; [[Hugo Dixon]], [[editing|editor-in-chief]] and chairman of [[Breakingviews]]; Jesse Lewis, [[managing editor]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]''; and Rik Kirkland, former managing editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.

A '''cohabitation agreement''' is a form of legal agreement reached between a couple who have chosen to live together (whether they are [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]]). In some ways, such a couple may be treated like a [[marriage|married]] couple, such as when applying for a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] or working out [[child support]]. However, in some other areas, such as property rights, [[pension]]s and [[inheritance]], they are treated differently.

A cohabitation agreement contains documentation for a couple who want to live together in order to protect themselves from unnecessary cost and litigation should their cohabitation break down. They can clearly regulate their property rights and what arrangements might be made for mutual financial support, dealing with [[debt]], caring for [[child]]ren, etc.

The agreement also, much like a [[prenuptial agreement]], allows the individuals concerned to determine in advance who will keep specific assets and what will happen to assets that have been purchased jointly if they separate. This agreement is intended to bind both parties.

== Advantages ==

In the United States, about 15 million couples qualify as cohabiting. A cohabitation agreement can give each party an idea of the expectations of the relationship with the legal enforceability to protect against financial ruin or the loss of support that was promised.&lt;ref name="minellalawgroup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minellalawgroup.com/dont-wait-to-protect-your-assets-with-an-enforceable-cohabitation-agreement/|title=Enforceable Cohabitation Agreements – Minella Law Group|date=27 February 2013|website=minellalawgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a good idea in that if the couple does break up, an altercation about who receives what may be less likely. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the courts may occasionally change or ignore provisions set out in a cohabitation agreement if they feel that they are inadequate under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.lawdepot.com/wiki/Cohabitation_Agreement_FAQ_-_United_States#Will_my_cohabitation_agreement_be_accepted_by_the_courts.3F|title=Cohabitation Agreement FAQ – United States|website=wiki.lawdepot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages and limitations ==
Cohabitation agreements are not considered to be legally binding in the [[United Kingdom]].

A cohabitation agreement will usually not be adequate to settle all legal issues that might arise, so a [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]] setting out property rights and a [[will (law)|will]] are also recommended.

== Common law marriage ==
It is a common misconception that there is a doctrine of "Common Law marriage" in English law. That is to say that without having married, there is no automatic right to home ownership, even if the home is shared for a long time. Instead, the only way in which ownership can be obtained is through ordinary trust law. Even if the parties are legally married, there is still no automatic right to home ownership. Instead, any transfer of ownership will be at the discretion of the court when exercising their power under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

In Canada, each province has legislation which governs the creation of cohabitation agreements. In the Province of Ontario there are restrictions on what can be included in such agreements. For example, clauses requiring chastity are unenforceable. Provisions which pre-determine issues of child custody and access as well as child support may be disregarded by a court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peires Law LLP|url=http://www.peireslaw.com/marriage-contracts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in Canada, for a cohabitation agreement to be valid, it must be signed, witnessed, and accompanied by financial disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cohabitation Agreement|url=http://www.cohabitationagreement.ca/validity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Same sex couples ==
Some gay activists have been campaigning for legal recognition of their partnerships. Their campaigning for the right to take over a partner's tenancy of the family home on bereavement have been gained, regardless of any cohabitation agreement existing, but if a couple share a home their chances of buying the rights are much more limited.

In December 2005, the British government offered gay couples equal rights with married couples if they register a civil partnership legally. The government-backed scheme – which enables same-sex couples to qualify for next-of-kin entitlements on inheritance tax, pensions and property – is likely to attract many more couples.

There will still be large legal differences between civil partnership and marriage. For example, a couple can get married and have all the legal rights and benefits after knowing each other for only a few days, but a same-sex couple will almost certainly be required to show a lengthy commitment to each other before they are allowed to register their partnership. Currently, for immigration purposes, a same-sex couple must show they have a relationship of two years' standing, and it is likely that a similar term will be imposed for registering a partnership. Consequently, same-sex couples will need to make wills and a cohabitation agreement, to provide security in the event of break-up.

In the United States, a cohabitation agreement offers fewer legal protections than a registered domestic partnership.&lt;ref name="minellalawgroup.com" /&gt;
== Prenuptial agreements ==
As afore mentioned, the term is also sometimes used loosely to refer to prenuptial agreements. These are often designed when one intends to protect his or her wealth in the event of the marriage ending in divorce. The contract aims to achieve a measure of certainty about what the financial "damage" would be if the marriage came to an end. However ''K v K'' (2003) has heightened the importance of prenuptial agreements by deciding that the wife had to stick by the terms of a prenuptial agreement she signed. The courts still keep their discretion about whether or not a prenuptial agreement will be upheld but this new case shows that the courts are in favour of couples making private agreements between themselves.

[[File:English 1956 Westminster Bank cheque of Doris Ogilvie.jpg|thumb|A '''crossed cheque'''&amp;nbsp;– the oblique or vertical lines in the centre form the crossing. Like most modern cheques in the UK, the cheque is pre-crossed as printed by the Bank.]]

A '''crossed cheque''' is a [[cheque]] that has been marked specifying an instruction on the way it is to be redeemed. A common instruction is for the cheque to be deposited directly to an [[Transactional account|account]] with a bank and not to be immediately cashed by the holder over the bank counter. The format and wording varies between countries, but generally, two parallel lines may be placed either vertically across the cheque or on the top left hand corner of the cheque. By using crossed cheques, cheque writers can effectively protect the instrument  from being stolen or cashed by unauthorized persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossedcheck.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheques can be open (uncrossed) or crossed.

==Open cheque==
An open [[cheque]] is a cheque that is not crossed on the left corner and payable at the counter of the drawee [[bank]] on presentation of the cheque.

==Crossed cheque==
A crossed cheque is a cheque that is payable only through a collecting [[bank]]er and not directly at the counter of the bank.

When two parallel [[wikt:transverse|transverse]] lines, with or without any words, are drawn generally, on the left hand top corner of the cheque.

==Types of crossing==

===General crossing===
A crossed cheque generally is a cheque that only bears two parallel transverse lines, optionally with the words 'and company' or '&amp; Co.' (or any abbreviation of them) on the face of the cheque, between the lines, usually at the top left corner or at any place in the approximate half (in width) of the cheque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61/section/76 Bills of Exchange Act 1882 section 76]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the crossing is across the cheque by the person who originally wrote the cheque (the drawer), or it can legitimately be added by the person the cheque is payable to (the payee), or even by the bank that the cheque is being paid into.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61/section/77 Bills of Exchange Act 1882 section 77]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally-crossed cheques can only be paid into a bank account,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61/section/79 Bills of Exchange Act 1882 section 79(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; so that the beneficiary can be traced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goosen|first1=W|last2=Pampallis|first2=A|last3=Amelia Van|first3=Der Merwe|last4=Mdluli|first4=L|title=Banking in the New Millennium|publisher=f Juta and Company Ltd|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

A crossed cheque on its own does not affect the negotiability of the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====Account payee====

Adding a crossing to a cheque increases its security in that it cannot be cashed at a bank counter but must be paid into an account in exactly the same name as that which appears on the ‘payee’ line of the cheque (i.e. the person who has received the cheque, who is legally the “payee” and “holder” of the cheque).

====Not negotiable====

The words 'not negotiable' can be added to a crossing.

The effect of such a crossing is that it removes the most important characteristic of a negotiable instrument: the transferee of such a crossed cheque cannot get a better title than that of the transferor (cannot become a holder in due course) and cannot convey a better title to his own transferee, but the instrument remains transferable.

===Restrictive or special crossings===
Where some customary instruction is written between the two parallel transverse lines (constituting crossing of cheque) that may result in imposing certain restrictions on the collecting or paying banker, it is called restrictive crossing.  The example is "State Bank of India".  In these cases, the respective restrictions mandate to pay the cheque through State Bank of India (acting as collecting banker) only.

====Specific bank====

A crossing may have the name of a specific banker added between the lines. A cheque with a such a crossing can only be paid into an account at that bank.

The beneficiary bank can add an additional crossing to allow another bank, who are acting as their agent in collecting payment on cheques, to be paid the cheque on their behalf.

==Consequence of a bank not complying with the crossing==
A bank's failure to comply with the crossings amounts to a breach of contract with its customer. The bank may not be able to debit the drawer's account and may be liable to the true owner for his loss.

[[File:Downtownhaywardcitycenter.jpg|thumb|Downtown Hayward, looking south on Foothill Boulevard, with the [[City Center Building]] (left)]]
'''Downtown Hayward''' is the original and current [[central business district]] of [[Hayward, California]], [[United States]], and is home to the current [[Hayward City Hall]], along with the two previous city halls, [[Alex Giualini Plaza]] and the [[City Center Building]]. The [[Hayward Fault]] runs through the area, and is the cause of the two previous city halls being taken out of use.

The boundaries are Third Street to the east, Grand Street and [[Hayward (BART station)|Hayward BART]] to the west, [[California State Route 92|Jackson Street]] and E Street to the south, and City Center Drive/Hazel Avenue to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hayward-ca.gov/CITY-GOVERNMENT/SPECIAL-PROJECTS-&amp;-STUDIES/dpu/img/plan_area.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907122147/http://www.hayward-ca.gov/CITY-GOVERNMENT/SPECIAL-PROJECTS-%26-STUDIES/dpu/img/plan_area.JPG |archivedate=2013-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foothill Boulevard was known as "The Golden Strip", a retail business corridor that was built in the 1950s, and housed [[The Emporium, San Francisco|Capwell's]] and [[I. Magnin]] department stores. The street lost businesses after the opening of [[Southland Mall (Hayward, California)|Southland Mall]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="insidebayarea1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_19616418 |title=Foothill Boulevard gateway getting face-lift in Hayward |publisher=Inside Bay Area |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks include Newman Park and The Julio Bras Portuguese Park.

'''Electronic News Production System '''(ENPS) is a [[software]] application developed by the [[Associated Press]]'s Broadcast Technology division for producing, editing, timing, organizing and running news broadcasts. The system is scalable and flexible enough to handle anything from the local news at a small-market station to large organizations spanning remote [[News bureau|bureau]]s in multiple countries.

The basic organization of each news broadcast is called a "rundown" (US) or "running order" (UK). The run-down is a grid listing scripts, [[video]], [[Sound|audio]], [[character generator]] data, [[teleprompter]] control, director notations, camera operator cues, and timing estimates for each section of the broadcast.

ENPS integrates scripts, [[wire feed]]s, [[device control]], and production information in a [[Server (computing)|server]]/client environment. On the server side, ENPS runs an identical [[backup server]] (called a "buddy") at all times as a fail-safe. If the primary server fails, all users are redirected to the buddy server until such time as the primary comes back on-line. All document changes are queued on the buddy and copied back to the primary automatically when it returns to production. Note that this is not a [[mirror website|mirror server]] as the changed data is copied to the buddy, but there is no direct replication inherent within the intercommunications between the servers, so if the data is corrupted due to hardware failure on one server, this corruption will not be replicated to the "buddy".

Device control can be managed either through a [[serial interface]], or the MOS ([[Media Object Server]]) protocol. MOS functionality is included in the base ENPS license, but may be an extra add-on for the device that needs to interface with ENPS. MOS items such as video or audio clips can be added directly to scripts, and then used by third party software and devices during the broadcast. Many broadcast media systems support the MOS protocol to a greater or lesser degree by implementing any of the seven MOS Protocol 'profiles'. An example of a MOS System which fully supports all seven MOS Profiles is SIENNA [http://www.enps.com/partner_systems/51/gallery_sienna] [http://sienna.tv], used by ENPS customers including the BBC.

The ENPS client utilizes the .NET framework and other Windows-only technologies. The client, therefore, will only run in the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]].

ENPS was originally developed by the Associated Press for use at the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]] as a replacement for the [[text mode]] system [[BASYS]] (which developed into [[Avid iNEWS]]), and the Corporation has the largest installation of the system with over 12,000 users in 300 different locations [http://www.enps.com/files/marketing/ENPS%20and%20BBC.pdf].

On December 15, 2011 [[Synaptic Digital]] announced a partnership with ENPS to deliver their content on [[thenewsmarket.com]] directly to subscribers of their feed.[http://www.synapticdigital.com/2011/12/15/synaptic-digital-teams-up-with-the-associated-press-to-distribute-video-content-from-thenewsmarket-com-via-enps-system/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">'''Emil Corsillo Inc.''' was a company that manufactured [[hairpiece]]s; primarily for the [[entertainment industry]].

==History==
Emil was an Italian immigrant. Together with his wife, Elsie Koch, he founded Emil Corsillo Inc., the famous [[Hollywood]] company that for close to 50 years supplied the entertainment industry in with [[toupee]]s, headpieces, [[wig]]s, and manufactured [[mannequin]] wigs.

Emil was the originator of the mannequin wig in the 1940s. The wigs were made from [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19440109&amp;id=7fgZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7g0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6154,4190241  The Milwaukee Sentinel - Jan 9, 1944] "This pretty young woman is wearing Nylon wig...."&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 1950, Corsillo filed a [[patent]] for his wigs, in particular, the reinforced wig foundation frames (where the fake hair was attached). He was issued with Patent number: 2661749 in December 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/patents/about?id=8mFSAAAAEBAJ Patent details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Hollywood actors that required a hairpiece were clients of the company.  Among them were [[Bozo the Clown]], [[Harpo Marx]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Hal Fishman]], and many more.

Emil died in 1967, but the company continued on into the 1980s when it was closed. The decline in demand was attributed to new technologies and imports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">__NOTOC__
The '''Empowerment Experiment''' (formerly called the '''Ebony Experiment'''&lt;ref name=APMar122009&gt;Couple's 'buy black' experiment becomes a movement, Associated Press, May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as of March 12, 2009), was co-founded by John and Maggie Anderson of Oak Park, Illinois. [[Steven S. Rogers]], director of the Kellogg Entrepreneurial Practice Center at [[Northwestern University]]'s Graduate School of Management, serves as an Executive Advisor to the experiment, which is a year-long study designed to find out what happens when people buy things only from black-owned businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/business/1341775,CST-FIN-buyblack21.article Their year of buying black], Chicago Sun Times, December 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some participants who are committed to this movement have been willing to drive substantially longer distances than what they had driven before the movement started, in order to purchase goods from black-owned businesses.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-buying-black-09-mar09,0,1956992.story Oak Park couple travel far and wide to buy only from black-owned businesses], The Chicago Tribune, March 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 12, 2009, 4,000 people had signed up on the Andersons' website to participate in their experiment.&lt;ref name=APMar122009/&gt;

The [[United States]] has one million black-owned businesses, which account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. Blacks have more than $800 billion in expendable income each year.&lt;ref name=APMar122009/&gt;

==Praise==
Lawrence Hamer, associate professor of marketing at [[DePaul University]], praised the experiment as being "brave and courageous," and said the rationale for it was "exactly right."&lt;ref name=trib/&gt;

James E. Clingman, who writes frequently about [[African-American]] economic empowerment, and also teaches a class on black entrepreneurship at the [[University of Cincinnati]], said, "I'd rather have more black businesses than black politicians."&lt;ref name=trib/&gt;

Gregory Price, chairman of the economics department at [[Morehouse College]], said the ideas behind the movement were similar to the ideas expressed by black visionaries like [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[Marcus Garvey]]. Price also said, "The idea is a sound one, given that black Americans are still underrepresented in the ranks of the self-employed and that entrepreneurship is a key component to wealth."&lt;ref name=APMar122009/&gt;

== The aim ==
The aim of this strategically location business site is to deliver major employment opportunities and maximise job creation potential in key industries. It will also play a key role in the diversification and growth of the regional economy. It is also believed that i54 South Staffordshire will achieve high standards of sustainability.

The regeneration project is a joint venture between [[Wolverhampton City Council]], [[Staffordshire County Council]] and [[South Staffordshire Council]].

== Project costs and details ==
The cost of the project to the 98 hectare site is estimated to be costing £67&amp;nbsp;million [[GBP]] and was granted crucial planning approvals from two local authorities in September 2006.

In August 2006 contractors to the site started the second major phase of the scheme, a £5&amp;nbsp;million [[GBP]] 12-month programme of infrastructure and reclamation work.

On Tuesday 3 July 2007 key partners for the project toasted the substantial completion of a £10&amp;nbsp;million [[GBP]] programme of remediation and site preparation works on the i54 site. The site preparation work ran over a 16-month period and has been carried out by Blackwell and supervised by [[Mouchel Parkman]] engineering consultancy. During this time the following was achieved:

* Produced level development plots
* Installation of primary infrastructure including a spine road
* Drainage Systems
* Site fencing
* Creation of new wetland and ecological habitats

Other statistics include:

* 152,000 cubic metres of topsoil has been excavated but retained on site.
* 190,000 cubic metres of sub-soil and rock excavated and reused on site.
* 1 kilometre spine road constructed
* 4.5 kilometres of fencing erected ''(3 kilometres still to be erected)''
* Total of 6,500 cubic metres of ponds and [[Swale (landform)|swales]] created as part of the landscaping

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">'''Jan Baan''' (Born in [[Rijssen]], 9 March 1946) is a Dutch [[entrepreneur]] and [[venture capitalist]], known as the founder of the [[Baan Corporation|Baan Company]], a software company providing [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) software. After selling the company, he founded Cordys, a company to provide web-related ERP products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrahams |first=Peter |title=Jan Baan the software man |publisher=[[The Register]] |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/25/jan_baan_cordys/ |accessdate=12 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NKM2jlKQ?url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/25/jan_baan_cordys/ |archivedate=12 February 2014 |date=25 June 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Baan was born and raised in [[Rijssen]] as eldest son in a family of ten. His father was a [[carpenter]], and his grandfather on his mother's side was cofounder of a regional bus company.&lt;ref name="HM 2004"&gt;Henk Post "[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHub0hNZSEQC&amp;pg=PA229 De snelle groei van de Baan Company: de rol van Jan Baan] in: ''Ondernemen in netwerken.'' Wim Hulsink, Dick Manuel (eds.), 2004. p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, Baan started working at a [[Slaughterhouse|meatworks]], leaving secondary school without a degree. After serving in the military, Baan got a job at an accounting firm. In 1970, he started working for a wholesale firm, where after two years he became head of the accounting department. When the company bought their first computer, Baan got acquainted with automation. Mid 1970s Baan started working as a consultant, and shortly managed the financial department of a large company.&lt;ref name="HM 2004"/&gt;

In 1978, Jan founded The Baan Company, a software company providing ERP solutions, which became a major player in the ERP software industry. Jan Baan left the Baan Company in 1998. After his efforts with the Baan Company, Baan became a venture capitalist&lt;ref name="HM 2004"/&gt; and invested in companies like Top Tier and [[WebEx]];  both were eventually valued above $1billion. Top Tier was later sold to [[SAP AG|SAP]], while WebEx was sold to [[Cisco]]. In an interview, Baan said that "... with [[WebEx]] and Top Tier I was an investor. [[Baan Corporation|Baan]], and [[Cordys]], I do for life. I am not a serial entrepreneur at all." &lt;ref&gt;CBR Online's Q&amp;A: Jan Baan on the demise of Baan and the birth of Cordys Part 1, 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Baan wrote a book on his life as an entrepreneur, called The Way to Market Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;The Way To Market Leadership [https://www.amazon.com/Way-Market-Leadership-Life-Entrepreneur/dp/B00289ZRZO], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Baan Company ===
The Baan Company was founded in 1978. With the development of his first software package in 1979, he commenced his career in the ERP industry. His brother [[Paul Baan]] joined him in the management of the company. Under Jan's stewardship, the company made good market in the field of [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) software and grew from a $35 million company in the early 1990s to $680 million in 1998.

The Baan Company competed successfully with large companies like [[SAP AG|SAP]] and [[PeopleSoft]] and became the number 2 ERP player in the software industry.&lt;ref&gt;Cordys Executive Team: Jan Baan, Executive Chairman and CEO [http://www.cordys.com/ufc/file2/cordyscms_sites/download/dad8a85a9d49e6fa99ced341d1fe535d/pu/bio_jan_baan.pdf], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company's fall started in 1998 as the stocks started to dip and eventually in 2000 it was sold to the British company [[Invensys]].&lt;ref&gt;The Baan Company [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Baan-Company-Company-History.html], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cordys ===
In 2001, Baan started a new company, Cordys, along with Theodoor van Donge. The intention was to produce products serving to bridge the traditional [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] products with the internet, using the internet as the front end.&lt;ref&gt;Cordys Background [http://www.cordys.com/cordyscms_com/cordys_history_mission.php], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ERP pioneer Jan Baan on impact of BPM [http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid26_gci1378738,00.html], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010 Cordys Switzerland AG was founded as an independent legal entity according to Swiss law. The Swiss company was not part of the later M&amp;A deal between Jan Baan and OpenText.

In August 2013, Jan Baan sold Cordys to [[OpenText]] for 33M USD.

'''John Mercer Brockenbrough''' (August 1, 1830 &amp;ndash; August 24, 1892)&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt; was a farmer and a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
Brockenbrough, the son of Moore Fauntleroy Brockenbrough and his wife Sarah Waller Smith was born August 1, 1830 in [[Richmond County, Virginia]].  He is a 2nd cousin of [[John White Brockenbrough]] and his sister, Civil War diarist, Judith White (Brockenbrough) McGuire. He graduated from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in 1850.&lt;ref name="VMI" /&gt;

==Civil War==
At the start of the Civil War, Brockenbrough was appointed [[colonel]] of the [[40th Virginia Infantry]], which served attached to Brig. Gen. [[Charles W. Field]]'s Virginia [[brigade]] in [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[A.P. Hill]]'s Light Division and later Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]]'s division in the Third Corps, [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. Brockenbrough led his [[regiment]] through the [[Seven Days Battles]], a punishing series of battles that caused 50% casualties in his regiment.

Brockenbrough assumed command of the brigade after Field was wounded at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and led it two days later at [[Battle of Chantilly|Chantilly]]. During the [[Maryland Campaign]], he took part in the capture of [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]], and then marched with the rest of the Light Division to the rescue of Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army at [[Battle of Antietam|Sharpsburg]]; his brigade was deployed on the far right of A.P. Hill's line and did not see any direct action there. At [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], his brigade was ordered to plug a hole in the Confederate line that was being exploited by [[Union Army|Union]] troops under Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]]. Brockenbrough lost control of his brigade during this action and two of his regiments split off with him and never reached the fighting. Lee apparently was not impressed with Brockenbrough's leadership qualities. Even though months had passed, the unit was still called Field's Brigade and Brockenbrough was still considered its temporary commander. Lee did not recommend him for promotion.

In early 1863, Lee brought Brig. Gen. [[Henry Heth]] from assignment in [[Tennessee]] to replace Brockenbrough in command of the brigade (soon called "Heth's Brigade"), hoping to restore it to fighting shape. During the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], Heth took over command of the division when Hill was wounded on May 2, 1863, which meant that Brockenbrough was back in command of the brigade on May 3, when  it lost around 300 men storming the enemy line. After the battle, Brockenbrough was given a rare commendation for leading the attack by General Heth. He remained in brigade command when Heth was promoted to command a new division.

At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Brockenbrough's brigade was in the rear of Heth's column during the march on the Chambersburg Pike, July 1, 1863, and thus missed the morning attacks against the [[Union Army|Union]] cavalry and the [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]]. In the afternoon attacks, his men advanced on a line with [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]]'s North Carolina brigade, and although the latter brigade fought fiercely, suffering over a thousand casualties, Brockenbrough's brigade was hesitant and fought ineffectively against the Pennsylvanians of Col. [[Roy Stone]] and a portion of the [[Iron Brigade]], as may be inferred from their casualty rate of 100. The brigade rested on July 2, but on July 3 participated in the bloody assault known as [[Pickett's Charge]]. There is no record that Brockenbrough marched with his men toward [[Cemetery Ridge]] that day, however, and Col. [[Robert M. Mayo]] of the [[47th Virginia Infantry]] was in temporary command. It is possible that the death of Brockenbrough's brother during the battle on July 1 left him distraught and unable to step up to his responsibilities. Assigned to the far left flank of Pettigrew's divisional line, the brigade was subjected to heavy shelling from Union artillery on [[Cemetery Hill]] and when the [[8th Ohio Infantry]] came up on their left flank, the Virginians turned and ran.

During the Confederate retreat back to Virginia, Brockenbrough attempted to reclaim some of his damaged reputation by making a reckless advance against Union troops at [[Battle of Williamsport|Falling Waters]] on July 14, suffering numerous casualties. Five days later, Brockenbrough's former regimental lieutenant colonel, Brig. Gen. [[Henry Harrison Walker]], was given command of the brigade, returning Brockenbrough to the 40th Virginia, which he led at [[Bristoe Campaign|Bristoe]] and [[Battle of Mine Run|Mine Run]]. On January 21, 1864, Brockenbrough resigned from the Confederate States Army. He retained his rank of colonel in the reserves until late 1864.

==Postbellum life==
After the war, Brockenbrough lived in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. He died in Richmond and is buried there in [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;

==Education==
Hickey received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Sociology from the [[University of Rochester]] in 1979 where she graduated Cum Laude. Hickey went onto acquire a Certificate in Graphic Design from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, Massachusetts. {{Cite web|url=http://www.lisahickeycreative.com/LisaResume100108.pdf |title=Lisa Hickey Resume |publisher=Lisa Hickey Creative |accessdate=2010-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306155629/http://www.lisahickeycreative.com/LisaResume100108.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}

==Career==
In 1999, Hickey opened her own agency, Velocity Advertising. The agency was known for offering full-service capabilities to clients regardless of their geographic location. Prior to Velocity, Hickey worked for companies such as Boston's Heater Advertising (Renamed Red), Arnold Worldwide and [[Holland Mark]] Advertising.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7621">[[Image:MediaTechnologyMonitorLogo.jpg|frame|50px|alt=Logo of the Media Technology Monitor (MTM).|Logo ]]The '''Media Technology Monitor''' (MTM) is an annual telephone survey and research product designed to monitor Canadians' use and adoption of new and existing technologies.  The first MTM questionnaire was distributed in 2005 and now consists of two annual surveys conducted in the spring and fall of each year.&lt;ref&gt;CRTC Communications Monitoring Report (2011) - {{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2011/cmr2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005120457/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring/2011/cmr2011.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey features questions that focus on current and emerging media activities and technologies such as, television across multiple platforms, radio use social media, and online audio.  The results of the Media Technology Monitor are published through a series of syndicated reports and multiple short, targeted theme reports. The Media Technology Monitor reports are distributed to government agencies, broadcasters, and other media stakeholders across Canada who subscribe to the service.

The MTM is designed, implemented and analyzed by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC/Radio-Canada).&lt;ref&gt;Broadcaster Magazine - http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/bbm-analytics-to-market-cbc-radio-canada-media-technology-monitor/1000045568/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the MTM coordinated with [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Ontario to provide learning materials to the Communications Department.

==History==
The Media Technology Monitor has evolved from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's]] Quality Ratings Survey (QRS) that began in 1997 to measure Canadians' use and perception of Canada's conventional and specialty television channels as well as some media technology behaviours.  In 2005, the MTM was launched with a specific focus on media technology adoption and use among Canadians. In 2010, an online MTM portal ([http://www.mtm-otm.ca www.mtm-otm.ca]) was created to provide a more interactive experience for users.  The portal allows users a quick and easy way to download MTM reports and trending data, as well as conduct custom analysis of the data with a proprietary data analysis tool.

MTM-OTM Video on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGlObksktTU&amp;feature=youtu.be

Since then the technology has become less and less used due to the rise of the internet and the easier, quicker and cheaper way to send our surveys to users which using certain methods is also further available for free. 

==Survey Methodology and Design==
The Media Technology Monitor is released in the fall and spring of each year and collects a total of 12,000 responses through telephone interviews with 6,000 Anglophones and 6,000 Francophones aged 18+.  The response rate for both surveys is 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fall Survey - 8,000 Respondents (4,000 Anglophones and 4,000 Francophones)&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spring Survey - 4,000 Respondents (2,000 Anglophones and 2,000 Francophones)&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTM survey households are selected by [[Random digit dialing|Random Digit Dialing]] (RDD) and the respondent within each household is randomly selected based on the most recent birthday method. The MTM uses telephone surveys to ensure that the respondents are representative of all Canadians by eliminating bias due to geographic location and connection to the Internet.

==Current Topics==

The Media Technology Monitor is revised every year to include emerging media trends and technologies.  Recent MTM surveys have asked respondents about their behavior and consumption of:

== Writing career ==
While in the Middle East, he publishes his first two novels under the pen name Gabriel Malika, so as to separate his identity as writer and as a businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.rts.ch/play/radio/detours/audio/entre-qatar-et-arabie?id=6679623#?station=a9e7621504c6959e35c3ecbe7f6bed0446cdf8da Entre Qatar et Arabie], ''Détours'', ''Radio télévision suisse''.

'''Organizational conflict''', or '''workplace conflict''', is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of [[needs]], [[values]] and [[Conflict of interest|interests]] between people working together. [[Conflict (process)|Conflict]] takes many forms in [[organization]]s. There is the inevitable clash between formal authority and power and those individuals and groups affected. There are disputes over how revenues should be divided, how the work should be done, and how long and hard people should work. There are jurisdictional disagreements among [[individual]]s, [[Departmentalization|departments]], and between [[Trade union|unions]] and [[management]]. There are subtler forms of conflict involving rivalries, [[jealousies]], [[personality clashes]], role definitions, and struggles for [[Power (social and political)|power]] and favor. There is also conflict within individuals&amp;nbsp;– between [[competition|competing needs]] and demands&amp;nbsp;– to which individuals respond in different ways.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn= 9780876205402|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type==
Conflict affecting organizations can occur in [[individual]]s, between individual and between groups. Conflicts within work groups are often caused by struggles over control, status, and scarce resources. Conflicts between groups in organizations have similar origins. The constructive [[conflict resolution|resolution]] of such conflicts can most often be achieved through a rational process of problem solving, coupled with a willingness to explore issues and alternatives and to listen to each other.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Personal conflict ===
A personal conflict involves a conflict between two people, most often from a mutual dislike or personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conflict Resolution Principles 150|url=http://www.toolingu.com/definition-950150-105250-personal-conflict.html|work=Supervisor Essentials Training|publisher=TOOLINGU|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Boston University FSAO, "Causes for workplace conflict can be personality or style differences and personal problems such as substance abuse, childcare issues, and family problems. Organizational factors such as leadership, management, budget, and disagreement about core values can also contribute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Conflict|url=http://www.bu.edu/fsao/resources/workplace/|work=Faculty and Staff Assistance|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Colorado–Boulder]] cites as primary causes of workplace conflict as poor communication, different values, differing interests, scarce resources, personality clashes, and poor [[Job performance|performance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/fsap/conflict.html Resolving Workplace Conflict], University of Colorado–Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many difficulties in this area are beyond the scope of [[management]] and more in the province of a professional counselor or workplace mediator, but there are some aspects of personal conflict that managers should understand and some they can possibly help remedy. Social conflict refers to interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup differences.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; Organizational conflict at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ ''Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

It was pointed out that there is a basic incompatibility between the authority and structure of formal organizations and the human personality. [[Human behavior]] cannot be separated from the culture that surrounds it.&lt;ref name="conf2"&gt;{{cite book |author = Chris Argyris|title = Personality and organization; the conflict between system and the individual|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|location = New York|year = 1957|pages = 47–54|isbn = |oclc = 243920|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intragroup conflict ===
Conflict arises in groups because of the scarcity of freedom, position, and resources. People who value independence tend to resist the need for interdependence and, to some extent, conformity within a group. People who seek power therefore struggle with others for position or status within the group. Rewards and recognition are often perceived as insufficient and improperly distributed, and members are inclined to compete with each other for these prizes.&lt;ref name="conf3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore M Mills|title= The Sociology of Small Groups|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|year=1967 |pages=14–17|isbn= |oclc=255221|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western culture, winning is more acceptable than losing, and competition is more prevalent than cooperation, all of which tends to intensify [[intragroup conflict]]. Group meetings are often conducted in a win-lose climate&amp;nbsp;— that is, individual or subgroup interaction is conducted for the purpose of determining a winner and a loser rather than for achieving mutual problem solving.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Intergroup conflict ===
Intergroup conflict occurs in four general forms. Horizontal strain involves competition between functions, for example, sales versus production, research and development versus engineering, purchasing versus legal, line versus staff, and so on. Vertical strain involves competition between hierarchical levels, for example, union versus management, foremen versus middle management, shop workers versus foremen.&lt;ref name="conf5" /&gt; A struggle between a group of employees and management is an example of vertical strain or conflict. A clash between a sales department and production over inventory policy would be an example of horizontal strain.

Certain activities and attitudes are typical in groups involved in a win-lose conflict. Each side closes ranks and prepares itself for battle. Members show increased loyalty and support for their own groups. Minor differences between group members tend to be smoothed over, and deviants are dealt with harshly. The level of morale in the groups increases and infuses everyone with competitive spirit. The power structure becomes better defined, as the "real" [[leader]]s come to the surface and members rally around the "best" thinkers and talkers.&lt;ref name="conf3" /&gt;

In addition, each group tends to distort both its own views and those of the competing group. What is perceived as "good" in one's own position is emphasized, what is "bad" is ignored; the position of the other group is assessed as uniformly "bad," with little "good" to be acknowledged or accepted. Thus, the judgment and objectivity of both groups are impaired. When such groups meet to "discuss" their differences, constructive, rational behavior is severely inhibited.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt; Each side phrases its questions and answers in a way that strengthens its own position and disparages the other's. Hostility between the two groups increases; mutual understandings are buried in negative [[stereotype]]s.

It is easy to see that under the conditions described above, mutual [[solution]]s to problems cannot be achieved. As a result, the side having the greater power wins; the other side loses. Or the conflict may go unresolved, and undesirable conditions or circumstances continue. Or the conflict may be settled by a higher authority.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt;

None of these outcomes is a happy one. Disputes settled on the basis of power, such as through a [[strike action|strike]] or a lockout in a labor-management dispute, are often deeply resented by the loser. Such settlements may be resisted and the winner defeated in underground ways that are difficult to detect and to counter. When this happens, neither side wins; both are losers. If the conflict is left unresolved, as when both sides withdraw from the scene, intergroup cooperation and effectiveness may be seriously impaired to the detriment of the entire [[organization]]. Disputes that are settled by higher authority also may cause resentment and what is called "lose-lose" consequences. Such settlements are invariably made on the basis of incomplete [[information]]&amp;nbsp;— without data that the conflict itself obscures&amp;nbsp;— and therefore are poor substitutes for mutually reasoned solutions. Again, both sides have lost. A specific approach to resolving intergroup conflict is outlined in the next chapter on organization development.&lt;ref name="conf3"/&gt;

== Causes ==

===Role conflict===
{{Main|Role conflict}}
One fact of personal conflict includes the multiple roles people play in organizations.
[[Behavioral]] scientists sometimes describe an [[organization]] as a system of position roles. Each member of the organization belongs to a role set, which is an association of individuals who share interdependent tasks and thus perform formally defined roles, which are further influenced both by the expectations of others in the role set and by one's own personality and expectations. For example, in a common form of classroom organization, students are expected to learn from instructors by listening to them, following their directions for study, taking exams, and maintaining appropriate standards of conduct. [[teacher|Instructors]] are expected to bring students high-quality learning materials, give lectures, write and conduct tests, and set a scholarly example. Another in this role set would be the dean of the school, who sets standards, hires and supervises faculty, maintains a service [[Employment|staff]], readers and graders, and so on. The system of roles to which an individual belongs extends outside the organization as well, and influences their functioning within it. As an example, a person's roles as partner, parent, descendant, and church member are all intertwined with each other and with their set of organizational roles.&lt;ref name="conf5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Daniel Katz; Robert Louis Kahn|title= The social psychology of organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1966 |pages=18–33|isbn= |oclc=255184|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, there exist opportunities for role conflict as the various roles interact with one another. Other types of role conflict occur when an individual receives inconsistent demands from another person; for example, they are asked to serve on several time-consuming committees at the same time that they are urged to get out more production in their work unit. Another kind of role strain takes place when the individual finds that they are expected to meet the opposing demands of two or more separate members of the [[organization]]. Such a case would be that of a worker who finds himself pressured by their boss to improve the quality of their work while their work group wants more production in order to receive a higher bonus share.

These and other varieties of role conflict tend to increase an individual's anxiety and [[frustration]]. Sometimes they motivate him to do more and better work. Other times they can lead to frustration and reduced efficiency.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971 |pages=Chapter 8|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passive aggressive behavior===
{{Main|Passive aggressive behavior}}Passive aggressive behavior is a common response from workers and managers which is particularly noxious to team unity and productivity. In workers, it can lead to sabotage of projects and the creation of a hostile environment. In managers, it can end up stifling a team's creativity. De Angelis says "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;De Angelis, Paula: Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Leadership in the Workplace, (Kindle Edition - Jun 22,2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Office romance ===
{{Main|Office romance}}Office romances can be a cause of workplace conflict. 96 percent of human resource professionals and 80 percent of executives said workplace romances are dangerous because they can lead to conflict within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/02/14/BU144015.DTL Dangerous love: An Office romance could cost you your job, Julie N. Lynem, [[San Francisco Chronicle]], Feb. 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public displays of affection]] can make co-workers uncomfortable and accusations of favoritism may occur, especially if it is a supervisor-subordinate relationship. If the relationship goes awry, one party may seek to exact revenge on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://working.canada.com/national/resources/atwork/story.html?id=4f8d63ab-a97a-42b5-b3a1-54983d3aef8f When an Office Romance Sours], Working.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, quality problems, missed deadlines or delays, increased stress among employees, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, disruption to work flow, decreased customer satisfaction, distrust, split camps, and [[Gossip#Workplace gossip|gossip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/337162_workcoach29.html Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict], Maureen, Moriarty, [[Seattlepi]], Oct. 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The win-lose conflict in groups may have some of the following negative effects:&lt;ref name="conf4"&gt;{{cite book |author=John E Jones;  J William Pfeiffer|title=The 1973 annual handbook for group facilitators|publisher=University Associates|location=San Diego, Calif. |year=1973 |pages=106–109|isbn= 9780883900819|oclc=9160197|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Divert time and energy from the main issues
* Delay decisions
* Create [[deadlocks]]
* Drive unaggressive committee members to the sidelines
* Interfere with listening
* Obstruct exploration of more alternatives
* Decrease or destroy [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]]
* Cause members to drop out or resign from committees
* Arouse anger that disrupts a meeting
* Interfere with [[empathy]]
* Incline underdogs to [[sabotage]]
* Provoke [[personal abuse]]
* Cause defensiveness
Conflict is not always destructive. When it is destructive, however, managers need to understand and do something about it. A rational process for dealing with the conflict should be programmed. Such a process should include a planned action response on the part of the manager or the organization, rather than relying on a simple reaction or a change that occurs without specific action by management.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

===Stress===
{{Main|Occupational stress}}Interpersonal conflict among people at work has been shown to be one of the most frequently noted stressors for employees.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, A., &amp; Newton, T. (1985). Stressful events, stressors and psychological strains in young professional engineers. Journal of Occupational Behaviour, 6(2), 151-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, C., Spector, P. E., &amp; Shi, L. (2007). Cross-National Job Stress: A Quantitative and Qualitative Study. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 28(2), 209-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict has been noted to be an indicator of the broader concept of workplace harassment.&lt;ref name="Bowling, N. A. 2006"&gt;Bowling, N. A., &amp; Beehr, T. A. (2006). Workplace harassment from the victim's perspective: A theoretical model and meta-analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology, 91(5), 998-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to other stressors that might co-occur, such as [[role conflict]], role ambiguity, and [[workload]]. It also relates to strains such as [[anxiety]], depression, physical symptoms, and low levels of [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Bowling, N. A. 2006"/&gt;

===Positive outcomes===

Group conflict does not always lead to negative consequences. The presence of a dissenting member or subgroup often results in more penetration of the group's problem and more creative solutions. This is because disagreement forces the members to think harder in an attempt to cope with what may be valid objections to general group opinion. But the group must know how to deal with differences that may arise.&lt;ref name="conf2" /&gt;

True interdependence among members leads automatically to [[Dispute resolution|conflict resolution]] in the group. Interdependence recognizes that differences will exist and that they can be helpful. Hence, members learn to accept ideas from dissenters (which does not imply agreeing with them), they learn to listen and to value openness, and they learn to share a mutual problem-solving attitude to ensure the exploration of all facets of a problem facing the group.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt;

Intergroup conflict between groups is a sometimes necessary, sometimes destructive, event that occurs at all levels and across all functions in [[organization]]s. Intergroup conflict may help generate creative tensions leading to more effective contributions to the organization's [[goal]]s, such as competition between sales districts for the highest [[Sales|sale]]s.&lt;ref name="conf5"/&gt; Intergroup conflict is destructive when it alienates groups that should be working together, when it results in win-lose [[competition]], and when it leads to compromises that represent less-than-optimum outcomes.

== Resolution ==

=== Conflict management ===
Constantino helps organizations design their own, ad hoc [[conflict management]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=adr] Conflict and dispute management system design: overview.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tosi, Rizzo, and Caroll suggested that improving organizational practices could help resolve conflicts, including establishing [[superordinate goals]], reducing vagueness, minimizing authority- and domain-related disputes, improving policies, procedures and rules, re-apportioning existing resources or adding new, altering communications, movement of personnel, and changing reward systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W7504E/w7504e07.htm Conflict Management], FAO Corporate Document Repository.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large organizations have a [[human resources]] department, whose tasks include providing confidential advice to internal "customers" in relation to problems at work. This could be seen as less risky than asking one's manager for help. HR departments may also provide an impartial person who can mediate disputes and provide an objective point of view. Another option is the introduction of the Ombudsman figure at the organizational level, charged with surveying common causes of conflict and suggesting structural improvements to address them.

* [[Counseling]] - when personal conflict leads to frustration and loss of [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], counseling may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener&amp;nbsp;— something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt;  Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings&amp;nbsp;— that is, to express them to a concerned and understanding listener, is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting their work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.  There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
*[[Conflict avoidance]] - non-attention or creating a total or partial separation of the combatants allowing limited interaction&lt;ref name="Montana"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick J. Montana|title=Management|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=New York|year=2008 |page=265|isbn=0-7641-3931-2|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Smoothing]] - stressing the achievement of harmony between disputants&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[Power (social and political)|Dominance or power intervention]] - the imposition of a solution by management at a higher level than the level of the conflict&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[Compromise]] - seeking a resolution satisfying at least part of each party's position&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[wikt:confrontation|Confrontation]] - a thorough and frank discussion of the sources and types of conflict and achieving a resolution that is in the best interest of the group, but that may be at the expense of one or all of the conflicting parties&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindred Greer, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVWpipM-Rnw&amp;list=UUGwuxdEeCf0TIA2RbPOj-8g Managing Conflict in Teams] (8-min video). ''[[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].'' Professor Lindred Greer gives tips for managing conflicts, which left unchecked, can go viral, hurt productivity, and create employee turnover.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trained conflict resolver can begin with an economical intervention, such as getting group members to clarify and reaffirm shared goals. If necessary, they move through a systematic series of interventions, such as testing the members' ability and willingness to compromise; resorting to confrontation, enforced counseling, and/or termination as last resorts.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Kaye 1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kenneth Kaye]]|title=Workplace Wars and How to End Them: Turning Personal Conflict into Productive Teamwork|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York|year=1994|isbn=0-8144-0215-1|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace conflict may include disputes between peers, supervisor-subordinate conflict or intergroup disputes. When disputes are not dealt with in a timely manner, greater efforts may be needed to solve them. [[Party-Directed Mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between colleagues or peers, especially those based on deep-seated interpersonal conflict or multicultural or multiethnic ones. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The [[Negotiated Performance Appraisal]] (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change===
Management is presumed to be guided by a vision of the future. The manager reflects in their decision-making activities the values of the organization as they have developed through time, from the original founder-owner to the present top-management personnel. In navigating a path between the values of the organization and its objectives and goals, management has expectations concerning the organization's effectiveness and efficiency and frequently initiates changes within the organization. On other occasions, changes in the external environment&amp;nbsp;— [[market demand]], [[technology]], or the political, social, or economic environment&amp;nbsp;— require making appropriate changes in the activities of the [[organization]]. The organization faces these demands for change through the men and women who make up its membership, since organizational change ultimately depends on the willingness of employees and others to change their attitudes, behavior, their degree of knowledge and skill, or a combination of these.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alfred W Clark|title= Experimenting with organizational life: the action research approach|publisher=Plenum Press|location= New York|year=1976 |pages=|isbn= 9780306308796|oclc=1976875|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific Maritime Association''' ('''PMA''') is a non-profit organization based in [[San Francisco, California]] that represents employers of the shipping industry on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]].&lt;ref name="ftrobertwright"&gt;Robert Wright. "US supply chains face lengthy turmoil despite port deals". ''Financial Times'', February 23, 2015, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Pacific Maritime Association was founded in 1949&lt;ref name="pmaoverview"&gt;[http://www.pmanet.org/overview Pacific Maritime Association: Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; as a non-profit corporation. Its principal business is to negotiate and administer labor agreements with the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] (ILWU). PMA’s 72 members are cargo carriers, terminal operators, and stevedores that operate along the U.S. West Coast.

In 1960, it negotiated the [[Mechanization and Modernization Agreement 1960|Mechanization and Modernization Agreement]].&lt;ref name="pmaoverview"/&gt;

As of December 2012, PMA members employed nearly 14,000 registered longshore, clerk and foreman workers at 29 west coast ports in California, Oregon, and Washington, and thousands more “casual” workers, who typically work part-time. Since the 2002 agreement that brought the widespread use of technology to the West Coast, the registered workforce has increased by 32 percent.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2015, it negotiated a five-year contract with the ILWU.&lt;ref name="ftrobertwright"/&gt;

In October 2008, the magazine reduced its staff by 20 percent, and changed to publishing only 10 times per year.

'''Priority Matrix''' is a [[time management]] software application that is supported on a number of platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[iOS]]. It is based on the [[Eisenhower method|Eisenhower Method]] of arranging tasks by urgency and importance in a 2x2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. Priority Matrix offers a [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based synchronization of data, allowing for data management across multiple devices. The application is also loosely based on [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]'s [[Getting Things Done]] methodology of improving productivity.

==Features==
* '''Quadrants-based task prioritization'''- The 2x2 time management matrix, based on the Eisenhower Method of time management, is the general framework on which Priority Matrix is run. The quadrants organize tasks based on importance and urgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Management for Sales People|url=http://salestrong.co.uk/time-management-for-sales-people/|publisher=www.salestrong.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Priority Matrix, the four quadrants' default labels are: Critical and Immediate, Critical but not Immediate, Not Critical but Immediate, and Uncategorized.
* '''Task [[drag and drop]]'''- Tasks and projects are capable of being dragged from one location to another, allowing users to change a task's priority level without having to create a new item altogether.
* '''Project import/export'''- Entire projects can be exported into the program's native file format, .pmatrix, for transferring a workspace quickly.
* '''Cloud-based synchronization across platforms'''- Despite running on several different platforms, Priority Matrix is able to sync project and task data over the cloud, with data being stored on Priority Matrix's [[Server (computing)|server]]s.
* '''Progress and date tracking'''- Dates and deadlines can be made for each task, providing notifications and allowing users to track their progress over time.
* '''Project summary emails and reporting'''- Emails can be created out of entire projects, for quick reporting and sending a summary of projects.
* '''Color and label customization'''- Each quadrant's background can be changed to any color in the [[RGB]] [[spectrum]]. For further customization, every task has icons that can be selected to represent a specific task.
* '''Template system'''- New projects can be created from sample templates, to avoid repetitive data input. Various templates are available &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Priority Matrix templates|url=https://sync.appfluence.com/templates/Innovation-Management-Matrix/|publisher=appfluence.com|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for different thought processes.

==Reception==
Across the various platforms, Priority Matrix has over 90,000 paid customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appfluence.com/ |title=Appfluence - Plan differently. - The best desktop to do list app for Windows, Mac, iPhone and iPad |publisher=Appfluence |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been ranked among the 10 highest downloaded [[productivity]] [[Mobile app|apps]] in the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appfluence.com/productivity/priority-matrix-top-10-free-productivity-iphone-app/ |title=productivity 151: striving for continuous improvement - a blog by appfluence |publisher=Appfluence |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC Magazine]] has ranked the [[iPad]] version of Priority Matrix among its 100 Best iPad Apps in 2011, 2012, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l%253D250054%2526a%253D250058%2526po%253D24,00.asp?p=n |title=The 100 Best iPad Apps - Priority Matrix - Slideshow from PCMag.com |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the product has garnered a 4 out of 5-star rating or better on the Apple App Store on both the [[iPhone]] and iPad platforms, with over 1,300 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/priority-matrix/id364906005?mt=8 |title= Priority Matrix for iPad |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was added to the [[Google Play|Play Store]] September 2013.

The '''Pub Design Awards (PDA)''' are an annual [[award]]s, established in 1983 and hosted by [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]], that are given to exceptional [[pub]]s in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] that have been newly built/converted or have recently undergone building/conservation work.

==Categories==
The awards cover 4 Categories:
#'''New Build''' ''(For newly constructed pubs)''
#'''Conversion of existing buildings to pub use''' ''(For use of a building that had not previously been a pub)''
#'''Refurbishment of existing public houses''' ''(For recently refurbished pubs. The final interior must suit the era of the building and enhance the 'feel' of the pub)''
#'''The ''English Heritage'' Award for conservation''' ''(For pubs that have retained much of their original design and/or decor, and have recently had conservation work to improve the overall condition of the interior.)''

There is also a fifth award which is given independently of the above categories and cannot be entered directly; the '''Joe Goodwin Conservation Award''', sometimes known as '' '[[Joe Goodwin]] Award for best 'Street-Corner Local' ''. This is chosen from all entries, not just winners of other categories.

Any pub can only enter one category, entries may be from anywhere in the [[British Isles]]. Anyone can enter a pub for the awards.

==Entry==
[[Photograph]]s and a typed description(Max. 2 A4 sheets) of the interior and exterior and what work was completed are required for entry, as are drawings of the interior plan and location map of the pub.

To qualify, the work must have been finished between 1 January and 31 December of the year before, e.g. For ''2007'', the work on the pub must have been completed sometime in ''2006''.

==Judging==
Judging takes place initially by shortlisting, after which the selection will be visited, the panel comprises members of the [[CAMRA Pubs Group]] along with conservation experts and architects outside ''CAMRA''.

Not every award is given every year(depending on the entries), but there are often mentions for highly commended pubs, and some years there are joint winners when there are a number of exceptional pubs in particular categories.

The winners receive a plaque which can be displayed publicly in the pub, permanently.

==Winners==
Where the entry reads ''None Awarded'', this means no award was given in that category for that year, even though there may be 'Highly Commended' pubs in that category(which are not listed here). ''None listed'', this means there was no information about that particular award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7620">The '''Rabinovitz/Rabb family''' is a Jewish family engaged in [[business]] and [[philanthropy]] who built the [[Stop &amp; Shop]] supermarket chain in the Boston area.&lt;ref name='rabbs'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digifindingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109208|title=Guide to the Collection of the Rabb Family and Stop &amp; Shop Companies, 1912-1989|publisher=American Jewish Historical Society|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Generation ==
In 1891, Nachman Schleime and Yente Rabinovitz immigrated to the United States with their children from [[Malestovka, Russia]]. They settled in Boston, where Yente ran a grocery store in Boston's North End.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

== The Rabinovitz Brothers ==

The eldest brother, Joseph Rabinovitz and his brother Max founded the Standard Grocery Company (known as "Ecco") in 1898. Their brothers Jacob (1885-1967) and Julius founded the Economy Grocery Stores in 1914. Joseph soon sold his share in Standard and invested in Ecco.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

== The Rabbs ==

Joseph and his wife Charlotte (Lottie) Wolf had four children: Sidney R. Rabb (1900-1985), Norman S. Rabb (1905-1997), Jeanette Rabb Solomon (Mrs. Sidney), and Irving William Rabb (1913-2011).  The three brothers and one sister all attended [[Boston Latin School andGirls Latin School]] and [[Harvard University]] and joined Ecco. The three joined their last name to Rabb in 1946, the year the Economy Grocery Company was renamed Stop &amp; Shop.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

Sidney, the eldest, was the first to join Ecco at the age of 18. In 1920 he became co-owner with his father and uncle Joseph and Jacob. Sidney became chairman of the Board and chief executive officer in 1930, a position he retained until his death in 1985.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

The '''railway interest''' was the [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s in the [[United Kingdom|British]] parliament who held directorships or senior administrative posts in railway companies in the 19th century. They could be relied upon to vote in the interest of the railways when legislation aimed at controlling the companies' actions was proposed, and to persuade their fellow members, most of whom will have been railway shareholders, to follow suit. While the monopoly position of railways in inland transport remained unchallenged, the influence of the railway interest in resisting rates' control and safety improvements was a continuing concern both to free-trade liberals and to the aristocracy/landed-gentry with a dependence on farming. The 'interest' was particularly strong as [[Division (vote)|divisions]] were often not [[Whip (politics)|whipped]] on party lines until the end of the century.

'Railway members' of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] were listed in some early editions of [[George Bradshaw|Bradshaw]]'s ''Almanack, directory and shareholder's guide''s from 1847, and both Lords and MPs who were railway directors were listed continuously there from 1858 to 1923. Geoffrey Alderman shows that from 1868 to 1879 the number of MPs holding railway directorships was between 106 and 132 (out of 640 seats) that is, roughly up to a fifth of the house. This fell somewhat in 1880-1891 to 78-108, fell again in the 1890s to 65-79 and later in first decade of the 1900s to 34-50, which effectively saw the end of the interest's influence during the Liberal administration of 1906-1910.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.227, pp.229-250&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberto Salas Benedicto''' (April 17, 1917&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; - May 15, 2000)  was a Filipino lawyer, ambassador, diplomat, and banker historically most remembered&lt;ref name="Hau20160408"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.grips.ac.jp/~esp/en/event/what-is-%E2%80%9Ccrony-capitalism%E2%80%9D/ |title=What is "Crony Capitalism"? |last=Hau |first=Caroline S. |authorlink=Caroline Hau |date=2016-04-08 |website=National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) Emerging State Project |publisher=National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies |location=Tokyo, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|crony]] of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/the-philippines-during-the-martial-law/ |title=It Takes a Village to Loot a Nation: Cronyism and Corruption |website=Martial Law Museum |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicto owned Philippine Exchange Company, the ''[[Philippines Daily Express]]'',  [[Radio Philippines Network]], [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]]. Benedicto was the Philippines' Ambassador to Japan from 1972 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-22/news/mn-269_1_federal-bank|title=Local Bank Known for Ties to the Marcoses|first=JUBE SHIVER|last=Jr|date=22 October 1988|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the prime of his career, Benedicto's empire consisted of 85 corporations, 106 sugar farms, 14 haciendas, other agricultural lands, 17 radio stations, 16 television stations, 2 telecommunications networks, 7 buildings, 10 vessels and 5 aircraft.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684 |title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism |last=Ricardo. |first=Manapat, |date=1991 |publisher=Aletheia Publications |isbn=9719128704 |location=New York |oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned 14 hectares of real estate in Bacolod City, 13.5&amp;nbsp;billion shares in Oriental Petroleum, and membership shares in golf and country clubs estimated at {{US$|491,000}}.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; Overseas, he owned a sugar mill in [[Venezuela]], a trading company in Madrid, bank deposits, mansions, and limousines in [[California]]. Marcos's executive secretary estimated that in 1983, Benedicto's net worth was $800&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Benedicto, born in [[La Carlota, Negros Occidental]] on April 17, 1917,&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{rp|page=100}} was a contemporary of Ferdinand Marcos, becoming his classmate and fraternity brother while studying at the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]].&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MathewsAirline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcos Seizes Airline That Billed Wife|first=Jay|last=Mathews|date=23 April 1978|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with Ferdinand Marcos ==
Roberto Benedicto was Marcos's former classmate at the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|UP Law School]], and his [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]] fraternity brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos|title=Marcos Graft Staggering|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

When Marcos became president, Benedicto became part of his small circle in [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañan]], one of the few with full access even to private quarters.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia2016"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Thirty Years Later ... Catching Up with the Marcos Era Crimes |last=Garcia |first=Myles |year=2016 |publisher=eBookIt.com|ISBN=9781456626501|quote="Although he was not a relative, Benedicto became part of the small Marcos circle in Malacanang and was one of the few with complete access to the president's private quarters" and "From La Carlota, Negros Occidental, Benedicto developed an early friendship with Marcos at the University of the Philippines".}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcos would eventually give power-of-attorney to Benedicto, allowing him to deal with corporations on the Marcoses' behalf.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt;  

=== Role in the creation of the Credit Suisse "Saunders Account" ===
It was with Roberto Benedicto's help&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; that Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos opened their first Swiss Bank accounts in 1968, funneling money which the Swiss Federal Court would later determine to be "of criminal origin".  This was the infamous "Saunders Account" with [[Credit Suisse]], which Ferdinand Marcos signed under the false name of "William Saunders" and which Imelda Marcos signed as "Jane Ryan".&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

== Role and business interests during the Marcos administration ==
Benedicto's business interests grew significantly when Ferdinand Marcos became president. Marcos appointed him as the Philippines' Ambassador to Japan and put him in charge of the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB), the Philippines' largest state-owned bank.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; 

=== Chairman of the Philippine National Bank ===
In his role as PNB Chairman, Benedicto permitted huge loans for business of other cronies and associates. He used PNB to grant loans for his shipping company, Northern Lines, and his sugar business.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt; His role as PNB Chair enabled him to gain control of additional banks, and overcome business competitors by dictating the terms of loans.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; 

=== Philippine Ambassador to Japan ===
{{main|Marcos Japanese ODA scandal}}
Benedicto's appointment as Japanese ambassador allowed him to develop high-level contacts in Japan. He secured more than {{US$|550}}M in World War&amp;nbsp;II reparations, which he allegedly used to promote his private interests.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt;

Working with President Marcos, they ratified the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the Philippines, which gave Japan [[Most favoured nation|most-favored nation]] status. This agreement gave Japan an advantage in using the country's natural resources, which was the primary reason the Philippine Senate did not ratify the treaty for 13 years.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt;

His ambassadorship also gave him insider knowledge regarding the business interests of the Japanese, which allowed him to arrange lucrative joint-venture operations between Japanese corporations and his own.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos |title=Marcos Graft Staggering:Investigators Trace Billions in Holdings |last=Crewdson |first=John |date=1986-03-23 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-05-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When the Marcoses were exiled to the [[United States]] in February 1986,&lt;ref name="JapanForeignRelationsinAsia"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=cBFFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT443&amp;lpg=PT443&amp;dq=Marcos+ODA+scandals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sC-HjBNB-a&amp;sig=WQ-gr_AJgc0X8u2NQVTJNcahpDw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOvde_3f_bAhVYbysKHTcwAIYQ6AEITjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcos%20ODA%20scandals&amp;f=false|title=Japan's Foreign Relations in Asia|last=Brown|first=James D.J.|last2=Kingston|first2=Jeff|date=2018-01-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351678575|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American authorities confiscated papers that they brought with them. The confiscated documents revealed that since the 1970s, Marcos and his associates received commissions of 10 to 15 percent of Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund loans from about fifty Japanese contractors. These revelations became very controversial and became known in Japan as the {{Nihongo|''[[Marukosu giwaku]]''|マルコス疑惑}} ({{lang-en|Marcos scandal}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gL-HDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=Marcos+ODA+scandals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m2dga16nUR&amp;sig=2LntN4uZtW4mKE7XMDmVLS9FK_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOvde_3f_bAhVYbysKHTcwAIYQ6AEIXDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcos%20ODA%20scandals&amp;f=false|title=Civil Society in Japan: The Growing Role of NGO’s in Tokyo’s Aid and Development Policy|last=Hirata|first=K.|date=2002-08-16|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230109162|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lessons from the Marcos scandal were among the reasons why Japan created its 1992 ODA Charter.&lt;ref name="JapanForeignRelationsinAsia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsunekawa2014"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Tsunekawa |first=Keiichi |date=February 2014 |title=Objectives and Institutions for Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) : Evolution and Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268503601_Objectives_and_institutions_for_Japan%27s_official_development_assistance_ODA_Evolution_and_challenges |journal=JICA Research Institute Working Papers No.66. |volume=No. 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sugar monopoly ===
{{main|Monopolies in the Philippines (1965–1986)#Sugar industry}}
The most-notable expansion in Benedicto's business holdings during the Marcos dictatorship&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; was in his establishment of a monopoly in the Philippines' sugar industry beginning in 1974, which earned him the monicker of "Sugar King".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/05/world/philippine-planters-and-workers-fight-sugar-controls.html|title=PHILIPPINE PLANTERS AND WORKERS FIGHT SUGAR CONTROLS|last=Kamm|first=Henry|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos's [[Proclamation No. 1081|proclamation of martial law]] allowed Benedicto to take control of the Philippine Exchange Company (Philex), which monopolized local hacienderos' (sugar barons) international trade.  Benedicto used Philex to buy cheap sugar from local producers and sell it abroad for large profits. Aided by Marcos's presidential decrees under martial law, Benedicto later seized control of the Philippine Sugar Commission, which accounted for 27% of the Philippines' dollar earnings at the time. In turn, a big segment of the profits from this sugar monopoly was deposited in a "special fund" which was "subject to the disposition of the president for public purposes."&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt;

=== Media monopoly ===
{{main|Monopolies in the Philippines (1965–1986)#Broadcast media}}
Martial law also gave Benedicto a media and telecommunications monopoly in the Philippines. Before martial law, he had transformed a small radio station that he owned into the Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS) (now [[Radio Philippines Network]]), a media empire that consisted of three television stations, 15 radio stations and a national newspaper called the ''[[Philippines Daily Express|Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; 

In 1972, news and media outlets were forced to cease operations, and their facilities were taken over by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/817651/september-1972-recalling-the-last-days-and-hours-of-democracy|title=September 1972: Recalling the last days and hours of democracy|last=Generalao|first=Kate Pedroso, Minerva|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benedicto was allowed to continue his broadcasts, to serve as the voice of the Marcos dictatorship. His newspaper, the ''Daily Express'', was the first to put out an edition after martial law was announced, three days later on September 25.&lt;ref name="MelaniePinlac20070901"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmfr-phil.org/media-ethics-responsibility/ethics/marcos-and-the-press/ |title=Marcos and the Press |last=Pinlac |first=Melanie Y. |date=2007-09-01 |website=CMFR |language=en-us |access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This monopoly secured Benedicto's political ties with Marcos and generated income as the owner of the sole running television and radio stations. Benedicto assigned Enrique Romualdez, a relative of the first lady, as chief editor of the paper to ensure that it held the views of the regime.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; {{rp|page=129}}

KBS was the only full-color TV channel in the country, and it was later taken over by [[Imee Marcos]]. Benedicto expanded his media business by acquiring [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC) which had five television stations, and nine radio stations.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; His growing media empire received government favors from the Marcos administration, with the president granting several Letters of Instruction (LOIs) for Benedicto's benefit. In 1977, Marcos issued LOI&amp;nbsp;640 to allow [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]], one of Benedicto's companies,&amp;nbsp;to import $3&amp;nbsp;million worth of TV transmission equipment and facilities, without paying taxes or tariffs. The LOI also allowed tax-free importation of $15&amp;nbsp;million worth of 12-inch black-and-white television sets for the next five years, and allowed Banahaw to commission a local company to assemble the television sets, justifying that these sets would be distributed to "critical areas" at lower prices. The LOI then instructed government agencies to market the TV sets. The ministries of Public Information, National Defense, Education and Culture were instructed to use the sets for their public information and educational projects.&lt;ref name="officialgazette19771215"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1977/12/15/letter-of-instruction-no-640-s-1977/|title=Letter of Instruction No. 640, s. 1977 |work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Marcos issued LOI&amp;nbsp;640-A, to extend the scope and duration of the earlier order. The new instruction directed government ministries to distribute Benedicto's television sets in the countryside areas "on matters pertaining to peace and order". Due to the tax breaks, Benedicto was able to sell 12-inch black-and-white television sets cheaper than the competitors who had to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1981/01/05/executive-order-no-640-a-s-1981/|title=Executive Order No. 640-A, s. 1981 {{!}} GOVPH|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Consumer Electronic Products Manufacturers Association (CEPMA) complained that the television sets meant for rural areas were being sold in Manila, greatly affecting their market.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{rp|page=130}}

==Compromise deal with the Philippine government ==
Benedicto entered into a compromise agreement with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] in 1990, surrendering about {{US$|16}}&amp;nbsp;million worth of Swiss bank deposits, shares in 32 corporations including "100% of the California Overseas Bank shares", cash dividends in his firms, and 51 percent of his agricultural land holdings.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/123667-marcos-cronies-compromise |title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies |last=Lustre |first=Philip M., Jr. |date=2016-02-25 |work=Rappler |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rock and Roll Hall of Fame''', located on the shore of [[Lake Erie]] in [[downtown Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of [[rock and roll]]. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by [[Atlantic Records]] founder and chairman [[Ahmet Ertegun]]. In 1986, [[Cleveland]] was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.

==Foundation and museum==
Founder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine editor and publisher [[Jann S. Wenner]], attorney [[Allen Grubman]], and record executives [[Seymour Stein]], [[Bob Krasnow]], and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of [[Bill Haley]] and ''[[American Bandstand]]''), Memphis (home of [[Sun Studio]]s and [[Stax Records]]), Detroit (home of [[Motown|Motown Records]]), Cincinnati (home of [[King Records (United States)|King Records]]), New York City, and Cleveland.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Cleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that [[WKNR|WJW]] disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] both coined the term "[[rock and roll]]" and heavily promoted the new genre—and that Cleveland was the location of Freed's [[Moondog Coronation Ball]], the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station [[WMMS]], which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[David Bowie]], who began his first U.S. tour in the city, [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Roxy Music]], and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/wmms--a-cleveland-legend-turns-40/|title=Exhibits|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.

Civic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 ''USA Today'' poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.  Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland.  "The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly," wrote [[Peter Guralnick]], author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Guralnick (author of ''Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll''), an interview, "Bostonia," Winter-Spring 2016, pp. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As ''The Plain Dealer'' music critic Michael Norman noted, "It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money." Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, "One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place," but then added, "I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland."

During early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by [[Lake Erie]], east of [[Cleveland Stadium]].

At one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect [[I. M. Pei]] to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. [[Larry R. Thompson]] facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200&amp;nbsp;ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162&amp;nbsp;ft (49 m) due to its proximity to [[Burke Lakefront Airport]]. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. [[Pete Townshend]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Sam Phillips]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[Sam Moore]] of [[Sam and Dave]], [[Carl Gardner]] of the [[Coasters]] and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]] all appeared at the groundbreaking.

The museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Little Richard]], among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Al Green]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[John Fogerty]], [[John Mellencamp]], and many others.

In addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum Timeline: 1995–2010|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/08/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_and_3.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impact===
Since 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986–92, 1994–96, 1998–2008, 2010–11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015).  Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grzegorek, Vince|date=April 8, 2016|title=Rock Hall President: Induction to Take Place in Cleveland Every Other Year Beginning in 2018|url=http://clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2016/04/08/rock-hall-president-induction-to-take-place-in-cleveland-every-other-year-beginning-in-2018|work=CleveScene.com|publisher=[[Cleveland Scene]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a [[public–private partnership]] between the City of Cleveland, the State of [[Ohio]], the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction  ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is going strong, 15 years after opening|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/08/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_and_4.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Millions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions, done 'the Cleveland way,' are a hit|url=http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_ind_17.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the [[Ahmet Ertegun|Ahmet M. Ertegun]] Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll ([[gospel]], [[blues]], [[rhythm &amp; blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], [[Country music|country]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Detroit]], London and [[Liverpool]], [[San Francisco]], Los Angeles, New York and [[Seattle]]. There are exhibits about [[soul music]], the Fifties, [[Sun Records]], [[Atlantic Records]], [[hip hop music]], Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=A look inside the redesign of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum: Interactive Graphic|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/03/a_look_inside_the_redesign_of.html|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called "Backstage Stories." The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on [[one-hit wonders]] and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about [[Les Paul]], [[Alan Freed]], [[Sam Phillips]] and the evolution of audio technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swank|first=Niki|title=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame: the heart of rock and roll|url=http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=1274|work=Builders Exchange Magazine|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes "The Power of Rock Experience," which includes one of [[Jonathan Demme]]'s final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Troy L. |title=Rock Hall premieres its spellbinding 'The Power of Rock Experience'|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/06/the_power_of_rock_experience_g.html |website=[[Cleveland.com]]|accessdate=September 10, 2017|date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Ellen|title=First Major redesign of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum nears completion|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/first-major-redesign-of-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-and-museum-nears-completion|publisher= [[Scripps Media]]/[[News Net 5]]/ABC News (Cleveland)|accessdate=March 4, 2013|date=June 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223062710/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/first-major-redesign-of-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-and-museum-nears-completion | archivedate=February 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Redesigned Rock Hall opens exhibit on The Beatles|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43326599/ns/travel-destination_travel/#.UTS1mKVBCME|work=Article|publisher=NBC News/AP|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about [[Elvis Presley]], [[hip-hop]], [[the Supremes]], [[the Who]], [[U2]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Clash]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], ''Women Who Rock'', and the [[Rolling Stones]].

===Architecture===
[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, showing [[Lake Erie]] in the foreground]]
Designed by [[I. M. Pei]] and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of [[Lake Erie]]. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass "tent" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.

The building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a café.

"In designing this building," Pei said, "it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of [[Cleveland]] and for fans of [[rock and roll]] around the world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=The House That Steel Built: A Showcase of Interesting and Aesthetic Projects|url=http://www.lera.com/files/rock%26roll_AISC.pdf|work=Business Literature|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit history==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}
Since 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.

The museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called ''I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 – 1969''. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including [[John Lennon]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Jefferson Airplane|the Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Janis Joplin]], as well as artifacts related to the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]] and [[Woodstock]].

That exhibit was followed by ''Elvis is in the Building'', an exhibit about the "King of Rock and Roll", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999.  This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986.  Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.&lt;ref&gt;(see Larry G. Keeter, "Elvis Is In the Building," "Elvis International Forum," Summer 2000,  pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29)&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, the museum curated ''Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story''. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by ''Rock Style'', an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from [[Buddy Holly]] to [[Alice Cooper]], from [[Ray Charles]] to [[David Bowie]] and from [[Smokey Robinson]] to [[Sly Stone]]. After it closed in Cleveland, ''Rock Style'' traveled to other museums in the U.S.

[[File:Rock-roll-annex-76-Mercer.jpg|thumb|upright|The former Annex in Soho in New York City (now closed)]]
Other temporary exhibits have included ''Lennon: His Life and Work'', which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by ''In the Name of Love: Two Decades of [[U2]]'' and then ''Reflections: The [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] Supreme Legacy Collection''. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was ''Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Troy|title=Rock Hall announces 'Rock, Power and Politics' exhibit to coincide with Republican National Convention|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/12/rock_halls_rock_power_and_poli.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large temporary exhibits have focused on [[the Clash]] (''Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash''), [[the Doors]] (''Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors''), [[the Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' (''Tommy: The Amazing Journey''), and [[Bruce Springsteen]] (''From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen''). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (''Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power''). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine [[Rolling Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Troy|title=Rock Hall exhibit lays out Rolling Stone magazine's remarkable impact|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/05/rock_halls_new_rolling_stone_e.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the [[Vans Warped Tour]], [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], Woodstock's 40th anniversary, [[Austin City Limits]], the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Graham Nash]], and [[John Mellencamp]].

The museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarborough|first=Chuck|title="Just Can't Get Enough: The Photography of Robert Alford" opens Sept. 19 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2012/09/just_cant_get_enough_the_photo.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum / Past Exhibits|url=https://www.rockhall.com/exhibits/past/|work=Official Website|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarborough|first=Chuck|title='Herb Ritts: The Rock Portraits': Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's captivating exhibit spotlights photographer's skill at capturing stars' essence (review)|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2015/03/herb_ritts_the_rock_portraits.htmllwork=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public programs===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.
Every February, the museum celebrates [[Black History Month]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hake|first=A.|title=Rock Hall Announces Black History Month Events|url=http://downtown.woio.com/news/events/89102-rock-hall-announces-black-history-month-events|work=Article|publisher=WOIO/19 Action News|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], [[the Temptations]], [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[the Ohio Players]], [[Lloyd Price]], [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]], and [[Al Green]] have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.

Another program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl "DMC" McDaniels of [[Run-D.M.C]]., [[Lloyd Price]], [[Marky Ramone]], [[Seymour Stein]], [[Ray Manzarek]] of [[the Doors]], [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Bootsy Collins]], Ann and Nancy Wilson of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] of the [[Jefferson Airplane]].

A similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. [[Peter Hook]] of [[Joy Division]], [[Spinderella]] of [[Salt n Pepa]], [[Tommy James]], and [[the Chi-Lites]] are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.

The American Music Masters series began in 1996 with ''Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger''. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] (1997), [[Robert Johnson]] (1998), [[Louis Jordan]] (1999), [[Muddy Waters]] (2000), [[Bessie Smith]] (2001), [[Hank Williams]] (2002), [[Buddy Holly]] (2003), [[Lead Belly]] (2004), [[Sam Cooke]] (2005), [[Roy Orbison]] (2006), [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (2007), [[Les Paul]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D.X.|first=Ferris|title=Slash, Billy Gibbons Jam for Les Paul at Rock Hall's American Music Master's Concert|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/slash-billy-gibbons-jam-for-les-paul-at-rock-halls-american-music-masters-concert-20081117|work=Article|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janis Joplin]] (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeMarco|first=Laura|title=Rock Hall to honor Janis Joplin in American Music Masters series|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2009/08/rock_hall_to_honor_janis_jopli.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fats Domino]] and [[Dave Bartholomew]] (2010), [[Aretha Franklin]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Aretha Franklin Honored in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame American Music Masters Tribute|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2011/11/aretha_franklin_honored_in_roc.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chuck Berry]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Patrick|title=Chuck Berry Praises Obama, Laments Fading Health|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chuck-berry-praises-obama-laments-fading-voice-20121027|work=Article|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll ===
{{anchor|The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll}}
Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with "the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts", created an unordered list of  "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/site/faq/|title=FAQ - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0150472.html | title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock|website=Infoplease.com | accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcom.com/Museums/nv/mr/44114-10.htm|title=Artcom Museums Tour: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, Cleveland, OH - Moving Companies|website=Art.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains songs recorded from the [[Stagger Lee (song)|1920s]] through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is "[[Wabash Cannonball]]", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as "The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll". The most recent songs on the list are [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" and [[My Chemical Romance]]'s "[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]", both released in 2006.&lt;ref name="655 Songs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/one-hit-wonders-songs-that-shaped-rock-and-roll/ |title=Experience The Music: One Hit Wonders and The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll |publisher=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628094517/http://rockhall.com/exhibits/one-hit-wonders-songs-that-shaped-rock-and-roll/ |archive-date=28 June 2011 |access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.

===25th anniversary concert===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. The celebration included performances by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[U2]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; [[the E Street Band]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Dion DiMucci]], [[Metallica]], [[James Taylor]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Ray Davies]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]], and [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]].

==Inductees==
[[File:Eric-Clapton 1975.jpg|thumbnail|220px|English guitarist, singer, and songwriter [[Eric Clapton]] is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]

{{See also|List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees}}
Artists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. 
Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters.
The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included [[Elvis Presley]], [[James Brown]], [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Sam Cooke]], the [[Everly Brothers]], [[Buddy Holly]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. [[Robert Johnson]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], and [[Jimmy Yancey]] were inducted as Early Influences, [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]] received the Lifetime Achievement Award and [[Alan Freed]] and [[Sam Phillips]] were inducted as Non-Performers.

===Performers===
A nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the "Performers" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.&lt;!--It is *not* impossible for 5 to 7 nominees to each receive 50 percent or more of a vote, as the number of nominees is not specified, and voters can select multiple nominees. There were seven inductees in this category in 2004, and eight in 2001. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/induction-process/|title=Induction Process|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, six additional groups, [[the Miracles]], [[the Famous Flames]], [[the Comets]], [[the Blue Caps]], [[the Midnighters]], and [[the Crickets]], were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. "There was a lot of discussion about this," said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/02/crickets_famous_flames_comets.html|title=Crickets, Famous Flames, Comets, Miracles, Midnighters and Blue Caps added to Rock Hall induction ceremony|author=Soeder, John|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Influences===
Early Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], and [[blues]], whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]] &amp; [[The Ink Spots]], country musicians [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Hank Williams]], blues musicians [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Muddy Waters]], and jazz musicians [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and [[Louis Armstrong]]. After [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Billie Holiday]] in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer [[Wanda Jackson]] was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the "rock era".

===Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement===
Formerly the "Non-Performers" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, [[tour promoter|concert promoter]]s and [[Journalism|music journalists]]. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder [[Ahmet Ertegun]], this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/late-ertegun-honoured-with-new-hall-of-fame-award_1062079|title=Late Ertegun Honoured With New Hall Of Fame Award|author=|work=Contactmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Award for Musical Excellence===
Formerly the "Sidemen" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran [[session musician|session]] and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the "Award for Musical Excellence" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, "This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/12/neil_diamond_alice_cooper_dr_j.html|title=Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Dr. John, Darlene Love and Tom Waits headed into Rock Hall|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=December 20, 2010|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Soeder, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library and archives==
[[File: RocknRollHall 2015 LHCollins 600.jpg |thumb|right|350px |The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio November 2015]]
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's [[Campus District]].

The Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.

The library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.

The archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], handwritten working lyrics by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[LL Cool J]], papers from music journalists such as [[Sue Cassidy Clark]], and rare concert recordings from [[CBGB]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Opens Archives to the Public|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-opens-archives-to-the-public-20120118|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Gary|title=Rock Hall Opening Library and Archives This Week|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/511232/rock-hall-opening-library-and-archives-collection-this-week|work=Article|publisher=Billboard Magazine|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Rock Hall Library and Archives set to open Tuesday|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/01/rock_hall_library_and_archives.html|work=article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder [[Jann Wenner]] (co-founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer [[Dave Marsh]], reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that "At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the [[doo-wop]] groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today."&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1966,00.html |title=Rock Hall of Fame Fallout: 'There Is Resentment Building Up' |accessdate=April 4, 2001 |author=Friedman, Roger |date=April 4, 2001 |publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]] is often considered "The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock &amp; Roll",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00xf8k7/the-godmother-of-rock-roll-sister-rosetta-tharpe |title=The Godmother of Rock &amp; Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe |work=[[BBC Four]] |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/black-culture/shows/list/rock-and-roll-rosetta-tharpe/|title=Godmother of Rock and Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe|work=PBS|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not chosen for induction until 2017. [[Velvet Underground]] drummer [[Maureen Tucker]] has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the "Hall of Lame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html|title=Doug Yule - Story|website=Olivier.landemaine.free.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders – and committee members say they want to keep it that way."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/in-rock-hall-of-fame-vote-a-battle-of-industry-egos.html|title=Battle of the Bands (and Egos) for the Rock Hall of Fame|author=Morrissey, Janet|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=December 5, 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jon Landau]], the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. "We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room."&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

According to [[Fox News]], petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/getting-progressive-the-rock-hall-voted-in-genesis-whos-still-missing.html|title=Getting progressive: The Rock Hall votes in Genesis. Is Yes or Procol Harum next?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2010|author=Boehm, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Brett Milano]], "entire genres get passed over, particularly [[progressive rock]], '60s [[Top 40]], New Orleans [[funk]] and a whole lot of [[African-American music|black music]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-03-11-rock-hall-main_N.htm|title=Dispute rocks the hall|date=March 12, 2007|accessdate=January 20, 2010|work=USA Today|author=Gundersen, Edna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous [[hip hop]] artists have been inducted, including [[Tupac Shakur]] (class of 2017), [[N.W.A]] (class of 2016) and [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] (class of 2007).&lt;ref name="Friedman2"/&gt;

Another criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.&lt;ref name="Bream"/&gt; A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.&lt;ref name="Bream"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/457/story/931216.html |title=Three strikes, they're in |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |author=Friedman, Roger |date=January 12, 2007 |work=Star Tribune |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020112245/http://www.startribune.com/457/story/931216.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including [[Joel Selvin]], himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/14/DDBITBMBD.DTL |title=View: Rock and Roll Hall offers lackluster candidates |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |author=Selvin, Joel |authorlink=Joel Selvin|date=November 14, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the British [[punk rock]] band [[The Sex Pistols]], inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum "a piss stain" and "urine in wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302091236/http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ |url=http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ |title=Official announcement from the Sex Pistols regarding the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |date=February 24, 2006 |archivedate=March 2, 2008 |work=[[Sex Pistols]] – The Filth and the Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]'s Annual [[John Peel]] Lecture in 2013, the singer [[Charlotte Church]] accused the museum of [[gender bias]], stating, "Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that [[Tina Weymouth]]'s part in [[Talking Heads]] makes them one of the 36 female acts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/10/15/church Transcript: Paul Resnikoff, "I'm Charlotte Church. And This Is How Women Are Routinely Demoralized by the Music Industry…,"] Digital Media News, October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/jpl|title=BBC Radio 6 Music - The John Peel Lecture - Downloads|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrollkit.com/s/GGR9Eju|title=scroll kit|website=Scrollkit.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which 61 have been women, none of whom has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: Inductees|website=Rockhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016 inductee [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not  enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/64693-steve-miller-rips-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/|title=Steve Miller Rips the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 vote controversy===
On March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of [[Fox News]] published an article claiming that [[the Dave Clark Five]] should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]. The article went on to say "Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act."&lt;ref name="Friedman2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258664,00.html#2 |title=Rock Hall Voting Scandal: Rock Group Actually Won |accessdate=April 6, 2007 |author=Friedman, Roger |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, "No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted.

===The Monkees controversy===

In June 2007, Monkee [[Peter Tork]] complained to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that Wenner had blackballed [[the Monkees]], commenting:

{{bquote|[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.}}

In a Facebook post, fellow Monkee [[Michael Nesmith]] stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: "I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesmith|first=Michael|title="Should The Monkees be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?", you ask.|url=https://www.facebook.com/michaelnesmith/posts/400891016595629|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the establishment of Oracle Business Limited Foundation, Ortom has set aside funds in St. Theresa's Hospital, Makurdi and Rahama Hospital, Gboko Road, Makurdi, for treatment of [[hernia]] and [[snakebite]]s free of charge to the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://samuelortom.com/blog/2014/05/22/ortoms-job-creation-initiatives/| title=Samuel Ortom –   Ortom's Job Creation Initiatives| work=Samuel Ortom| accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://samuelortom.com/blog/2014/08/06/list-of-treated-snake-bite-victims-and-cost-from-2010-2013/| title=Samuel Ortom – List of Treated Snake Bite Victims and Cost from 2010 – 2013| work=Samuel Ortom| accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has also reached out to prison inmates.

'''Shareholders in the United Kingdom''' are people and organisations who buy [[share (finance)|share]]s in UK companies. In large companies, such as those on the [[FTSE100]], shareholders are overwhelmingly large institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds or similar foreign organisations. UK shareholders have the most favourable set of rights in the world in their ability to control directors of corporations. [[UK company law]] gives shareholders the ability to,

*remove the board of directors with a simple majority of votes
*change the company constitution with a three quarter vote (unless a higher figure is in the constitution)
*wind up (i.e. liquidate) the company with a three quarter vote
*veto any sale of a significant percentage of company assets
*veto by a majority any restriction on ability to freely trade their shares, such as a [[poison pill]]

Shareholders also owe one another duties, and owe duties under the [[Stewardship Code]] to exercise their voting power.

==Shareholder rights==
Shareholders provide an essential source of capital investment to corporations, and because of the [[inequality of bargaining power|bargaining position]] this confers, shareholders typically gain a comprehensive set of governance rights under a constitution. While not technically required, shareholders invariably possess exclusive voting rights, in contrast to many other European jurisdictions which require that employees [[codetermine]] (i.e. have the right to elect some of) the members of the board.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, the [[Mitbestimmungsgesetz]] 1976 ([[Codetermination Act 1976]])&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, and also because of the additional mandatory rights shareholders enjoy under the [[Companies Act 2006]], the UK is a "shareholder friendly" jurisdiction relative to its European and American counterparts.

===Elections===
Since the ''[[Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment]]'', chaired in 1945 by [[Lionel Cohen, Baron Cohen|Lord Cohen]], led to the [[Companies Act 1947]], as voters in the general meeting of public companies,&lt;ref&gt;In closely held, private companies, the mandatory removal right in [[CA 2006]] s 168 is qualified by the majority House of Lords decision in ''[[Bushell v Faith]]'' [1970] AC 1099, holding that a company's articles could allow a shareholder's votes to triple if facing removal as a director. This followed the Cohen Report's recommendations.&lt;/ref&gt; shareholders have the mandatory right to remove directors by a simple majority, now under [[CA 2006]] section 168.&lt;ref&gt;Previously [[Companies Act 1985]], section 303, implemented in the [[Companies Act 1947]], following recommendations of the [[Cohen Committee]], ''Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment'' (1945) [http://www.takeovers.gov.au/content/Resources/other_resources/Cohen_Committee.aspx Cmd 6659]. See [[EM Dodd]], 'The Cohen Report' (1945) 58 [[Harvard Law Review]] 1258&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Aktiengesetz]] 1965 §76. This is the [[Vorstand]], or the "executive" of the company that carries out all functions of management, rather than the [[Aufsichtsrat]] or supervisory council, which appoints it and is in turn elected by shareholders and employees.&lt;/ref&gt; and in most American companies (predominantly incorporated in [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]]) directors can only be removed for a "good reason".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] s 141(k) and ''[[Campbell v. Loews, Inc]]'' [[s:Campbell v. Loew's, Inc./Opinion of the Court|134 A.2d 852]] (1957); for a comprehensive critique, see [[AA Berle]] and GC Means, ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitution===
Shareholders will habitually have the right to change the company's constitution with a three quarter majority vote, unless they have chosen to entrench the constitution with a higher threshold.&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 s 283 (special resolution definition), ss 21–22 (amending the constitution)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meetings and resolutions===
Shareholders with support of 5 per cent of the total vote can call [[Shareholders' meeting|meetings]],&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 s 303, as amended by Companies (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2009/1632 Pt 2, reg 4&lt;/ref&gt; and can circulate suggestions for resolutions with support of 5 per cent of the total vote, or any one hundred other shareholders holding over £100 in shares each.&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 ss 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive pay===
{{main|Say on pay}}
Shareholder have [[say on pay]] of directors under [[CA 2006]] section 439. For the time being, this is non-binding.

===Significant transactions===
Categories of important decisions, such as large asset sales,&lt;ref&gt;[[UK Listing Authority|UKLA]] [[Listing Rule]] 10.&lt;/ref&gt; approval of mergers, takeovers, winding up of the company, any expenditure on political donations,&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 ss 366–368 and 378 require a resolution, itemising the money to be donated, be passed by shareholders for any political contributions over £5000 in 12 months, lasting a maximum of four years.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[share repurchase|share buyback]]s. Other transactions where directors have a conflict of interest that require binding approval of shareholders are ratification of corporate opportunities, large self dealing transactions and service contracts lasting over two years.

Companies cannot make political donations without approval of the general meeting.

===Classes of shares===

==Shareholder duties==

===Activism===
{{main|Stewardship Code|Shareholder activism}}
Despite habitually occupying the most privileged position in UK corporate governance, shareholders in large public companies listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] infrequently exercise their governance rights. [[Institutional investors]], including [[pension fund]]s, [[mutual fund]]s and [[insurance fund]]s, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through [[Pensions in the United Kingdom|pensions]], are [[Beneficiary|beneficiaries]] from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. However, institutional investors also often work "behind the scenes" to secure better corporate governance for their members, through informal but direct communication with management.&lt;ref&gt;See BS Black and JC Coffee, 'Hail Britannia?: Institutional Investor Behavior Under Limited Regulation' (1994) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=276991 92 Michigan Law Review 1997–2087]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other peoples' money, are bound by [[fiduciary]] obligations, deriving from the law of [[English trusts law|trusts]] and obligations to exercise care deriving from the [[common law]]. Now the [[Stewardship Code]] 2010, drafted by the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Sociaal-Economische Raad''' (English: Social and Economic Council; SER) is a major economic advisory council to the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]]. Formally it heads a [[Publiekrechtelijke Bedrijfsorganisatie|system of sector-based regulatory organizations]]. It represents the [[social partners]] [[trade union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s. It forms the core organization of the [[corporatism|corporatist]] and [[social market economy|social market]] [[economy of the Netherlands|economy]] known as the [[polder model]] and the main platform for [[social dialogue]].

==History==
The SER was founded in 1950. It was founded after a long debate about the economic order of the Netherlands. The two main governing parties of the time, the Catholic [[Katholieke Volkspartij|KVP]] and the social-democratic [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]] had differing opinions on the subject. Both wanted to prevent the repetition of the [[Great Depression|economic crisis of the 1930s]]. The social-democrats preferred to grant the government an important regulatory role in the economy, while the Catholics preferred to rely on the workings of a self-regulating market economy. A compromise was found in the corporatist model, in which both [[Trade unions in the Netherlands|trade unions]] and employers' organizations would form sector-based regulatory organizations. The SER headed this structure and served as important partner for the national government. The SER was very important in the reconstruction of the Netherlands after the [[Second World War]]. 

In the 1950s and 60s the SER was particularly successful in ensuring economic growth by close cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organizations. In the 1970s because of rising political [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] and the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] the SER was unable to resolve economic problems. In the 1980s the SER returned to the centre of the economic policy making, as it was the platform for dialogue between  the government and its [[social partners]]. In the 1990s the role of the SER began to change. The role of the sector-based regulatory organizations began to decline and the SER more and more took the role of an advisory council of government, In 1997 the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] and [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] were granted the right to submit enquiry commissions to the SER.

==Goals==
The SER has three main goals for Dutch social-economic policy:
* To promote balanced and [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[economic growth]];
* To promote full employment;
* To promote a fair [[income distribution]].

==Organization==
[[File:SERDenHaag.JPG|thumb|SER headquarters, [[The Hague]]]]
The SER has thirty-three members. It consists of three sections, which each have eleven members in the council. These sections are trade unions, employers' organizations and government appointed members, the so-called Crown members. The trade union-members are appointed from the three major unions: [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]] (8), [[Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond|CNV]] (2) and the [[Federation of Managerial and Professional Staff Unions|MHP]] (1). The members of the employers' organizations are representatives from the three major employers' organizations: [[VNO-NCW]] (7), [[Midden- en Kleinbedrijf Nederland|MKB]] (3) and the [[Land- en Tuinbouw Organisatie|LTO]] (1). The government-appointed members are normally professors of economics or related fields and they include representatives of the economic planning agency [[CPB (Netherlands)|CPB]] and the central bank [[De Nederlandsche Bank|DNB]]. The board of the SER is formed by four members of each section. The chair of the organization is always a government appointee.

The SER heads and oversees the system of sector-based regulatory organizations. These organizations can like other governments, [[province]]s, [[water board]]s etc. enforce legislation{{examples needed|date=October 2018}} for their members, in this case companies. The SER is financed by levies which companies pay to the [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]]. It spends €14 million a year.

==Activities==
The group has negotiated among other things, agreements in the textile sector, the banking sector and the gold sector. The SER also performs legal and administrative tasks. For example in the field of employee participation, healthy and safe working, employment inspections and pensions.{{huh|date=October 2018}}&lt;!-- Are these binding agreements? What do they cover?

A '''sovereign wealth fund''' ('''SWF''') or '''sovereign investment fund''' is a state-owned [[investment fund]] that invests in real and financial assets such as [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], real estate, [[precious metal]]s, or in alternative investments such as [[private equity fund]] or [[hedge fund]]s. Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or from [[foreign-exchange reserves]] held by the [[central bank]].  By historic convention, the United States' [[Social Security Trust Fund]], with [[US$]]2.8 trillion of assets in 2014, and similar vehicles like [[Japan Post Bank]]'s [[JP¥]]200 trillion of holdings, are not considered sovereign wealth funds.

Some sovereign wealth funds may be held by a [[central bank]], which accumulates the funds in the course of its management of a nation's banking system; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance.  Other sovereign wealth funds are simply the state savings that are invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and that may not have a significant role in fiscal management.

The accumulated funds may have their origin in, or may represent, foreign currency deposits, gold, [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reserve positions held by central banks and monetary authorities, along with other national assets such as pension investments, oil funds, or other industrial and financial holdings. These are assets of the sovereign nations that are typically held in domestic and different [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]] (such as the [[United States dollar|dollar]], [[euro]], [[Pound (currency)|pound]], and [[yen]]). Such [[investment management]] entities may be set up as official investment companies, state pension funds, or sovereign funds, among others.

There have been attempts to distinguish funds held by sovereign entities from foreign-exchange reserves held by central banks. Sovereign wealth funds can be characterized as ''maximizing long-term return'', with foreign exchange reserves serving short-term "currency stabilization", and liquidity management. Many central banks in recent years possess reserves massively in excess of needs for liquidity or foreign exchange management.  Moreover, it is widely believed most have diversified hugely into assets other than short-term, highly liquid monetary ones, though almost no data is publicly available to back up this assertion. Some central banks have even begun buying equities, or derivatives of differing ilk (even if fairly safe ones, like overnight [[interest rate swap]]s).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==History==
The term "sovereign wealth fund" was first used in 2005 by Andrew Rozanov in an article entitled, "Who holds the wealth of nations?" in the ''Central Banking Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssga.com/library/esps/Who_Holds_Wealth_of_Nations_Andrew_Rozanov_8.15.05REVCCRI1145995576.pdf|format=PDF|title=Who holds the wealth of nations?|publisher=[[Central Banking Journal]] (May 2005, Volume 15, Number 4)|accessdate=2008-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529122341/http://www.ssga.com/library/esps/Who_Holds_Wealth_of_Nations_Andrew_Rozanov_8.15.05REVCCRI1145995576.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous edition of the journal described the shift from traditional reserve management to sovereign wealth management; subsequently the term gained widespread use as the spending power of global officialdom has rocketed upward.

Some of them have grabbed attention making bad investments in several Wall Street financial firms such as [[Citigroup]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and [[Merrill Lynch]].  These firms needed a cash infusion due to losses resulting from mismanagement and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

SWFs invest in a variety of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds.  Many sovereign funds are directly investing in institutional real estate.  According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute's transaction database around US$9.26 billion in direct sovereign wealth fund transactions were recorded in institutional real estate for the last half of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.swfinstitute.org/swf-article/sovereign-funds-embrace-direct-real-asset-deals/ Sovereign Funds Embrace Direct Real Asset Deals]." SWF Institute. August 1, 2013. Retrieved August 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first half of 2014, global sovereign wealth fund direct deals amounted to $50.02 billion according to the SWFI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunkley |first=Dan |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/ |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early SWFs===
Sovereign wealth funds have existed for more than a century, but since 2000, the number of sovereign wealth funds has increased dramatically. The first SWFs were non-federal U.S. state funds established in the mid-19th century to fund specific public services.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;M. Nicolas J. Firzli and Joshua Franzel: [https://www.academia.edu/7789625/Non-Federal_Sovereign_Wealth_Funds_in_the_United_States_and_Canada ‘Non-Federal Sovereign Wealth Funds in the United States and Canada’, Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. state of [[Texas]] was thus the first to establish such a scheme, to fund public education. The [[Permanent School Fund]] (PSF) was created in 1854 to benefit primary and secondary schools, with the [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF) following in 1876 to benefit universities. The PUF was endowed with public lands, the ownership of which the state retained by terms of the 1845 annexation treaty between the [[Republic of Texas]] and the United States. While the PSF was first funded by an appropriation from the state legislature, it also received public lands at the same time that the PUF was created. The first SWF established for a sovereign state is the [[Kuwait Investment Authority]], a commodity SWF created in 1953 from oil revenues before [[Kuwait]] gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. According to many estimates, Kuwait's fund is now worth approximately US$600&amp;nbsp;billion.

Another early registered SWFs is the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] of [[Kiribati]]. Created in 1956, when the British administration of the [[Gilbert Islands]] in [[Micronesia]] put a levy on the export of [[phosphates]] used in [[fertilizer]], the fund has since then grown to $520&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9230598 |title=The world's most expensive club |publisher=The Economist |date=2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and purpose==
SWFs are typically created when governments have budgetary surpluses and have little or no international debt. It is not always possible or desirable to hold this excess [[liquidity]] as money or to channel it into immediate consumption. This is especially the case when a nation depends on raw material exports like oil, copper or diamonds. In such countries, the main reason for creating a SWF is because of the properties of resource revenue: high volatility of resource prices, unpredictability of extraction, and exhaustibility of resources.

There are two types of funds: saving funds and stabilization funds. Stabilization SWFs are created to reduce the volatility of government revenues, to counter the boom-bust cycles' adverse effect on government spending and the national economy. Savings SWFs build up savings for future generations.  One such fund is the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway]]. It is believed that SWFs in resource-rich countries can help avoid [[resource curse]], but the literature on this question is controversial. Governments may be able to spend the money immediately, but risk causing the economy to overheat, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;in [[Hugo Chávez]]'s Venezuela or [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]-era Iran. In such circumstances, saving the money to spend during a period of low inflation is often desirable.

Other reasons for creating SWFs may be economic, or strategic, such as [[war chest]]s for uncertain times. For example, the Kuwait Investment Authority during the [[Gulf War]] managed excess reserves above the level needed for currency reserves (although many central banks do that now). The [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation]] and [[Temasek Holdings]] are partially the expression of a desire to bolster Singapore's standing as an international financial centre. The [[Korea Investment Corporation]] has since been similarly managed.  Sovereign wealth funds invest in all types of companies and assets, including startups like [[Xiaomi]] and renewable energy companies like Bloom Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Concerns about SWFs==
The growth of sovereign wealth funds is attracting close attention because:

* As this asset pool continues to expand in size and importance, so does its potential impact on various asset markets.
* Some{{which|date=August 2014}} countries worry that foreign investment by SWFs raises national security concerns because the purpose of the investment might be to secure control of strategically important industries for political rather than financial gain.  
* Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[Lawrence Summers]] has argued that the U.S. could potentially lose control of assets to wealthier foreign funds whose emergence “shake[s] [the] capitalist logic”&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;  These concerns have led the [[European Union]] (EU) to reconsider whether to allow its members to use "[[golden share]]s" to block certain foreign acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/sovereign-wealth-funds-the-new-hedge-fund/
 |title=Sovereign Wealth Funds: The New Hedge Fund?
 |publisher=The New York Times
 | date=2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy has largely been excluded as a viable option by the EU, for fear it would give rise to a resurgence in international protectionism. In the United States, these concerns are addressed by the [[Exon–Florio Amendment]] to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-418, § 5021, 102 Stat. 1107, 1426 (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. app. § 2170 (2000)), as administered by the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]] (CFIUS).
* Their inadequate transparency is a concern for investors and regulators: for example, size and source of funds, investment goals, internal checks and balances, disclosure of relationships, and holdings in private equity funds.
* SWFs are not nearly as homogeneous as central banks or public [[pension fund]]s.
* A lack of transparency and hence an increase in risk to the financial system, perhaps becoming the "new hedge funds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article1991137.ece |title=IMF concern over 'black box' funds of reserve rich nations |publisher=[[Times Online]] |date=2007-06-27 | location=London | first=Gary | last=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of SWF's commit to follow certain rules:
* Accumulation rule (what portion of revenue can be spent/saved)
* Withdraw rule (when the Government can withdraw from the fund)
* Investment (where revenue can be invested in foreign or domestic assets) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2011/03/11-sovereign-wealth-funds |title=Rebuilding America: The Role of Foreign Capital and Global Public Investors &amp;#124; Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=2011-03-11 |accessdate=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental interest in 2008===
* On 5 March 2008, a joint sub-committee of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|U.S. House Financial Services Committee]] held a hearing to discuss the role of "Foreign Government Investment in the U.S. Economy and Financial Sector".  The hearing was attended by representatives of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of Treasury]], the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], Norway's Ministry of Finance, Singapore's Temasek Holdings, and the [[CPP Investment Board|Canada Pension Plan Investment Board]].
* On August 20, 2008, Germany approved a law that requires parliamentary approval for foreign investments that endanger national interests. To be specific, it affects acquisitions of more than 25% of a German company's voting shares by non-European investors—but the economics minister [[Michael Glos]] has pledged that investment reviews would be "extremely rare." The legislation is loosely modeled on a similar one by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investments. Sovereign wealth funds are also increasing their spend. In fact, the Qatar wealth fund plans to spend $35 billion in the USA in the next 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=How Are Sovereign Wealth Fund Decisions Made?|url=https://www.indrastra.com/2017/12/How-are-sovereign-wealth-fund-decisions-made-003-12-2017-0022.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldfolio.com/news/qatar-to-invest-35bn-in-us-over-5-years/4186/ |title=Qatar to invest $35bn in U.S. over 5 years |publisher=The WorldFolio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santiago Principles===
{{See| Santiago Principles}}
There were a number of transparency indices springing out before the Santiago Principles, some more stringent than others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}  To address these concerns some of the world's main SWFs come together in a summit in Chile on 2-3 September 2008, under the leadership of the IMF, they formed a temporary International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds. This working group then drafted the 24 [[Santiago Principles]], to set out a common global set of [[international standard]]s regarding transparency, independence, and accountability in the way that SWFs operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwg-swf.org/pubs/eng/santiagoprinciples.pdf Sovereign Wealth Funds: Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (Santiago Principles)], International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifswf.org/santiago-principles|title=Santiago Principles|author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were published after being presented to the IMF International Monetary Financial Committee on 11 October 2008.&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"/&gt; They also considered a standing committee to represent them and so a new organisation, the [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (IFSWF) was then set up to maintain the new standards going forward and represent them in international policy debates.&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us|title=About us|author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, 30&lt;ref name="IFSWF003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifswf.org/our-members|title=Our Members|author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds|accessdate=27  September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; funds have formally signed up to the Principles representing collectively 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally or USD 5.5 trillion.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2016/04/04/238050/international-forum-sovereign-wealth-funds-ifswf-and-hedge-fund-standards-board-hf|title=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB) establish Mutual Observer relationship|author=Hedge Fund Standards Board|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New SWFs established in developed jurisdictions since 2010==
New SWFs were established in various developed jurisdictions after 2010 following the rise in energy and commodity prices, e.g., the [[North Dakota]] Legacy Fund (2011) and the [[Western Australia]]n Future Fund (2012). The [[Israeli Citizens' Fund]] should start operating in 2020 after several years of preparatory work involving veteran American as well as local [[asset management]] experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-natgas-idUSL5N1HC37U |title=Israel natural gas wealth fund expected to begin around 2020 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size of SWFs==
[[Assets under management]] of SWFs increased for the tenth year running in 2018 to a record $8.109 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/ |title=Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Retrieved on 2018-10-23 |publisher=Swfinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an additional $7.2&amp;nbsp;trillion held in other sovereign investment vehicles, such as pension reserve funds, development funds and state-owned corporations' funds and $8.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in other official foreign exchange reserves. Taken together, governments of SWFs, largely those in emerging economies, have access to a pool of funds totalling $20&amp;nbsp;trillion. Some of these funds could in future be channelled towards funding development of infrastructure for which there is global demand.

Countries with SWFs funded by oil and gas exports, primarily oil and gas exports, totalled $4.29 trillion as of the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund-rankings/ |title=Fund Rankings &amp;#124; SWFI - Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute |publisher=Swfinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-oil and gas SWFs totalled $2.82 trillion. Non-commodity SWFs are typically funded by transfer of assets from official foreign exchange reserves, and in some cases from government budget surpluses and privatisation revenue. Asian countries account for the bulk of such funds.

An important point to note is the SWF-to-Foreign Reserve Exchange Ratio, which shows the proportion a government has invested in investments relative to currency reserves. According to the SWF Institute, most oil-producing nations in the [[Persian Gulf]] have a higher SWF-to-Foreign Exchange Ratio—for example, the Qatar Investment Authority (5.89 times) compared to the China Investment Corporation (0.12 times)—reflecting a more aggressive stance to seek higher returns.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Norway, and Russia all have funds devoted to investing in oil and natural gas exports.  Other countries with investment funds are as varied as China, Singapore, Chile, and the Pacific island nation of Kiribati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emergingindex.com/2010/01/sovereign-investment-funds.html |title=Sovereign Investment Funds |publisher=[[Emerging Index]] |date=2010-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
