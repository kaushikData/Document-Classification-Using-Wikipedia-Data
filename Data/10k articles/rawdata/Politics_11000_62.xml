The '''AN/FRD-10''' Circularly Disposed Antenna Array (CDAA) was a [[United States Navy]] circular "[[Wullenweber]]" [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] array, built at a number of locations during the [[cold war]] for [[high frequency]] [[radio]] [[direction finding]] ([[High-frequency direction finding|HF/DF]]) and [[signals intelligence]]. In the [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System]], FRD stands for '''F'''ixed ground, '''R'''adio, '''D'''irection finding. 14 sites were originally constructed as a part of the "Classic Bullseye" program.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAS Bullseye"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fas.org/irp/program/collect/classic_bullseye.htm |title= AN/FRD-10 CLASSIC BULLSEYE |website= fas.org |accessdate= 2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two AN/FRD-10 systems were also installed in Canada. AN/FRD-10 systems were originally constructed in the 1960s, but after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the systems began to be shut down and demolished. The [[Naval Security Group]] operated and maintained the US Navy AN/FRD-10 systems. The system had several nicknames including '''Fr'''e'''d'''-10 and Elephant or Dinosaur cages.&lt;ref name="Morris, 2008" /&gt; As of 2015, none of the US Navy AN/FRD-10 sites are extant, but the two Canadian sites remain in service.{{cn|date=October 2015|reason=IP anon claimed operational without comment or citation. Need reliable source.}} The [[AN/FLR-9]] was a system with a similar design and function, but used by the US Air Force and Army.

== Bullseye ==
The program to install and operate the radio direction finding network was known as Bullseye, Clarinet Bullseye and Classic Bullseye at various points over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jproc.ca/rrp/masset.html |title= CFS Masset |first= Jerry |last= Proc |date= 3 February 2015 |accessdate= 4 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Classic was likely added later when permanently assigned "first words" were created for two-word nicknames. Classic was the word used to designate programs related to the [[Naval Security Group]] and Clarinet was used for programs related to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/codenames.html |title= Code Names for U.S. Military Projects and Operations |first= Andreas |last= Parsch |date= 2005 |accessdate= 4 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://fas.org/irp/doddir/navy/opnavinst/5511_37d.pdf |title= OPNAVINST 5511.37D |publisher= Chief of Naval Operations via fas.org |accessdate= 5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classic Bullseye was also related to the Centerboard and Flaghoist programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/CIADocuments/CIA-255_djvu.txt |title= Declassified US Government Internal Documents on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) #255 |website= Archive.org |accessdate= 2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centerboard was a network for processing HF/DF information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fas.org/irp/program/process/centerboard.htm |title= Centerboard |website= fas.org |accessdate= 2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security classification guide that covered all three programs was cancelled in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url= http://www.secnav.navy.mil/dusnp/Security/Information/Documents/Cancelled%20DON%20SCGs%20Report.pdf |title= Cancelled DON SCGs Report |publisher= Secretary of the Navy |accessdate= 2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url= https://fas.org/irp/doddir/navy/opnavinst/5513_4e.pdf |title= OPNAVINST 5513.4E |publisher= Chief of Naval Operations, via fas.org  |accessdate= 2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the programs Unitary DF and Crosshair sought to unify the military's HF direction finding information into a single data collection network.&lt;ref name="Friedman, 2006"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC&amp;pg=PA20 |title= The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapon Systems |first= Norman |last= Friedman |publisher= Naval Institute Press  |year= 2006 |ISBN= 978-1-55750-262-9 |page= 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosshair, an HF/DF geolocation network, is apparently still in use c. 2015, employing small fixed or mobile HF/DF systems instead of large Wullenweber arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IiedBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The U.S. Intelligence Community |first= Jeffrey T |last= Richelson |publisher= Westview Press |year= 2015 |ISBN= 978-0-8133-4919-0 |page= 243 |accessdate= 2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) led development of the technology that was used in the AN/FRD-10. Three developments were critical to the FRD-10, the ability to record portions of the frequency spectrum for future analysis, the Circularly Disposed Antenna Array (CDAA) and the computer control system that allowed rapid triangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content_images/75awards.pdf |title= 75th Anniversary Awards for Innovation |publisher= Naval Research Laboratory |date= 1998 |page= 28 |accessdate= 2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRL funded research at a test site built by the [[University of Illinois]] at the Bondville Road Field Station in [[Scott Township, Champaign County, Illinois]], south of [[Bondville, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.ece.illinois.edu/rao/MEFware/Wullenweber_and_the_books_it_made_happen.pdf |title= Wullenweber and the books it made happen |website= faculty.ece.illinois.edu |accessdate= 2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AN/FRD-10 antenna was a scaled-up version of the NRL prototype antenna array.&lt;ref name="Friedman, 2006" /&gt;

== Construction and Cost ==
[[File:FRD-10 Plan View of CDAA.png|thumb|Plan view of a CDAA quadrant]]
In 1959, the Navy awarded a contract to [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] Federal Systems to construct a network of AN/FRD-10 systems.&lt;ref name="MPDigest, 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpdigest.com/Military/issue/2014/Sept/Wullenweber/default.asp |title=The CDAA Antenna and the Wullenweber |publisher=Military Products Digest |date=September 2014 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first AN/FRD-10 to be constructed was at NSGA Hanza in [[Okinawa]], but future FRD-10 sites had different antenna dimensions. The High band reflector was reduced from 120&amp;nbsp;ft to 90&amp;nbsp;ft in later sites. Additionally, the outer high band antenna ring at Hanza was {{convert|311|ft|m}} from the center with later sites being around {{convert|435|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="1972 manual" /&gt; For the remaining sites, the outer antenna elements were spaced every 3 degrees around the circle and the outer reflector was {{convert|24.3|ft|m}} tall. The inner antenna elements were spaced every 9 degrees and the inner reflector was {{convert|90|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name="1972 manual" /&gt; One site was short lived. NSGA Marietta, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] closed in 1972 and reverted to a [[Lummi]] reservation.&lt;ref name="Spokane, 1971"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19711105&amp;id=t5pYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4373,1811552&amp;hl=en |title= Navy plans to close unit |agency= AP |newspaper= Spokane Daily Chronicle |date= 5 November 1971 |accessdate= 5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marietta was the first FRD-10 site to shut down and operated less than 10 years.

[[File:FRD-10 Major Components CDAA.png|thumb|left|Major components of the antenna array.]]
The 1970 estimate to construct a CDAA was just under $900,000 (${{formatprice|{{inflation|USD|900000|1970}}}} today) with electronics at the site estimated at around $20 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|USD|20000000|1970}}}} today).&lt;ref name="1972 manual"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy-radio.com/manuals/frd10-maint-9010.pdf |date= 1972 |title= Maintenance Manual for Antenna Groups OA-3967(XN-1)/FRD-10(V) and OA-3967/FRD-10(V) (15&amp;nbsp;MB) |website= navy-radio.com |accessdate= 2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system had 120 high band antennas and 40 low band antennas which had to be positioned within +/- two minutes of arc and +/- 3 inches of their intended distance from the center of the array. 160 75&amp;nbsp;ohm coaxial transmission lines were used to carry signals from the antennas had to be electrically matched to within 3/4 of a degree at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. This task was estimated at 300 to 400 man hours to complete.&lt;ref name="1972 manual" /&gt; There was also an extensive grounding system used at the FRD-10 sites. This included 360 ground radials made of 8 AWG wire, {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, extending from the outer antenna ring. It also included a massive ground grid, made of 10 AWG wire bonded together to create a mesh with {{convert|2|ft|cm}} squares. It was laid underground up to the radials in the area between the high and low antennas.&lt;ref name="1972 manual" /&gt;

Weather proved to be a challenge for the FRD-10 antennas. For example, the antenna at NSGA Winter Harbor had problems due to [[frost heaving]] the ground and shifting the reflector screens out of alignment. Digging up the affected poles and replacing them was costly and was estimated at around $240,000 in the late 1970s. An alternative method was discovered that modified the poles to allow readjustment of the screen instead the costly removal and replacement that had been done in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19810327&amp;id=lBM0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oyMIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1309,4174316&amp;hl=en |title= Man Gets $1,175 for $240,000 Idea |first= Michael |last= Gordon |newspaper= Bangor Daily News |date= 27 March 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrays were also vulnerable to high winds. Antenna arrays at Homestead, Florida and Sebana Seca, Puerto Rico were heavily damaged by hurricanes [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] and [[Hurricane Georges|Georges]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Morris, 2008" /&gt;

== Capabilities ==

The AN/FRD-10 had an estimated range of {{convert|3200|nmi|km}} and was used to monitor and triangulate single or double hop high frequency (HF) signals between 2 and 32&amp;nbsp;MHz. Site locations were likely chosen based on HF hop distances for their intended surveillance targets.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt;  The FRD-10 was designed to locate HF transmissions especially from submarines and was managed by the [[Naval Security Group]].&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt; The Navy also claimed over the years that the direction finding sites were used primarily for [[air-sea rescue|air and sea rescue]] operations&lt;ref name="Spokane, 1971" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19950512&amp;id=1qlJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YQ4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1499,3117400&amp;hl=en |title= Winter Harbor Naval Base Receives Orders until 2000 |newspaper= Bangor Daily News |date= 12 May 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and communications research, in the case of the [[Sugar Grove Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19870610&amp;id=ORAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y3IFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1036,2252642&amp;hl=en |title= National Security Agency has big, secret ears |first= Steven |last= Herman |agency= AP |newspaper= Schenectady Gazette |date= 10 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRD-10 used a goniometer to rapidly scan through all the antennas around the circle. This electronically "rotated" the antenna 360 degrees several times a second allowing fast and accurate direction finding.&lt;ref name="MPDigest, 2014" /&gt; This was needed because Soviet submarines began to use wide-band burst transmissions in the early 1960s to make themselves more difficult to pinpoint. Initially, these signals were too rapid for Bullseye's predecessor, Boresight, to locate, but the AN/FRD-10 was able to locate even very brief transmissions.&lt;ref name="Friedman, 2006" /&gt;

Sites in the Classic Bullseye network were connected by communications links to facilitate "near instantaneous" [[triangulation]] of received signals if two or more sites received the same signal. Signals could also be recorded for later direction finding. The system was four times more accurate than the prior Navy system with bearing accuracy better than 0.5 degrees.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt;

The Navy AN/FRD-10 was slightly smaller and had a narrower frequency range compared to the Air Force [[AN/FLR-9]] system.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B"&gt;{{cite report |url= http://www.masonarch.com/research-library/Antenna.pdf |title= HABS No. HI-522-B |publisher= [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] |date= May 2007 |first= Dan |last= Ruzicka |accessdate= 2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FRD-10 had only 2 antenna rings, {{convert|870|ft|m}} and {{convert|780|ft|m}} diameters.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt; The Navy system was vertically instead of horizontally polarized.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt; The FRD-10 was also said to be closer to omnidirectional than to the FLR-9 due to complications added by having three sets of reflectors and with FLR-9 array looking inward rather than outward. On the FRD-10 the high band elements were on the outside, vs inside.&lt;ref name="HABS HI-522-B" /&gt;

Smaller AX-16 Pusher antenna arrays were developed with about half the diameter of the AN/FRD-10 and were used at sites that required a smaller footprint, like Diego Garcia and other sites in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Friedman, 2006" /&gt; The pusher systems were found to have lower performance, but not primarily due to the reduced antenna size. Most of the excess signal loss and higher noise floor was attributed to problems with the RF distribution network and higher transmission line losses due to the RG-8 coaxial cable that the pusher systems used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a283263.pdf |title= AN/FRD-10 vs AN/AX-16 Pusher |accessdate= 2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afro-Arabs''' are individuals and groups from [[Africa]] who are of partial [[Arabs|Arab]] descent. Most Afro-Arabs inhabit the [[Swahili coast|Swahili Coast]] in the [[African Great Lakes]] region, although many can also be found in parts of the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name="Romero"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romero|first1=Patricia W.|title=Lamu|date=1997|publisher=Markus Wiener|isbn=1558761063|page=7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=Y5hyAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunnar M Ahmad Abdel Ghaffar Muhammad Chr Michelsens Institutt|title=Sudan Divided: Continuing Conflict in a Contested State|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1137338245|page=90|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=fe3QAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Arab resident of the Belgian Congo.jpg|thumb|Afro-Arab man of the Congo (ca. 1942).]]
By around the 10th century CE, Arabs had established commercial settlements on the [[Swahili coast|Swahili Coast]]. The Portuguese conquered these trading centers after the discovery of the Cape Road. From the 1700s to the early 1800s, Muslim forces of the [[Sultanate of Muscat]] reseized these market towns, especially on the islands of [[Pemba Island|Pemba]] and [[Unguja|Zanzibar]]. In these territories, the [[Oman]] Arabs mingled with the local "[[negro]]" populations, thereby establishing Afro-Arab communities.{{sfn|Hinde|1897|p=2}} The [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] [[Swahili language]] and culture largely evolved through these intermarriages between Arab men and native [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tarikh, Volumes 1-2|date=1966|publisher=Longman|page=68|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=qVvjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Arab communities were similarly founded in the [[Nile Valley]], as Arabs intermarried with indigenous [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] women.&lt;ref name=Mazrui77&gt;{{harvnb|Mazrui|2014|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Afro-Arabs in [[the Sudans]] had little biological connection to Arab peoples, but were instead essentially of Nilotic and Bantu origins, albeit influenced by the old Arabian civilization in language and culture.{{sfn|Guarak|2011|pp=7, 401}} In the mid-to-late 1800s, Arab traders began to move into the interior, in pursuance of the ivory trade in central Africa.{{sfn|Hinde|1897|p=3}} Unlike other cases of racial mixing, Arabs generally did not view Afro-Arabs as half-caste; Afro-Arabs instead enjoyed similar statuses in their societies as long as the father was Arab.&lt;ref name=Mazrui77/&gt; Thus, after the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of 1964, many of the Afro-Arabs that left Zanzibar and settled in Oman were able to attain high political and diplomatic positions and be accepted as Arabs.&lt;ref name= Mazrui&amp;Mutunga324&gt;{{harvnb|Mazrui|Mutunga|2004|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial assimilation of Afro-Arabs with non-Arab Africans also aided Muslim missionaries in the spread of [[Islam]] throughout Africa.&lt;ref name=Mazrui77/&gt;

In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], descendants of people from the Swahili Coast perform traditional [[Liwa (music)|Liwa]] and [[Fann At-Tanbura]] music and dance.&lt;ref&gt;Poul Rovsing Olsen, "La Musique Africaine dans le Golfe Persique", Journal of the International Folk Music Council, Vol. 19, (1967), pp. 28-36&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mizmar (dance)|mizmar]] is also performed by Afro-Arabs in the [[Tihamah]] and [[Hejaz]] regions of [[Saudi Arabia]].{{cn|date=June 2015}}

In addition, [[Stambali]] of [[Tunisia]] and [[Gnawa music]] of [[Morocco]] are both ritual music and dances, which in part trace their origins to [[West Africa]]n musical styles.

[[Image:closed.circuit.twocameras.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Closed-circuit television]] cameras such as these can be used to take the images scanned by automatic number plate recognition systems]]

'''[[Automatic number plate recognition]]''' (ANPR) is a technology for automatically reading [[Vehicle registration plate|vehicle number plate]]s. The [[Home Office]] states ANPR is used by law enforcement agencies in the [[United Kingdom]] to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality including tackling organised crime groups and terrorists.&lt;ref name=policeuk&gt;{{cite web|title=Automatic Number Plate Recognition|url=https://www.police.uk/information-and-advice/automatic-number-plate-recognition/|website=POLICE.UK|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vehicle movements on UK roads are recorded by a network of around 8500 cameras capturing between 25 and 35 million ANPR ‘read’ records daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of ANPR by police forces and other law enforcement agencies (LEA)|url=http://www.npcc.police.uk/FreedomofInformation/ANPR.aspx|publisher=National Police Chiefs' Council|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These records are stored for up to two years in the National ANPR Data Centre (NADC), which can be accessed, analysed and used as evidence as part of investigations by [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|UK law enforcement agencies]].&lt;ref name=policeuk /&gt;&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANPR|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/investigations/investigative-strategies/investigative-strategiesanpr/|publisher=College of Policing|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition]] government placed ANPR under statutory regulation through the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]]. This established a right in law to collect the data, and placed controls on its use, storage and access by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/04/anpr-surveillance-numberplate-recognition 'Big brother' traffic cameras must be regulated, orders home secretary], The Guardian, published 2010-07-04.

Their report said existing traffic cameras in towns and cities are being converted to read number plates automatically as part of the new national surveillance network.&lt;ref name="SUK" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What we're trying to do as far as we can is to stitch together the existing camera network rather than install a huge number of new cameras," - Mr Whiteley chairman of the ANPR steering committee said.&lt;ref name='SUK'&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Connor |coauthors= |title=Surveillance UK: why this revolution is only the start |date=22 December 2005 |publisher= |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article334684.ece |work=[[The Independent]] |pages= |accessdate=20 September 2007 |language= |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103025848/http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article334684.ece |archivedate=3 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some cameras may be disguised for covert operations but the majority will be ordinary CCTV traffic cameras converted to read [[Vehicle registration plate|number plates]].&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt; Every police force will also have a fleet of specially fitted police vans with ANPR cameras.&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt; All data generated is fed to The National ANPR Data Centre.

One camera can cover many motorway lanes. Just two ANPR devices, for instance, cover north and south movements through the 27 lanes of the Dartford crossing toll area on the Thames. Whiteley said the intention eventually was to move from the "low thousands" of cameras to the "high thousands".&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt;

==National ANPR Data Centre==
The National ANPR Data Centre stores all ANPR data feed from the various police forces, currently it does not take data from CCTV networks in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name='Gwatch'/&gt; It is based at Hendon in north London, on the same site used for the existing Police National Computer. In March 2006 the National ANPR Data Centre could store 50 million number plate 'reads' per day,&lt;ref name='UKDATA'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=UK car tracking database delayed to boost capacity | date= | publisher= | url =https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/18/anpr_delayed/ | work =[[the Register]] | pages = | accessdate = 20 September 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be expanded to 100 million 'reads' per day within a couple of years. The time, date and place of each vehicle sighting will be stored for two years.&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt; At the present 27 million clocks a day, over 18 billion ANPR records would be recorded every year.  According to the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] 25,000 hits per day against the ANPR database generate a transaction against the [[Police National Computer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/248237/0738.pdf] [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] Annual Report
and Accounts 2008/09. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crosschecks===
[[Image:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|[[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras]]
The National ANPR Data Centre is connected to the Police National Computer to provide up-to-date lists of vehicles connected by the police to crimes such as burglary or theft of petrol.&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt;
Other crosschecks will include insurance-industry data to identify uninsured drivers, vehicles without a valid MoT test certificates, vehicles who have failed to pay for valid [[vehicle excise duty]], and/or with vehicles with unlawful number plates.

The National ANPR Data Centre allows analysis across police force boundaries.&lt;ref name='Gwatch'/&gt; If a vehicle enters the ANPR network, the police should have an image of it entering the area, which may also show the driver and passenger. As the data generated is stored for two years the police argue criminals could be identified and linked to vehicles.&lt;ref name='Gwatch'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/e-public/story/0,,2012997,00.html|title=Worried about being watched? You already are.|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=SA|last=Mathieson|location=[[London]]|date=15 February 2007|accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data mining===

The National ANPR Data Centre will make it possible for software to [[data mining|data mine]] previous sightings of license plate to identify patterns in the data. Patterns can be used to build up intelligence of a vehicle's movements on the road network or to find cloned vehicles by searching the database for impossibly quick journeys.&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Gwatch'/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can use ANPR on investigations or we can use it looking forward in a proactive, intelligence way. Things like building up the lifestyle of criminals - where they are going to be at certain times. We seek to link the criminal to the vehicle through intelligence. Vehicles moving on the roads are open to police scrutiny at any time. The Road Traffic Act gives us the right to stop vehicles at any time for any purpose" - Frank Whiteley, Chief Constable of [[Hertfordshire]] and Chair of the ACPO ANPR Steering Group&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The database===
The National ANPR Data Centre uses an [[Oracle database]], and custom-written [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software with specific police networks rather than the internet used to send and receive data.&lt;ref name='Gwatch'/&gt;
The system will be designed to work with possible future electronic vehicle identification marks on the bodywork of cara.&lt;ref name='SUK'/&gt;

==Data access==

===Police===

All police forces have real-time access to ANPR camera data through direct links to the National ANPR Data Centre.&lt;ref name="SUK" /&gt; Effectively, the police (and the security services) can track any car (technically any numberplate) around the country in close to real time.&lt;ref name='CC'/&gt;

The current restraints on police use of ANPR data have been dictated by pragmatism rather than a concern for [[civil liberties]]. Giving every police officer free access to the system would overload the system, "make it unstable, slow it down", said John Dean, National ANPR co-ordinator for the Association of Chief Police Officers.&lt;ref name='UKDATA'/&gt; ANPR records younger than 91 days can only be accessed on the NADC with an Inspector's authority to investigate serious and major crime. Enquiries over 90 days to a year require a Superintendent's authority and any searches over a year require a Superintendent's authority and must be for Counter Terrorism only. 

Mobile ANPR systems such as ProVida ANPR are becoming more popular, with forces having systems in traffic police intercept cars. The advantage of this is that officers can get real time 'hits' from passing vehicles as they are on patrol.

==Legislation==
In 2012, the government enacted the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012|Protection of Freedoms Act]] which includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information about individuals. Under this Act, the Home Office published a code of practice in 2013 for the use of surveillance cameras, including ANPR, by government and law enforcement agencies. The aim of the code is to help ensure their use is "characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to [[policing by consent]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance Camera Code of Practice|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204775/Surveillance_Camera_Code_of_Practice_WEB.pdf|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=5|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a set a standards were introduced in 2014 for data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National ANPR Standards for Policing: Part 1 – Data Standards|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/policeuk/uploads/20141015_NASP_Part_1_Approved_version_2.0.pdf|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National ANPR Standards for Policing Part 2 – Infrastructure Standards|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/policeuk/uploads/20141015_NASP_Part_2_Approved_version_2.0.pdf|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and data access and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National ANPR Standards for Policing Part 3 – Data Access and Management Standards|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/policeuk/uploads/20141015_NASP_Part_3_Approved_version_2.0.pdf|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;bg

==History==

In August 2004 a presentation by John Dean, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ (ACPO) National ANPR Co-ordinator at IFSEC revealed how ANPR was being used to 'deny criminals the use of the road'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.securitysa.com/article.aspx?pklArticleId=3093&amp;pklCategoryId=22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2005 [[Policing in the United Kingdom|British police]] [[constable]] [[Sharon Beshenivsky]] was shot and killed during a robbery in [[Bradford]].  The [[Closed-circuit television camera|CCTV]] network was linked into an ANPR system and was able to identify the getaway car and track its movements, leading to the arrest of six suspects.  At its launch in May, Ch Supt Geoff Dodd of West Yorkshire Police, called the ANPR system a "revolutionary tool in detecting crime".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4455918.stm CCTV network tracks 'getaway' car]" at [[BBC News]], 21 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Laser in the United Kingdom===
In March 2005, plans were announced to set up a nationwide system of over 2,000 automatic number plate recognition cameras in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

This followed the successful rollout of Project Spectrum in which all 43 Police Forces in England and Wales were supplied by the Home Office with an ANPR capable mobile unit, and a 'Back Office'. A subsequent series of trials were then commenced in 2002 when the [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]] (VOSA) was given funding by the [[Home Office]] to work with the Police Standards Unit and develop "'''Project Laser'''" using the equipment supplied under Project Spectrum.  With the aim of running the ANPR system nationwide, it was initially trialled by nine police forces and ran between 30 September 2002 and March 2003.  Those police forces covered the areas of [[Greater Manchester Police|Greater Manchester]], [[North Wales Police|North Wales]], [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary|Avon and Somerset]], [[Northamptonshire Police|Northampton]], [[Metropolitan Police Service|London]], [[Kent Police|Kent]], [[West Yorkshire Police|West Yorkshire]], [[Staffordshire Police|Staffordshire]] and [[West Midlands Police|West Midlands]]

The second phase of the project ran between 1 June 2003 and 21 June 2004 and involved 23 police forces in total.  The DVLA is also involved with Project Laser, using the system to gather details on unregistered and unlicensed vehicles and those without a valid [[MOT test|MOT certificate]] or insurance cover.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Eventually the database will link to most CCTV systems in town centres, meaning that all vehicles filmed on one of the many cameras protecting Bedford High Street, for instance, can be checked against the database and the movements of wanted cars traced to help with serious crime investigations."
&lt;br /&gt;— [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927064841/http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/bedfordshirepolice/news/bedfordpolicesearch.taf?function=detail&amp;NewsRelease_uid1=1162 Bedfordshire Police]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The project was seen as a success despite a [[Home Office]] report showing that the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) trial had an error rate of up to 40%, with claims that the system was contributing &lt;blockquote&gt;"…in excess of 100 arrests per officer per year – ten times the national average…"&lt;ref&gt;
"[http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/ Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921030806/http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/ |date=21 September 2007 }}". Police Standards Unit, PoliceReform.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further findings went on to show that the error rate dropped to 5% when infrared systems and more regular updates of information were used.

During the second phase of the project around 28 million number plates were spotted in total, with 1.1 million (3.9%) of these matching an entry in one of the databases.  180,543 vehicles were stopped (101,775 directly because of the ANPR system), leading to 13,499 arrests (7.5% of the total) and the issue of 50,910 fines (28.2%).  1,152 stolen vehicles (worth £7.5 million in total), £380,000 worth of [[illegal drugs trade|drugs]] and £640,000 worth of stolen goods were also recovered.  The primary goal of the second phase was to see how well the costs of the ANPR system could be covered.  The final conclusion was that less than 10% of the expenditure incurred was recouped, with the Home Office claiming that the failure of drivers to pay fines contributed to this low figure, and continued to recommend the system be deployed throughout the UK.

Funding is now in place for the construction of the National ANPR Data Centre capable of holding 50 million ANPR reads per day, destined to form the basis of a vehicle movement database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/18/anpr_delayed/ UK car tracking database delayed to boost capacity] 18 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been stories in the national press suggesting that the use of the network could be extended to catch drivers using [[mobile phone]]s illegally, and those failing to wear [[seat belt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/transport/Story/0,,1725229,00.html Surveillance on drivers may be increased] 7 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; although the current system only retains text-strings consisting of number, date, &amp; time.

===Project Champion===
Project Champion is a project to install a £3m network of 169 ANPR cameras to monitor vehicles entering and leaving the [[Sparkbrook]] and [[Washwood Heath]] neighbourhoods of [[Birmingham]], both of which have large [[Muslim]] communities. Its implementation was frozen in June 2010 amid allegations that the police deliberately misled councillors about its purpose, after it was revealed that it was being funded as an [[counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] initiative, rather than for 'reassurance and crime prevention'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/18/muslim-cctv-scheme-police-row Police under fire over Muslim CCTV surveillance scheme], [[The Guardian]], published 2010-06-18. Retrieved 14 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/17/birmingham-stops-muslim-surveillance-scheme Birmingham stops Muslim CCTV surveillance scheme], [[The Guardian]], 2010-06-17. Retrieved 14 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Speaking on 14 September 2008, Simon Davies, the director of [[Privacy International]] stated that the [[database]] would give police "extraordinary powers of surveillance" and claimed that "this would never be allowed in any other democratic country".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/15/civilliberties.police Fears over privacy as police expand surveillance project] The Guardian, 2008-09-15. Retrieved 15 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

John Catt, an 80-year-old pensioner at the time and his daughter Linda (with no criminal record between them) - were stopped on 31 July 2005, had their vehicle searched under section 44 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] by [[City of London Police]] and were threatened with arrest if they refused to answer police questions. After making formal police complaints, it was discovered they were stopped after their vehicle had been picked up by roadside ANPR CCTV cameras, after a marker had been placed against their vehicle in the [[Police National Computer]] database as a result of them being spotted attending [[Criticism_of_EDO_Corporation#Protest_in_the_UK|EDO MBM demonstrations]] in [[Brighton]]. Supporters of the Catts highlight the fact that John and Linda Catt had been suspected of no crime, and argue that they were unfairly targeted due to their associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news6252.htm Watching You], SchNEWS 625, 20 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Police spokesmen described the campaign Catt had been taking part in as a "campaign of illegality designed to pressurise EDO to cease its lawful business" which led to a series of convictions of campaigners, and argued that surveillance of Catt was necessary because "his voluntary association at the Smash EDO protests forms part of a far wider picture of information which it is necessary for the police to continue to monitor in order to plan to maintain the peace, minimise the risks of criminal offending and adequately to detect and prosecute offenders".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/09/protester-sues-police-surveillance-database Protester sues police over surveillance database], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Sussex Police refused to confirm or deny whether a tag exists on their car. As of February 2012 John Catt did not have a criminal record. Catt commented "That our participation in peaceful protest outside an arms factory led to our arbitrary stop-check for terrorist activities many miles away by another force is a very disturbing development of the 'police state'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4393086.Brighton_pensioner_slams__police_state__after_terror_police_tag_car/  Brighton Argus: Brighton pensioner slams "police state" after terror police tag] car&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Register]]'' has noted that "in theory a system could be organised in such a way that records of law-abiding drivers weren't generated at all, but that hasn't been the way things have panned out."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/26/motorway_anpr_active_traffic_london_congestion_ibm/ UK.gov plans more active-traffic motorway ANPR cams] The Register, 2007-10-26. Retrieved 8 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car cloning===
The success of ANPR in detecting vehicles of interest to police has led to a new kind of crime - car cloning.  Criminals target vehicles of the same make and model to copy these number plates so that ANPR systems will record a read on the make and model relating to a fake number plate. Any legal transgressions could then lead to the legitimate owner receiving notification of enforcement action instead of the criminal.  There is very little monitoring of number plate manufacture, particularly websites offering "vanity plates"  (plates that are usable only in off-road circumstances, such as car shows) and this gives criminals avenues to attempt to evade detection, however ANPR will often show that there are multiple vehicles using the same registration number and prove that the genuine owner is innocent as well as providing images to identify the culprits.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/westmidlands/series7/car_cloning.shtml Inside Car Cloning]" at [[BBC Inside Out]], 3 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign position==
During his presidential campaign, Carter responded to a candidate survey by [[NORML]], and stated that he was in favor of decriminalization of cannabis, as had recently been [[Cannabis_in_Oregon#Decriminalization|passed in Oregon in 1973]].&lt;ref name="Delinquency1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

==Presidency==
In a 1977 address to Congress, Carter submitted that penalties for cannabis use should not outweigh the actual harms of cannabis consumption. Carter retained Nixon-era (yet pro-decriminalization) advisor [[Robert Du Pont]], and appointed pro-decriminalization British physician [[Peter Bourne]] as his drug advisor (or "drug czar") to head up his newly-formed [[Office of Drug Abuse Policy]].&lt;ref name="Gerber2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudak2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hudak|title=Marijuana: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9qACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=25 October 2016|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8157-2907-5|pages=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decriminalization===
Six months into his administration, Carter was already speaking in support of decriminalization of cannabis, replacing imprisonment with civil fines,&lt;ref name="M.P.H.2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael T.

===Opposition===
Carter's momentum on decriminalization was impeded by the discrediting of Bourne, leading to Bourne's resignation on 20 July, 1978. Bourne came under controversy concerning his efforts to maintain the confidentiality of one of his staff for whom he had written a prescription for [[methaqualone]]. Shortly thereafter, [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] executive director [[Keith Stroup]] leaked Bourne's alleged use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[cocaine]] (which Bourne had previously characterized as being "acutely pleasurable" in "The Great Cocaine Myth," a 1974 article for the ''Drugs and Drug Abuse Education Newsletter'')&lt;ref&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/special/9712/appc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; at a party coinciding with the group's annual convention to journalists [[Gary Cohn (journalist)|Gary Cohn]] and [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] in retaliation for the Carter administration's continued use of [[paraquat]] on Mexican cannabis fields.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/07/21/cocaine-sniffing-incident/9e5b6175-25a7-4169-8a8f-e12484aaa961/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4607.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassroots parents' organizations played a role in building popular opinion against cannabis decriminalization. The group [[Nosy Parents Association]] met with DuPont in 1977 and impressed upon him that youth cannabis usage was hurting students and families. Following this meeting, DuPont scaled back his support for decriminalization.&lt;ref name="WhitfordYates2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew B. Whitford|author2=Jeff Yates|title=Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda: Constructing the War on Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8nNThWU5IcC&amp;pg=PA54|date=11 September 2009|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9346-9|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerber2004"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Carter was also opposed by conservative politicians. Ex-governor of California and future president [[Ronald Reagan]] used his syndicated weekly radio show to attack Carter for being soft on cannabis, and support stricter anti-cannabis policies.&lt;ref name="TateTaylor2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katherine Tate|author2=James Lance Taylor|author3=Mark Q.

Congress ultimately ignored Carter's support for decriminalization, alarmed by a sharp increase in the use of [[cocaine]], and seeing cannabis as a [[gateway drug]].&lt;ref name="Farmbry2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kyle Farmbry|title=The War on Poverty: A Retrospective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LZKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=6 August 2014|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9079-1|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compassionate Investigational New Drug program===
The [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]] (Compassionate IND) was founded in 1978 by the Carter administration, providing federally-produced cannabis products to a limited number of assigned patients. The program was closed to new applicants in 1992 under the George H. W. Bush administration.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite news |date=November 24, 2009 |author= Goldman, Russell |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Business/man-sets-marijuana-record-smokes-115000-joints-provided/story?id=9159281 |title= Man Sets Marijuana Record, Smokes 115,000 Joints Provided by Federal Government |work=ABC News |accessdate= December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon emissions trading''' is a form of [[emissions trading]] that specifically targets [[carbon dioxide]] (calculated in tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] or tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) and it currently constitutes the bulk of emissions trading.

This form of permit trading is a common method countries utilize in order to meet their obligations specified by the [[Kyoto Protocol]]; namely the reduction of carbon emissions in an attempt to reduce [[climate change mitigation|(mitigate)]] future [[climate change]].

Under Carbon trading, a country having more emissions of carbon is able to purchase the right to emit more and the country having less emission sells the right to emit carbon to other countries. The countries emitting more carbon thereby satisfy their carbon emission requirements, and the trading market results in the most cost-effective carbon reduction methods being exploited first. For any given expenditure on carbon reduction, the market mechanism will result in the greatest reduction.

==Economics==
Emissions trading works by setting a quantitative limit on the emissions produced by emitters. The [[economic]] basis for emissions trading is linked to the concept of [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{Cite book

===Costs and valuation===
The economic problem with [[climate change]] is that the emitters of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) do not face the full cost implications of their actions (IMF, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name=imf&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are costs that emitters do face, e.g., the costs of the fuel being used, but there are other costs that are not necessarily included in the price of a good or service. These other costs are called [[external cost]]s (Halsnæs ''et al.''., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

External costs may affect the [[welfare economics|welfare]] of others. In the case of climate change, GHG emissions affect the welfare of people now and in the future, as well as affecting the natural environment (Toth ''et al.'', 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These external costs can be estimated and converted into a common (monetary) unit. The argument for doing this is that these external costs can then be added to the private costs that the emitter faces. In doing this, the emitter faces the full ([[social cost|social]]) costs of their actions (IMF, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;9), and will therefore take these costs into account in their decisions and actions.

===Ethics and fairness===
The manner in which climate change is addressed involves ethical and other issues related to fairness. To actually calculate social cost requires [[value judgement]]s about the value of future climate impacts (Smith ''et al.''., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

These valuations are chosen by the economist doing the study. Valuations can be difficult since not all goods have a market price.

There are methods to infer prices for "[[nonmarket|non-market]]" goods and services. However, these valuations can be controversial, e.g., valuations of human health impacts, or impacts on [[ecosystem]]s (Smith ''et al.''., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that social costs could be accounted for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective. Coase's model assumes perfectly operating [[Market (economics)|market]]s and equal [[bargaining power]] among those arguing for property rights. For climate change, the property rights are for emissions (permits or quotas). However, it should be noted that other factors affect the climate than just emissions, e.g., the ocean, forests, etc. (Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In Coase's model, efficiency, i.e., achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost, is promoted by the market system. This can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions. Flexibility is desirable because the [[margin (economics)|marginal]] costs, that is to say, the incremental costs of reducing emissions, varies among countries. Emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the marginal costs of abatement are lowest (Bashmakov ''et al.''., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, efficiency can also be promoted by allowing "banking" of permits (Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30). This allows polluters to reduce emissions at a time when it is most efficient to do so.

===Equity===
One of the advantages of Coase's model is that it suggests that fairness (equity) can be addressed in the distribution of property rights, and that regardless of how these property rights are assigned, the market will produce the most efficient outcome (Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In reality, according to the held view, markets are not perfect, and it is therefore possible that a trade off will occur between equity and efficiency (Halsnæs ''et al.''., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In comparison, industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax. It is therefore argued that with emissions trading, polluters have an incentive to cut emissions, but if they are exempted from a carbon tax, they have no incentive to cut emissions (Smith, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–57).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A pure carbon tax fixes the price of carbon, but allows the amount of carbon emissions to vary; and a pure carbon cap places a limit on carbon emissions, letting the market price of tradable carbon allowances vary. Proponents argue that a carbon tax is more easy and simple to enforce on a broad-base scale than cap-and-trade programs.  The simplicity and immediacy of a carbon tax  has been proven effective in British Columbia, Canada - enacted and implemented in five months. Taxing can provide the right incentives for polluters, inventors, and engineers to develop cleaner technologies, in addition to creating revenue for the government.

Supporters of carbon cap-and-trade systems believe it sets legal limits for emissions reductions, unlike with carbon taxes. With a tax, there can be estimates of reduction in carbon emissions, which may not be sufficient to change the course of climate change. A declining cap gives allowance for firm reduction targets and a system for measuring when targets are met.  It also allows for flexibility, unlike rigid taxes.&lt;ref name=Beinecke2009/&gt; Providing emission permits under emissions trading is preferred in situations where more accurate target level of emissions certainty is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade and climate change: WTO-UNEP Report|date=2009|publisher=WTO|location=Geneve|accessdate=26 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trading===
In an emissions trading system, permits may be traded by emitters who are liable to hold a sufficient number of permits in system. Some analysts argue that allowing others to participate in trading, e.g., private [[broker]]age firms, can allow for better [[risk management|management of risk]] in the system, e.g., to variations in permit prices (Bashmakov ''et al.''., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also improve the efficiency of system. According to Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001), regulation of these other entities may be necessary, as is done in other [[financial market]]s, e.g., to prevent abuses of the system, such as [[insider trading]].

===Incentives and allocation===
Emissions trading gives polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions. However, there are possible [[perverse incentive]]s that can exist in emissions trading. Allocating permits on the basis of past emissions ("grandfathering") can result in firms having an incentive to maintain emissions. For example, a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future (IMF, 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26).&lt;ref name=imf/&gt; This problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds, since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions (Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;38).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; On the other hand, a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away, provides the government with revenues. These revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy, e.g., by funding reductions in [[distortion (economics)|distortionary]] taxes (Fisher ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;417).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Coase's model of social costs, either choice (grandfathering or auctioning) leads to efficiency. In reality, grandfathering subsidizes polluters, meaning that polluting industries may be kept in business longer than would otherwise occur.{{Citation needed|reason=source|date=April 2014}} Grandfathering may also reduce the rate of technological improvement towards less polluting technologies (Fisher ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;417).

The economist William Nordhaus argues that allocations cost the economy as they cause the under utilisation an efficient form of taxation.&lt;ref name="nordhaus_taxorno"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordhaus points out that normal income, goods or service taxes distort efficient investment and consumption, so by using pollution taxes to generate revenue an emissions scheme can increase the efficiency of the economy.&lt;ref name="nordhaus_taxorno"/&gt;

'''Form of allocation'''

The economist [[Ross Garnaut]] states that permits allocated to existing emitters by 'grandfathering' are not 'free'. As the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter. The cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy, typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs.&lt;ref name='garnaut'&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.garnautreview.org.au/chp14.htm#14_3 |contribution=Releasing permits into the market |title=The Garnaut Climate Change Review  |publisher=Cambridge University Press   |ISBN=978-0-521-74444-7 |accessdate=2010-04-28  |year=2008 |first=Ross |last=Garnaut }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“It is important that we stop thinking in terms of payments to Australian firms in order to compensate them for the effects of the domestic emissions trading scheme. There is no basis for compensation arising from the loss of profits or asset values as a result of this new policy. The rationale for payments to trade-exposed, emissions-intensive industries is different and sound. It is to avoid the economic and environmental costs of having firms in these industries contracting more than, and failing to expand as much as, they would in a world in which all countries were applying carbon constraints involving similar costs to ours.”''

==Market trend==
Carbon emissions trading has been steadily increasing in recent years. According to the World Bank's Carbon Finance Unit, 374 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) were exchanged through projects in 2005, a 240% increase relative to 2004 (110 mtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e)&lt;ref&gt;http://carbonfinance.org/docs/StateoftheCarbonMarket2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was itself a 41% increase relative to 2003 (78 mtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf Microsoft Word - Carbon Market Study 2005 - FINAL - Letter.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing costs of permits have had the effect of increasing costs of carbon emitting fuels and activities. Based on a survey of 12 European countries, it was concluded that an increase in carbon and fuel prices of approximately ten percent would result in a short-run increase in electrical power prices of roughly eight percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |year=2009

With the creation of a market for mandatory trading of carbon dioxide emissions within the Kyoto Protocol, the [[City of London|London financial marketplace]] has established itself as the center of the carbon finance market, and is expected to have grown into a market valued at $60 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointcarbon.com Point Carbon news]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}} The voluntary offset market, by comparison, is projected to grow to about $4bn by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/282b278c-f4db-11db-b748-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=3c093daa-edc1-11db-8584-000b5df10621.html ''The carbon market''] Fiona Harvey, FT April 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voluntary surrender of units==
There are examples of individuals and organisations purchasing tradable emission permits and 'retiring' (cancelling) them so they cannot be used by emitters to authorise their emissions. This makes the emissions 'cap' lower and therefore further reduces emissions. In 1992, the National Healthy Air License Exchange was established to pool donations for buying and retiring sulfur allowances under the USA sulfur allowance trading program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Tietenberg |author-link=Thomas H.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British organization "Climakind" accepts donations and uses them to buy and cancel European Allowances, the carbon credits traded in the [[European Union Emission Trading System]]. It is argued that this removes the credits from the carbon market so they cannot be used to allow the emission of carbon and that this reduces the 'cap' on emissions by reducing the number of credits available to emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2010 |title=Strengthening the ETS

==Criticisms==
{{Criticism section|date=October 2014}}
{{see also|Criticism of the Kyoto Protocol#Criticism of Carbon Trade}}
Critics of carbon trading, such as [[Carbon Trade Watch]], argue that it places disproportionate emphasis on individual lifestyles and carbon footprints, distracting attention from the wider, systemic changes and collective political action that needs to be taken to tackle climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org
|title=Carbon Trade Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}} Groups such as [[the Corner House (organisation)|the Corner House]] have argued that the market will choose the easiest means to save a given quantity of carbon in the short term, which may be different from the pathway required to obtain sustained and sizable reductions over a longer period, and so a market-led approach is likely to reinforce technological lock-in. For instance, small cuts may often be achieved cheaply through investment in making a technology more efficient, where larger cuts would require scrapping the technology and using a different one. They also argue that emissions trading is undermining alternative approaches to pollution control{{Clarify|date=April 2010|reason=like what?}} with which it does not combine well, and so the overall effect it is having is to actually stall significant change to less polluting technologies. In September 2010, campaigning group [[FERN]] released "Trading Carbon: How it works and why it is controversial" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] has been criticised for not promoting enough [[sustainable development]].

Another criticism is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the Kyoto Protocol due to the surplus of allowances that some countries possess. For example, Russia had a surplus of allowances due to its economic collapse following the end of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name='liverman'/&gt; Other countries could have bought these allowances from Russia, but this would not have reduced emissions.

===Structuring issues===
Corporate and governmental Carbon emission trading schemes (a trading system devised by economists to reduce {{CO2}} emissions, the goal being to reduce global warming) have been modified in ways that have been attributed to permitting [[money laundering]] to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/International/2010/7/83958/ "Carbon trading used as money-laundering front: experts" www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828063745/http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/International/2010/7/83958/ |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
A '''corrector''' (English plural ''correctors'', Latin plural ''correctores'') is a person or object practicing [[wiktionary:correction|correction]], usually by removing or rectifying errors.

The word is originally a Roman title ''corrector'', derived from the Latin verb ''corrigere'', meaning "to make straight, set right, bring into order."

Apart from the general sense of anyone who corrects mistakes, it has been used as, or part of (some commonly shortened again to Corrector), various specific titles and offices, sometimes quite distant from the original meaning.

== Secular offices ==

=== Roman Antiquity ===
The office of ''corrector'' first appears during the [[Principate]] in the reign of [[Trajan]] (r. 98–117), for extraordinary officials of [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] rank, who were tasked with investigating and reforming the administration in the [[Roman province|provinces]]. To this end, they were entrusted with full ''[[imperium maius]]'', which extended also to territories normally exempt from the authority of the Emperor's provincial governors: the [[Free city (antiquity)|free cities]] of the [[Greek East]], the [[senatorial province]]s, as well as [[Roman Italy|Italy]] herself.&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = v. Premerstein | first = A. |title = Corrector | encyclopedia = [[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]] | volume = Band IV, Halbband 8, Corniscae-Demodoros | year = 1901 | at=col. 1645–1655}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title of these officials, from their institution to the end of the 3rd century, was in [[Latin]] ''[[legatus Augusti pro praetore]] [missus] ad corrigendum [ordinandum] statum'', in [[Greek language|Greek]] rendered as πρεσβευτὴς καἰ ἀντιστράτηγος Σεβαστοῦ διορθωτὴς [or ἐπανορθωτὴς] (''presbeutes kai [[antistrategos]] [[sebastos|Sebastou]] diorthotes/epanorthotes''). From the late 3rd century on, the title was increasingly, and afterwards exclusively, simplified as ''corrector'' in Latin and διορθωτὴς (or ἐπανορθωτὴς) in Greek.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

The sending of ''correctores'' to the Greek free cities, as well as to Italy, which as a metropolitan territory formally enjoyed a status different from the provinces, began a process of slow degradation of their distinct legal status and their gradual assimilation to the "ordinary" provinces, a process completed with the reforms of [[Diocletian]] (r. 284–305).&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; Thus, at the start of the 4th century, all Italian districts (and [[Sicily]]) had a ''corrector'' as governor, although by the middle of the century most were replaced by governors with the rank of ''[[consularis]]''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; In the administrative division as preserved in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', the ''correctores'' held the senatorial rank of ''[[vir clarissimus]]''. Those of the [[West Roman Empire]] ranked between the ''consulares'' and the ordinary ''[[praeses|praesides]]'', while in the [[East Roman Empire]], they ranked below the ''praesides''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

According to the ''Notitia Dignitatum'', ca. 400 the following provinces were under ''correctores'':
*[[Province of Apulia and Calabria|Apulia et Calabria]], in southern Italy.&lt;ref name="OccidensI"&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P1.HTM ''in partibus Occidentis'', I]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Lucania et Bruttii]], in southern Italy&lt;ref name="OccidensI"/&gt;
*[[Pannonia Savia|Savia]], in [[Pannonia]] (Balkans)&lt;ref name="OccidensI"/&gt;
*[[Augustamnica]], in Egypt&lt;ref name="OriensI"&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P17.HTM ''in partibus Orientis'', I]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paphlagonia]], in Asia Minor (Anatolia)&lt;ref name="OriensI"/&gt;

The ''corrector''{{'}}s staff (''[[officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]]'') is also specified: ''princeps officii'', ''[[cornicularius]]'', two ''tabularii'', ''commentariensis'', ''adiutor'', ''ab actis'', ''subadiuva''; finally unspecified ''exceptores'' and 'other' ''cohortalini'', i.e. menial staff.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P15.HTM ''in partibus Occidentis'', XLIV]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two famous but extraordinary ''correctores'' were [[Odaenathus]] and his son [[Vaballathus]], who rose to the fore when Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] was defeated and captured by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns in 260.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Odaenathus |volume=19 |page=995 |first=George Albert |last=Cooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odaenathus not only defended the frontier in the East but ended up creating an almost independent state (known as the [[Palmyrene Empire]], after its capital [[Palmyra]]), formally still within the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; For his efforts, he gained the title of ''corrector totius orientis'' "corrector of the whole East". When he died, his son requested and obtained, after some years, the same title, but later styled himself ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'', and Emperor [[Aurelian]] marched East to quash this open rebellion, defeating and capturing Vaballathus and his mother (and [[Éminence grise|''de facto'' ruler]]) Queen [[Zenobia]].

In various ''[[municipia]]'', ''corrector'' became the title of a permanent single [[chief magistrate]] (traditionally there had been collegial systems, e.g. two ''[[Roman consul|consul]]es'' or ''[[duumvir]]i''), as a Byzantine 7th-century source attests for thirteen cities in the Egyptian province [[Augustamnica Prima]].

* ''Corrector of the Press''

== Ecclesiastic (Catholic) titles==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Correctores Romani]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
* In the [[Roman Curia]] (papal ecclesiastical administration), there is an office of corrector and reviser of the books of the [[Vatican Library]]; of the former Tribunal of Correctors, abolished by [[Pius VII]], only a substitute-corrector among the [[Abbreviatores]] was maintained
* In the regular order of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]] it was the style of [[General superior|Superiors]] at the convent level, and the higher level, all elected; at the central level, the title is ''Corrector General'', and at the level of the province, ''Corrector Provincial''.
* '''Correctores Romani''' was the name of a pontifical [[canon law]] commission, installed by [[Gregory XIII]], later increased to thirty-five members by Pius V in 1566, which revised the text of the [[Corpus Iuris Canonici]].

Furthermore, the word Corrector was used as the title of several publications, some of which are quite famous, such as the 19th book, also known as ''Medicus'', of the Ancient [[canon law|canons]].

The derived term ''correctorium'' has been used for revisions of the text of the [[Vulgate]] Bible, begun in 1236 by the Dominicans under the French Cardinal [[Hugh of St. Cher]].

== Publishing ==
In the [[publishing]] of literature or other information, [[Editing|editor]]s assume the correctional roles of [[proofreading|proofreader]]s and [[Copy editing|copy edit]]ors in the editing cycle.

== Objects ==
The term is used for various devices used to correct another, as with a ship's compass or artillery.

The '''Council for National Policy''' ('''CNP''') is an umbrella organization and networking group for [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservative]] [[activists]] in the [[United States]].  It has been described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a little-known club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country," who meet three times yearly behind closed doors at undisclosed locations for a confidential conference.&lt;ref name="NYT-8-28-04"&gt;David D. Kirkpatrick, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/28/politics/campaign/28conserve.html?ex=1146110400&amp;en=f173712f417dcad1&amp;ei=5070 "The 2004 Campaign: The Conservatives: Club of the Most Powerful Gathers in Strictest Privacy"], ''The New York Times'', August 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Nation]]'' has called it a secretive organization that "networks wealthy right-wing donors together with top conservative operatives to plan long-term movement strategy."&lt;ref&gt;Max Blumenthal, [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/352178/secretive_right_wing_group_vetted_palin  Secretive Right-Wing Group Vetted Palin] thenation.com 09/01/2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was founded in 1981 by [[Tim LaHaye]] as a forum for conservative Christians seeking to strengthen the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT-2-25-07"&gt;David D. Kirkpatrick, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/us/politics/25secret.html?ex=1330059600&amp;en=95cfbe147d903c79&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Christian Right Labors to Find '08 Candidate"], ''The New York Times'', February 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNP describes itself as "an educational foundation organized under [[Section 501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. We do not lobby Congress, support candidates, or issue public policy statements on controversial issues. Our over 600 members include many of our nation's leaders from the fields of government, business, the media, religion, and the professions. Our members are united in their belief in a free enterprise system, a strong national defense, and support for traditional western values. They meet to share the best information available on national and world problems, know one another on a personal basis, and collaborate in achieving their shared goals."

== Meetings and membership ==
[[Marc Ambinder|Marc J. Ambinder]] of [[ABC News]] said about the Council:  "The group wants to be the conservative version of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]."  The CNP was founded in 1981. Among its founding members were: Tim LaHaye, then the head of the [[Moral Majority]], [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]], [[T. Cullen Davis]],  William Cies, and [[Paul Weyrich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121170 Inside the Council for National Policy] [[ABC News]] May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the CNP have included: General [[John Singlaub]], shipping magnate [[J. Peter Grace]], [[Edwin Feulner|Edwin J. Feulner Jr]] of the [[Heritage Foundation]], Rev. [[Pat Robertson]] of the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], [[Jerry Falwell]], U.S. Senator [[Trent Lott]], [[Southern Baptist Convention]] activists and retired [[Texas Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Paul Pressler (Texas)|Paul Pressler]], lawyer and paleoconservative activist [[Michael Peroutka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/28/us/2004-campaign-conservatives-club-most-powerful-gathers-strictest-privacy.html|title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE CONSERVATIVES; Club of the Most Powerful Gathers in Strictest Privacy|first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|date=August 28, 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend [[Paige Patterson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Membership is by invitation only.  The membership list, previously{{when|date=May 2016}} made public, is now considered "strictly confidential." Guests may attend "only with the unanimous approval of the executive committee." Members are instructed not to refer to the organization by name, to protect against leaks.&lt;ref name="NYT-8-28-04"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' political writer David D. Kirkpatrick suggested that the secrecy since its founding was intended to insulate the Council "from what its members considered the liberal bias of the news media."&lt;ref name="NYT-2-25-07"/&gt;

CNP's meetings are closed to the general public, reportedly to allow for a free-flowing exchange of ideas.  The group meets three times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Nancy|last1=Gibbs|first2=Michael|last2=Duffy|title=Still Looking for Mr. Right|work=Time|date=October 4, 2007|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1668472,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy is said to be similar to the  long-held policy of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which the CNP has at times been compared.  CNP's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status was revoked by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] in 1992 on grounds that it was not an organization run for the public benefit. The group successfully challenged this ruling in federal court.  A quarterly journal aimed at educating the public, promised in the wake of this incident, has not substantially materialized.  The group has launched a website that contains selected speeches from past gatherings.

While those involved are almost entirely from the United States, their organizations and influence cover the globe, both religiously and politically. Members include corporate executives,&lt;ref name="NYT-5-20-1981"&gt;Adam Clymer, [https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00C13FB3F5C0C738EDDAC0894D9484D81 "Conservatives Gather in Umbrella Council for a National Policy"], ''The New York Times'', May 20, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; legislators&lt;ref name="NYT-5-20-1981"/&gt; former high ranking government officers,&lt;ref name="NYT-5-20-1981"/&gt; leaders of 'think tanks'&lt;ref name="NYT-5-20-1981"/&gt; dedicated to molding society and those whom many view as "Christian leadership".&lt;ref name="NYT-5-20-1981"/&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] released a leaked copy of the membership directory for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf|title=2014 Membership Directory of the Council for National Policy, redacted and released by the Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences and political plans==
Leading members of the CNP voted in a meeting at the Grand America Hotel in [[Salt Lake City]], on September 29, 2007, to consider launching a [[third party (politics)|third party]] candidate if the 2008 Republican nominee were a [[pro-choice]] candidate. This was an implicit reference to [[Rudy Giuliani]], whose liberal opinions on several social issues, such as abortion, gay rights and gun ownership, had disturbed the Christian right. The CNP's statement read, "If the Republican Party nominates a pro-abortion candidate, we will consider running a third-party candidate."  Attending the meeting were notable social conservatives, including [[James Dobson]], [[Richard Viguerie]], [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] and [[Morton Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0907/Social_conservatives_say_they_may_back_thirdparty_if_prochoicer_is_nominee.html|title=Social conservatives may back 3rd party over Rudy|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|date=2007-09-30|website=POLITICO.com|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2007/09/30/giuliani_8/|title=Religious right may blackball Giuliani|last=Scherer|first=Michael|date=2007-09-30|website=Salon|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNP members have been given billions of dollars by [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder of the [[Unification Church]] and the conservative ''[[Washington Times]]'' newspaper, and are aligned with various other groups supported by him such as [[CAUSA International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/groupwatch/cnp_body.html |title=Welcome - Political Research Associates - Right Web |publisher=Rightweb.irc-online.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 Moon founded the [[Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation]], a [[public diplomacy]] agency which promoted the interests of [[South Korea]] and sponsored [[Radio Free Asia]].  Former [[U.S. President]]s  [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and [[Richard Nixon]] were honorary presidents or directors at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korean denies influence peddling|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19761102&amp;id=y6kzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yjgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3422,903462|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of [[Taiwan]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]] spoke at a Unification Church sponsored "[[Global Peace Festival]]" which was held in [[Taipei]] October 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rti.org.tw/Content/GetSingleNews.aspx?ContentID=89479 Pres - cross-strait peace is conducive to regional stability], [[Radio Taiwan International]], 2009-11-1&lt;/ref&gt;

CNP also has membership links to the [[Committee for the Free World]], whose many other members included, among others, some members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]], some Republican Party leaders, and [[counter-revolutionaries]] in Latin America, particularly during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightweb.irc-online.org/gw/1587.html |title=Committee for the Free World - Political Research Associates - Right Web |publisher=Rightweb.irc-online.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Midge Decter]] served as Executive Director of its Committee.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/about/board-of-trustees|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/midge-decter|title=Midge Decter|website=National Endowment for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weekly"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-039428-8 An Old Wife's Tale: My Seven Decades in Love and War], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', 07/30/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Irving Kristol]], [[Melvin J. Lasky]], [[Seymour M. Lipset]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[George Will]]. [[Eugene V. Rostow]], then serving as Director of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], was a speaker at a CFW event on [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="poland"&gt;Judith Miller, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/23/world/arms-control-chief-asserts-reagan-is-uncertain-how-to-use-power.html Arms control chief asserts Reagan is uncertain how to use power], ''The New York Times'', January 23, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a speech given to the CNP by Republican candidate [[George W. Bush]] is credited with helping him gain the support of conservatives in his successful bid for the [[United States Presidency]] in 2000.

== Method ==
The network stole several billion Euros from the treasury, through what [[Correctiv]] calls a "cum-ex" trade:

The participants in the network would lend each other shares in large companies, so that to tax authorities there would appear to be two owners of the shares, when in reality there was only one. The bank that was used in stock trading would then issue a "confirmation" to the investor that tax on the dividend payment had been paid - without it actually being done. "It’s a bit like parents claiming a child benefit for two – or more – children when there is only one child in the family." writes Correctiv.&lt;ref name="cumex"/&gt;   This practice was outlawed in 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40199259 |title=Germany fears huge losses in massive tax scandal |last=Hill |first=Jenny |date=2017-06-09 |website=BBC News |access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "cum-ex" is derived from Latin, meaning "with without", and refers to the disappearing nature of the fraudulent dividend payments.&lt;ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
State Commissioner August Schäfer first warned of the practice in 1992, after the testimony of five whistleblowers.  However, they remained widespread until an administrative assistant in the central German tax office noticed abnormally large tax rebate claims from a US pension fund.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

A '''deep map''' refers to a map with greater information than a two-dimensional image of places, names, and topography.

One such kind of intensive exploration of place was popularised by author [[William Least Heat-Moon]] with his book ''PrairyErth: A Deep Map'' (1991).  A deep map work can take the form of engaged [[documentary film|documentary]] writing of literary quality. It may be performed in long-form on [[radio]]. It does not preclude the combination of writing with [[photography]] and [[illustration]]. Its subject is a particular place, usually quite small and limited, and usually rural.

Some{{Who|date=May 2010}} call the approach 'vertical [[travel writing]]', while archeologist Michael Shanks compares it to the eclectic approaches of 18th and early 19th century [[antiquarian]] topographers or to the [[psychogeography|psychogeographic]] excursions of the early [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mshanks.com/2012/07/10/chorography-then-and-now|title=chorography – then and now|date=10 July 2012|website=mshanks.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.stanford.edu/MichaelShanks/51|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305085710/http://documents.stanford.edu/MichaelShanks/51|archivedate=2016-03-05|title=Deep maps|website=documents.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a deep map goes beyond simple landscape/history-based topographical writing to include and interweave autobiography, [[archeology]], stories, memories, [[folklore]], traces, reportage, weather, interviews, [[natural history]], science, and intuition. In its best form, the resulting work arrives at a subtle, multi-layered and "deep" map of a small area of the earth.

U.S. scholars and writers of [[bioregionalism]] have promoted the concept of deep maps. The best known U.S. examples are [[Wallace Stegner]]'s ''Wolf Willow'' (1962) and Heat-Moon's ''PrairyErth'' (1991).

In [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], the method is used by those who use the terms "[[spirit of place]]" and "[[local distinctiveness]]". [[BBC Radio 4]] has recently undertaken several series of radio documentaries that are deep maps. These are inspired by the "sense of place" work of the [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] organisation.

As used in the field of [[geographical information systems]], deep maps have more kinds of information than 2D images with labels. They may have 3D information, census information, health or immigrant or education information; information on particular buildings, museum artifacts and where they are from, and the overall demographics of cities. They can link places to documents about their history.  They can help support subjective descriptions, and narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Bodenhamer, David J.; John Corrigan; Trevor M. Harris. 2015. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxxzr2 Deep Maps and Spatial Narratives]''. Indiana University Press. DOI: 10.2307/j.ctt1zxxzr2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ieng Sary's first press conference after his defection took place in a safe house near Phnom Malai on August 28, 1996. Flanked by the commanders of the Pailin and Phnom Malai regions, the former Khmer Rouge leader said that he had decided to break away from "the dictatorial group of Pol Pot, Ta Mok, and So Sen" to end the decades of war. [...] Ieng Sary finished the interview by claiming he was a supporter of limited democracy, like that practiced in Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. [...] Ieng Sary's public relations effort shifted into high gear when he ... distributed a ten-page, typed document entitled, "True Facts About Pol Pit's Dictatorial Regime, 1975-1978." The report ... blamed the Khmer Rouge atrocities on Pol Pot and his "secret security committee" run by Nuon Chea, Son Sen and his wife Yun Yat, and Ta Mok — these were the real "mass murderers of Cambodia."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13208">'''ERP Security''' is a wide range of measures aimed at protecting [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems from illicit access ensuring accessibility and integrity of system data. ERP system is a computer software that serves to unify the information intended to manage the company including Production, [[Supply Chain Management]], [[Financial Management]], [[Human Resource Management]], [[Customer Relationship Management]], [[Enterprise Performance Management]], etc. Common ERP systems are [[SAP ERP|SAP]], [[Oracle E-Business Suite]], [[Microsoft Dynamics]].&lt;ref name="ERP"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP (enterprise resource planning) |url=https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/ERP-enterprise-resource-planning |newspaper=SearchERP TechTarget|date=May 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Review == 
ERP system integrates business processes enabling procurement, payment, transport, human resources management, product management, and financial planning.&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/applications/erp/what-is-erp.html|title=What Is ERP?|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As ERP system stores confidential information, [[ISACA]] recommends to regularly conduct a comprehensive assessment of ERP system security, checking ERP servers for software vulnerabilities, configuration errors, segregation of duties conflicts, compliance with relevant standards and recommendations, and recommendations of vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Information Age"&gt; {{cite news |title=Why security should be a priority for an ERP ecosystem |url=http://www.information-age.com/security-priority-erp-ecosystem-123468295/ |newspaper=Information Age|date=31 August 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes for vulnerabilities in ERP systems == 

=== Complexity ===
ERP systems process transactions and implement procedures to ensure that users have different access privileges. There are hundreds of authorization objects in SAP permitting users to perform actions in the system. In case of 200 users of the company, there are approximately 800,000 (100*2*20*200) ways to customize security settings of ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;ERP Security and Segregation of Duties Audit: A Framework for Building an Automated Solution https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/ivancevichd/classes/MSA%20516/Extra%20Readings%20on%20Topics/Database/ERP%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth of complexity, the possibility of errors and segregation of duties conflicts increases.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specificity === 
Vendors fix vulnerabilities on the regular basis since hackers monitor business applications to find and exploit security issues. SAP releases patches monthly on [[Patch Tuesday]], Oracle issues security fixes every quarter in [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html Oracle Critical Patch Update]. Business applications are becoming more exposed to the Internet or migrate to the cloud.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP Security Deserves Our Attention Now More Than Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/07/07/erp-security-deserves-our-attention-now-more-than-ever/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of competent specialists === 
ERP Cybersecurity survey&lt;ref&gt;ERP Cybersecurity survey 2017 https://erpscan.com/research/white-papers/erp-cybersecurity-survey-2017/&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that organizations running ERP systems "lack both awareness and actions taken towards ERP security".&lt;ref name="CSO"&gt; {{cite news |title=Survey reveals the damage of fraud attacks against SAP system is estimated at $10m |url=https://www.cso.com.au/article/621185/survey-reveals-damage-fraud-attacks-against-sap-system-estimated-10m/|newspaper=CSO from IDG |date=27 June 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, security vulnerabilities complicate undertakings such as detecting and subsequent fixing.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP Security Deserves Our Attention Now More Than Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/07/07/erp-security-deserves-our-attention-now-more-than-ever/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CloudComputing"&gt; {{cite news |title=Six classic ERP system security problems – and how to avoid them |url=https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2017/may/10/six-classic-erp-system-security-problems-and-how-avoid-them/ |newspaper=CloudTech|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of security auditing tools  === 
ERP security audit is done manually as various tools with ERP packages do not provide means for system security auditing. Manual auditing is a complex and time-consuming process that increases the possibility of making a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large number of customized settings ===  
The system includes thousands of parameters and fine settings including segregation of duties for transactions and tables, and the security parameters are set for every single system. ERP system settings are customized according to customers' requirements.

== Security issues in ERP systems == 
Security issues occur in ERP systems at different levels.

=== Network layer  === 
'''Traffic interception and modification''' 
* absence of data encryption 
In 2011, Sensepost specialists analyzed DIAG protocol used in SAP ERP system for transferring data from the client to the SAP server. Two utilities were published that allowed to intercept, decrypt, and modify client-server requests containing critical information. This made attacks possible including [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]. The second utility operates like a Proxy and was created to identify new vulnerabilities. It allowed modifying requests coming to client and server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erpscan.ru/press-center/press-release/erpscan-warns-about-new-vulnerabilities-of-diag-protocol-in-sap/ ERPScan warns about new vulnerabilities of DIAG protocol in SAP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* sending password in cleartext (SAP J2EE Telnet / Oracle listener old versions) 
In the SAP ERP system, it is possible to perform administering functions via [[Telnet]] protocol, which encrypts passwords.

''Vulnerabilities in encryption or authentication protocols''' 
* authentification by hash 
* XOR password encryption (SAP DIAG) 
* imposing the use of outdated authentication protocols
* incorrect authentication protocols 

'''Vulnerabilities in protocols (e.g. RFC in SAP ERP and Oracle Net in Oracle E-Business Suite).''' 
RFC protocol is used (Remote Function Call) to connect two systems by TCP/IP in SAP ERP. RFC call is a function that enables calling and running a functional module located in a system. The [[ABAP]] language that is used for writing business applications for SAP have functions to make RFC calls. Several critical vulnerabilities were found in SAP RFC Library versions 6.x and 7.x&lt;ref&gt;SAP RFC Library Multiple Vulnerabilities http://www.cnet.com/forums/post/7986898c-0a03-43d4-af70-b8427164c8e2&lt;/ref&gt;:  
* RFC function "RFC_SET_REG_SERVER_PROPERTY" allows determining an exclusive use of RFC server. Vulnerability exploits lead to a denial of access for the legitimate users. [[DoS-attack|denial of service]] becomes possible. 
* Error in RFC function "SYSTEM_CREATE_INSTANCE". Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code. 
* Error in RFC function "RFC_START_GUI". Exploiting vulnerability also allows executing arbitrary code. 
* Error in RFC function "RFC_START_PROGRAM".  Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code or gain information about RFC server configuration. 
* Error in RFC function "TRUSTED_SYSTEM_SECURITY". Exploiting vulnerability allows obtaining information about existing users and groups in RFC server.

=== Operating system level === 
OS software vulnerabilities 
* any remote vulnerability in OS is used to gain access to applications 

Weak OS passwords 
* remote password brute-forcing 
* empty passwords for remote management tools like RAdmin and [[VNC]] 

Insecure OS settings 
* NFS and SMB. SAP data becomes accessible to remote users via NFS an SMB 
* file access rights. Critical SAP and DBMS Oracle data files have insecure access rights such as 755 and 777 
* insecure hosts settings. In the trusted hosts, servers can be listed and an attacker easily accesses them

=== Application vulnerabilities === 
ERP systems transfer more functionality on the web applications level with a lot of vulnerabilities:  
* Web application vulnerabilities ([[XSS]], [[XSRF]], [[SQL Injection]], Response Splitting, Code Execution) 
* Buffer overflow and format string  in web-servers and application-servers (SAP IGS, SAP Netweaver, Oracle BEA Weblogic) 
* Insecure privileges for access (SAP Netweaver, SAP CRM, Oracle E-Business Suite)

== Role-based access control == 
In ERP systems, RBAC ([[Role-Based Access Control]]) model is applied for users to perform transactions and gain access to business objects.&lt;ref&gt;Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems http://www.utdallas.edu/~bxt043000/Publications/Journal-Papers/DAS/J46_Security_for_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_Systems.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
In the model, the decision to grant access to a user is made based on the functions of users, or roles. Roles are a multitude of transactions the user or a group of users performs in the company. Transaction is a procedure of transforming system data, which helps perform this transaction. For any role, there is a number of corresponding users with one or multiple roles. Roles can be hierarchical. After the roles are implemented in the system, transactions corresponding to each role rarely change. The administrator needs to add or delete users from roles. The administrator provides a new user with a membership in one or more roles. When employees leave the organization, the administrator removes them from all the roles.&lt;ref&gt;Role-Based Access Controls http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

== Segregation of Duties == 
Segregation or [[Separation of duties]], also known as SoD, is the concept according to which a user cannot make a transaction without other users (e.g. a user cannot add a new supplier, write out a cheque or pay to a supplier)&lt;ref&gt;ISACA Glossary Terms http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Lists/ISACA%20Glossary%20Terms/DispForm.aspx?ID=1700&lt;/ref&gt; and a risk of fraud is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;A risk-based approach
to segregation of duties http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_Segregation_of_duties/$FILE/EY_Segregation_of_dutie/s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SoD can be implemented by RBAC mechanisms, and a notion of mutually exclusive roles is introduced. For instance, to pay a supplier, one user initiates payment procedure and another accepts it.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Botha and J. H. P. Eloff [http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/403/botha.html Separation of Duties for Access Control Enforcement in Workflow Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, initiating payment and accepting are mutually exclusive roles. Segregation of duties can be either static or dynamic. With static SoD (SSoD), a user cannot belong to two mutually exclusive roles. With dynamic SoD (DSoD), a user does but cannot perform them within one transaction. Both of them have their own advantages. SSoD is simple, while DSoD is flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Simple Search http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/all/52d12689b4758c84c12572a600386f1d/$file/mcs-2006-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation of Duties is explained in SoD matrix. X and Y matrixes describe system roles. If the two roles are mutually exclusive, there is a flag at the interception of the corresponding rows and columns.

== ERP Security scanners == 
ERP Security scanner is a software intended to search for vulnerabilities in ERP systems. Scanner analyzes configurations of ERP system, searches for misconfigurations, access control and encryption conflicts, insecure components, and checks for updates. The scanner checks system parameters for compliance with the manufacturer's recommendations and auditing procedures [[:en:ISACA|ISACA]]. ERP Security scanners produce reports with the vulnerabilities listed according to their criticality.
The examples of scanners:

The '''eightfold path''' is a method of [[policy analysis]] assembled by [[Eugene Bardach]], a professor at the [[Goldman School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Bardach {{!}} Emeritus Professor of Public Policy|url=https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/eugene-bardach|publisher=University of California at Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is outlined in his book ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving'', which is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Press: Book: A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving, 4th Edition, Eugene Bardach |url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |publisher=CQ Press |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010053147/http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is commonly referenced in [[Policy|public policy]] and [[public administration]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of scholarly works referencing ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis''|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4884126323094470718&amp;as_sdt=20005&amp;sciodt=0,9&amp;hl=en|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardach's procedure is as follows:
# Define the problem
# Assemble some evidence
# Construct the alternatives
# Select the criteria
# Project the outcomes
# Confront the trade-offs
# Decide
# Tell your story

A possible ninth step, based on Bardach's own writing, might be "repeat steps 1 - 8 as necessary."

== The New York taxi driver test ==
The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bardach| first = Eugene| title = A practical guide for policy analysis: the eightfold path to more effective problem solving| year = 2000| publisher = Chatham House Publishers, Seven Bridges Press| isbn = 978-1-889119-29-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p%3D321 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712110533/http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p=321 |archivedate=12 July 2011 |title=Digital Fishers – The Taxi Driver Pitch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Forum Minority Research Institute''' or '''Forum Institute''' (''Fórum Kisebbségkutató Intézet'' or ''Fórum Intézet'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''Fórum inštitút pre výskum menšín'' or ''Fórum inštitút'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) is a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[think tank]] with its main focus on [[ethnic minorities]] living in Slovakia, especially [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarians]]. The [[NGO]]'s scope of activities are the study and documenting of ethnic minorities,&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foruminst.sk/en/18/about_us|title=About us|work=Forum Minority Research Institute|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing these findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foruminst.sk/en/5/publications/0/publications_of_the_forum_minority_research_institute|title=Publications|work=Forum Minority Research Institute|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the keeping of a database of historical documents and photographs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foruminst.sk/hu/13/kepeslapok/1/a_forum_kisebbsegkutato_intezet_kepeslapgyujtemenye|title=A Fórum Kisebbségkutató Intézet képeslapgyűjteménye|language=Hungarian|work=Forum Minority Research Institute|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also speaks out on government policy-making on a regular basis, especially when the policies affects the minorities in a negative way,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/38800/2/promises_not_kept_say_ethnic_hungarians_updated.html|publisher=''The Slovak Spectator''|title=Promises not kept, say ethnic Hungarians|author=Michaela Terenzani - Stanková|date={{date|2010-05-10}}|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sometimes triggers criticism from Slovak [[nationalism|nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/587|title=Res publica|language=Slovak|date=August 2009|author=Ľudovít Števko|publisher=''Extra Plus''|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The institute was founded in 1996 by the [[Katedra Foundation]] and the [[Forum Foundation]] in [[Dunajská Streda]]. In 1999, two partner institutes were founded: the [[Forum Information Centre]] provides civil training and civil service, while the [[Forum Regional Development Centre]] is engaged with rural development and small area planning. Together with the Forum Minority Research Institute, these three organizations form a consortium, the [[Forum Institute (Slovakia)|Forum Institute]]. In 2002 the Forum Institute moved to [[Šamorín]], where it resides up to this day.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; The president of the Institute is [[political science|political analyst]] [[László Öllös]].

'''Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული ოცნება – დემოკრატიული საქართველო}}, ''Kartuli ocneba – Demok’rat’iuli Sakartvelo'') is the governing party of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The party was established on 19 April 2012 by the billionaire businessman and politician [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]].&lt;ref name="Jones2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Jones|chapter=Preface to the Paperback Edition|title=Georgia: A Political History Since Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcMZCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|year=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78453-085-3 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the leading party of the six-party Georgian Dream [[political alliance|political coalition]] which won the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]]. The political party Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia currently has 115 seats in the 150-seat Georgian parliament.

==History==
The party evolved from the public movement Georgian Dream, launched by Ivanishvili as a platform for his political activities in December 2011. Since Ivanishvili was not a Georgian citizen at the moment of the party's inaugural session, the lawyer [[Manana Kobakhidze]] was elected as an interim, nominal chairman of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia. The party also includes several notable Georgians such as the politician [[Sozar Subari]], former diplomat [[Tedo Japaridze]], chess grandmaster [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]], security commentator Irakli Sesiashvili, writer Guram Odisharia and famed [[Association football|footballer]] [[Kakha Kaladze]].&lt;ref name="civil-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SForward&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/shevchenko-hangs-boots-politics-143548518--sow.html Shevchenko hangs up boots for politics]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, AFP (28 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The party successfully challenged the ruling [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] (UMN) in the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], pledging to increase welfare spending and pursue a more pragmatic foreign policy with Russia.&lt;ref name="civil-1"&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=24683 Ivanishvili's Political Party Launched]. Civil Georgia. 21 April 2012. Retrieved 12 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It won this election in coalition with six other opposition parties, with 54.97% of the vote, being allotted 85 seats in parliament.&lt;ref name="Jones2015"/&gt; The governing UMN took 40.34%. [[President of Georgia|President]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] conceded that his party lost, and pledged to support the constitutional process of forming a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barry |first=Ellen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/world/europe/georgia-election-results.html?ref=global-home |title=Georgia’s President Concedes Defeat in Parliamentary Election |location=Georgia (Georgian Republic) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2012-10-02 |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 senior MP Gedevan Popkhadze threatened to quit the party for its endorsement of an opposition-nominated candidate to the supervisory board of the [[Georgia Public Broadcasting|Georgian Public Broadcaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior MP Ponders Quitting Georgian Dream|url=https://old.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=31008|website=Civil.Ge|publisher=civil.ge|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkhadze criticized the candidate on account of her anti-clerical activism. The incident is seen as an internal conflict between long-time GD members which joined the party while it was in opposition and a new group of members who were installed in high positions prior to the 2016 parliamentary elections. The news agency [[Democracy and Freedom Watch]] related the incident to the return of Bidzina Ivanishvili as chairman of the party later that month, which furthermore was perceived as a move to maintain the unity of the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DFWatch Staff|title=Ivanishvili to make political comeback, will head Georgia’s ruling GD|url=http://dfwatch.net/ivanishvili-make-political-comeback-will-head-georgias-ruling-gd-50262|accessdate=24 May 2018|agency=Democracy and Freedom Watch|date=Apr 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2018 Chairman of the [[Georgian Parliament]] [[Irakli Kobakhidze]] announced that the party will nominate no candidate for 2018 presidential elections. Instead it is supporting the independent candidate [[Salome Zurabishvili]].

==Ideology==
Like many [[party of power|parties of power]] the Georgian Dream lacks a clear ideology. The reasons given for this range from the party’s history as an all-encompassing front of people opposed to the UNM government to the standard opportunism associated with such parties. For example, the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] described it as "a party of nomenclature, public servants, ‘intelligentsia’, medium and large businessmen, and technocrats – a party, which is held together through loyalty to its charismatic leader and the opposition to the government of the ‘Rose Revolution.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lortkipanidze|first1=Levan|title=Parliamentary Elections in Georgia|url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2016/10/13/parliamentary-elections-georgia|website=ge.boell.org|publisher=Heinrich Böll Foundation|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been reported that left-wing activists view the party as “ideologically amorphous” in contrast to the party's own self-identification with the left itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pertaia |first=Luka |url=http://oc-media.org/are-georgias-disparate-left-wing-protesters-consolidating-into-a-coherent-political-force/ |title=Are Georgia’s disparate left-wing protesters consolidating into a coherent political force? |location=Georgia (Georgian Republic) |website=oc-media.org |date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under their majority the constitution was amended to define marriage solely as "a union between a woman and a man for the purpose of creating a family.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://jamestown.org/program/georgias-ruling-party-supermajority-passes-unilateral-constitutional-reform/ Georgia's Ruling Party 'Supermajority' Passes Unilateral Constitutional Reform]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the same time the party passed legislation banning discrimination against LGBT individuals, making Georgia the most LGBT-friendly country in the South Caucasus on paper.&lt;ref&gt;https://ge.boell.org/sites/default/files/emc_legal_situation_of_lgbti_persons_in_georgia_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Georgian Institute of Politics, Georgian Dream's economic policy comprises a combination of the pre-existing free market model, created by their predecessors, with a comprehensive "centre-left" safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The First 100 Days of the Georgian Dream Government: A Reality Check |url=http://gip.ge/the-first-100-days-of-the-georgian-dream-government-a-reality-check/ |accessdate=7 June 2018 |agency=Georgian Institute of Politics |date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Georgian Dream coalition==
Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia party is the leading member of the Georgian Dream Coalition, which initially included six political parties of diverse ideological orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Georgia’s election: Pain and grief in Georgia |newspaper=The Economist |date=29 September 2012 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21563789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=de Waal |title=A Crucial Election in Georgia |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |date=11 September 2012 |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/09/11/crucial-election-in-georgia/drlp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition was made up of pro-market and pro-western liberals, radical nationalists with [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] rhetoric, and former representatives of the [[Eduard Shevardnadze|Shevardnadze]] administration who were disempowered during the [[Rose Revolution]] of 2003.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=de Waal |title=Georgia Holds Its Breath |newspaper=Foreign Policy |date=26 September 2012 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/26/georgia_holds_its_breath?page=0,0 |access-date=7 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110152600/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/26/georgia_holds_its_breath?page=0,0# |archive-date=10 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the alliance is inspired by a rap song by Ivanishvili's son [[Bera (rapper)|Bera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/sns-rt-us-georgia-election-factboxbre88t0iw-20120930,0,2550976.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=baltimoresun.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/georgia-brink-odd-parliamentary-election-leads-angst-over-results-798509?page=3 |title=Georgia On Brink: Odd Parliamentary Election Leads To Angst Over Results |publisher=Ibtimes.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people came with their families to enjoy a country resort; groups and agencies held conferences; others attended the numerous residential [[self-awareness]] seminars. Still others returned for training in counseling; currently, 95 people have graduated from the Diploma program offered by ''The Haven Institute''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation

==Teaching principles==

The methods in the courses are derived from a great variety of sources in the fields of [[humanistic psychology]] and [[transpersonal psychology]], as well as the more traditional fields of [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[drama]], [[music]] and [[art]]. The techniques used cover a broad spectrum, including [[Gestalt therapy|gestalt]], [[Body psychotherapy|Reichian]] body approaches, [[acupuncture]], [[psychodrama]], [[psychosynthesis]], role playing, [[family therapy]], fantasy and visualization techniques, video work, [[theatre games]], [[play therapy]] and [[music therapy]], all stressing [[Encounter group|encounter]] and [[communication]] skills.  The approaches are [[educational]] only, so no [[therapeutic]] care is available.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation

'''''Health and Human Rights''''' is a biannual [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[public health journal]] that was established in 1994. It covers research on the conceptual foundations of [[human rights]] and [[social justice]] in relation to health. The founding [[editor-in-chief]] was [[Jonathan Mann (WHO official)|Jonathan Mann]], who was succeeded by [[Sofia Gruskin]] in 1997. Since 2007, the journal is edited by [[Paul Farmer]]. [[Harvard University Press]] became the publisher of the journal in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardfxbcenter.org/harvard-university-press-publishes-hhr-journal/ |title=FXB Center for Health and Human Rights, Harvard University Press Partner on Health and Human Rights: An International Journal |publisher=Harvardfxbcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at [[Harvard School of Public Health]].

The journal transitioned to an online [[Open access (publishing)|open-access publication]] in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardfxbcenter.org/resources-hhr-journal.php |title=FXB Center for Health and Human Rights &amp;#124; Harvard School of Public Health &amp;#124; Harvard University |publisher=Harvardfxbcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes two sections: "Critical Concepts" and "Health and Human Rights in Practice". The first focuses on the conceptual foundations and challenges of rights discourse and action in relation to health. The second encourages and promotes new voices from the field — highlighting the innovative work of groups and individuals in direct engagement with human rights struggles as they relate to health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5351">This article provides a listing of applications that include [[Homeless Management Information Systems|Homeless Management Information System]] (HMIS) functionality. Although the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) requires that Continuums of Care (CoCs) receiving HUD funds for homeless services implement an HMIS for data collection and reporting purposes, they do not require the use of any one application. Rather, they require that the data be collected in a manner consistent with the HMIS Data Standards and that they generate key reports such as the HUD Annual Performance Report (APR) and the [[Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress|Annual Homeless Assessment Report]] (AHAR). The APR is a program-level report that includes information about data quality, demographic data related to clients served, and performance indicators of a program's success in working with clients. The AHAR is a broader report which is submitted at the CoC level and aggregated at a national level. Any application that collects data consistent with HUD's published data standards and generates the required reports may be considered an HMIS.

Although HUD has released data standards and programming specifications for some reports, HUD does not endorse or explicitly approve any HMIS application. HUD provides certification for related CMS products for Housing Counseling Agencies, information can be found below.&lt;ref&gt;HUD CERTIFIED CMS PRODUCTS FOR HUD HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Schadewald]] emphasized the influence [[Kurt Wise]] has had on shaping a more candid and rigorous approach to creationism, particularly praising a talk entitled "How Geologists Date Things" as absolutely straight Geology 101 mixing introductory geology with a debunking of creationist misconceptions. Wise has labored tirelessly by example and persuasion to convince his creationist colleagues to study the facts carefully and find new ways to interpret them. Besides technical and educational tracks, ICC86 featured a "basic creationism" track that included Walter Brown's Hydroplate Model (some creationists privately referred to it as the "wacky track").&lt;ref name=rncse&gt;{{cite journal | title = The 1998 International Conference on Creationism | journal=  Reports of the [[National Center for Science Education]] |date=May–June 1998 | first = Robert | last = Schadewald | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 22–25, 33 | url = http://ncse.com/rncse/18/3/1998-international-conference-creationism | accessdate = 2010-12-01|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}  The second ICC, held in 1990, was marginally better, but evolution-bashing and "wacky track" nonsense still were abundant.&lt;ref name=rncse /&gt; The 1990 conference featured a debate between Gregg Wilkerson, a old-earth creationist geologist and Steven A. Austin, chairman of geology at the [[Institute for Creation Research]]. Wilkerson urged the conference attendees to drop the young Earth viewpoint and accept the "ample scientific evidence" that the Earth is [[Age of the Earth|4.5 billion years old]].  Austin stated that Wilkerson was misinterpreting the data and that a young Earth viewpoint remained feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ken | last = Guggenheim | title = Geologists Debate The Age Of Earth Before Creationists | date = 1990-09-01| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n3YcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3mMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5883,64309&amp;dq=international-conference-on-creationism&amp;hl=en | publisher = Pittsburgh Press | accessdate = 2010-12-01|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} Following ICC90, the Pittsburgh Creation Science Fellowship (CSF) established a refereeing system. Wise and philosophers Paul Nelson and John Mark Reynolds convinced CSF that evolution-bashing never has advanced and never will advance a real "creation model." As a result, ICC94 was dramatically better.&lt;ref name=rncse /&gt;

At ICC98, the transformation was virtually complete. Most presentations tried either to advance a model in some way or at least to honestly review the evidence that needs explaining. This requirement was stated in the call for papers and enforced in the refereeing process, Anyone whose only exposure to creationism is a Gish Gallop would not have recognized a single presentation at ICC98.&lt;ref name=rncse /&gt; Larry Witham described it as having "become the preeminent meeting of its kind in the world." It's goal is to provide a peer-review forum wherein the Creation model could be rigorously developed. He states that the conferences express similar disdain for both "slipshod" populist young earth creationism, and for smuggling in "antiquity and evolution". He describes as "astounding" their presupposition that God "''used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe''." They state they cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the Creator.&lt;ref name=witham&gt;{{cite book |last=Witham |first=Larry A. |title=Where Darwin meets the Bible: creationists and evolutionists in America |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llzwy_Ft1DQC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=icc+Creationism#v=onepage&amp;q=icc%20Creationism&amp;f=false |page=52 | isbn=978-0-19-518281-1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics professor [[Jason Rosenhouse]] writes expressing sadness that while generally impressed with attendees "personality and temperament", that they are "hopelessly ignorant of science. This ignorance is exacerbated by the annoying fact that so many of them fancy themselves highly knowledgeable indeed."&lt;ref name=discover2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/realitybase/2008/08/18/annual-creationism-conference-takes-scientific-approach/  |title=Annual Creationism Conference Takes "Scientific" Approach|format= Blogs / Reality Base|work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|ref=harv|date=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathleen Marie Kelly''' (born October 29, 1980), known as '''Kate Kelly''', is an American [[Mormon feminism|Mormon feminist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/4042513-155/two-years-after-kate-kellys-excommunication|title=Two years after an excommunicated Kate Kelly sought a giant leap, Mormon feminists keep making small steps toward equity|last=Tribune|first=Peggy Fletcher Stack  The Salt Lake|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights attorney who founded [[Ordain Women]], an organization advocating for the [[ordination of women]] to the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Kelly was [[Excommunication#The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|excommunicated]] from the LDS Church in 2014.

==Early life and education==
Kelly was born in 1980 in Arizona to Jim and Donna Kelly as the first of four children. She grew up in [[Hood River, Oregon]], with both her parents working outside the home. Both parents were converts to the LDS Church, and her father at one time served as [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of a local congregation.&lt;ref name=Marostica2014&gt;{{cite news |last= Marostica |first= Laura |title= Feminism in Faith: Kate Kelly's Mission to Ordain Mormon Women |url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/lauradomenica/feminism-in-faith-mormonism |newspaper= BuzzFeed BuzzReads |date= March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leadership style''' is a [[leader]]'s method of providing direction, implementing plans, and [[motivation|motivating]] people.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Various authors have proposed identifying many different [[leadership]] styles as exhibited by leaders in the [[politics | political]], [[commerce | business]] or other fields. Studies on leadership style are conducted{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} in the [[military]] field, expressing an approach that stresses a [[holistic]] view of [[leadership]], including how a leader's physical presence determines how others perceive that leader. The factors of physical presence in this context include military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and to acquire knowledge to do the job.{{cn|date=April 2017}} A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.&lt;ref name="Army 10-2006"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army |title=Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile |page=18 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |url=http://cdm16635.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16635coll8/id/55579 |date=12 October 2006}} Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil), FM 6–22.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=April 2017}} Daniel Goleman (2000) in his article "Leadership that Gets Results" talks about six styles of leadership.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;
{{cite web |title=Leadership that Gets Results |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |url=https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results |access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian==
The [[authoritative]] leadership style keeps main emphasis on the distinction of the authoritarian leader and their followers. These types of leaders make sure to only create a distinct [[professional]] relationship. Direct [[supervision]] is what they believe to be key in maintaining a successful environment and follower ship. Authoritarian leadership styles often follow the vision of those that are in control, and may not necessarily be compatible with those that are being led. Authoritarian leaders have a focus on efficiency, as other styles, such as a democratic style, may be seen as a hindrance on progress. Examples of authoritarian leadership: a police officer directing traffic, a teacher ordering a student to do his or her assignment, and a supervisor instructing a subordinate to clean a workstation. All of these positions require a distinct set of characteristics that give the leader the position to get things in order or get a point across. Authoritarian Traits: sets goals individually, engages primarily in one-way and downward communication, controls discussion with followers, and dominate interaction.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Several studies have confirmed a relationship between [[bullying]], on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Organizational conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a [[climate of fear]], where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="SalinHelge2010"&gt;{{citation |author1=Salin, D. |author2=Helge, H. |chapter=Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying |title=Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice |publisher= |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paternalistic==
The way a paternalistic leader works is by acting as a parental figure by taking care of their subordinates as a parent would. In this style of leadership the leader supplies complete concern for his followers or workers. In return he receives the complete trust and loyalty of his people. Workers under this style of leader are expected to become totally committed to what the leader believes and will not strive off and work independently. The relationship between these co-workers and leader are extremely solid. The workers are expected to stay with a company for a longer period of time because of the loyalty and trust. Not only do they treat each other like family inside the work force, but outside too. These workers are able to go to each other with any problems they have regarding something because they believe in what they say is going to truly help them.&lt;ref name="ErbenGuneser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erben and Guneser|first=Gul and Ayse|title=The Relationship Between Paternalistic Leadership and Organizational Commitement:Investigating the Role of Climate Regarding ethics|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=November 2008|volume=82|issue=4|pages=955–968|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-007-9605-z?LI=true|accessdate=2012-12-01|doi=10.1007/s10551-007-9605-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the downsides to a paternalistic leader is that the leader could start to play favorites in decisions. This leader would include the workers more apt to follow and start to exclude the ones who were less loyal. In today's market paternalism is more difficult to come by according to Padavic and Earnest who wrote "business dimensional and Organizational Counseling." They believe this because there have become more lay-offs and stronger unionization. This affects paternalistic leaders because the co-workers may not believe that their jobs are 100% ensured.  When this happens, workers begin to look for bigger and better job opportunities instead of staying at one company for a longer period of time. Because of this, the leader may be thinking that you could be leaving and not fully believe you when you tell them something about a job opportunity. This could put the workers and leader at risk for a bad situation.&lt;ref name="ErbenGuneser"/&gt;

According to B. M. Bass, who wrote ''Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations'', workers who follow paternalistic leadership also have better organization skills. The leader encourages organization because they allow the workers to complete tasks so that they can stay on top of their work. The workers complete tasks this boosts self-confidence and it makes them work harder to reach a goal and exceed the goal to prove to their boss they are working hard. Having this style of leadership can also help implement a reward system. This system will allow their workers to work even better because there is something for them at the end of the tunnel. While doing this they will also be able to accomplish more work in a set time frame.&lt;ref name="ErbenGuneser" /&gt;

==Democratic==
The [[democracy|democratic]] leadership style consists of the leader sharing the [[decision-making]] abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing [[social equality]].&lt;ref name="Foster2002"&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=D. E. |year=2002 |title=A Method of Comparing Follower Satisfaction with the Authoritarian, Democratic, and Laissez-faire Styles of Leadership |journal=Communication Teacher |volume=16 |number=2 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The boundaries of democratic participation tend to be circumscribed by the organization or the group needs and the instrumental value of people's attributes (skills, attitudes, etc.). The democratic style encompasses the notion that everyone, by virtue of their human status, should play a part in the group's decisions. However, the democratic style of leadership still requires guidance and control by a specific leader. The democratic style demands the leader to make decisions on who should be called upon within the group and who is given the right to participate in, make and vote on decisions.&lt;ref name="Woods2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woods |first=A. P. |year=2010 |title=Democratic leadership: drawing distinctions with distributed leadership |journal=International Journal of Leadership in Education |volume=7 |number=1 |pages=3–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that this leadership style is one of the most effective and creates higher productivity, better contributions from group members and increased group morale. Democratic leadership can lead to better ideas and more creative solutions to problems because group members are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas. While democratic leadership is one of the most effective leadership styles, it does have some potential downsides. In situations where roles are unclear or time is of the essence, democratic leadership can lead to communication failures and uncompleted projects. Democratic leadership works best in situations where group members are skilled and eager to share their knowledge. It is also important to have plenty of time to allow people to contribute, develop a plan and then vote on the best course of action.&lt;ref name=Martindale&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martindale |first=N |year=2011 |title=Leadership Styles: How to handle the different personas |journal=Strategic Communication Management |volume=15 |number=8 |pages=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laissez-faire==
The [[laissez-faire]] leadership style is where all the rights and power to make decisions is fully given to the worker. This was first described by Lewin, Lippitt, and White in 1939, along with the autocratic leadership and the democratic leadership styles.&lt;ref name="Wren2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Wren|title=Social Influences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGhwpXpTG8cC&amp;pg=PA75|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-66357-6|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laissez-faire leaders allow followers to have complete freedom to make decisions concerning the completion of their work.  It allows followers a [[self-rule]], while at the same time offering guidance and support when requested. The laissez-faire leader using guided freedom provides the followers with all materials necessary to accomplish their goals, but does not directly participate in decision making unless the followers request their assistance.&lt;ref name=essortment&gt;{{cite web |title=Styles Of Leadership |publisher=Essortment |access-date=March 16, 2012 |url=http://www.essortment.com/styles-leadership-36149.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}

This is an effective style to use when:
* Followers are highly skilled, experienced, and educated.
* Followers have pride in their work and the drive to do it successfully on their own.
* Outside experts, such as staff specialists or consultants are being used.
* Followers are trustworthy and experienced.

This style should ''not'' be used when:
* The leader cannot or will not provide regular feedback to their followers.&lt;ref name=essortment/&gt;

== Transactional ==
{{Main article|Transactional leadership}}

&lt;!-- Commented out:
Transactional leaders focus their leadership on motivating followers through a system of rewards and punishments. There are two factors which form the basis for this system, [[Contingent]] Reward and management-by-exception.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* Contingent reward provides rewards, materialistic or psychological, for effort and recognizes good performance.
* Management-by-exception allows the leader to maintain the status quo. The leader intervenes when subordinates do not meet acceptable performance levels and initiates corrective action to improve performance. Management by exception helps reduce the workload of managers being that they are only called-in when workers deviate from course.

This type of leader identifies the needs of their followers and gives rewards to satisfy those needs in exchange for a certain level of performance. Transactional leaders focus on increasing the efficiency of established routines and procedures. They are more concerned with following existing rules than with making changes to the organization. A transactional leader establishes and standardizes practices that will help the organization reach:{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
*Maturity
*[[Goal-setting]] 
*Efficiency of operation
*Increasing productivity.
--&gt;

===Effect on work teams===
Survey done by Jun Liu, Xiaoyu Liu and Xianju Zeng&lt;ref name="Lio_al2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=J. |last2=Liu |first2=X. |last3=Zeng |first3=X. |year=2011 |title=Does transactional leadership count for team innovativeness? |journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=282–298 |url= |doi=10.1108/09534811111132695}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the correlation between transactional leadership and how innovations can be affected by team emotions. The research was composed of 90 work teams, with a total of 460 members and 90 team leaders. The study found that there is a relationship between emotions, labor behavior and transactional leadership that affects the team. Depending on the level of emotions of the team; this can affect the transactional leader in a positive or negative way. Transactional leaders work better in teams where there is a lower level of emotions going into the project. This is because individuals are able to:
*Think freely when setting their emotions aside from their work.
*Have all of their focus on the given task.

A transactional leader is:
#Negatively affected when the emotional level is high.
#Positively affected when the emotional level is low.

Transactional leadership presents a form of strategic leadership that is important for the organization's development.
Transactional leadership is essential for team innovativeness.

==Transformational==
A [[transformational leadership|transformational leader]] is a type of person in which the leader is not limited by his or her followers' perception.&lt;ref name="Schultz&amp;Schultz1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schultz |first1=Duane P. |last2=Schultz |first2=Sydney Ellen |year=1998 |chapter=Chapter 7: Leadership |title=Psychology and Work Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HSACgAAQBAJ |edition=10 |location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire |publisher=Routledge |publication-date=2015 |page= |isbn=978-1-3173-5080-4 |access-date=2016-05-22 |quote=Transformational leadership[:] A leadership style in which leaders are not constrained by their followers' perceptions but are free to act to change or transform their followers' views.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz&amp;Schultz2010NJ"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Duane P.

Leaders that follow the transformation style of leading, challenge and inspire their followers with a sense of purpose and excitement.&lt;ref name="Schultz&amp;Schultz2010NY"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schultz |first1=Duane P. |last2=Schultz |first2=Sydney Ellen |title=Psychology and work today |year=2010 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=New York |isbn=0-205-68358-4 |pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformational leaders also create a vision of what they aspire to be, and communicate this idea to others (their followers).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Schultz and Schultz identify three characteristics of a transformational leader:&lt;ref name="Schultz&amp;Schultz1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz&amp;Schultz2010NJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz&amp;Schultz2010NY"/&gt;
* Charismatic leadership has a broad field of knowledge, has a self-promoting personality, high/great energy level, and willing to take risk and use irregular strategies in order to stimulate their followers to think independently 
* Individualized consideration 
* Intellectual stimulation

'''Left-wing nationalism''', '''leftist nationalism''', '''socialist nationalism''', or '''social nationalism''' (abbreviation for socialist/social democratic nationalism) describes a form of [[nationalism]] based upon [[social equality]] (not necessary [[political equality]]), [[popular sovereignty]] and national [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name="Sa'adah, Anne 2003. Pp. 17-20"&gt;Sa'adah 2003, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing nationalism typically espouses [[anti-imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Angel 1999. Pp. 30"&gt;Smith 1999, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delanty, Gerard; Kumar, Krishan. ''The SAGE handbook of nations and nationalism''. London, England, UK; Thousand Oaks, California, USA; New Delhi, India: Sage Publications, Ltd, 2006. Pp. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in contrast to [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalism, and often rejects [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalism]] to this same end, although some forms of left-wing nationalism have included a platform of racialism, favoring a homogeneous society, a rejection of minorities, and opposition to immigration.&lt;ref name="Smith, Angel 1999. Pp. 30"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Arthur Calwell, Leader of the Labor Party, Defender of White Australia."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“[https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition Fact Sheet – Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy], homeaffairs.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“'How Sweden Became Multicultural'.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable left-wing nationalist movements in history have included [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]'s [[Indian National Army]], which promoted independence of India from Britain; the [[Mukti Bahini]]; [[Sinn Féin]], an [[Irish republican]] party; the [[National Bolshevik Party]] and its successor [[The Other Russia (party)|The Other Russia]], the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], the [[Black Front]] of Germany, [[Malay Nationalist Party]] of Malaysia, and the [[African National Congress]] of [[South Africa]] under [[Nelson Mandela]].

==Marxism and nationalism==
[[Marxism]] identifies the nation as a socioeconomic construction created after the collapse of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], which was utilized to create the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economic system.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 14"&gt;Nimni 1991, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical Marxism|Classical Marxists]] have unanimously claimed that nationalism is a "bourgeois phenomenon" that is not associated with Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;Nimni 1991, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism, in certain instances, has supported nationalist movements if they were in the interest of class struggle, but rejects other nationalist movements deemed to distract workers from their necessary goal of defeating the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Nimni 1991, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists have evaluated certain nations to be "[[Progressivism|progressive]]" and other nations to be "[[reactionary]]".&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 14"/&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]], for instance, supported interpretations of Marx tolerating the use of proletarian nationalism that promoted class struggle within an internationalist framework.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 49"&gt;van Ree 2002, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] interpreted issues concerning nationality on a [[social evolution]]ary basis. Marx and Engels claim that the creation of the modern nation state is the result of the replacement of feudalism with the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 18"&gt;Nimni 1991, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; With the replacement of feudalism with capitalism, capitalists sought to unify and centralize populations' culture and language within states in order to create conditions conducive to a [[market economy]] in terms of having a common language to coordinate the economy; to contain a large enough population in the state to insure an internal division of labour; and to contain a large enough territory for a state to maintain a viable economy.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 18"/&gt; 

Though Marx and Engels saw the origins of the nation state and national identity as bourgeois in nature, both believed that the creation of the centralized state as a result of the collapse of feudalism and creation of capitalism had created positive social conditions to stimulate class struggle.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 21"&gt;Nimni 1991, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx followed [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] view that the creation of individual-centred [[civil society]] by states as a positive development, in that it dismantled previous religious-based society and freed individual conscience.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 21"/&gt; In ''[[The German Ideology]]'', Marx claims that although civil society is a capitalist creation and represents bourgeois class rule, it is beneficial to the proletariat because it is unstable in that neither states nor the bourgeoisie can control a civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Nimni 1991, 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx described this in detail in ''The German Ideology'', saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Civil society embraces the whole material intercourse of individuals within a definite stage of development of productive forces. It embraces the whole commercial and industrial life of a given stage, and, insofar, transcends the state and the nation, though on the other hand, it must assert itself in its foreign relations as nationality and inwardly must organize itself as a state.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 21"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marx and Engels evaluated progressive nationalism as involving the destruction of feudalism, and believed that it was a beneficial step, but evaluated nationalism detrimental to the evolution of international class struggle as reactionary and necessary to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 22"&gt;Nimni 1991, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels believed that certain nations that could not consolidate viable nation-states should be assimilated into other nations that were more viable and further in Marxian evolutionary economic progress.&lt;ref name="Nimni, Ephraim 1991. Pp. 22"/&gt;

On the issue of nations and the proletariat, the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word. National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The Communist Manifesto|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm|accessdate=11 September 2013|year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general, Marx preferred internationalism and interaction between nations in class struggle, saying in ''Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' that "[o]ne nation can and should learn from others".&lt;ref&gt;Nimni 1991, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, though Marx and Engels criticized Irish unrest for delaying a worker's revolution in [[England]], both Marx and Engels believed that [[Ireland]] was oppressed by [[Great Britain]] but believed that the Irish people would better serve their own interests by joining proponents of class struggle in Europe, as Marx and Engels claimed that the socialist workers of Europe were the natural allies of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Schmitt, Richard 1987, Pp. 169"&gt;Schmitt 1997 [1987], 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Marx and Engels believed that it was in Britain's best interest to let Ireland go, as the Ireland issue was being used by elites to unite the British working class with the elites against the Irish.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, Richard 1987, Pp. 169"/&gt;

===Stalinism and "revolutionary patriotism"===
[[Joseph Stalin]] promoted a civic patriotic concept called "revolutionary patriotism" in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 49"/&gt; As a youth, Stalin had been active in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nationalist movement and was influenced by Georgian nationalist [[Ilia Chavchavadze]] who promoted cultural nationalism, material development of the Georgian people, [[Statism|statist]] economy and education systems.&lt;ref&gt;van Ree 2002, 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; When Stalin joined Georgian Marxists, the Marxism in Georgia was heavily influenced by [[Noe Zhordania]], who evoked Georgian patriotic themes and opposition to Russian imperial control of Georgia.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 60"&gt;van Ree 2002, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhordania claimed that communal bonds existed between peoples that created the plural sense of "I" of countries, and went further to say that the Georgian sense of identity pre-existed capitalism and the capitalist conception of nationhood.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 60"/&gt;

After Stalin became a [[Bolshevik]] in the 20th century, he became fervently opposed to national culture, denouncing the concept of contemporary nationality as bourgeois in origin and accused nationality of causing retention of "harmful habits and institutions".&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 64"&gt;van Ree 2002, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stalin did believe that cultural communities did exist where people lived common lives, and were united by holistic bonds, these, Stalin claimed were "real nations", while others that did not fit these traits were "paper nations".&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 67"&gt;van Ree 2002, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin defined the nation as being "neither racial nor tribal, but a historically formed community of people".&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 67"/&gt; Stalin believed that the assimilation of "primitive" nationalities like [[Abkhazians]] and [[Tartars]] into the Georgian and Russian nations was beneficial.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 64"/&gt; Stalin claimed that all nations were assimilating foreign values and that the nationality as a community was diluting under the pressures of capitalism and with rising rational universality.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 65"&gt;van Ree 2002, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Stalin rejected the concept of national identity entirely and advocated in favour of a universal [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] modernity.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 65"/&gt; Stalin identified Russian culture as having greater universalist identity than that of other nations.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 66"&gt;van Ree 2002, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's view of vanguard and progressive nations such as Russia, Germany, and Hungary in contrast to nations he deemed primitive is claimed to be related to Friedrich Engels' views.&lt;ref name="Ree, Erik 2002. Pp. 66"/&gt;

===Titoism===
[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the rule of [[Josip Broz Tito]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], promoted both communism and Yugoslav nationalism ([[Yugoslavism]]).&lt;ref name="Perica, Vjekoslav 2002. Pp. 98"&gt;Perica 2002, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Tito's Yugoslavia was overtly nationalistic in its attempts to promote unity between the Yugoslav nations within Yugoslavia and asserting Yugoslavia's independence.&lt;ref name="Perica, Vjekoslav 2002. Pp. 98"/&gt; To unify the Yugoslav nations, the government promoted the concept of "[[Brotherhood and Unity]]", where the Yugoslav nations would overcome their cultural and linguistic differences through promoting fraternal relations between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Perica 2002, 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; This Yugoslav nationalism was opposed to [[cultural assimilation]], as had been carried out by the previous Yugoslav monarchy, but was instead based upon [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Perica 2002, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; While promoting a Yugoslav nationalism, the Yugoslav government was staunchly opposed to any factional [[ethnic nationalism]] or domination by the existing nationalities, as Tito denounced ethnic nationalism in general as being based on hatred and was the cause of war.&lt;ref name="Perica, Vjekoslav 2002. Pp. 98, 100"&gt;Perica 2002, 98 &amp; 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Communists of Yugoslavia blamed the factional division and conflict between the Yugoslav nations on foreign [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Perica, Vjekoslav 2002. Pp. 98, 100"/&gt; Tito built strong relations with states that had strong socialist and nationalist governments in power, such as [[Egypt]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].&lt;ref name="Perica, Vjekoslav 2002. Pp. 98"/&gt;

In spite of these attempts to create a left-wing Yugoslav national identity, factional divisions between Yugoslav nationalities remained strong and it was largely the power of the League of Communists and popularity of Tito that held the country together.&lt;ref&gt;Perica 2002, 98 &amp; 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Left-wing nationalists have historically led the [[separatism]] and [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] movements in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] ([[Basque nationalism]]), [[Catalan countries|Catalonia]] ([[Catalan independence]]), [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] ([[Galician nationalism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Justo Beramendi|last1=González|first2=X.

===Poland===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
In late 19th century Polish labour movement split into two factions. Minor one that proposed [[communist revolution]] and Polish [[autonomy]] within [[Russian Empire]] established [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]], renamed later as [[Communist Party of Poland]]. Most activists, however, have seen Polish independence as a requirement to realise socialist political program &amp;ndash; as after [[partitions of Poland]] Russia, [[Prussia]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] repressed their ethnically Polish citizens of all social classes. Those activists established [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS). During [[World War I]] PPS' leader [[Józef Piłsudski]] became a leader of German dominated (according to [[Mitteleuropa]] plan) puppet [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–18)|Poland]]. Then he broke an alliance with [[Central Powers]] and claimed an independent [[Second Polish Republic]]. As a [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]] Piłsudski signed in very first weeks [[decree]]s about the eight hour work day, equal rights for women, free and compulsory education, free healthcare and social insurance thus making Poland one of the most progressive countries of [[interwar]] period.

In Poland itself, however, the Polish Socialist Party is considered 'pro-independence, patriotic left-wing' (in contrast with the internationalist left-wing) rather than left-wing nationalist. The term nationalism is used nearly exclusively for the right-wing [[national democracy]] of [[Roman Dmowski]], and other officially far-right movements such as [[National Radical Camp (1993)|National Radical Camp]] and [[National Revival of Poland]]. Nowadays, notable parties and organizations that come the closest to the idea of a 'left-wing nationalism' are [[Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland]], under the leadership of [[Andrzej Lepper]], and [[Zmiana]] led by [[Mateusz Piskorski]]. Both advocate patriotism (at times even nationalism), [[social conservatism]], euroscepticism, anti-imperialism (strong criticism of a NATO and US foreign policies), and [[economic nationalism]]. The Self-Defence won 53 seats out of 460 in 2001 elections, and 56 in 2005. From 2005 to 2007 it was in the coalition government with two other parties (one right-wing, the other nationalist). Since then it has no representatives in the Polish [[Sejm]].

===Scotland===
The [[Scottish independence]] movement is mainly left-wing and is spearheaded by the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), who have been on the [[left of centre]] since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Mitchell, Lynn Bennie and Rob Johns|title=The Scottish National Party: Transition To Power|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are other political parties from the political left in favour of Scottish independence, namely the [[Scottish Greens]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and Solidarity Scotland's Socialist Movement.

===Wales===
Similarly to Scotland, in Wales there is a left-wing movement led by [[Plaid Cymru]] for [[Welsh independence]], previously in favour of a revolutionary form of independence, Plaid now considers itself to be "evolutionary" in its approach to independence, through continued devolution and ultimate sovereignty. This is also the view of the [[Welsh Green Party]]

===Ireland===
Irish nationalism has been left wing nationalism since its mainstream inception.  Parties such as Sinn Féin and the SDLP are left-wing nationalist parties, but there is a strand of nationalism in Ireland that is towards the centre-right, for example Fianna Fáil are a centre-right republican party, but has only ever contested elections in the Republic of Ireland. Right wing nationalist outlooks, and far right political parties in general, were few and far between in Ireland until relatively recently, with the foundation of the unregistered 
[[National Party (Ireland, 2016)]] and other less relevant groups and parties.

===France===
In Europe, a number of left-wing nationalist movements exist, and have a long and well-established tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel 1984 [1981].&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalism itself was placed on the left during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The original left-wing nationalists endorsed [[civic nationalism]]&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defined the nation as a "daily plebiscite" and as formed by the subjective "will to live together." Related to "[[revanchism]]", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism could then be sometimes opposed to imperialism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Australia==
During the 1890s, Australian-born novelists and poets such as [[Henry Lawson]], [[Joseph Furphy]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] drew on the [[archetype]] of the "Australian bushman"; these and other writers formulated the "bush legend", which included broadly left wing notions that [[working class]] [[Outback]] Australians were "democratic", [[egalitarian]], [[anti-authoritarian]] and cultivated "[[mateship]]". However, terms like "nationalist" and "patriotic" were also utilised by pro-[[British Empire]] political conservatives, culminating with the formation in 1917 of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]], which remained the main centre-right party until the late 1920s.

During the 1940s and 1950s, radical intellectuals, many of whom joined the [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA), combined philosophical internationalism with a radical nationalist commitment to [[Australian culture]].  This type of cultural nationalism was possible among radicals in Australia at the time, because:
*of the "patriotic turn" in [[Comintern]] policy from 1941, and;
*the most common understanding of what it meant to be "patriotic" at the time was a kind of pro-Imperial "race patriotism" and anti-British sentiment was, until the late 1960s, regarded as subversive and;
*radical nationalism dovetailed with a growing respect for Australian cultural output among intellectuals, which was itself a product of the break in cultural supply chains &amp;ndash;   lead actors and scripts had always come from Britain and the United States &amp;ndash;   occasioned by the war.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Alomes, ''A Nation at Last?'' (Sydney, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war radical nationalists consequently sought to [[Canonization|canonise]] the "bush" culture which had emerged during the 1890s. The post-war radical nationalists interpreted this tradition as having implicitly or inherently radical qualities: they believed it meant that working class Australians were "naturally democratic" and/or socialist. This view combined the CPA's commitment to the working class with the post-war intellectuals' own nationalist sentiments. The apotheosis of this line of thought was perhaps [[Russel Ward]]'s book ''[[The Australian Legend]]'' (1958), which sought to trace the development of the radical nationalist ethos from its [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] origins, through bushranging, the Victorian gold rush, the spread of agriculture, the industrial strife of the early 1890s and its literary canonisation.  Other significant radical nationalists included the historians [[Ian Turner (Australian historian)|Ian Turner]], [[Lloyd Churchward]], [[Robin Gollan|Robin (Bob) Gollan]], [[Geoffrey Serle]] and [[Brian Fitzpatrick (Australian author)|Brian Fitzpatrick]], whom Ward described as the "spiritual father of all the radical nationalist historians in Australia",&lt;ref&gt;Russel Ward, ''A Radical Life'' (South Melbourne, 1988), p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; and the writers [[Stephen Murray-Smith]], [[Judah Waten]], [[Dorothy Hewett]] and [[Frank Hardy]].

The [[Barton Government]] which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the [[Protectionist Party]] with the support of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the [[Australian Workers Union]] and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

At the start of the world war 2, Labor Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] ([[Australian Labor Party|ALP]]) reinforced the message of the White Australia policy by saying: "This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race."&lt;ref name="abolition"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader of the Labor Party from 1960-1967 [[Arthur Calwell]] supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.&lt;ref&gt;Calwell, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The radical-nationalist tradition was challenged during the 1960s, during which [[New Left]] scholars interpreted much of Australian history &amp;ndash;   including [[Labor history (discipline)|labour history]] &amp;ndash;   as dominated by racism, sexism, homophobia and militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey McQueen, ''A New Britannia'' (Melbourne, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, it has been uncommon for those on the political left to claim Australian nationalism for themselves. The "bush legend", however, has survived the above changes in Australian culture: it informed much cultural output during the period of the "new nationalism" in the 1970s and 1980s, the language of Australian nationalism was adopted by [[Liberal Party of Australia|centre-right]] politicians such as Prime Minister [[John Howard]] for the political right during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Brett, ''Australian Liberals and the Moral Middle Class'' (Cambridge, 2003), pp.203-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, attempts by left-leaning intellectuals to re-claim nationalism for the Left are few and far between.&lt;ref&gt;See: David McKnight, ''Beyond Right and Left: New Politics and the Culture Wars'' (2005); Tim Soutphommasane, ''Reclaiming Patriotism'' (2009); Russell Marks, 'Labor No Longer Party of Progressive Nationalism', ''National Times'', 19 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
Bangladesh after 1971's liberation war wrote its binding beliefs to be for "Secularism, Nationalism and Socialism." For a long time [[Bengali nationalism]] was promoted in Bangladesh while excluding other minorities which led to President [[Ziaur Rahman]] of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] to change Bengali nationalism to [[Bangladeshi nationalism]] where all citizens of the country is equal under the law. This new nationalism in Bangladesh has been promoted by the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] and the [[Awami League]] calling for national unity and cultural promotion. However later the BNP ([[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]]) promoted islamic unity as well and has excluded hindus from the national unity while bringing together Bihari muslims and Chakma buddhists. This is different from Awami League's staunch secularist stance of the national identity uniting all religious minorities.

{{main article|Nationalisms in Canada}}
{{See also|Quebec nationalism|Canadian nationalism}}

In Canada, nationalism is associated with the left in the context of both [[Quebec nationalism]] and pan-[[Canadian nationalism]] (mostly in [[English Canada]] but also in Quebec).

In Quebec, the term was used by S. H. Milner and H. Milner to describe political developments in 1960s and 1970s [[Quebec]] which they saw as unique in North America.  While the liberals of the [[Quiet Revolution]] in Quebec had opposed Quebec nationalism which had been right-wing and reactionary, nationalists in Quebec now found that they could only maintain their cultural identity by ridding themselves of foreign elites, which was achieved by adopting radicalism and socialism. This ideology was seen in contrast to historic socialism, which was internationalist and considered the working class to have no homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Milner 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milner 1989, vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s in Canada saw the rise of a movement in favour of the independence of Quebec. Among the proponents of this constitutional option for Quebec were militants of an independent and socialist Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Milner 1973, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1960s, nationalism in Quebec had taken various forms. First, a radical [[liberal nationalism]] emerged and was a dominant voice in the political discourse of [[Lower Canada]] from the early 19th century to the 1830s. The 1830s saw the more vocal expression of a liberal and republican nationalism which was silenced with the rebellions of 1837 and 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Pask 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s, in a now annexed Lower Canada, a moderately liberal expression of nationalism succeeded the old one, which remained in existence but was confined to political marginality thereafter. In parallel to this, a new catholic and [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]] nationalism emerged. Antagonism between the two incompatible expressions of nationalism lasted until the 1950s.

According to political scientist Henry Milner, the manifestation of a third kind of nationalism became significant when intellectuals raised the issue of the economic colonization of Quebec, something the established nationalists elites had neglected to do.&lt;ref&gt;Milner 1973, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Milner identifies three distinct clusters of factors in the evolution of Quebec toward left-wing nationalism: the first cluster relates to the national consciousness of Quebecers (''Québécois''), the second to changes in technology, industrial organization, and patterns of communication and education, the third related to "the part played by the intellectuals in the face of changes in the first two factors".&lt;ref&gt;Milner 1973, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

In English Canada, support for government intervention in the economy to defend the country from foreign (i.e. American) influences is one of Canada's oldest political traditions, going back at least to the [[National Policy]] (tariff protection) of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]], and has historically been seen on both the left and the right.  However, calls for more extreme forms of government involvement to forestall a putative American takeover have been a staple of the Canadian left since the 1920s, and possibly earlier.  Right-wing nationalism has never supported such measures, which is one of the major differences between the two.  Leftist nationalism has also been more eager to dispense with historical Canadian symbols associated with Canada's British colonial heritage, such as the [[Canadian Red Ensign]] or even [[Monarchy of Canada|the monarchy]] (see [[Republicanism in Canada]]).  English Canadian leftist nationalism has historically been represented by most of [[:Category:Socialist parties in Canada|Canada's socialist parties]], factions with the social-democratic [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (such as the [[Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada]] in the 1960s and 1970s), and in a more diluted form in some elements of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] (such as [[Trudeauism]] to a certain extent).  Today it manifests itself pressure groups such as the [[Council of Canadians]].  This type of nationalism is associated with the slogan "it's either [[Sovereign state|the state]] or [[United States|the States]]", coined by the [[Canadian Radio League]] in the 1930s during their campaign for a national [[public broadcaster]] to compete with the private, American radio stations broadcasting into Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/salutin/states.htm|title=States Readings|author=|date=|website=individual.utoronto.ca|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a fear of annexation by the United States.  Right-wing nationalism continues to exist in Canada, but tends to be much less concerned with [[continentalism|integration into North America]], especially since the Conservative Party embraced free trade after 1988.  As well, many [[far-right]] movements in Canada are nationalist, but not ''Canadian'' nationalist, instead advocating for [[Western alienation|Western Separation]] or [[Annexationism in Canada|union with the United States]].

== Mauritius ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
The [[Mouvement Militant Mauricien]] (MMM) (English: Mauritian Militant Movement) is a left-wing socialist political party in Mauritius. The party was formed by a group of students in the late 1960s, advocating independence from the United Kingdom, socialism and social unity. The MMM advocates what it sees as a "fairer" society, without discrimination on the basis of social class, race, community, caste, religion, gender or sexual orientation.

The MMM was founded in 1968 as a students' movement (Mouvement Etudiants Mauricien) by [[Paul Bérenger]], Dev Virahsawmy, Jooneed Jeeroburkhan, Chafeekh Jeeroburkhan, Sushil Kushiram, Tirat Ramkissoon, Krishen Mati, Ah-Ken Wong, Kriti Goburdhun, Allen Sew Kwan Kan, Vela Vengaroo, and Amedee Darga amongst others. In 1969 it became the Mouvement Militant Mauricien.

The MMM is a member of the Socialist International, an international grouping of socialist, social-democratic, and labour parties, as well as the Progressive Alliance.

'''Liberal feminism''' is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]], which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Its emphasis is on making the legal and political rights of women equal to men. Liberal feminists argue that society holds the false belief that women are, by nature, less intellectually and physically capable than men; thus it tends to discriminate against women in the academy, the forum, and the marketplace. Liberal feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tong | first = Rosemarie | chapter = Liberal feminism | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cv5EAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 | title = Feminist thought: a comprehensive introduction | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780415078740 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Liberal feminism does not have a clearly defined set of philosophies, which makes their beliefs abstract. They value individualistic approaches to justice and societal structures instead of blaming inequalities on others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=Susan|date=June 1987|title=A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=65–93|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01066.x|issn=0887-5367}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Susan Wendell states, "liberal feminism's clearest political commitments, including equality of opportunity, are important to women's liberation and not necessarily incompatible with the goals of socialist and radical feminism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
The goal for liberal feminists in the late 1800s and early 1900s was to gain women's suffrage under the idea that they would then gain individual liberty. They were concerned with gaining freedom through equality, putting an end to men's cruelty to women, and gaining the freedom to opportunities to become full persons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | last = Marilley | first = Suzanne M. | chapter = The feminism of equal rights | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SQ7PP7qSkRsC&amp;pg=PA16 | title = Woman suffrage and the origins of liberal feminism in the United States, 1820-1920 | pages = 1–10 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780674954656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that no government or custom should prohibit the exercise of personal freedom. Early liberal feminists had to counter the assumption that only white men deserved to be full citizens. Feminists such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Judith Sargent Murray]], and [[Frances Wright]] advocated for women's full political inclusion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1920, after nearly 50 years of intense activism, women were finally granted the right to vote and the right to hold public office in the United States.

Liberal feminism was quiet for four decades after winning the vote. In the 1960s during the civil rights movement, liberal feminists drew parallels between systemic race discrimination and sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Groups such as the [[National Organization for Women]], the [[National Women's Political Caucus]], and the [[Women's Equity Action League]] were all created at that time to further women's rights. In the U.S., these groups have worked for the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] or "Constitutional Equity Amendment", in the hopes it will ensure that men and women are treated as equals under the democratic laws that also influence important spheres of women's lives, including reproduction, work and equal pay issues. Other issues important to liberal feminists include but are not limited to reproductive rights and abortion access, sexual harassment, voting, education, fair compensation for work, affordable childcare, affordable health care, and bringing to light the frequency of sexual and domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center" Cambridge, MA: South End Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writers==
Popular feminist writers associated with this theory are [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Helen Taylor (feminist)|Helen Taylor]]; [[Second wave feminism|Second Wave]] feminists [[Betty Friedan]] and [[Gloria Steinem]]; and [[Third-wave feminism|Third Wave]] feminist [[Rebecca Walker]].

[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]]]]
;Mary Wollstonecraft
[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) has been very influential in her writings as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' commented on society's view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft "denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood."&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; She argued that patriarchal oppression is a form of slavery that could no longer be ignored. Along with Judith Sargent Murray and Frances Wright, Wollstonecraft was one of the first major advocates for women's full inclusion in politics.

;Elizabeth Cady Stanton
[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]]]
[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was one of the most influential women in [[First-wave feminism|first wave feminism]]. An American social activist, she was instrumental in orchestrating the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, which was held in Seneca Falls, New York. Not only was the suffragist movement important to Stanton, she also was involved in women's parental and custody rights, divorce laws, birth control, employment and income rights, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baker | first = Jean H. | title = Sisters: the lives of America's suffragists | publisher = Hill and Wang | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780809095285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her partner in this movement was the equally influential [[Susan B. Anthony]].  Together, they fought for a linguistic shift in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to include "female".&lt;ref name="Evans, Sara M 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Sara M. | title = Born for liberty: a history of women in America | publisher = Free Press Paperbacks | location = New York, New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780684834986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 1890 she founded the National American Woman Suffrage Association and resided as president until 1892.&lt;ref name="Evans, Sara M 1997"/&gt; Despite never authoring a feminist text, she produced many speeches, resolutions, letters, calls, and petitions that fed the first wave and kept the spirit alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stanton | first = Elizabeth Cady | author-link = Elizabeth Cady Stanton | chapter = Address to the New York State Legislature, 1854 | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2V6YAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 | editor-last = Schneir | editor-first = Miriam | title = Feminism: the essential historical writings | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 1994 | page = 110 | isbn = 9780679753810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by gathering a large number of signatures, she aided the passage of the Married Women's Property Act of 1848 which considered women legally independent of their husbands and granted them property of their own. Together these women formed what was known as the NWSA (National Women Suffrage Association), which focused on working the courts to gain suffrage.

;John Stuart Mill
[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]]]
[[John Stuart Mill]] (May 20, 1806 – May 8, 1873) believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that "until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mill | first = John Stuart | author-link = John Stuart Mill | title = The Subjection of Women (A Feminist Literature Classic) | publisher = e-artnow Editions | location = Cork | origyear = 1869 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9788074843150 | title-link = The Subjection of Women }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same "genuine unselfishness" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one "that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters, and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book ''The Subjection of Women'', Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education, and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Brink | first = David | chapter = Mill's Moral and Political Philosophy | chapterurl = https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/ | title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=9 October 2007|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that sex inequality is greatly inhibiting the progress of humanity.

===The National Women's Political Caucus===
The [[National Women's Political Caucus]] (NWPC) was founded in 1971, this organization is the only national organization dedicated exclusively to increasing women's participation in all areas of political and public life as elected and appointed officials, as delegates to national party conventions, as judges in the state and federal courts, and as lobbyists, voters and campaign organizers.&lt;ref name="nwpc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwpc.org/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029053715/http://www.nwpc.org/history |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founders of NWPC include such prominent women as [[Gloria Steinem]], author, lecturer and founding editor of [[Ms. Magazine]]; former Congresswoman [[Shirley Chisholm]]; former Congresswoman and current president of Women USA [[Bella Abzug]]; [[Dorothy Height]], president of the [[National Council of Negro Women]]; Jill Ruckelshaus, U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner; [[Ann Lewis]], Political Director of the [[Democratic National Committee]]; [[Elly Peterson]], former vice-chair of the [[Republican National Committee]]; [[LaDonna Harris]], Indian rights leader; [[Liz Carpenter]], author, lecturer and former press secretary to [[Lady Bird Johnson]]; and [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], former chair of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].

These women were spurred by Congress' failure to pass the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1970. They believed legal, economic and social equity would come about only when women were equally represented among the nation's political decision-makers. Their faith that women's interests would best be served by women lawmakers has been confirmed time and time again, as women in Congress, state legislatures and city halls across the country have introduced, fought for and won legislation to eliminate sex discrimination and meet women's changing needs.&lt;ref name="nwpc.org"/&gt;

===The Women's Equity Action League===
The [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL) was a national membership organization, with state chapters and divisions, founded in 1968 and dedicated to improving the status and lives of all women primarily through education, litigation, and legislation. Its sister organization, the Women's Equity Action League Fund, was incorporated in 1972 "to help secure legal rights for women and to carry on educational and research projects on sex discrimination". The two organizations merged in 1981 following changes in the tax code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00323|title=Women's Equity Action League. Records of the Women's Equity Action League, 1966-1979: A Finding Aid|website=oasis.lib.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purposes of WEAL were:
*to promote greater economic progress on the part of American women;
*to press for full enforcement of existing anti-discriminatory laws on behalf of women;
*to seek correction of de facto discrimination against women;
*to gather and disseminate information and educational material;
*to investigate instances of, and seek solutions to, economic, educational, tax, and employment problems affecting women;
*to urge that girls be prepared to enter more advanced career fields;
*to seek reappraisal of federal, state and local laws and practices limiting women's employment opportunities;
*to combat by all lawful means, job discrimination against women in the pay, promotional or advancement policies of governmental or private employers;
*to seek the cooperation and coordination of all American women, individually or as organizations *to attain these objectives, whether through legislation, litigation, or other means, and by doing any and all things necessary or incident thereto.

==Legislation==
A fair number of American liberal feminists believe that equality in pay, job opportunities, political structure, social security and education for women especially needs to be guaranteed by the [[U.S. Constitution]].

===The Equal Rights Amendment===
Three years after women won the right to vote, the [[Equal Rights Amendment|Equal Right Amendment]] (ERA) was introduced in Congress by Senator Curtis and Representative Anthony, both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. This amendment stated that civil rights cannot be denied on the basis of one's sex. It was authored by [[Alice Paul]], head of the [[National Women's Party]], who led the [[suffrage]] campaign. Through the efforts of Alice Paul, the Amendment was introduced into each session of the [[United States Congress]]. But it was buried in committee in both Houses of Congress. In 1946, it was narrowly defeated by the full [[United States Senate|Senate]], 38–35. In February 1970 twenty NOW leaders disrupted the hearings of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, demanding the ERA be heard by the full Congress. In May of that year, the Senate Subcommittee began hearings on the ERA under Senator [[Birch Bayh]]. In June, the ERA finally left the House Judiciary Committee due to a discharge petition filed by Representative [[Martha Griffiths]]. In March 1972, the ERA was approved by the full Senate without changes, 84–8. Senator [[Sam Ervin]] and Representative [[Emanuel Celler]] succeeded in setting an arbitrary time limit of seven years for ratification. The ERA went to individual states to be ratified by the state legislatures. The ERA first attempted to be passed after the passing of the nineteenth amendment in 1920 by the feminists in the National Woman's Party, but it got little attention at the time.

In 2008, the ERA was stopped three states short of ratification. The state legislatures that were most hostile to the ERA were Utah, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The NOW believes that the single most obvious problem in passing the ERA was the gender and racial imbalance in the legislatures. More than 2/3 of the women and all of the African Americans in state legislatures voted for the ERA, but less than 50% of the white men in the targeted legislatures cast pro-ERA votes in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.now.org/issues/economic/cea/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807035643/http://www.now.org/issues/economic/cea/history.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Constitutional Equity Amendment===
The Constitutional Equity Amendment (CEA) was rolled out in 1995 by American women's organizations. The CEA incorporated all of the concerns that have arisen out of a two-year study by NOW and other groups of the ERA which reviewed the history of the amendment from 1923 until the present. The items that were included in the CEA which were missing in the ERA include:

*States that women and men shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place and entity subject to its jurisdiction;
*It guarantees rights without discrimination on account of sex, race, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnicity, national origin, color or indigence;
*It prohibits pregnancy discrimination and guarantees the absolute right of a woman to make her own reproductive decisions including the termination of pregnancy;

== Critiques ==
Critics of liberal feminism argue that its individualist assumptions make it difficult to see the ways in which underlying social structures and values disadvantage women. They argue that even if women are not dependent upon individual men, they are still dependent upon a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] state.  These critics believe that institutional changes like the introduction of [[women's suffrage]] are insufficient to emancipate women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bryson | first = Valerie | title = Feminist debates: issues of theory and political practice | pages = 14–15 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780814713488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more prevalent critiques of liberal feminism is that it, as a study, allows too much of its focus to fall on a "metamorphosis" of women into men, and in doing so, disregards the significance of the traditional role of women.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Liberal feminism focuses on the individual, and it is sometimes argued that in doing so, it overlooks the importance of community.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989" /&gt;{{rp|38}} A historical critique of liberal feminism focuses on its racist, classist and heterosexist past.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989" /&gt;{{rp|40}} One of the leading scholars who have critiqued liberal feminism is [[radical feminist]] [[Catherine A. MacKinnon]], an American lawyer, writer and social activist.  Specializing in issues regarding sex equality, she has been intimately involved in the case regarding the definition of sexual harassment and sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon"/&gt;  She, among other leading scholars, view liberalism and feminism as incompatible because liberalism offers women a, "piece of the pie as currently and poisonously baked".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Morgan | chapter = Light bulbs, radishes and the politics of the 21st century | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K22CrjaKYsYC&amp;pg=PA5 | editor-last1 = Bell | editor-first1 = Diane | editor-last2 = Klein | editor-first2 = Renate | title = Radically speaking: feminism reclaimed | pages = 5–8 | publisher = Spinifex Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 9781742193649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics such as [[Black feminism|black feminists]] and [[Postcolonial feminism|postcolonial feminists]] assert that mainstream liberal feminism reflects only the values of middle-class, heterosexual, white women and has largely ignored women of different races, cultures or classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mills | first = Sara | chapter = Postcolonial feminist theory | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mg4CnbiN_rMC | editor-last1 = Jackson | editor-first1 = Stevi | editor-last2 = Jones | editor-first2 = Jackie | editor-link1 = Stevi Jackson | title = Contemporary feminist theories | pages = 98–112 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | location = Edinburgh | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780748606894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of liberal feminism is based in white privilege and often times, liberal feminism fails to recognize how women of color did not have a voice when it came to how women spoke out about inequality. Liberal feminism fails to include racism and discrimination because of how it arose historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3810738|title = (In)Quest of Liberal Feminism|journal = Hypatia|volume = 12|issue = 4|pages = 178–197|last1 = Kensinger|first1 = Loretta|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liberty Bell''' is an iconic [[symbol]] of [[American independence]], located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Once placed in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House (now renamed [[Independence Hall]]), the bell today is located in the Liberty Bell Center in [[Independence National Historical Park]]. The bell was commissioned in 1752 by the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]] from the [[London]] firm of Lester and Pack (known subsequently as the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]]), and [[bell founding|was cast]] with the lettering "Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof", a [[Bible|Biblical]] reference from the [[Book of Leviticus]] ({{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|25:10|KJV}}). The bell first cracked when rung after its arrival in Philadelphia, and was twice recast by local workmen John Pass and John Stow, whose last names appear on the bell. In its early years the bell was used to summon lawmakers to legislative sessions and to alert citizens about public meetings and proclamations.

Although no immediate announcement was made of the [[Second Continental Congress]]'s [[Lee Resolution|vote for independence]], and so the bell could not have rung on July 4, 1776, related to that vote, bells were rung on July 8 to mark the reading of [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|the Declaration of Independence]]. While there is no contemporary account of the Liberty Bell ringing, most historians believe it was one of the bells rung. After American independence was secured, the bell fell into relative obscurity until, in the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] societies, who dubbed it the "Liberty Bell".

The bell acquired its distinctive large crack some time in the early 19th century—a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] in 1835.  The bell became famous after an 1847 short story claimed that an aged bellringer rang it on July 4, 1776, upon hearing of the [[Second Continental Congress]]'s vote for independence. Despite the fact that the bell did not ring for independence on that July 4, the tale was widely accepted as fact, even by some historians.  Beginning in 1885, the City of Philadelphia that owns the bell, allowed it to go to various expositions and patriotic gatherings. The bell attracted huge crowds wherever it went, additional cracking occurred and pieces were chipped away by souvenir hunters. The last such journey occurred in 1915, after which the city refused further requests.

After [[World War II]], the city allowed the [[National Park Service]] to take custody of the bell, while retaining ownership. The bell was used as a symbol of freedom during the [[Cold War]] and was a popular site for protests in the 1960s. It was moved from its longtime home in Independence Hall to a nearby glass pavilion on [[Independence Mall (Philadelphia)|Independence Mall]] in 1976, and then to the larger Liberty Bell Center adjacent to the pavilion in 2003. The bell has been featured on coins and stamps, and its name and image have been widely used by corporations.

== Founding (1751–1753) ==
Philadelphia's city bell had been used to alert the public to proclamations or civic danger since the city's 1682 founding. The original bell hung from a tree behind the Pennsylvania State House (now known as [[Independence Hall]]) and was said to have been brought to the city by its founder, [[William Penn]]. In 1751, with a [[bell tower]] being built in the Pennsylvania State House, civic authorities sought a bell of better quality that could be heard at a greater distance in the rapidly expanding city.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Norris (statesman)|Isaac Norris]], speaker of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]], gave orders to the colony's [[London]] agent, Robert Charles, to obtain a "good Bell of about two thousands pound weight".&lt;ref name="oneclick" /&gt;

{{quote|We hope and rely on thy care and assistance in this affair and that thou wilt procure and forward it by the first good opp&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; as our workmen inform us it will be much less trouble to hang the Bell before their Scaffolds are struck from the Building where we intend to place it which will not be done 'till the end of next Summer or beginning of the Fall. Let the bell be cast by the best workmen &amp; examined carefully before it is Shipped with the following words well shaped around it.

== Inscription ==
[[File:Bell crack.png|thumb|The path of the Liberty Bell's hairline crack.|222x222px]]
The inscription on the bell reads:

&lt;blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 120%; font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof Lev. XXV. v X.

At the time, "Pensylvania" was an accepted alternative spelling for "Pennsylvania." That spelling was used by [[Alexander Hamilton]], a graduate of King's College (now [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia University]]), in 1787 on the signature page of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="script"&gt;Paige, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Two local [[foundry|founders]], John Pass and John Stow, offered to recast the bell. Though they were inexperienced in bell casting, Pass had headed the [[Mount Holly, New Jersey|Mount Holly]] Iron Foundry in neighboring New Jersey and came from [[Malta]] that had a tradition of bell casting. Stow, on the other hand, was only four years out of his apprenticeship as a brass founder. At Stow's foundry on Second Street, the bell was broken into small pieces, melted down, and cast into a new bell. The two founders decided that the metal was too brittle, and augmented the bell metal by about ten percent, using copper. The bell was ready in March 1753, and Norris reported that the lettering (that included the founders' names and the year) was even clearer on the new bell than on the old.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

City officials scheduled a public celebration with free food and drink for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When the fruit of the two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the difficulties with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry, still in business today, takes the position that the bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[Winterthur Museum]] conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps with a high level of tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap [[pewter]] with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The result was "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early days (1754–1846) ==

Dissatisfied with the bell, Norris instructed Charles to order a second one, and see if Lester and Pack would take back the first bell and credit the value of the metal towards the bill. In 1754, the Assembly decided to keep both bells; the new one was attached to the tower clock&lt;ref name="whoops"&gt;Nash, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; while the old bell was, by vote of the Assembly, devoted "to such Uses as this House may hereafter appoint."&lt;ref name="whoops" /&gt; The Pass and Stow bell was used to summon the Assembly.&lt;ref name="whosits" /&gt; One of the earliest documented mentions of the bell's use is in a letter from [[Benjamin Franklin]] to Catherine Ray dated October 16, 1755: "Adieu. The Bell rings, and I must go among the Grave ones, and talk Politiks.{{sic}}"&lt;ref name="bigben"&gt;Paige, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The bell was rung in 1760 to mark the accession of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to the throne.&lt;ref name="whosits" /&gt; In the early 1760s, the Assembly allowed a local church to use the State House for services and the bell to summon worshipers, while the church's building was being constructed.&lt;ref name="bigben" /&gt; The bell was also used to summon people to public meetings, and in 1772, a group of citizens complained to the Assembly that the bell was being rung too frequently.&lt;ref name="whosits"&gt;Kimball, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the legends that have grown up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least not for any reason connected with independence), as no public announcement was made of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first"&gt;Nash, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackettFischer&gt;Fischer, p. 754&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing.&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the [[National Park Service]], "We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence."&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

If the bell was rung, it would have been most likely rung by [[Andrew McNair]], who was the doorkeeper both of the Assembly and of the Congress, and was responsible for ringing the bell. As McNair was absent on two unspecified days between April and November, it might have been rung by William Hurry, who succeeded him as doorkeeper for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;

[[File:Libbell1908.jpeg|thumb|right|The Liberty Bell is paraded through the streets of Philadelphia, 1908, in a recreation of its 1777 journey to Allentown|alt=A large bell is seen tied to a wagon. Soldiers in Revolutionary War uniforms stand by.]]
[[File:Arrival of Liberty Bell in Allentown - 1777.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of a watercolor by Davis Gray of the arrival of the Liberty Bell at Zions Church, in Northampton Towne, (later Allentown) Pennsylvania on 24 September 1777. (Holdings of the Lehigh County Historical Society)]]
After [[George Washington|Washington]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, and the city prepared for what was seen as an inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to the town of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the [[High German Evangelical Reformed Church|Zion German Reformed Church]] in Northampton Town, now [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], where it waited out the [[Philadelphia campaign#Capture of Philadelphia|British occupation of Philadelphia]] under the church floor boards.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Placed on an upper floor of the State House, the bell was rung in the early years of independence on the [[Fourth of July]] and on [[Washington's Birthday]], as well as on [[Election Day (politics)|Election Day]] to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to their classes at nearby [[Philosophical Hall]]. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], it again rang to summon legislators into session.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Pennsylvania]], having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|70000|1800}}}} today.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to [[St. Augustine Church, Philadelphia|St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church]] that was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the [[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]] of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at [[Villanova University]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain how the bell came to be cracked; the damage occurred sometime between 1817 and 1846. The bell is mentioned in a number of newspaper articles during that time; no mention of a crack can be found until 1846. In fact, in 1837, the bell was depicted in an anti-slavery publication—uncracked. In February 1846 ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' reported that the bell had been rung on February 23, 1846, in celebration of Washington's Birthday (as February 22 fell on a Sunday, the celebration occurred the next day), and also reported that the bell had long been cracked, but had been "put in order" by having the sides of the crack filed. The paper reported that around noon, it was discovered that the ringing had caused the crack to be greatly extended, and that "the old Independence Bell ... now hangs in the great city steeple irreparably cracked and forever dumb".&lt;ref name="dumb"&gt;Kimball, pp. 43–45&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common story about the cracking of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], [[John Marshall]]. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, announced that he had ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|on his return to the United States]] in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]], and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, pp. 43–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pass and Stow bell was first termed "the Liberty Bell" in the New York Anti-Slavery Society's journal, ''Anti-Slavery Record''. In an 1835 piece, "The Liberty Bell", Philadelphians were castigated for not doing more for the abolitionist cause. Two years later, in another work of that society, the journal ''Liberty'' featured an image of the bell as its frontispiece, with the words "Proclaim Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, Boston's Friends of Liberty, another abolitionist group, titled their journal ''The Liberty Bell''. The same year, [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] publication ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' reprinted a Boston abolitionist pamphlet containing a poem entitled "The Liberty Bell" that noted that, at that time, despite its inscription, the bell did not proclaim liberty to ''all'' the inhabitants of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Becoming a symbol (1847–1865) ==
[[File:Bellringer1776.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Bellman Informed of the Passage of the Declaration of Independence'': an 1854 depiction of the story of the Liberty Bell being rung on July 4, 1776|alt=An elderly man looks excitedly around as a boy enters a bell chamber. The old man holds a rope leading to the Liberty Bell in his hand.]]
A great part of the modern image of the bell as a relic of the proclamation of American independence was forged by writer [[George Lippard]]. On January 2, 1847, his story "Fourth of July, 1776" appeared in ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' magazine. The short story depicted an aged bellman on July 4, 1776, sitting morosely by the bell, fearing that [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] would not have the courage to declare independence. At the most dramatic moment, a young boy appears with instructions for the old man: to ring the bell. The story was widely reprinted and closely linked the Liberty Bell to the Declaration of Independence in the public mind.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the story were reprinted in early historian [[Benson J. Lossing]]'s ''The Pictorial Field Guide to the Revolution'' (published in 1850) as historical fact,&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and the tale was widely repeated for generations after in school primers.&lt;ref&gt;de Bolla, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, with the rise of interest in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and [[United States Constitution]] had been debated and signed.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed).&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, President [[Franklin Pierce]] visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1861, the [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], came to the Assembly Room and delivered an address en route to his inauguration in Washington DC.&lt;ref name="linc"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Liberty Bell 1872 - crop.jpg|thumb|left|The Liberty Bell on its ornate stand, 1872]]
In 1876, city officials discussed what role the bell should play in the nation's Centennial festivities. Some wanted to repair it so it could sound at the [[Centennial Exposition]] being held in Philadelphia, but the idea was not adopted; the bell's custodians concluded that it was unlikely that the metal could be made into a bell that would have a pleasant sound, and that the crack had become part of the bell's character. Instead, a replica weighing {{convert|13000|lb}} (1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds for each of the original states) was cast. The metal used for what was dubbed "the Centennial Bell" included four melted-down cannons: one used by each side in the American Revolutionary War, and one used by each side in the Civil War. That bell was sounded at the Exposition grounds on July 4, 1876, was later recast to improve the sound, and today is the bell attached to the clock in the steeple of Independence Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; While the Liberty Bell did not go to the Exposition, a great many Exposition visitors came to visit it, and its image was ubiquitous at the Exposition grounds—myriad souvenirs were sold bearing its image or shape, and state pavilions contained replicas of the bell made of substances ranging from stone to tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, the bell was hung from the ceiling of the Assembly Room by a chain with thirteen links.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bell in case.png|thumb|right|upright|The glass-encased Liberty Bell in the tower hall of Independence Hall]]
Between 1885 and 1915, the Liberty Bell made seven trips to various expositions and celebrations. Each time, the bell traveled by rail, making a large number of stops along the way so that local people could view it.&lt;ref&gt;de Bolla, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; By 1885, the Liberty Bell was widely recognized as a symbol of freedom, and as a treasured relic of Independence, and was growing still more famous as versions of Lippard's legend were reprinted in history and school books.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1885, the city agreed to let it travel to [[New Orleans]] for the [[World Cotton Centennial]] exposition. Large crowds mobbed the bell at each stop. In [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], the former [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] of the [[Confederate States of America]], [[Jefferson Davis]] came to the bell. Davis delivered a speech paying homage to it, and urging national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, it was sent to Chicago's [[World Columbian Exposition]] to be the centerpiece of the state's exhibit in the Pennsylvania Building.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, 1893, in Chicago, the bell was serenaded with the first performance of ''[[The Liberty Bell March]]'', conducted by "America's Bandleader", [[John Philip Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphians began to cool to the idea of sending it to other cities when it returned from Chicago bearing a new crack, and each new proposed journey met with increasing opposition.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;Kimball, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that the bell's private watchman had been cutting off small pieces for souvenirs. The city placed the bell in a glass-fronted oak case.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, it was taken out of the glass case and hung from its yoke again in the tower hall of Independence Hall, a room that would remain its home until the end of 1975. A guard was posted to discourage souvenir hunters who might otherwise chip at it.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liberty Bell at Bunker Hill 1903.jpg|thumb|The Liberty Bell visits [[Bunker Hill Monument|Bunker Hill]] (obelisk visible background left) in 1903.|alt=The Liberty Bell on a wagon, a number of people, including policemen, pose with it.]]
By 1909, the bell had made six trips, and not only had the cracking become worse, but souvenir hunters had deprived it of over one percent of its weight. When, in 1912, the organizers of the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, the city was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally decided to let it go as the bell had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to bring it to millions who might never see it otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride, the city installed a metal support structure inside the bell, generally called the "spider."&lt;ref&gt;The Franklin Institute, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1915, the bell was tapped gently with wooden mallets to produce sounds that were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission that also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home; again, five million saw it on the return journey.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after [[World War I]], and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago and San Francisco had obtained its presence after presenting petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of children. Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4&amp;nbsp;million schoolchildren, for the 1933 [[Century of Progress]] Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. Both efforts failed.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, one of Independence Hall's exterior doors was replaced by glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of [[World War II]], it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to [[Fort Knox]], to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The bell was again tapped on [[D-Day]], as well as in victory on [[V-E Day]] and [[V-J Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], and following considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia agreed that it would transfer custody of the bell and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. The city would also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later [[Independence National Historical Park]] was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS or Park Service).&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; The Park Service would be responsible for maintaining and displaying the bell.&lt;ref name="ben" /&gt; The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall that had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, [[Independence Mall (Philadelphia)|Independence Mall]].&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;Nash, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postwar period, the bell became a symbol of freedom used in the [[Cold War]]. The bell was chosen for the symbol of a [[savings bond]] campaign in 1950. The purpose of this campaign, as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Alben Barkley]] put it, was to make the country "so strong that no one can impose ruthless, godless ideologies on us".&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Paige, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, former residents of nations behind the [[Iron Curtain]] were allowed to tap the bell as a symbol of hope and encouragement to their compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign dignitaries, such as Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[West Berlin]] Mayor [[Ernst Reuter]] were brought to the bell, and they commented that the bell symbolized the link between the United States and their nations.&lt;ref name="ben" /&gt; During the 1960s, the bell was the site of several protests, both for the [[civil rights movement]], and by various protesters supporting or opposing the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Paige, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost from the start of its stewardship, the Park Service sought to move the bell from Independence Hall to a structure where it would be easier to care for the bell and accommodate visitors. The first such proposal was withdrawn in 1958, after considerable public protest.&lt;ref name="nonono"&gt;Paige, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Park Service tried again as part of the planning for the 1976 [[United States Bicentennial]]. The Independence National Historical Park Advisory Committee proposed in 1969 that the bell be moved out of Independence Hall, as the building could not accommodate the millions expected to visit Philadelphia for the Bicentennial.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Park Service announced plans to build a large glass tower for the bell at the new visitors center at South Third Street and Chestnut Street, two blocks east of Independence Hall, at a cost of $5&amp;nbsp;million, but citizens again protested the move. Instead, in 1973, the Park Service proposed to build a smaller glass pavilion for the bell at the north end of Independence Mall, between Arch and Race Streets. Philadelphia Mayor [[Frank Rizzo]] agreed with the pavilion idea, but proposed that the pavilion be built across Chestnut Street from Independence Hall, which the state feared would destroy the view of the historic building from the mall area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

During the Bicentennial, members of the [[Procrastinators' Club of America]] jokingly picketed the Whitechapel Bell Foundry with signs "We got a lemon" and "What about the warranty?" The foundry told the protesters that it would be glad to replace the bell—so long as it was returned in the original packaging.&lt;ref name="Whitechapel" /&gt; In 1958, the foundry (then trading under the name Mears and Stainbank Foundry) had offered to recast the bell, and was told by the Park Service that neither it nor the public wanted the crack removed.&lt;ref name="nonono" /&gt; The foundry was called upon, in 1976, to cast a full-size replica of the Liberty Bell (known as the Bicentennial Bell) that was presented to the United States by the British monarch, Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; and was housed in the tower once intended for the Liberty Bell, at the former visitor center on South Third Street.&lt;ref&gt;Greiff, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Park Service began preliminary work on a redesign of Independence Mall. Architects [[Robert Venturi|Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates]] developed a master plan with two design alternatives. The first proposed a block-long visitors center on the south side of Market Street, that would also house the Liberty Bell. This would have interrupted the mall's three-block vista of Independence Hall, and made the bell visible only from the south, i.e. Chestnut Street. The second alternative placed a similar visitors center on the north side of Market Street, also interrupting the mall's vista, with the bell in a small pavilion on the south side.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Salisbury, "Architects push proposal to ring Liberty Bell with visitors center," ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', July 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; City planner [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund Bacon]], who had overseen the mall's design in the 1950s, saw preservation of the vista of Independence Hall as essential. He created his own plan that included a domed bell pavilion built north of Market Street.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Magaziner, "A Debate: Imagining the Mall," ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', June 30, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction to the possibility of moving the Liberty Bell so far from Independence Hall was strongly negative. NPS announced that the bell would remain on the block between Chestnut and Market Streets.&lt;ref&gt;''Revision of the Proposed Plan for Independence National Historical Park'', "Alternate E-1: Site Specific Actions #10 – Liberty Bell" (Denver, CO: National Park Service, September 1996), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other plans were proposed, each had strengths and weaknesses, but the goal of all was to encourage visitors to see more of the historical park than just the Liberty Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hine, "Lost in Space on Philadelphia's Independence Mall," ''The New York Times'', February 9, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Independence Hall2.jpg|thumb|left|Independence Hall, with Liberty Bell Center to the right]]
The [[Olin Partnership]] was hired to create a new master plan for Independence Mall; its team included architect [[Bernard Cywinski]], who ultimately won a limited design competition to design what was called the Liberty Bell Center (LBC).  Cywinski's design was unveiled in early 1999. Significantly larger than the existing pavilion, allowing for exhibit space and an interpretive center,&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Olin, "Giving Form to a Creation Story—The Remaking of Independence Mall," in Rodolphe el-Khoury, ed., ''Liberty Bell Center, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson'' (Philadelphia, PA: Oscar Riera Ojeda &amp; Associates, 2006) {{ISBN|0-9746800-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   the proposed LBC building also would cover about 15% of the footprint of the long-demolished [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], the "White House" of [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/maps/map.htm Footprints of LBC and President's House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808001437/http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/maps/map.htm |date=August 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists excavating the LBC's intended site uncovered remnants of the 1790–1800 executive mansion that were reburied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Faye Flam]], "Formerly on Ice, Past Unearthed.

Inside the LBC, visitors pass through a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.&lt;ref name="hung"&gt;{{Cite book

The crack ends near the attachment with the yoke.&lt;ref&gt;The Franklin Institute, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Constance M. Greiff, in her book tracing the history of Independence National Historical Park, wrote of the Liberty Bell:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he Liberty Bell is the most venerated object in the park, a national icon. It is not as beautiful as some other things that were in Independence Hall in those momentous days two hundred years ago, and it is irreparably damaged. Perhaps that is part of its almost mystical appeal. Like our democracy it is fragile and imperfect, but it has weathered threats, and it has endured.&lt;ref&gt;Greiff, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to the replicas that are seen at Independence National Historical Park, early replicas of the Liberty Bell include the so-called [[Justice Bell (Valley Forge)|Justice Bell]] or Women's Liberty Bell, commissioned in 1915 by [[suffragist]]s to advocate for women's suffrage. This bell had the same legend as the Liberty Bell, with two added words, "establish justice", words taken from [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|the Preamble]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. It also had the clapper chained to the bell so it could not sound, symbolizing the inability of women, lacking the vote, to influence political events. The Justice Bell toured extensively to publicize the cause. After the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] (granting women the vote), the Justice Bell was brought to the front of Independence Hall on August 26, 1920, to finally sound. It remained on a platform before Independence Hall for several months before city officials required that it be taken away, and today is at the [[Washington Memorial Chapel]] at [[Valley Forge]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 114–117&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Liberty Bell Savings Bonds drive in 1950, 55&amp;nbsp;replicas of the Liberty Bell (one each for the 48&amp;nbsp;states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] and were cast in [[France]] by the [[Fonderie Paccard]]. The bells were to be displayed and rung on patriotic occasions.&lt;ref name="states" /&gt; Many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings.&lt;ref name="states" /&gt; Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited on the grounds of the state's Girls Detention Center.

The Liberty Bell appeared on a commemorative coin in 1926 to mark the sesquicentennial of American independence.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgeons, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; Its first use on a circulating coin was on the [[reverse (coin)|reverse]] side of the [[Franklin half dollar]], struck between 1948 and 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgeons, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared on the [[United States Bicentennial coinage|Bicentennial design]] of the [[Eisenhower dollar]], superimposed against the moon.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgeons, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

The bell, the ads related, would henceforth spend half the year at Taco Bell corporate headquarters in [[Irvine, California]]. Outraged calls flooded Independence National Historical Park, and Park Service officials hastily called a press conference to deny that the bell had been sold. After several hours, Taco Bell admitted that it was an [[April Fools' Day]] joke. Despite the protests, company sales of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos rose by more than a half million dollars that week.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, pp. 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">In United States agriculture policy, '''Loan deficiency payments''' are a farm income support program first authorized by the [[Food Security Act of 1985]] (P.L. 99-198) that makes direct payments, equivalent to marketing loan gains, to producers who agree not to obtain nonrecourse loans, even though they are eligible. Loan deficiency payments are available under the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1205) for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybeans, other oilseeds, wool, mohair, honey, dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas.

'''Producer Option Payment''' (POP) is the original name for the loan deficiency payment (LDP). This phrase continues to be used by some farmers.

The '''MARA Junior Science College''' ({{lang-ms|'''Maktab Rendah Sains MARA (MRSM)'''}}) is a group of boarding schools created by the People's Trust Council ({{lang-ms|Majlis Amanah Rakyat}}, commonly abbreviated as [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat|MARA]]), a Malaysian government agency. The institution provides learning facilities for bright students in local schools throughout Malaysia.

The first MRSM was established in Seremban in February 1972 with its first intake of 150 pioneering (male only) students from all over Malaysia. [[MRSM Seremban]] took in its last batch of students in 1986 and gradually converted into [[Kolej Mara Seremban]] officially in February 1994.

== Academic system ==
Students are primarily assessed through a system similar to the grading systems in universities and/or colleges: the grade point average (GPA) ({{lang-ms|Purata Nilaian Gred (PNG)}} system. By the end of their final semesters they will be awarded a certificate of graduation for those who succeeded to pass with at least a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) ({{lang-ms|Timbunan Purata Nilaian Gred (TPNG)}}) of 2.00 and above.

Applicants take the [[Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3|Form 3 Assessment]] ({{lang-ms|[[Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3]]}}) and the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia|Malaysian Education Certificate]] ({{lang-ms|[[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]}}) national examinations.

MJSCs use the usual academic ladders in Malaysia when it comes to the level progression system, where students advance through year 7 (known as Form 1 in Malaysia) to Year 11 (Form 5) by age. In Malaysia, there is no system that allows for level transition according to the student's capability. Most MJSC runs all levels from Form 1 to Form 5, but there are 3 MJSCs that only run Forms 4 and 5. In 2015, there are no more MJSCs that only run Forms 1 to 3. All of these previous lower form only MJSCs have been enrolling upper form with MJSC Pasir Tumboh and MJSC Gerik both had their form 4 intakes in 2015 (SPM 2016).

Students who started from Form 1 can continue their studies in MJSC until Form 5 in the same college or by transferring to another college. These students can only continue their studies in MJSC if they pass their [[Penilaian Menengah Rendah]] with at least 6As, with As in Mathematics and Science. Failure to achieve this will cause their studies in the MJSC system to be discontinued, and they will have to continue their studies in an ordinary school.

== MRSM PROGRAM DWI-SIJIL (Dual Certificate Programme or {{ lang-ms|Program Dwi-Sijil}}) ==
Dual Certificate Programme is a part of internationalisation of the Education System.It is believed that educational excellence can be achieve in a shorter time by adopting best practices from leading and prestigious schools in the world.By providing basic skills in communication skills, thinking skills and learning skills,students will be more willing to adapt to the teaching styles.
Subsequently, learning activities will be truly student-centered, thus ensuring effective teaching and learning.
This internationalisation programme enables MJSCs that offer this programme to take four examinations:SPM,IGCSE,PT3 and Cambridge Checkpoint.
The pioneering MJSC of this programme is MRSM Tun Abdul Razak Pekan Pahang.

== MRSM PKP (Special Education Programme or {{lang-ms|Program Khas Pendidikan}}) ==
PKP is a title that is given to MARA Junior Science Colleges who have attained a high level of quality in their students through national exams and participation in events – with the former being the primary factor. These colleges are often deemed the most superior in their category of schools in Malaysia, though others could still compete with them. Most of the students who are admitted into MRSM PKP are usually those who obtain 8As or more in the {{lang-ms|[[Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3]]}} (PT3) and UPSR examination and pass the UKKM with flying colours. The quality of the students in MRSM PKP are usually higher. As such, these MJSCs usually become the role models for the other MJSCs to promote healthy competition between its students.

There are eight of them:
* MJSC Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan (upper form only)
* MJSC Tun Ghafar Baba, Melaka (upper form only)
* MJSC Taiping, Perak (upper form only)
* MJSC Beseri, Perlis (upper and lower form)
* MJSC Tun Dr Ismail, Pontian, Johor (upper and lower form)
* MJSC Langkawi, Kedah (upper and lower form)(PKP IGCSE)
* MJSC Kuantan, Pahang (upper and lower form)(PKP IGCSE)
* MJSC imtiaz YT KETENGAH, Terengganu (upper form)(PKP Keusahawanan)

The first MRSM PKP is MRSM Kulim Kedah. First batch is 1988 batch. Second batch is 1990 batch. and after that MRSM Kulim stopped taking pkp students. and the program has moved to the eight above MRSM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)''' refers to a set of policies and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.

NAMA was first used in the [[Bali Action Plan]] as part of the [[Bali Road Map]] agreed at the [[Bali Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali]] in December 2007, and also formed part of the [[Copenhagen Accord]] issued following the [[COP 15|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]] (COP 15) in December 2009.

==History of the use of NAMA in international agreements==

===Bali Action Plan (December 2007)===
The [[Bali Action Plan]] is centered on four main building blocks: (i) Mitigation, (ii) Adaptation, (iii) Technology, and (iv) Financing, with NAMA forming an important part of the mitigation component. 
The Bali Action Plan called for future discussions to address:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/climatechange/docs/UNDP_BAP_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by all developed countries, and;''
* ''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.''.

===Copenhagen Climate Conference (December 2009)===
The [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] did not produce the global agreement envisaged in the Bali Road Map. The Copenhagen Accord, however, did retain the concept of NAMA, but in a narrower definition only applying to Non-Annex 1 countries, and did not specify what form they should take:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c2es.org/copenhagen-accord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Non-Annex I Parties to the Convention will implement mitigation actions … consistent with Article 4.1 and Article 4.7 and in the context of sustainable development … Non-Annex I Parties will communicate information on the implementation of their actions through National Communications, with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure that national sovereignty is respected. '''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' seeking international support will be recorded in a registry along with relevant technology, finance and capacity building support. Those actions supported will be added to the list in appendix II. These supported '''nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties.''

==What is meant by Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action?==
* Different countries, different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities 
* Developing countries will effectively implement national action depending on the effective implementation of the commitments by developed countries in providing financial resources and transfer of technology. 
* The priorities of developing countries are economic and social development and poverty eradication.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/39/16/40633672.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
India has argued that NAMA means ''voluntary reductions'' by developing countries that ''require to be supported and enabled'' by technology transfer from developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/india100209b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition, NAMAs will vary by country. Indonesia, for example, might focus on integrating climate change policy with other aspects of economic development, such as progressive reduction in oil subsidies, poverty reduction through promotion of alternative income to reduce [[illegal logging]], and exploit more fully the country’s renewable resources, especially geothermal.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

==Implementation of NAMA==
In 2010, no NAMAs were implemented yet. The [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] is regarded a precedor of a future NAMA mechanism and already operational.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter C. and Schibli R., If you want a Nama tomorrow, you need a POA today (March 2011), Trading Carbon, Reuters. Available at: http://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/110300_Namas_TradingCarbon_SPcs-rs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of NAMA submissions==
As of September 2012, about 50 countries have submitted information of their NAMA to the UNFCCC. The detailed contents of their submissions vary greatly on each country, ranging from their intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, target sectors, specific actions to be taken, to GHG emissions reduction targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmechanisms.org/e/namainfo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2012 "Submission of more information by developing country Parties, subject to availability, relating to nationally appropriate mitigation actions, including underlying assumptions and methodologies, sectors and gases covered, global warming potential values used, support needs for implementation of nationally appropriate mitigation actions and estimated mitigation outcomes. Submissions from Parties." FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/MISC.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2011 "Compilation of information on nationally appropriate mitigation actions to be implemented by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention." FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of NAMA==
Some have criticized NAMA as heading away from [[carbon pricing]] and encouraging enormous subsidy programs funded by developed countries and implemented on a voluntary basis by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stoft, Steven E., Beyond Kyoto: Flexible Carbon Pricing for Global Cooperation (October 23, 2009).

'''Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone''', sometimes abbreviated to '''neohesperidin DC''' or simply '''NHDC''', is an [[artificial sweetener]] derived from [[citrus]].

It is particularly effective in masking the bitter tastes of other compounds found in citrus, including [[limonin]] and [[naringin]]. Industrially, it is produced by extracting neohesperidin from the [[bitter orange]], and then hydrogenating this to make NHDC.

==Discovery==

NHDC was discovered during the 1960s as part of a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] research program to find methods for minimizing the taste of bitter flavorants in citrus juices.  [[Neohesperidin]] is one such bitter compound.  When treated with [[potassium hydroxide]] or another strong base, and then [[catalyst|catalytically]] [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]], it becomes NHDC. 

== Profile ==
NHDC in pure form is found as a white substance not unlike [[powdered sugar]].

A compound roughly 1500-1800 times sweeter than sugar at threshold concentrations; around 340 times sweeter than sugar weight-for-weight. Its potency is naturally affected by such factors as the application in which it is used, and the [[pH]] of the product.

Like other highly sweet [[glycoside]]s, such as [[glycyrrhizin]] and those found in [[stevia]], NHDC's sweet taste has a slower onset than sugar's and lingers in the mouth for some time.

Unlike [[aspartame]], NHDC is stable to elevated temperatures and to acidic or basic conditions, and so can be used in applications that require a long shelf life. NHDC itself can stay foodsafe for up to five years when stored in optimal conditions.

The product is well known for having a strong synergistic effect when used in conjunction with other [[artificial sweetener]]s such as [[aspartame]], [[saccharin]], [[acesulfame potassium]], and [[cyclamate]], as well as sugar alcohols such as [[xylitol]]. NHDC usage boosts the effects of these sweeteners at lower concentrations than would otherwise be required; smaller amounts of other sweeteners are needed. This provides a cost benefit.

== Approval ==

The [[European Union]] approved NHDC's use as a sweetener in 1994.  It has not been approved as a sweetener in the [[United States]].  It is sometimes said that NHDC is considered a [[Generally Recognized as Safe]] flavour enhancer by the Flavour and Extract Manufacturers' Association, which is a trade group with no legal standing.  NHDC has never appeared on the FDA's GRAS listing.

== Uses ==

In food it is used as a [[flavour enhancer]] in concentrations of around 4-5 [[parts per million]] (ppm) and as an [[artificial sweetener]] at around 15-20 ppm.

=== Masking ===

[[Pharmaceutical]] companies are fond of the product as a means of reducing the bitterness of [[pharmacological]] [[Medication|drugs]] in [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form, and it has been used for [[livestock]] feed as a means of reducing feeding time. It is also widely favoured for use in otherwise naturally [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] products.

=== Enhancer ===
As a [[flavour enhancer]], NHDC is used in a wide range of products and is indicated by the [[E number]] E 959. It is noted particularly for enhancing [[sensory analysis|sensory]] effects (known in the industry as 'mouth feel'). An example of this is 'creaminess' in [[dairy]] foods such as [[yogurt]] and [[ice cream]].

=== Other uses ===

Other products NHDC can be found in may include a wide variety of beverages,
[[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic]] and non-alcoholic, [[Umami|savoury]] foods, [[toothpaste]], [[mouthwash]] and [[condiment]]s such as [[ketchup]] and [[mayonnaise]].

== Safety ==

NHDC safety has been extensively tested, and all studies have confirmed it &lt;ref&gt;''[[Fennema's Food Chemistry]]'', 4th Edition, '''722'''.&lt;/ref&gt;. Safety studies have indicated that NHDC is neither toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic &lt;ref&gt;''[[Food Additive User's Handbook]]'', J. Smith, 1st Edition, '''70'''.&lt;/ref&gt;. As other flavonoids, NHDC is easily metabolized by intestinal microbiota to innocuous products &lt;ref&gt;''[[EFSA Flavouring Group Evaluation 32 Scientific Opinion]]'', EFSA Journal 2010; 8(9):1065&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">In [[economics]], the '''new international division of labor''' ('''NIDL''') is an outcome of [[globalization]]. The term was coined by theorists seeking to explain the spatial shift of [[manufacturing]] industries from [[Developed country|advanced capitalist countries]] to [[Developing country|developing countries]]—an ongoing geographic reorganization of [[Production (economics)|production]], which finds its origins in ideas about a global [[division of labor]].&lt;ref name="EncylG"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/geography/n814.xml | title=Encyclopedia of Geography | publisher=Sage Pubs | author=Warf, Barney (ed.) | article=New International Division of Labor | year=2010 | isbn=978-1412956970}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a spatial division of labor which occurs when the process of production is no longer confined to national [[Economy|economies]]. Under the "old" international division of labor, until around 1970, [[underdevelopment|underdeveloped areas]] were incorporated into the [[world economy]] principally as suppliers of minerals and agricultural commodities. However, as developing economies are merged into the world economy, more production takes place in these economies.&lt;ref name="EncylG"/&gt;
 
This has led to a trend of transference, or what is also known as the "global industrial shift", in which production processes are relocated from developed countries (such as the [[United States|US]], [[Europe|European]] countries, and [[Japan]]) to developing countries in [[Asia]] (such as [[China]], [[Vietnam]], and [[India]]) and [[Latin America]]. This is because companies search for the cheapest locations to manufacture and assemble components, so low-cost labor-intensive parts of the manufacturing process are shifted to the developing world where costs are substantially lower. Companies do so by taking advantage of transportation and [[Information and communications technology|communications technology]], as well as fragmentation and locational flexibility of production. From 1953 to the late 1990s, the industrialized economies' share of world manufacturing output declined from 95% to 77%, and the developing economies' share more than quadrupled from 5% to 23%.&lt;ref&gt;UNIDO (1986) ''World industry: a statistical review,'' 1985, Industry and Development, 18: Fig. 1; UNIDO database&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Average GDP PPP per capita 2010.svg|thumb|right|350px|World map showing countries above and below the median 2010 GDP (PPP) per capita, [[US$]]10,700. Source: IMF (International Monetary Fund).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#138ae1"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt; above world GDP (PPP) per capita&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff8204"&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt; below world GDP (PPP) per capita]]

The resultant division of labor across continents closely follows the [[North–South divide|North–South socio-economic and political divide]], where in the North—with one quarter of the world population—controls four fifths of the world income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mimiko|first=Oluwafemi|title=Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business|year=2012|publisher=Carolina Academic|location=Durham, N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the South—with three quarters of the world population—has access to one fifth of the world income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steger|first=Manfred|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;A summary&lt;/big&gt;''' 

The NIDL is a spatial division of labor due to cut ties with national economies. Underdeveloped economies used to be incorporated with the world economy as suppliers of minerals and agricultural commodities. It has since added more production to these types of economies. With this, a "global industrial shift" occurs, meaning that production processes are relocated from developed countries to developing countries. Companies need a low cost location in order to manufacture and assemble products. Developing countries are able to produce at substantially lower prices than a developed country would. 

In the NIDL, the north controls about 4/5 of the world's income while the south controls about 1/5.

'''Pi Sigma Alpha''' ('''ΠΣΑ''' or '''PSA'''), the National Political Science Honor Society, is the only [[honor society]] for college and university students of [[political science]] in the United States. Its purpose is to recognize and promote high academic achievement in the field of political science. It is a member of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]] (ACHS) and adheres to all the standards set by ACHS for an upper-division, specialized honor society. Pi Sigma Alpha is not a social [[fraternity]] or club.

==Chapters==
The first chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha was founded in 1920 at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the society has grown over the years to over 700 [[chapters]] (as of 2012). A local chapter may be established at any college or university granting the [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] or higher degrees, which is [[accredited]] by a regional or national [[educational accreditation|accrediting association]], and which offers a major sequence of courses in political science through an appropriate administrative department, school, or division of the institution, and which conforms to other requirements established by the Executive Council of the society. Chapters are guided by faculty advisors and by student officers.

==Membership==
There are three classes of membership in Pi Sigma Alpha: [[student]], [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], and honorary. Student membership is open to juniors, seniors and [[graduate students]] currently enrolled in institutions where the chapters are located, who meet the following qualifications:
*For undergraduates, completion of ten semester-credits or fifteen quarter-credits in political science, including at least one upper-division course, with an average grade of B or higher in all political science courses, and an overall [[GPA]] placing the student in the top one-third of his or her class. Individual chapters may raise the eligibility threshold; they may not lower it.
*For graduate students, completion of nine graduate credits in political science with no grade lower than a B in those courses.
Faculty in political science departments where chapters are located are automatically eligible for membership in the honor society. Honorary membership is intended for persons of recognized ability and achievement in the field of political science. No more than two such honorary members may be elected by a local chapter in any one year. 
Election to membership may be based solely on stated criteria and is irrespective of membership in an affiliation with any other organization or group. Chapters may not discriminate on any basis prohibited by law. Membership, once conferred, is for life.

The lifetime national membership fee is $35.00. Individual chapters often collect additional money from each initiate to use for their own chapter programs. The initiation fee is the only payment members ever make to the national office of the honor society. There are no annual dues.

==Governance==
Pi Sigma Alpha is governed by an elected Executive Council, which acts as its board of directors. The Council includes the President, the President-elect, the three most recent past presidents, the Executive Director, the Newsletter Editor, the General Counsel, and twelve other members at large. Six of these are elected every two years to serve four-year terms. Members of the Council are almost always faculty of recognized distinction in the field of political science, or of proven leadership to the honor society. Elections take place in even numbered years at the Biennial Business Meeting of the honor society. The daily business of Pi Sigma Alpha is conducted by the National Office staff.

==Programs==
Pi Sigma Alpha has programs to benefit its student members and their chapters, and the profession of political science. Programs for chapters and members include an annual Chapter Activity Grants competition, Best Undergraduate Student Paper and Best Undergraduate Honors [[Thesis]] awards, Scholarships for Graduate Study in Political Science, Scholarship for [[Washington, DC|Washington]] Internships, Best Chapter awards, and Chapter Advisor Recognition awards. For the profession of political science, Pi Sigma Alpha sponsors major speakers at the annual meetings of the [[American Political Science Association|American Political Science Association (APSA)]] and the several regional and state political science associations, and provides Best Paper awards for the APSA Annual Meeting and the regional political science association annual meetings. It also co-sponsors APSA's annual awards for teachers of political science in [[higher education]].

==Publications==
Pi Sigma Alpha publishes ''Pi Sigma Alpha Newsletter'' and ''Pi Sigma Alpha Undergraduate Journal of Politics'', both twice per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Pressure politics''' generally refers to political action which relies heavily on the use of mass media and mass communications to persuade politicians that the public wants or demands a particular action. However, it commonly includes intimidation, threats, and other  covert techniques as well.

The use of pressure, intimidation and manipulation  has existed for millennia. However, its origins are most commonly associated with the [[temperance movement]] in the late 19th century and first two decades of the 20th century.  Discovering the power of utilizing the mass media to exert pressure on politicians is usually attributed to [[Wayne Wheeler]], the ''de facto'' leader of the [[Anti-Saloon League]].  Under his mentorship, a number of skilled  practitioners of pressure politics emerged within the league (Odegard, 1928). One of the most accomplished of these was [[William E. Johnson]], better known as "Pussyfoot" Johnson.

One leader of the league testified that prior to its passage in Congress, he had compiled a list of 13,000 business people who supported prohibition. They were then given their instructions at the crucial time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''We blocked the telegraph wires in Congress for three days. One of our friends sent seventy- five telegrams, each signed differently with the name of one his subordinates. The campaign was successful. Congress surrendered. The first to bear the white flag was Senator Warren Harding of Ohio. He told us frankly he was opposed to the amendment, but since it was apparent from the telegrams that the business world was demanding it, he would submerge his own opinion and vote for submission''. (Pollard, 1932, p. 107).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The league was so powerful that even national politicians feared its strength. The Eighteenth Amendment creating Prohibition might well not have passed if a secret ballot had made it impossible for the league to have punished the "disobedient" at the next election (Sinclair, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;110).

The Anti-Saloon League did not believe its actions to be immoral. To the contrary,  its activities to  bring about Prohibition were viewed as moral and justified because it believed it was working to bring about  God's will (Asbury, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–102).

==Experience==
Egan is a member of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association and Association of Military Court Advocates and Justice.&lt;ref name="TuckersSolicitors02"/&gt; He has gathered local attention in [[London]] for his aggressive defense style and was one of those who contended that solicitor advocates should be entitled to wear the same wig and gown in court as [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref name="DailyMail01"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2844868/How-army-meaning-meddlers-drove-troubled-mother-kill-three-children-Court-papers-reveal-unbearable-pressure-Tania-Clarence.html|title=Richard Egan, reading from a statement outside the Old Bailey |date=20 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable cases===
Egan's work has included acting for:
* [[Lotfi Raissi]], Algerian pilot who allegedly instructed four of the hijackers who crashed the plane into the Pentagon on [[September 11]]. The prosecution case was that Raissi qualified in the [[United States]] as a pilot in 1997, attending the same Arizona flight school as four of the hijackers involved in the attacks September 11.&lt;ref name="Telegraph01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Logica pair plead guilty to insider dealing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1363691/Arab-pilot-seeks-bail-as-FBI-asks-for-time.html| accessdate=20 August 2017 |publisher=Telegraph|date=20 August 2017|ref=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raissi was acquitted after trial.&lt;ref name="theguardian03"&gt;{{cite news|title='Hound of Hounslow' trader Navinder Singh Sarao hires legal experts ahead of US extradition fight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/22/lotfi-raissi-algerian-pilot-case| accessdate=20 August 2017 |date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Border Guard Service (SBS)''' ([[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]: Döwlet Serhet Gullugy, DSG; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Государственная пограничная служба, ГПС) also commonly known by its paramilitary force as the '''Turkmen Border Troops''' ([[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]: Türkmenistan Serhet Garawul; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Туркменские пограничные войска) is a [[border guard]] agency of the [[Armed Forces of Turkmenistan]]. It is currently a Public Service department of the government of the country and is under the command of the National Security Committee of Turkmenistan.

==History==
The service was established on August 11, 1992 by order of President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], on the basis of the [[Soviet Border Troops]] in the [[Turkestan Military District]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turkmeninform.com/ru/news/20090811/01349.html&lt;/ref&gt; It cooperated with [[Russian border guards]] who remained in country until 1999 as a result of a joint [[Russia]]n-[[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] agreement on the protection of the state border of [[Turkmenistan]], which was signed in 1993. It slowly evolved to meet the standards of its counterparts, with the DSG being allowed to inspect goods and other items transported across the border of [[Turkmenistan]] in April 1998. At the end of 2001, 3 new border detachments were created, with 2 (in [[Serhetabat|Kushka]] and [[Köýtendag]]), being intensified the cover of the [[Afghan]] border to prevent [[Taliban]] fighters from taking refuge in the country during the [[War in Afghanistan]]. Recently, the service created a separate naval border patrol division stationed in [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121114025436/http://www.agentura.ru/press/about/jointprojects/greatgame/pogranturkmen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The main tasks of the service include the following:

* Protecting of the national border of the country 
* Combating [[international terrorism]] and [[drug trafficking]]
* Targeting illegal migration and [[human trafficking]] 
* Protecting oil and gas platforms and pipelines in the Turkmen sector of the [[Caspian Sea]].

The head of the service is a member of the Council of Border Guard Commanders of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150518065340/http://www.skpw.ru/History_skpw.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syrian Revolution General Commission (SRGC)''' ({{lang-ar|الهيئة العامة للثورة السورية}}) is a Syrian coalition of 40 Syrian opposition groups to unite their efforts during the [[Syrian civil war]] that was announced on 19 August 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Syrian coalition against Assad formed|publisher=AFP / Dawn.com |date=19 August 2011|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/08/19/syrian-coalition-against-assad-formed-statement.html|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an initial statement, the long-term aim of the coalition is to build "a democratic and civil state of institutions that grants freedom, equality, dignity and respect of human rights to all citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Syrian opposition to launch ‘national council’|publisher=AFP / Lahore Times|date=20 August 2011|url=http://www.lhrtimes.com/syrian-opposition-to-launch-national-council.html|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010000438/http://www.lhrtimes.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 October 2017|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Syria dissidents eye unity in Istanbul|publisher=Hürriyet Daily News |date=19 August 2011|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=syria-dissidents-eye-unity-in-istanbul-2011-08-19|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been described as having an "aggressive platform" for the removal of president [[Bashar al-Assad]], of "actively supporting armed rebels through provincial military councils", and of refusing to cooperate with the [[Syrian National Council]] (SNC) -- unlike the two other Syrian opposition groups the [[Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution]] (SCSR), and the [[Local Coordination Committees]] (LCCs).   It reportedly refuses to cooperate with the SNC (the umbrella opposition group operating in exile),  "due to disillusionment with the SNC's endless internal power squabbles".&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/06/29/disorganized_like_a_fox Disorganized Like a Fox]| BY ELIZABETH O'BAGY | foreignpolicy.com| JUNE 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5018">The '''term''' of a [[patent]] is the maximum period during which it can be maintained in force. It is usually expressed in a number of years either starting from the filing date of the [[patent application]] or from the date of grant of the patent. In most [[patent law]]s, renewal annuities or [[maintenance fee (patent)|maintenance fee]]s have to be regularly paid in order to keep the patent in force. Otherwise the patent lapses before its term.

The term of a patent or specific "[[claim (patent)|claims]]" in a patent may also be curtailed by judgment of a court, as where a claim or patent is held "invalid" under the relevant law, and thus no longer enforceable.

Significant international harmonization of patent term across national laws was provided in the 1990s by the implementation of the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs Agreement). Article 33 of the TRIPs Agreement provides that
:"The term of protection available [for patents] shall not end before the expiration of a period of twenty years counted from the filing date."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Standards concerning the availability, scope and use of Intellectual Property Rights | url = http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, in most patent laws nowadays, the term of patent is 20 years from the filing date of the application. This however does not forbid the states party to the WTO from providing, in their national law, other type of patent-like rights with shorter terms. [[Utility model]]s are an example of such rights. Their term is usually 6 or 10 years.

== Jurisdiction ==

=== Europe ===
The [[European Patent Convention]] requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a term of 20 years from the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the actual date of filing an international application under the PCT designating the EPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual date of filing can be up to a year after the earliest [[Priority right|priority date]]. The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states this is by means of a [[supplementary protection certificate]].

=== United States ===
{{main|Term of patent in the United States}}

In the United States, for utility patents filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of the patent is 20 years from the earliest filing date of the application on which the patent was granted and any prior U.S. or [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT) applications from which the patent claims priority (excluding provisional applications). For patents filed prior to June 8, 1995, the term of patent is either 20 years from the earliest filing date as above or 17 years from the issue date, whichever is longer. Extensions may be had for certain administrative delays.

The patent term will additionally be adjusted to compensate for delays in the issuance of a patent.  The reasons for extensions include:

* Delayed response to an application request for patent.
* Exceeding 3 years to consider a patent application.
* Delays due to a secrecy order or appeal.

Because of significant backlog of pending applications at the USPTO, the majority of newly issued patents receive some adjustment that extends the term for a period longer than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intellectualpats.com/how-long-do-patents-last-and-can-they-be-extended/|title=How Long Do Patents Last and Can They Be Extended?|publisher=Intellectual Pats|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=May 2015}}

For [[design patents]] (patents based on decorative, non-functional features), for design applications filed on or after May 13, 2015 the term is 15 years from the issue date. For design applications filed before May 13, 2015, the term is 14 years from the issue date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1505.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' ('''TRC''') was a court-like [[restorative justice]]&lt;ref&gt;Suffolk University, College of Arts &amp; Sciences, Center for Restorative Justice, http://www.suffolk.edu/college/centers/15970.php What is Restorative Justice?&lt;/ref&gt; body assembled in [[South Africa]] after the end of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;Though it is a common claim that the TRC was a restorative justice body, it has been argued that the connection between the TRC and restorative justice is not as straightforward and unproblematic as often assumed. See b C.B.N. Restorative Justice and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Process, ''South African Journal of Philosophy'' 32(1), 10-35 [http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/53264449/Restorative_Justice_and_the_South_African_Truth_and_Reconciliation_Process.pdf, (click to read)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Witnesses who were identified as victims of gross human rights violations were invited to give statements about their experiences, and some were selected for public hearings. Perpetrators of violence could also give testimony and request [[amnesty]] from both civil and criminal prosecution.

The TRC, the first of the 1003 held internationally to stage public hearings, was seen by many as a crucial component of the [[Transitional justice|transition]] to full and free [[democracy]] in South Africa. Despite some flaws, it is generally (although not universally) thought to have been successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/truth-telling-identities-and-power-south-africa-and-guatemala "Truth Telling, Identities, and Power in South Africa and Guatemala"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute for Justice and Reconciliation]] was established in 2000 as the successor organisation of the TRC.

{{Apartheid}}

==Creation and mandate==
The TRC was set up in terms of the ''Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act'', No. 34 of 1995, and was based in [[Cape Town]]. The hearings started in 1996. The mandate of the commission was to bear witness to, record, and in some cases grant amnesty to the perpetrators of crimes relating to human rights violations, as well as offering reparation and rehabilitation to the victims. A register of reconciliation was also established so that ordinary South Africans who wished to express regret for past failures could also express their remorse.&lt;ref name="Sarkin-Hughes2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Sarkin-Hughes|title=Carrots and Sticks: The TRC and the South African Amnesty Process|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xc_3qbj7lD0C&amp;pg=PA219|year=2004|publisher=Intersentia nv|isbn=978-90-5095-400-6|pages=219–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRC had a number of high-profile members, including Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] (chairman), [[Alex Boraine]] (deputy chairman), [[Sisi Khampepe]], [[Wynand Malan]], and [[Emma Mashinini]].

==Committees==
The work of the TRC was accomplished through three committees:
* The Human Rights Violations Committee investigated human rights abuses that occurred between 1960 and 1994.
* The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee was charged with restoring victims' dignity and formulating proposals to assist with rehabilitation.
* The Amnesty Committee considered applications from individuals who applied for amnesty in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

== Process ==
Public hearings of the Human Rights Violations Committee and the Amnesty Committee were held at many venues around South Africa, including [[Cape Town]] (at the [[University of the Western Cape]]), [[Johannesburg]] (at the Central Methodist Mission), and [[Randburg]] (at the Rhema Bible Church).

The commission was empowered to grant [[amnesty]] to those who committed abuses during the apartheid era, as long as the crimes were politically motivated, proportionate, and there was full disclosure by the person seeking amnesty. To avoid [[victor's justice]], no side was exempt from appearing before the commission. The commission heard reports of human rights violations and considered amnesty applications from all sides, from the apartheid state to the liberation forces, including the [[African National Congress]].

=== Numbers ===
A total of 5,392 amnesty applications were refused, granting only 849 out of the 7,112 (which includes the number of additional categories, such as "withdrawn").&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice and Constitutional Development of the Republic of South Africa, The Truth and Reconciliation Official Website, [http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/amntrans/index.htm Justice.gov.za] Accessed 2 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance and impact==
The TRC's emphasis on [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]] was in sharp contrast to the approach taken by the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and other [[de-Nazification]] measures. The reconciliatory approach was seen as a successful way of dealing with human-rights violations after political change, either from internal or external factors.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Consequently, other countries have instituted similar commissions, though not always with the same scope or the allowance for charging those currently in power.

There are varying opinions as to whether the [[restorative justice]] method (as employed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission) is more or less effective than the [[retributive justice]] method (which was used during the Nuremberg Trials). In one survey study,&lt;ref name="vora" /&gt; the effectiveness of the TRC Commission was measured on a variety of levels: 
* Its usefulness in terms of confirming what had happened during the apartheid regime ("bringing out the truth") 
* The feelings of reconciliation that could be linked to the Commission
* The positive effects (both domestically and internationally) that the Commission brought about (i.e. in the political and the economic environment of South Africa). 
In the study by Orlando Lentini, the opinions of three ethnic groups were measured in this study: the [[British diaspora in Africa|British Africans]], the [[Afrikaner]]s, and the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]].&lt;ref name="vora"&gt;Vora, Jay A. and Erika Vora. 2004. "The Effectiveness of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Perceptions of Xhosa, Afrikaner, and English South Africans." ''Journal of Black Studies'' 34.3: 301-322.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers, all of the participants perceived the TRC to be effective in bringing out the truth, but to varying degrees, depending on the group in question.

The differences in opinions about the effectiveness can be attributed to how each group viewed the proceedings. Some viewed them as not entirely accurate, as many people would lie in order to keep themselves out of trouble while receiving amnesty for their crimes. (The Commission would grant amnesty to some with consideration given to the weight of the crimes committed.)  Some said that the proceedings only helped to remind them of the horrors that had taken place in the past when they had been working to forget such things. Thus, the TRC's effectiveness in terms of achieving those very things within its title is still debatable.&lt;ref name="vora" /&gt;

==Media coverage==
The hearings were initially set to be heard ''[[in camera]]'', but the intervention of 23 non-governmental organisations eventually succeeded in gaining media access to the hearings. On 15 April 1996, the South African National Broadcaster televised the first two hours of the first human rights violation committee hearing live. With funding from the [[Norway|Norwegian]] government, radio continued to broadcast live throughout. Additional high-profile hearings, such as [[Winnie Madikizela-Mandela|Winnie Mandela]]'s testimony, were also televised live.

The rest of the hearings were presented on television each Sunday, from April 1996 to June 1998, in hour-long episodes of the "[[Truth Commission Special Report]]". The program was presented by progressive Afrikaner journalist [[Max du Preez]], former editor of the [[Vrye Weekblad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/98-4NRwint98/Thloloe.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908021835/http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/98-4NRwint98/Thloloe.html |date=8 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the program included Anneliese Burgess, [[Jann Turner]], Benedict Motau, Gael Reagon, Rene Schiebe and Bronwyn Nicholson, a production assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jannturner.co.za/films.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726044915/http://www.jannturner.co.za/films.php |date=26 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the arts and popular culture ==

=== Film ===
Various films have been made about the commission:

==Criticisms==
A 1998 study by South Africa's Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation &amp; the Khulumani Support Group,&lt;ref name=csvr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papkhul.htm|title=Survivors' Perceptions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Suggestions for the Final Report|publisher=Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation|accessdate=2006-12-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925181412/http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papkhul.htm |archivedate = 25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khulumani.net/home.html |title=Home &amp;#124; South, Pdf, Litigation, Apartheid, Khulum |publisher=Khulumani |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080521103450/http://www.khulumani.net/home.html| archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which surveyed several hundred victims of human rights abuse during the Apartheid era, found that most felt that the TRC had failed to achieve reconciliation between the black and white communities.  Most believed that justice was a prerequisite for reconciliation rather than an alternative to it, and that the TRC had been weighted in favour of the perpetrators of abuse.&lt;ref name=storey&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As [[William Kentridge]], director of ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'', put it, "A full confession can bring [[amnesty]] and immunity from prosecution or civil procedures for the crimes committed.  Therein lies the central irony of the Commission.  As people give more and more evidence of the things they have done they get closer and closer to amnesty and it gets more and more intolerable that these people should be given amnesty." (Kentridge 2007, p. viii)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the TRC's shortcomings and the unaddressed injuries of many victims, victims' groups, together with NGOs and lawyers, took various TRC-related matters to South African and US courts in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies of Truth: law, memory and emancipation in post-apartheid South Africa|last = Kesselring|first = Rita|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2017|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dilemma facing the TRC was how to do justice to the testimonials of those witnesses for whom translation was necessary.  It was believed that, with the great discrepancy between the emotions of the witnesses and those translating them, much of the impact was lost in interlingual rendition.  A briefly tried solution was to have the translators mimic the witnesses' emotions, but this proved disastrous and was quickly scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;Kentridge 2007, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

While former president [[F.W. de Klerk]] appeared before the commission and reiterated his apology for the suffering caused by apartheid, many black South Africans were angered at amnesty being granted for human rights abuses committed by the apartheid government.  The BBC described such criticisms as stemming from a "basic misunderstanding" about the TRC's mandate,&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg |last=Barrow|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/truth_and_reconciliation/142673.stm|title=South Africans reconciled? Special Report|date=30 October 1998|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was to uncover the truth about past abuse, using amnesty as a mechanism, rather than to punish past crimes. Critics of the TRC dispute this, saying that their position is not a misunderstanding but a rejection of the TRC's mandate.

Among the highest-profile of these objections were the criticisms levelled by the family of prominent anti-apartheid activist [[Steve Biko]], who was killed by the security police, and whose story was featured in the film ''[[Cry Freedom]]''.&lt;ref name=biko&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahistory.org.za/pages/people/biko,s.htm |title=Stephen Bantu Biko |publisher=South African History Online |accessdate=2006-12-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924120312/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/biko%2Cs.htm |archivedate=24 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biko's family described the TRC as a "vehicle for political expediency", which "robbed" them of their right to justice.&lt;ref name=Biko&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970911/ai_n14132136|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110010302/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970911/ai_n14132136|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-11-10|title=Apartheid enforcer sticks to 'farcical' story on Biko killing|publisher=Findarticles.com|accessdate=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family opposed amnesty for his killers on these grounds and brought a legal action in South Africa's highest court, arguing that the TRC was unconstitutional.

On the other side of the spectrum, former apartheid [[State President of South Africa|State President]] [[P.W. Botha]] defied a subpoena to appear before the commission, calling it a "circus".  His defiance resulted in a fine and suspended sentence, but these were overturned on appeal.&lt;ref name=pwbotha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/biography/a/BioPWBotha_3.htm|title=PW Botha - A Biography|first=Alistair|last=Boddy-Evans|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright Jane Taylor, responsible for the acclaimed ''[[Ubu and the Truth Commission]]'', found fault with the Commission's lopsided influence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The TRC is unquestionably a monumental process, the consequences of which will take years to unravel.  For all its pervasive weight, however, it infiltrates our culture asymmetrically, unevenly across multiple sectors. Its place in small rural communities, for example, when it establishes itself in a local church hall, and absorbs substantial numbers of the population, is very different from its situation in large urban centres, where its presence is marginalised by other social and economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2007, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''University Human Rights Centers''' are centers established at universities for the purpose of promoting [[human rights]] and [[social justice]] locally, nationally, and globally through education, fieldwork, and other efforts.

==Human Rights Center – University of California, Berkeley==

The Human Rights Center at [[UC Berkeley]] was established in 1994 as part of their [[UC Berkeley School of Law|School of Law]].  This center works to promote human rights and justice at a global level.  The faculty and staff of the HRC have collaborated with leading human rights organizations specializing in the promotion of justice and post-war reconstruction in countries that have been torn apart by war.&lt;ref name="UCB About"&gt;"Human Rights Center | About Us." About HRC. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www.law.berkeley.edu/HRCweb/about.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The HRC at Berkeley lists 3 core goals that guide its service:&lt;ref name="UCB About" /&gt;
# Pursue accountability for mass atrocities
# Ensure the needs of survivors are heard
# Strengthen the research and advocacy capacities of local and international human rights organizations

This HRC has devoted a number of its projects to [[war crime]]s, including [[genocide]].  Current projects include documentation of the exposure to violence and the forced conscription in northern Uganda.  They are also investigating the experiences of the former detainees who were held at the U.S. military installation at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] in Cuba.  Concerning health injustice, the HRC is investigating mental health problems in Albania as well as access to healthcare for workers in post-Katrina New Orleans.  In the Summer of 2010 the HRC announced the beginning of their Sexual Violence and Accountability Project where they will study the role that safe shelters play in both peacetime communities as well as communities displaced by conflict.&lt;ref&gt;"Human Rights Center | About Us." Projects. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www.law.berkeley.edu/HRCweb/projects.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HRC's current executive director Alexa Koenig holds a J.D. from the University of San Francisco School of Law, an M.A. from UC Berkeley, and is in the final stages of completing her Ph.D. in UC Berkeley’s Jurisprudence and Social Policy program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/14148.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426200755/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/14148.htm# |archive-date=2013-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HRC's former director (currently Faculty Director of the HRC), Dr. [[Eric Stover]], is known for his work in uncovering evidence to prosecute crimes against humanity and returning remains to the victim’s families in genocide cases.&lt;ref&gt;Nuwer, Rachel.

==Human Rights Center – University of Minnesota==

The Human Rights Center at the [[University of Minnesota]] was inaugurated in December 1988 on the fortieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  Their purpose is to assist [[human rights]] advocates, students, educators, and volunteers in promoting a culture of human rights on the local, national, and international level.&lt;ref&gt;"University of Minnesota Human Rights Center." About the Human Rights Center. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/center/aboutcenter.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On February 4, 2011 the HRC launched the Islamic Law and Human Rights Program.  This program will “engage in research, scholarship, and educational and practical activities on issues of Islamic law, human rights, rule of law, and terrorism.”&lt;ref&gt;"Launching Ceremony." Islamic Law and Human Rights Program. Human Rights Center University of Minnesota, n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/center/IHRP%20Flyer.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HRC maintains a website that gives updates on the International Women’s Rights Activist Watch and a K-12 Human Rights Education Initiative and Curriculum.

In 2010, the HRC initiated a Close the Gap initiative, which was a learning resource that focused on issues of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Social class|class]], and place disparities in the [[Twin Cities]] and Greater Minnesota.  The HRC hopes that these educational tools will help others to take action towards ending these inequalities.  Potential projects stemming from this initiative include students interviewing parents to dissolve barriers preventing parental involvement in schools and working with the Carpenters Union to introduce children to apprenticeships and technical education as an alternative to college.&lt;ref name="UM"&gt;"Human Rights Center." 2010 Annual Report. Human Rights Center University of Minnesota, n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011.&lt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/center/reports/2010%20HRC%20Annual%20Report.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of focus for the HRC in 2010 included but were not limited to fair trade, immigration and asylum, indigenous rights,  public health, torture, women’s rights, and wrongful convictions.&lt;ref name="UM" /&gt;

Weissbrodt, founder of the Human Rights Center, is notorious for his work on the Guantanamo detainee cases.  He organized law students through the HRC to help with work on legal research and briefing.  He argued that charges against Bahlul did not constitute war crimes under international law and that Guantanamo detainees are put at a disadvantage because they are not entitled to a defense counsel until they have already been charged.&lt;ref&gt;DIAZ, KEVIN. "Gitmo detainees get a Twin Cities defense - Military lawyers join other Minnesotans in defining how law treats terror suspects in wartime." Star Tribune: Newspaper of the Twin Cities (Minneapolis, MN) 22 Apr. 2011, METRO, NEWS: 01A. NewsBank. Web. 2 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duke Human Rights Center==

The Duke Human Rights Center is an organization of [[Duke University]] that is home to a variety of scholar initiatives. The DHRC “seeks to lead university-wide scholarly conversations, collaborations, and programs on human rights, bringing together the humanities and social sciences with public policy and law.”&lt;ref&gt;"About the Center | Duke Human Rights Center." About the Center. Duke University, n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011. &lt;http://humanrights.fhi.duke.edu/about-the-center&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

This center sees the history of the [[American South]], predominantly the role of slavery and segregation, as being integrally important to their practice and study of human rights.  In 2009, the university launched the Pauli Murray Project which is a program that makes use of human rights thinking and techniques to branch out in the Durham community, seeking reconciliation regarding past practices of segregation and slavery.&lt;ref name="humanrights.fhi.duke.edu"&gt;"Duke Human Rights Center." History of Human Rights at Duke University. Duke University, n.d. Web. 2 Dec 2011. &lt;http://humanrights.fhi.duke.edu/about-the-center/history&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2011, the DHRC announced that it would unveil a historic marker in honor of [[Pauli Murray]].  She was co-founder for the [[National Organization for Women]] and the country’s first black, female Episcopal priest.  The marker was placed near her childhood home in [[Durham, NC]].&lt;ref&gt;Wire Reports, Staff and. "Man is charged after 12 dogs suffocate." [[Greensboro News &amp; Record]] (NC) 21 Nov. 2011, News &amp; Record, General News: A4. NewsBank. Web. 3 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Pauli Murray Project is working to restore the Murray home and director of the project, Barbara Lau, urged audience members at the unveiling to donate to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;"Making a mark." Herald-Sun, The (Durham, NC) 21 Nov. 2011, Final, A: 1. NewsBank. Web. 3 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke is home to Genocide Convention author Rafael Lemkin and Dr. Peter Storey who co-chaired the Peace Accord structures that intervened in political violence which occurred before South Africa’s first democratic elections.&lt;ref name="humanrights.fhi.duke.edu"/&gt;

The DHRC commonly shows films pertaining to social justice that are kept in an archive for the university and shown free of charge.  In 2011, they offered a viewing of a series of documentaries exploring issues of immigration, refugee rights, the justice system, and the environment called “Rights! Camera! Action!”&lt;ref&gt;"Duke Human Rights Center." Good Times: Second Film in the Rights! Camera! Action! series. Duke University, n.d.

==Buffalo Human Rights Center==

The BHRC is a part of [[SUNY Buffalo School of Law|The State University of New York Buffalo Law School]].  The BHRC maintains goals that include the organization of internships with leading human rights organizations throughout the world.  They maintain relations with human rights organizations, universities, and government agencies.  In addition, they seek to gain attention for human rights topics in the Buffalo community by organizing speakers, conferences, and symposia with leading human rights speakers.  They hope “to garner greater exposure and community support for the recognition, promotion, and protection of international human rights.”&lt;ref&gt;"Buffalo Human Rights Center." . SUNY Buffalo Law School, n.d. Web. 3 Dec 2011. &lt;http://wings.buffalo.edu/law/BHRC/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the BHRC founded the Buffalo Journal of International Law, which was renamed in 1997 as the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review. The BHRLR “seeks to unite professionals, students, legal practitioners, policymakers, advocates, and cross-disciplinary scholars, and to encourage thereby the development and practical application of human rights law.”&lt;ref&gt;"Buffalo Human Rights Law Review." . SUNY Buffalo Law School, n.d. Web. 3 Dec 2011. &lt;http://wings.buffalo.edu/law/BHRC/bhrlr.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BHRC organized a speaker series called The Comparative Human Rights and Practice series in the spring of 2010.  This series included talks about justice in Sierra Leone, international politics of civilian protection, sex trafficking in the United States, indigenous rights in the Americas, and refugee and asylum law.  The events were free and open to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Buffalo Human Rights Center." Videos. SUNY Buffalo Law School, n.d.

The Global Campus integrates the educational activities of the Regional Programmes through the exchange of lecturers, researchers and students; the joint planning of curricula for on-campus and online courses; the promotion of global research projects and dissemination activities; the professional development of graduates through internships in inter-governmental organisations; and the strong focus of networking through the Global Campus Alumni Association, as well as support to the alumni associations of the Regional Programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/bicet/docs/brochure|title=Global Campus Brochure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Human Rights – University of Pretoria==

The Centre for Human Rights at the [[University of Pretoria]] is an academic department and NGO in South Africa that was established in 1986 as part of domestic efforts against the apartheid system.  Their focus has now extended beyond the borders of [[South Africa]] and they currently work towards human rights for the entire continent of [[Africa]].  They hope to improve the education of human rights in Africa while increasing awareness and the number of publications about human rights in Africa.  They also aim to improve women’s rights, people affected by [[HIV]], [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]  peoples, sexual minorities, and others who are disadvantaged in some way.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Centre for Human Rights." Centre for Human Rights University of Pretoria. N.p., n.d. Web. 3 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www.chr.up.ac.za/index.php/about.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre played a crucial role in drafting the Model Law of HIV in South Africa, which was adopted in November by the SADC Parliamentary Forum.  Other important research by the Centre included access to medicines and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights adopted this resolution.  The Geneva Institute for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law awarded a competitive research assignment to the Centre’s work on the Gender Unit.&lt;ref&gt;"Centre for Human Rights: Research and Advocacy." . Centre for Human Rights University of Pretoria, n.d. Web. 3 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www.chr.up.ac.za/index.php/research.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre partnered with other organizations in launching the [[Redlight Children Campaign]].  This campaign worked to combat human trafficking and the exploitation and abuse of women and children.  The centre also held a West and Central Africa Consultation on the African Charter on Democracy alongside other organizations.  Discussions were held regarding unconstitutional changes of government, safeguarding the integrity of electoral processes, ending corruption, and aiding in development.  The Centre also held a panel discussion in October regarding maternal health concerning the quadrupling of the maternal mortality rate in the past decade as well as related issues and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;"Centre for Human Rights News and Events." . Centre for Human Rights University of Pretoria, n.d. Web. 3 Dec 2011. &lt;http://www.chr.up.ac.za/index.php/centre-news.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Rights Centre - University of Padua==

The Human Rights Centre of the [[University of Padua]] was one of the first to be established in Europe and its activities focus on the development of interdisciplinary knowledge of human rights and on their promotion, particularly through education and research.

It was founded in 1982 on an initiative of the Faculty of Political Science, as ‘Study and Training Centre on the Rights of the Person and of the Peoples’. In 2011, it became the ‘Interdepartmental Centre on human rights and the rights of Peoples’ and finally in 2013 it was transformed into University Human Rights Centre (Centro di Ateneo). 
In carrying out its activities, the Centre cooperates with regional ombudspersons and other human rights institutions, local authorities, schools and NGOs. The Centre is also responsible for managing the regional Archive ‘Peace Human Rights’, one of the main instruments through which the Region of Veneto promotes the culture of human rights, peace, cooperation to development and solidarity.

The Human Rights Centre is also active at the international level. Besides hosting one of the [[UNESCO Chairs]] on “Human Rights, Democracy and Peace” and the European Jean Monnet Excellence Centre, it also cooperates in different ways with the Council of Europe, the European Union, the UN OHCHR, the Multinational CiMic Group, the Anna Lindh Foundation and many others. Moreover, it contributed to the establishment of the European Master in Human Rights and Democratisation (E.MA).

Among its several publications, since 2011, the Human Rights Centre of the University of Padua has been publishing, both in Italian and in English, the Italian Yearbook of Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;Italian Yearbook of Human Rights &lt;http://unipd-centrodirittiumani.it/en/attivita/Italian-Yearbook-of-Human-Rights/637&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Annuario italiano dei diritti umani), a periodical account of how the international human rights monitoring system assesses Italy's behaviour, which aims at fostering an informed and transparent debate on this fundamental feature of public life.

Since 2013, the Centre has been supporting a new MA Degree Programme in Human Rights and Multi-level Governance,&lt;ref&gt;MA Degree Programme in Human Rights and Multi-level Governance &lt;http://www.unipd.it/en/courses/second-cycle-degrees&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; taught in English, which is supervised by the Department of Political Science, Law and International Studies, part of the School of Economics and Political Science of the University of Padua.

[[File:VertiCrop.jpg|thumb|Lettuce grown in indoor vertical farming system]]

'''Vertical farming''' is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and [[controlled-environment agriculture]] (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases...) and [[fertigation]]. Some vertical farms use techniques similar to [[greenhouse]]s, where natural [[sunlight]] can be augmented with artificial [[lighting]] and [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]].&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974"&gt;Hix, John. 1974.

Hydroponic systems can be lit by LEDs that mimic sunlight. Software can ensure that all the plants get the same amount of light, water and nutrients. Proper managements means that no herbicides or pesticides are required.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/|title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world|last=Marks|first=Paul|date=15 January 2014|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The term "vertical farming" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book ''Vertical Farming''. His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about [[farming]] with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as "vertical" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924000349328 |title=Vertical farming (1915) |publisher=E. I. duPont de Nemours Powder Co. |location=Wilmington, Del.  |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern usage of the term "vertical farming" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistory skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.

===Mixed-use skyscrapers===
Mixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect [[Ken Yeang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecture.org.au/news/enews/354-ken-yeang-and-bioclimatic-architecture|title=Ken Yeang and Bioclimatic Architecture|website=www.architecture.org.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.

===Despommier's skyscrapers===
Ecologist [[Dickson Despommier]] argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less [[embodied energy]] and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production, despite the ecological and environmental costs of extracting materials to build skyscrapers for the simple purpose of agricultural production.{{citation needed|reason=the 2nd part of the sentence sounds like a reader's inserted opinion, not Despommier's|date=February 2016}}

Despommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at [[Columbia University]]. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15farm.html |title=Country, the City Version: Farms in the Sky Gain New Interest  |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date= 2008-07-15|accessdate=2011-01-05 |first=Bina |last=Venkataraman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackable shipping containers===
Several companies have developed stacking recycled [[Intermodal_container|shipping containers]] in urban settings. Brighterside Consulting created a complete off-grid container system. [[Freight Farms]] produces a "leafy green machine" that is a complete [[farm-to-table]] system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, [[LED]] lighting and intuitive climate controls built within a 12&amp;nbsp;m &amp;times; 2.4&amp;nbsp;m shipping container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-PUIXUPgw|title=2015 Leafy Green Machine by Freight Farms|first=|last=Freight Farms|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked "growpods".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zWommg6JVfY|title=PodPonics Info Video 3d Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar farm is under construction in Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=r-Iymp-gdbo|title=PodPonics Oman Video Blog Part 1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=PrLTuGKcvPA|title=Oman Video Blog Part 2: Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; TerraFarms offer a proprietary&lt;ref name="localrootsfarms-how-we-farm-tech"&gt;{{cite web

Controlling light governs the growth cycle of the plant. E.g., infrared LEDs can mimic 5 minutes of sunset, stimulating some plants to begin flowering.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-science-2017-12-local-roots-farm-in-a-box"/&gt;

==Technology==
Lighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28 per cent efficient, which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. However, lighting engineers at [[Philips]] have demonstrated LEDs with 68 per cent efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.

==History==
One of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.ctbuh.org/PDF_Previews/Journal/CTBUHJournal_2009-2.pdf Nakheel Harbor and Tower] &lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Delirious New York''.  Koolhaas wrote that this 1909 theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas2014"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=163oAwAAQBAJ}}|title=Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan|last=Koolhaas|first=Rem|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=978-1-58093-410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed.&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974" /&gt; The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of [[greenhouse]] and [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] technology. Early [[Hydroponicum|hydroponicums]] integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These [[horticultural building system]]s evolved from greenhouse technology.  The British Interplanetary Society developed a [[hydroponicum]] for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The first Tower Hydroponic Units were developed in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Hydroponics problems|url=http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811024138/http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' ''[[Hydroponics]]: The Bengal System,'' first published in 1951 with data from the then-[[East Pakistan]], today's [[Bangladesh]], and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf|title=link|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf Hydroponics The Bengal System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sholto Douglas 1975"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=obVOSgAACAAJ}}|title=Hydroponics: The Bengal System|last1=Douglas|first1=James Sholto|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195605662|edition=5th|location=New Dehli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Ken Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.

=== Vertical farm ===
[[Dickson Despommier]] is a professor of [[environmental health]] sciences and [[microbiology]]. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste.

Although many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21154137/|title=Could vertical farming be the future?

Despommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of [[Manhattan]] (about 2,000,000 people) using only {{convert|13|acre|ha|order=flip|0}} of [[rooftop gardens]]. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only two percent of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function:

{{quote|Each floor will have its own watering and nutrient monitoring systems. There will be sensors for every single plant that tracks how much and what kinds of nutrients the plant has absorbed. You'll even have systems to monitor plant diseases by employing DNA chip technologies that detect the presence of plant pathogens by simply sampling the air and using snippets from various viral and bacterial infections. It's very easy to do.

Moreover, a gas [[chromatograph]] will tell us when to pick the plant by analyzing which [[Flavonoid|flavenoids]] the produce contains. These flavonoids are what gives the food the flavors you're so fond of, particularly for more aromatic produce like tomatoes and peppers. These are all right-off-the-shelf technologies. The ability to construct a vertical farm exists now. We don't have to make anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Arnie Cooper |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/science_environment/farming-in-high-rises-raises-hopes-1226 |title=Going up?

==Problems==

===Economics===
Opponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Clifton says: |url=http://e4capital.com/2009/08/24/vertical-farming/ |title=Vertical Farming: Too Far Outside the Box? &amp;#124; |publisher=E4capital.com |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic and environmental benefits rest partly on the concept of minimizing [[food miles]], the distance that food travels from farm to consumer.{{original research inline|date=September 2011}} However, a recent analysis suggests that transportation is only a minor contributor to the economic and environmental costs of supplying food to urban populations. The analysis concluded that "food miles are, at best, a marketing fad."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. (July 22, 2009). Local food no green panacea: professor. CBC News http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/07/22/consumer-local-food.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the facility would have to lower costs or charge higher prices to justify remaining in a city.

Similarly, if power needs are met by fossil fuels, the environmental effect may be a net loss;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627?story_id=17647627&amp;fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=Does it really stack up? | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; even building low-carbon capacity to power the farms may not make as much sense as simply leaving traditional farms in place, while burning less coal.

The initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |title=Starting a Commercial Greenhouse Business |publisher=Omafra.gov.on.ca |date=2003-07-28 |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024230113/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |archivedate=2005-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Office [[occupancy cost]]s can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[Dubai]], [[Milan]], [[Zurich]], and [[Sao Paulo]] ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket World in Figures, [[The Economist]], 2011 ed. pg 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy use===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:B11architecture exteriors040.jpg|thumb|A [[greenhouse]] with its lights on at night, contributing to ''[[light pollution]]'']] --&gt;

During the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roach |first=J. |date=June 30, 2009 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090630-farm-towers-locally-grown.html |title=High-Rise Farms: The Future of Food?|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental writer [[George Monbiot]] calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2010/08/16/towering-lunacy/ |title=George Monbiot – Towering Lunacy |publisher=Monbiot.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Economist argued that "even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough" and "the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Economist |date=December 9, 2010 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627 |title=Vertical farming: Does it really stack up?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "The Vertical Farm" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other tower. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/greenhouse/bng01s01.html |title=Crops &amp;#124; Greenhouse &amp;#124; Greenhouse Energy Calculations &amp;#124; Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives &amp;#124; Province of Manitoba |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
Depending on the method of electricity generation used, greenhouse [[produce]] can create more greenhouse gases than field produce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125741/http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to higher energy use per kilogram. Vertical farms require much greater energy per kilogram versus regular greenhouses, mainly through increased lighting. The amount of pollution produced is dependent on how the energy is generated.

Greenhouses commonly supplement [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels to 3–4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Dioxide In Greenhouses|last=Blom|first=T.J.|author2=W.A.

Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to leak into the atmosphere.

Greenhouse growers commonly exploit [[photoperiodism]] in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over [[light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=61B_RV3EdIcC|page=163}}|title=Light pollution handbook – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10|isbn=978-1-4020-2665-2|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. The most common method of spreading the effluent over neighbouring farmland or [[wetlands]] would be more difficult for an urban vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/greenhouse/nursery/environ/wmrecyc.html |title=Treating and Recycling Irrigation Runoff |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Many of VF's potential benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or [[aeroponic]] growing methods.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I |publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091951/http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |archivedate= 2009-07-01 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Nicholas|last2=Stuhlmacher|first2=Michelle|last3=Miles|first3=Albie|last4=Uludere Aragon|first4=Nazli|last5=Wagner|first5=Melissa|last6=Georgescu|first6=Matei|last7=Herwig|first7=Chris|last8=Gong|first8=Peng|date=2018-01-01|title=A Global Geospatial Ecosystem Services Estimate of Urban Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000536/abstract|journal=Earth's Future|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=40–60|doi=10.1002/2017ef000536|issn=2328-4277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for the future===
It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite web|website=The Vertical Farm Project |year=2009 |title=Agriculture for the 21st Century and Beyond |url=http://www.verticalfarm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland.&lt;ref name=vf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K.

L. |date= October 2011|title=High rise food |journal=The Horticulturalist |pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased crop production===
Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I|publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/?page_id=36 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Vertical Farm Video |publisher= Discovery Channel |date= 2009-04-23 |url= http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510091346/http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |archive-date= 2009-05-10 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs. Globally some 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

Despommier suggests that once dwarf versions of crops (e.g. [[dwarf wheat]] which is smaller in size but richer in nutrients&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web| title = Dwarf Wheat grown aboard the International Space Station | publisher = NASA| date = 9 February 2003| url = http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=2889| accessdate = 17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), year-round crops and "stacker" plant holders are accounted for, a 30-story building with a base of a building block ({{convert|5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}) would yield a yearly crop analogous to that of {{convert|2400|acre|ha|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of traditional farming.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

===Weather disruption===
Crops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather, and suffer from undesirable temperatures rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornadoe, flooding, wildfires and drought.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; "Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Big Food vs. Big Insurance|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2009-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VF productivity is mostly independent of weather, although earthquakes and tornadoes still pose threats.

=== Conservation ===
Up to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of VF could return to its natural state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/opinion/24Despommier.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Farm on Every Floor|last=Despommier|first=Dickson D.|date=2009-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainweb.org/pdf/11/ch_vertical_farming.pdf Vertical take off], ''Fresh Produce Journal'', 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; due to VR's increased productivity.

Vertical farming would thus reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Despommier| first = Dickson| authorlink = Dickson Despommier| title = The Rise of Vertical Farms| journal = Scientific American| volume = 301| issue = 5| pages = 60–67| publisher = Scientific American Inc.| location = New york| date = November 2009| url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-rise-of-vertical-farms| issn = 0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation and [[desertification]] caused by agricultural encroachment on natural [[biome]]s could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil and reducing emissions.

===Resource scarcity===
The scarcity of fertilizer components like phosphorus&lt;ref name="phosphorus"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100311092124.htm Expertanswer. "Scarcity of phosphorus threat to global food production". ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 17 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; poses a threat to industrial agriculture. The closed-cycle design of vertical farm systems minimizes the loss of nutrients, while traditional field agriculture loses nutrients to runoff and leeching.&lt;ref name="runoff"&gt;[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR009i003p00658 Timmons, D. R., et al. “Nitrogen and Phosphorus Losses in Surface Runoff from Agricultural Land as Influenced by Placement of Broadcast Fertilizer.” Water Resources Research , June 1973, doi:https://doi.org/10.1029/WR009i003p00658.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass extinction===
Withdrawing human activity from large areas of the Earth's land surface may be necessary to address [[Holocene extinction event|anthropogenic mass extinction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

Traditional agriculture disrupts wild populations and may be [[Ethics of eating meat#Argument that plant consumption also kills animals|unethical]] given a viable alternative. One study showed that [[wood mouse]] populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming.&lt;ref name="sldavis"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health===
Traditional farming is a hazardous occupation that often affects the health of farmers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[schistosomes]], exposure to toxic pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with wildlife such as venomous snakes, and injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. VF reduces some of these risks.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; The modern industrial food system makes unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These habits lead to health problems such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. 

===Poverty and culture===
Food security is one of the primary factors leading to absolute poverty.  Constructing farms will allow continued growth of culturally significant food items without sacrificing sustainability or basic needs, which can be significant to the recovery of a society from poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-265-food-and-culture-spring-2011/|title=Food and Culture Spring 2011 course|work=ocw.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban growth===
Vertical farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining substantially self-sufficient in food. This would allow large urban centers to grow without food constraints.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt;

===Energy sustainability===
Vertical farms could exploit [[methane digesters]] to generate energy.  Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into [[biogas]] that is generally composed of 65% methane along with other gases. This biogas could then be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Case Study&amp;nbsp;— Landfill Power Generation, H.

==Technologies and devices==
Vertical farming relies on the use of various physical methods to become effective. Combining these technologies and devices in an integrated whole is necessary to make Vertical Farming a reality. Various methods are proposed and under research. The most common technologies suggested are:

* [[Greenhouses]]
* The [[Folkewall]] and other vertical growing architectures&lt;ref name="Folkewalls"&gt;{{cite web|author=Folke Günther |url=http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml |title=The folkewall, greywater purification AND vertical growing |publisher=Holon.se |date=2013-01-06 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aeroponics]]
* [[Agricultural robot]]
* [[Aquaponics]]
* [[Composting]]
* [[Controlled-environment agriculture]]
* [[Flower pots]]
* [[Grow lights]]

In 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a physical base to conduct research into sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/files/Dublin2010/papers/Frediani-Kevin.pdf|title=Vertical plant production as a public exhibit at Paignton Zoo|publisher= Proceedings of the 4th World Botanic Garden Congress, Botanic Gardens Conservation International|date= June 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Green Zionist Alliance]] proposed a resolution at the 36th World Zionist Congress calling on Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael ([[Jewish National Fund]] in Israel) to develop vertical farms in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Green Zionist Alliance (GZA) – Bold Resolutions for 36th World Zionist Congress |url= http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/06/green-zionist-alliance-gza-resolutions/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women, Food and Agriculture Network''' (WFAN) is a non-profit organization that provides networking, education and leadership development for women in [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[food]] systems development.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Masterson, [http://harvestpublicmedia.org/article/435/redefining-farm-woman/5 "Redefining the farm woman"], Harvest Public Media ([[KCUR-FM]]/[[Iowa Public Radio]]), February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Programming focused mainly in the Midwest, such as an Iowa program called "Women Caring for the Land".&lt;ref&gt;Temra Costa, ''Farmer Jane: Women Changing the Way We Eat'' (Gibbs Smith, 2010), {{ISBN|978-1-4236-0562-1}}, pp. 130-136.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=bfVXaBM4gMkC&amp;pg=PA130 Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founders==
Its founders, Denise O'Brien and Kathy Lawrence, wanted to remedy the absence of women's voices in food and agricultural policy-making.

==Organization==
Women, Food and Agriculture Network started as an organization in 1997. Its establishment grew out of concerns about systemic rural, agricultural, and environmental problems and gender relations in these domains.

==Growth==
Since that time, WFAN has grown to a community of more than 1,200 women and men worldwide who share information and support each other's work through a [[listserv]], newsletter and periodic gatherings. It works with women farmland owners, beginning and transitioning women farmers, and established women farmers to provide networking, information and support.

The '''''épuration légale''''' (French "legal purge") was the wave of official trials that followed the [[Military history of France during World War II#Liberation of France|Liberation of France]] and the fall of the [[Vichy Regime]]. The trials were largely conducted from 1944 to 1949, with subsequent legal action continuing for decades afterward.

Unlike the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the ''épuration légale'' was conducted as a domestic French affair. Approximately 300,000 cases were investigated, reaching into the highest levels of the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] Vichy government. More than half were closed without indictment. From 1944 to 1951, official courts in France sentenced 6,763 people to death (3,910 in absentia) for [[treason]] and other offenses. Only 791 executions were actually carried out, including those of [[Pierre Laval]], [[Joseph Darnand]], and the journalist [[Robert Brasillach]]; far more common was "[[dégradation nationale|national degradation]]" — a loss of civil rights, which was meted out to 49,723 people.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony, Postwar: ''A History of Europe Since 1945'', Pimlico (London: 2007), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, public humiliations, assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators, known as the ''[[épuration sauvage]]'' (wild purge).&lt;ref name="épuration sauvage"&gt;Jackson (2003), p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; This period succeeded the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupational administration]] but preceded the authority of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|French Provisional Government]], and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice.&lt;ref name="épuration sauvage"&gt;Jackson (2003), p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 10,500 were executed, before and after liberation. "The courts of Justice pronounced about 6,760 death sentences, 3,910 in absentia and 2,853 in the presence of the accused. Of these 2,853, 73 percent were commuted by de Gaulle, and 767 carried out. In addition, about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals. Thus the total number of people executed before and after the Liberation was approximately 10,500, including those killed in the épuration sauvage",&lt;ref name="épuration sauvage"&gt;Jackson (2003), p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; notably including members and leaders of the [[milice]]s.

== Context ==

{{Further|Pursuit of Nazi collaborators#France}}
[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|150px|[[De Gaulle]] during World War II; he typically wore the uniform of a [[Brigade general]]]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pétain]] meeting [[Hitler]] on 24 October 1940.]]

Following the liberation of France, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] was faced with rebuilding the country and removing traitors, criminals and collaborators from office. The ''[[French Committee of National Liberation|Comité Français de Libération Nationale]]'' (CFLN), which became the GPRF on 4 June 1944, issued an [[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinance]] in Algiers on 18 August 1943, setting the basis for the judicial purge and establishing a Purge Commission (''Commission d'Epuration'').

The official purge in [[metropolitan France]] began in early 1945, although isolated civil trials, courts martial, and thousands of extra-legal vigilante actions had already been carried out through 1944, as the nation had been freed. Women accused of "horizontal collaboration" were arrested, shaved, exhibited, and sometimes mauled by crowds after Liberation, as punishment for their sexual relationships with Germans during the occupation.

In another example of action before the purge, following [[Operation Torch|the landings in North Africa]] in November 1942, some important [[civil servants (France)|civil servants]] loyal to Vichy, including [[Pierre Pucheu]], former [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], had been detained. Pucheu was indicted for treason by a military court martial at the end of August 1943, and his trial started on 4 March 1944.  He was executed 20 days later.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Buttin, ''Le procès Pucheu'', Paris, Amiot-Dumont, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Kupferman]], ''Le procès de Vichy : Pucheu, Pétain, Laval'', Bruxelles, Editions Complexe, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized implementation of the official purge was made difficult by the lack of untainted magistrates.  With a single exception, all of the Third Republic's surviving judges had taken an oath to the disgraced regime of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]].&lt;ref name=Cointet&gt;{{cite web|last=Cointet |first=Jean-Paul|language=French|publisher=Historia|title=Epuration légale : 400 000 dossiers, moins de 800 morts|url=http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910175241/http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html|archivedate=2004-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major types of civilian courts were set up:
* the [[High Court of Justice (France)|High Court of Justice]] (''Haute Cour de justice'')
* the ''[[Cours de justice]]'', modeled on the ''[[Cour d'assises]]'' (Assize Court)
* and the "Civic Chambers" (''Chambres civiques'')

A fourth category was the military [[court-martial|courts martial]]. This jurisdiction covered French citizens charged with pro-German military acts, and German nationals charged with [[war crime]]s, such as [[Pierre Pucheu]], Minister of the Interior of Vichy, and [[Otto Abetz]], ambassador of [[Nazi Germany]] to Paris.&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;

The High Court judged 108 persons (including 106 Ministers). In total the courts investigated more than 300,000 people, classifying 180,000 of them without any indictment, and finally fewer than 800 executions were enacted.&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt; Three successive general [[amnesty|amnesties]] were enacted, in 1947, 1951 and 1953.&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;

== Legal basis ==
While the laws of 1939 included provisions against [[treason]], the particular nature of events related to the Occupation of France made a number of offenses legally unclear, such as joining the [[SS]] or the paramilitary [[Milice]]. Hence, exceptional legal procurements were made.  The principles set unanimously by the ''[[Conseil National de la Résistance]]'' (National Council of Resistance, CNR) on 15 March 1944 called for the political elimination of any person guilty of [[Collaboration with Nazi Germany|collaboration with the Nazis]] between 16 June 1940 and the Liberation. Such offences included, notably:

* Taking part in collaborationist organizations or parties
* Taking part in propaganda
* Delation (denunciation)
* Any form of zeal in favor of the Germans
* [[Black market]] activities

On the other hand, preventing a civil war meant that competent civil servants should not be taken out of office, and that moderate sentences should be given where possible. More importantly, this prevented local Resistance movements from doing vigilante "justice" themselves, ending the "combative" period of the Liberation and restoring the proper legal institutions of France. These new institutions were set on three principles:

* Illegality of the Vichy regime
* France still being at war with Nazi Germany: the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|Franco-German armistice]] legally called for a cease fire and an end to military operations, but did not end the state of war, and no peace treaty was signed with Germany. Hence, it remained the duty of any French to resist occupation.
* [[Ex post facto law|Retroactivity]] of the new texts

On 26 August 1944, the government published an order defining the offence of ''[[indignité nationale]]'' ("national unworthiness"), and the corresponding punishment of ''[[dégradation nationale]]'' ("national stripping of rank"). ''Indignité nationale'' was characterised as "harming unity of France and neglecting one's national duty", and the sentence aimed in particular in prohibiting guilty individuals of exercising political functions.

On 18 November, the ''[[Haute Cour de Justice]]'' ("High Court of Justice") was created, with the aim of judging members of the Vichy government charged of offences of ''Indignité nationale'' (Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], etc.) Other suspects were judged by the ''[[cours de justice]]'' ("Courts of Justice"). A High Court of Justice already existed under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]: the [[French Senate|Senate]] was then to organise a court to judge state leaders guilty of high treason. But this form of justice had been suppressed by Marshal Pétain's Fifth Constitutional Act of 30 July 1940, establishing the Vichy regime.

The new High Court was not composed anymore of senators, but presided over by the first President of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], assisted by the President of the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation and by the first President of the [[Appeal Court]] of Paris. It was also composed of 24 juries, randomly chosen on two lists of a dozen each. The first list included 40 senators or deputies in function on 1 September 1939, who had not voted the full powers to Pétain on 10 July 1940 (the [[Vichy&amp;nbsp;80]]). The second list was composed of 50 persons chosen by the [[French Committee of National Liberation|Consultative Assembly]] in Resistance movements.

The composition of the High Court was changed again by 27 December 1945 Act. Thereafter, it was composed of 27 members, three magistrates and 24 juries randomly chosen on a list of 96 deputies of the [[Constituent Assembly]], [[French legislative election, 1945|elected on 21 October 1945]]. Each political party was represented on this list proportionally to its presence in the Assembly.

The High Court was further modified by 15 September 1947 Act, and then again by 19 April 1948 Act.

== Internment of accused ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DrancyConcentrationCamp.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Drancy internment camp]], Paris]] --&gt;

The French [[Concentration camps in France|concentration camps]] used by the Vichy regime to intern Jews, Spanish Republicans, Resistants and others, were now used to detain presumed collaborationists. In Paris, these included the [[Velodrome d'Hiver]], the [[Drancy internment camp]] (managed by the Resistance until the arrival of the [[French gendarmerie|gendarmerie]] on 15 September 1944) and the [[Fresnes prison]], which held [[Tino Rossi]], [[Pierre Benoît (novelist)|Pierre Benoit]], [[Arletty]], and the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]].  The 4 October 1944 ordinance authorised [[French prefects|prefects]] to intern dangerous prisoners until the end of hostilities.  For some Collaborationists, internment meant protection from popular vengeance.

On 31 October 1944, the Minister of Interior [[Adrien Tixier]] created commissions charged with controlling the internment camps and [[home confinement]]s. The [[Red Cross]] was permitted to visit the camps.  Tixier then stated on 30 August 1945 that although the war was not yet officially ended, further internments were prohibited except for cases of spying or major [[black market]]eering. The 10 May 1946 Act fixed the legal date of the end of the war, and at the end of May 1946, all internment camps were cleared.

== Trials ==

The first high official tried in the purge was [[Jean-Pierre Esteva]], [[List of colonial heads of French Tunisia|Resident General of France in Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803490,00.html |title=The Face of Dishonor |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine |date=26 March 1945 |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to detention for life on 15 March 1945, avoiding capital punishment because the court recognised that he had assisted patriots in May 1943, just before quitting Tunisia. In state of illness, Esteva was pardoned on 11 August 1950 and died a few months later.

The trial of Pétain began on 23 July 1945. Pétain's defense lawyer, Jacques Isorni, pointed out that the public prosecutor, [[André Mornet]], had also been in charge of the failed [[Riom Trial]]s organized by Pétain himself under the Vichy regime.&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt; This may not have impressed the judge, Pierre Mongibeaux, who had himself sworn allegiance to Petain in 1941. The 89-year-old Marshal was sentenced to death on 15 August, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He lived six more years, banished to the [[Île d'Yeu]].

[[Pierre Laval]], the French Prime Minister from July to December 1940 and from April 1942 to August 1944, had fled to [[Francoist Spain]]. [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], however, sent him back to [[Innsbruck]] in Austria, which was part of the U.S. Occupation Zone. Laval was thereafter handed over to the French authorities, and his trial started in October 1945.  In a hasty, rancorous trial, he was sentenced by an openly hostile jury to death on 9 October 1945, and executed a week later.

By 1 July 1949, the High Court had given out 108 sentences (106 of them concerned former ministers &lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;):
*In eight cases, the defendants had died before their trials and judicial proceedings were stopped.  For example, [[Jean Bichelonne]].&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;
*Three persons, including [[Marcel Peyrouton]], were acquitted, and 42 were given ''non-lieux'' (similar to acquittals),&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt; including [[Jacques Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Jérôme Carcopino]], [[Minister of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]] in [[François Darlan]]'s cabinet (1941–1942).
*Eighteen were [[Capital punishment in France|sentenced to death]], of whom only three were executed.  They were Pierre Laval, [[Milice]] leader [[Joseph Darnand]], and [[Fernand de Brinon]], representative of the Vichy government to the German High Command in Paris and state secretary.  Five sentences were commuted, among them Pétain, [[Henri Dentz]], commander of the [[Army of the Levant]], and [[Raphaël Alibert]], signatory of the first [[Statute on Jews]].&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt; Ten others were condemned to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' (including [[Louis Darquier de Pellepoix]], Commissioner for Jewish Affairs).&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;
*Eight were sentenced to [[forced labour]].  They were [[Jacques Chevalier]], Minister [[Paul Baudoin]], [[Charles Nogues]], Minister [[Gabriel Auphan]], Minister [[Hubert Lagardelle]], and others.&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;
*Fourteen were given prison sentences, including [[Yves Bouthillier]], [[André Marquis]], ''[[préfet maritime]]'' of Toulon, [[Bléhaut Henri]], and others.  Only one was a life sentence, given to [[Jean-Pierre Esteva]].&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;
*Fifteen sentences of ''[[dégradation nationale]]'' were issued, including [[François Piétri]], Vichy ambassador to Spain, and [[Adrien Marquet]].  Seven of those fifteen sentences would be suspended for compensating "acts of Resistance", including [[Jean Ybarnegaray]] and André Parmentier.&lt;ref name=Cointet/&gt;

Between 1954 and 1960, the High Court judged prisoners who had been sentenced ''in absentia'' or had been taken prisoner. More than a decade having passed, the court showed more leniency. For example, the [[General resident of Morocco]], [[Charles Noguès]], had been sentenced ''in absentia'' to 20 years of forced labour on 28 November 1947, but his ''indignité nationale'' was immediately suspended on 26 October 1956.
