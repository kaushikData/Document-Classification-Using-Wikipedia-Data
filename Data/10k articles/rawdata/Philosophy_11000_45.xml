==History==
The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] ({{IPAc-en|p|ɜːr|s}}; 1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic. Over the years he called such inference ''hypothesis'', ''abduction'', ''presumption'', and ''retroduction''. He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.

As two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific [[inquiry]], abduction and also [[inductive reasoning|induction]] are often collapsed into one overarching concept — the hypothesis. That is why, in the [[scientific method]] known from [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by [[Karl Popper]]'s explication of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]], where  the hypothesis is considered to be just "a guess"&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (2002), ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', London, UK: Routledge. p 536&lt;/ref&gt; (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this "guess" has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.

Before 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation, e.g., it is a known rule that if it rains the grass is wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass is wet; one ''abduces'' that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules explaining the observation are not taken into account (e.g. if the sprinklers were recently on the grass is wet). This remains the common use of the term "abduction" in the [[social science]]s and in [[artificial intelligence]].

Peirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See Santaella, Lucia (1997) "The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction", 6th Congress of the [[IASS]]. [http://www.pucsp.br/~lbraga/epap_peir1.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years his view came to be:

* "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.

(See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/retroduction.html Retroduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.)&lt;/ref&gt; It is "very little hampered" by rules of logic.&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt; Even a well-prepared mind's individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, pp. 90–112, see §4. In ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, see paragraph 476. In ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct&lt;ref name="NA"&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, pp. 90–112. See both part III and part IV. Reprinted, including originally unpublished portion, in ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 452–85, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 434–50, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; (some speak of [[logical intuition|intuition]] in such contexts&lt;ref&gt;Peirce used the term "intuition" not in the sense of an instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference as people often do currently. Instead he used "intuition" usually in the sense of a cognition devoid of logical determination by [[a priori and a posteriori|previous cognitions]]. He said, "We have no power of Intuition" in that sense. See his "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities" (1868), [http://www.peirce.org/writings/p27.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.&lt;ref name="NA" /&gt;
* Its longer aim is to economize [[inquiry]] itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths.&lt;ref&gt;For a relevant discussion of Peirce and the aims of abductive inference, see McKaughan, Daniel J. (2008), "From Ugly Duckling to Swan: C. S. Peirce, Abduction, and the Pursuit of Scientific Theories", ''Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society'', v. 44, no. 3 (summer), 446–468.&lt;/ref&gt; Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry. It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying.
* [[Pragmatism]] is the logic of abduction. Upon the generation  of an explanation (which he came to regard as instinctively guided), the [[pragmatic maxim]] gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have conceivable&lt;ref&gt;Peirce means "conceivable" very broadly. See ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraph 196, or ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, p. 235, "Pragmatism as the Logic of Abduction" (Lecture VII of the 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism): {{quote|It allows any flight of imagination, provided this imagination ultimately alights upon a possible practical effect; and thus many hypotheses may seem at first glance to be excluded by the pragmatical maxim that are not really so excluded.}}&lt;/ref&gt; implications for informed practice, so as to be testable&lt;ref name="L75"&gt;Peirce, C.

This is approximately the doctrine of pragmatism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, through its trials, to expedite and economize inquiry. The economy of research is what calls for abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1902), application to the Carnegie Institution, see MS L75.329-330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:
{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of [[heuristic]] and is the first question of heuristic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1910, Peirce admits that "in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century I more or less mixed up hypothesis and induction" and he traces the confusion of these two types of reasoning to logicians' too "narrow and formalistic a conception of inference, as necessarily having formulated judgments from its premises."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, A Letter to [[Paul Carus]] circa 1910, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 227–228. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypothesis.html Hypothesis]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He started out in the 1860s treating hypothetical inference in a number of ways which he eventually peeled away as inessential or, in some cases, mistaken:
* as inferring the occurrence of a character (a characteristic) from the observed combined occurrence of multiple characters which its occurrence would necessarily involve;&lt;ref name="NCA"&gt;(1867), "On the Natural Classification of Arguments", ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' v. 7, pp. 261–287. Presented April 9, 1867. See especially starting at [{{google books |plainurl=y |id=nG8UAAAAYAAJ|page=284}} p. 284] in Part III §1. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers v. 2, paragraphs 461–516 and ''Writings'' v. 2, pp. 23–49.''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, if any occurrence of ''A'' is known to necessitate occurrence of ''B, C, D, E'', then the observation of ''B, C, D, E'' suggests by way of explanation the occurrence of ''A''. (But by 1878 he no longer regarded such multiplicity as common to all hypothetical inference.&lt;ref name="DIH"&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1878), "Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 13, pp. 470–82, see [{{google books |plainurl=y |id=u8sWAQAAIAAJ|page=472}} 472].

* as aiming for a more or less probable hypothesis (in 1867 and 1883 but not in 1878; anyway by 1900 the justification is not probability but the lack of alternatives to guessing and the fact that guessing is fruitful;&lt;ref name="L2L"&gt;A letter to Langley, 1900, published in ''Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science''. See excerpts under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1903 he speaks of the "likely" in the sense of nearing the truth in an "indefinite sense";&lt;ref&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic'" (1903 manuscript), ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see p. 287. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1908 he discusses ''plausibility'' as instinctive appeal.&lt;ref name="NA" /&gt;) In a paper dated by editors as ''circa'' 1901, he  discusses "instinct" and "naturalness", along with the kind of considerations (low cost of testing, logical caution, breadth, and incomplexity) that he later calls methodeutical.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "On the Logic of Drawing History from Ancient Documents", dated as ''circa'' 1901 both by the editors of ''Collected Papers'' (see CP v. 7, bk 2, ch. 3, footnote 1) and by those of the ''Essential Peirce'' (EP) ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/headers/ep2headx.htm#8 Eprint]. The article's discussion of abduction is in CP v. 7, paragraphs 218–31 and in EP v. 2, pp. 107–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* as induction from characters (but as early as 1900 he characterized abduction as guessing&lt;ref name="L2L" /&gt;)
* as citing a known rule in a premise rather than hypothesizing a rule in the conclusion (but by 1903 he allowed either approach&lt;ref name="HL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newidea"&gt;Peirce, C. S., "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic" (1903), ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, p. 287:
{{quote| The mind seeks to bring the facts, as modified by the new discovery, into order; that is, to form a general conception embracing them. In some cases, it does this by an act of ''generalization''. In other cases, no new law is suggested, but only a peculiar state of facts that will "explain" the surprising phenomenon; and a law already known is recognized as applicable to the suggested hypothesis, so that the phenomenon, under that assumption, would not be surprising, but quite likely, or even would be a necessary result. This synthesis suggesting a new conception or hypothesis, is the Abduction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* as basically a transformation of a deductive categorical syllogism&lt;ref name="DIH" /&gt; (but in 1903 he offered a variation on ''modus ponens'' instead,&lt;ref name="HL" /&gt; and by 1911 he was unconvinced that any one form covers all hypothetical inference&lt;ref name="kehler"&gt;A Letter to J. H.

===1867===
In 1867, Peirce's "The Natural Classification of Arguments",&lt;ref name="NCA" /&gt; hypothetical inference always deals with a cluster of characters (call them ''P′, P′′, P′′′,'' etc.) known to occur at least whenever a certain character (''M'') occurs. Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All ''men'' [middle] are ''mortal'' [predicate]; ''Socrates'' [subject] is a ''man'' [middle]; ergo ''Socrates'' [subject] is ''mortal'' [predicate]". Below, 'M' stands for a middle; 'P' for a predicate; 'S' for a subject. Note also that Peirce held that all deduction can be put into the form of the categorical [[syllogism]] [[Syllogism#Modus Barbara|Barbara (AAA-1)]].

[Any] M is P &lt;br&gt;
[Any] S is M &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; [Any] S is P.

''S′, S′′, S′′′'', &amp;c. are taken at random as ''M'''s; &lt;br&gt;
''S′, S′′, S′′′'', &amp;c. are ''P'': &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; Any ''M'' is probably ''P''.

Any ''M'' is, for instance, ''P′, P′′, P′′′,'' &amp;c.; &lt;br&gt;
''S'' is ''P′, P′′, P′′′,'' &amp;c.: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''S'' is probably ''M''.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1878===
In 1878, in "Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis",&lt;ref name="DIH" /&gt; there is no longer a need for multiple characters or predicates in order for an inference to be hypothetical, although it is still helpful. Moreover, Peirce no longer poses hypothetical inference as concluding in a ''probable'' hypothesis. In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a "very curious circumstance". The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another's propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).

''Result:'' These beans [oddly] are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.
|}

===1883===
Peirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 "A Theory of Probable Inference", in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1883), "A Theory of Probable Inference" in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; Like "Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis" in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by [[Stephen Stigler]]), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.

[[Sherlock Holmes]] uses this method of reasoning in the stories of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], although Holmes refers to it as [[deductive reasoning]].

===1902 and after===
In 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought.&lt;ref&gt;In Peirce, C. S., 'Minute Logic' circa 1902, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraph 102. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction:&lt;ref name="HL" /&gt; 
{{quote|The surprising fact, C, is observed; 
:But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,
:Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.}}
The hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.

Note that the hypothesis ("A") could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation ("C"), which needs to follow only as a "matter of course"; or the "course" itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.&lt;ref name="newidea" /&gt;

Peirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, "I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all 'Retroductions'. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind."&lt;ref name="kehler" /&gt;

===Pragmatism===
In 1901 Peirce wrote, "There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents", 1901 manuscript, ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 164–231, see 202, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 75–114, see 95. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 Peirce called [[pragmatism]] "the logic of abduction" and said that the [[pragmatic maxim]] gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.&lt;ref name="prag" /&gt; The pragmatic maxim is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction's purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s&lt;ref name="econ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see pp. 107–9.&lt;/ref&gt; he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application, L75 (1902), Memoir 28: "On the Economics of Research", scroll down to Draft E. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m28 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three levels of logic about abduction===
Peirce came over the years to [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)#Sciences|divide (philosophical) logic]] into three departments: 
# Stechiology, or speculative grammar, on the conditions for meaningfulness. Classification of signs (semblances, symptoms, symbols, etc.) and their combinations (as well as their objects and [[interpretant]]s).
# Logical critic, or logic proper, on validity or justifiability of inference, the conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various modes (deduction, induction, abduction).
# Methodeutic, or speculative rhetoric, on the conditions for determination of interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes.
Peirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments.&lt;ref name="L75" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prag" /&gt; To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Scientific method|Peirce's outline of the scientific method]] of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes [[pragmatism]] or, as he later called it, [[pragmaticism]], the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.

====Classification of signs====
As early as 1866,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., the 1866 Lowell Lectures on the Logic of Science, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 1, p. 485. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypothesis.html Hypothesis]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce held that:

1. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an ''icon'' (also called a ''likeness''). &lt;br&gt;
2. Induction is inference through an ''index'' (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn. &lt;br&gt;
3. Deduction is inference through a ''symbol'' (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).

In 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: "It is recognized that the phenomena are ''like'', i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", written 1903. See ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' v. 2, p. 287. Quote viewable under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critique of arguments====
At the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail.&lt;ref name="NA" /&gt; It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the "facile and natural", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity" (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind's processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly "natural" guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without "a natural bent like nature's", people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative "ought": "By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, A Letter to Paul Carus 1910, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, see paragraph 223.&lt;/ref&gt; For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference ''as'' an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis's relation to the inquiry process.

The phrase "inference to the best explanation" (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the [[Occam's razor|fewest assumptions]]). However, in other senses of "best", such as "standing up best to tests", it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as good is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.&lt;ref name="L75" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), Application to the Carnegie Institution, Memoir 27, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Eprint]: "Of the different classes of arguments, abductions are the only ones in which after they have been admitted to be just, it still remains to inquire whether they are advantageous."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methodology of inquiry====
At the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected&lt;ref name="L75" /&gt; for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the [[inquiry]] process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies,&lt;ref name="econ" /&gt; in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:
* Cost: A simple but low-odds guess, if low in cost to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing, to get it out of the way. If surprisingly it stands up to tests, that is worth knowing early in the inquiry, which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track.
* Value: A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be treacherous.
* Interrelationships: Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their
** ''caution'', for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]],
** ''breadth'' of applicability to explain various phenomena, and
** ''incomplexity'', that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial "may give a good 'leave', as the billiard-players say", and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple.&lt;ref name="econ2"&gt;Peirce, "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see pp. 107–9 and 113. On Twenty Questions, p. 109, Peirce has pointed out that if each question eliminates half the possibilities, twenty questions can choose from among 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; or 1,048,576 objects, and goes on to say: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do. The secret of the business lies in the caution which breaks a hypothesis up into its smallest logical components, and only risks one of them at a time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other writers===
[[Norwood Russell Hanson]], a [[philosopher of science]], wanted to grasp a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Peirce's notion of abduction for this.&lt;ref name="RST-HermTerm"&gt;Schwendtner, Tibor and Ropolyi, László and Kiss, Olga (eds): Hermeneutika és a természettudományok. Áron Kiadó, Budapest, 2001. It is written in Hungarian. Meaning of the title: Hermeneutics and the natural sciences.  See, e.g., Hanson's ''Patterns of Discovery'' (Hanson, 1958), especially pp. 85–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Further development of the concept can be found in [[Peter Lipton]]'s ''Inference to the Best Explanation'' (Lipton, 1991).

== Deduction, induction, and abduction==
{{Main article|Logical reasoning}}

=== Deductive reasoning (deduction) ===
{{Main article|Deductive reasoning}}
Deductive reasoning allows deriving &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; only where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is formal [[logical consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For example, given that "Wikis can be edited by anyone" (&lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;) and "Wikipedia is a wiki" (&lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;), it follows that "Wikipedia can be edited by anyone" (&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Inductive reasoning (induction) ===
{{Main article|Inductive reasoning}}
Inductive reasoning allows inferring &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; does not follow necessarily from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; might give us very good reason to accept &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, but it does not ensure &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if all swans that we have observed so far are white, we may induce that the possibility that all swans are white is reasonable. We have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise, but the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed. (Indeed, it turns out that [[Black swan|some swans are black]].)

=== Abductive reasoning (abduction) ===
Abductive reasoning allows inferring &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as an explanation of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to be abduced from the consequence &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. [[Deductive reasoning]] and abductive reasoning thus differ in the direction in which a rule like "&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; [[entailment|entail]]s &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;" is used for inference.

As such, abduction is formally equivalent to the logical fallacy of [[affirming the consequent]] (or ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'') because of multiple possible explanations for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the ''eight'' ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that explains our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of [[prior probability|priors]] in [[Bayesian statistics]].

==Formalizations of abduction==

===Logic-based abduction===
In [[logic]], [[explanation]] is done from a logical theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; representing a [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] and a set of observations &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;. Abduction is the process of deriving a set of explanations of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; according to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and picking out one of those explanations.  For &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to be an explanation of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; according to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, it should satisfy two conditions:

* &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; follows from &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is consistent with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

In formal logic, &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; are assumed to be sets of [[Literal (mathematical logic)|literal]]s. The two conditions for &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; being an explanation of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; according to theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are formalized as:

:&lt;math&gt;T \cup E \models O;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T \cup E&lt;/math&gt; is consistent.

Among the possible explanations &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; satisfying these two conditions, some other condition of minimality is usually imposed to avoid irrelevant facts (not contributing to the entailment of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;) being included in the explanations.  Abduction is then the process that picks out some member of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.  Criteria for picking out a member representing "the best" explanation include the [[simplicity]], the [[prior probability]], or the explanatory power of the explanation.

A proof theoretical abduction method for first order classical logic based on the [[sequent calculus]] and a dual one, based on semantic tableaux ([[analytic tableaux]]) have been proposed (Cialdea Mayer &amp; Pirri 1993). The methods are sound and complete and work for full first order logic, without requiring any preliminary reduction of formulae into normal forms. These methods have also been extended to [[modal logic]].

[[Abductive logic programming]] is a computational framework that extends normal [[logic programming]] with abduction. It separates the theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; into two components, one of which is a normal logic program, used to generate &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by means of [[backward reasoning]], the other of which is a set of integrity constraints, used to filter the set of candidate explanations.

===Set-cover abduction===
A different formalization of abduction is based on inverting the function that calculates the visible effects of the hypotheses.  Formally, we are given a set of hypotheses &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and a set of manifestations &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;; they are related by the domain knowledge, represented by a function &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; that takes as an argument a set of hypotheses and gives as a result the corresponding set of manifestations. In other words, for every subset of the hypotheses &lt;math&gt;H' \subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;, their effects are known to be &lt;math&gt;e(H')&lt;/math&gt;.

Abduction is performed by finding a set &lt;math&gt;H' \subseteq H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M \subseteq e(H')&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, abduction is performed by finding a set of hypotheses &lt;math&gt;H'&lt;/math&gt; such that their effects &lt;math&gt;e(H')&lt;/math&gt; include all observations &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

A common assumption is that the effects of the hypotheses are independent, that is, for every &lt;math&gt;H' \subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;, it holds that &lt;math&gt;e(H') = \bigcup_{h \in H'} e(\{h\})&lt;/math&gt;. If this condition is met, abduction can be seen as a form of [[set covering]].

===Abductive validation===
Abductive validation is the process of validating a given hypothesis through abductive reasoning. This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation. Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see [[Occam's razor]]). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in [[science]]; moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looking out my window this lovely spring morning, I see an azalea in full bloom. No, no! I don't see that; though that is the only way I can describe what I see. That is a proposition, a sentence, a fact; but what I perceive is not proposition, sentence, fact, but only an image, which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact. This statement is abstract; but what I see is concrete. I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see. The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction. Not the smallest advance can be made in knowledge beyond the stage of vacant staring, without making an abduction at every step.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce MS. 692, quoted in Sebeok, T. (1981) "[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/abduction.html You Know My Method]" in Sebeok, T., ''The Play of Musement'', Bloomington, IA: Indiana, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was Peirce's own maxim that "Facts cannot be explained by a hypothesis more extraordinary than these facts themselves; and of various hypotheses the least extraordinary must be adopted."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce MS. 696, quoted in Sebeok, T. (1981) "[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/abduction.html You Know My Method]" in Sebeok, T., ''The Play of Musement'', Bloomington, IA: Indiana, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining results from an inference procedure, we may be left with multiple assumptions, some of which may be contradictory. Abductive validation is a method for identifying the assumptions that will lead to your goal.

===Probabilistic abduction===
Probabilistic abductive reasoning is a form of abductive validation, and is used extensively in areas where the probability distribution over possible hypotheses needs to be derived, such as for making diagnoses from medical tests.

For example, a pharmaceutical company that develops a test for a particular infectious disease will typically determine the reliability of the test by hiring a group of infected and a group of non-infected people to undergo the test. Assume the statements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;: "Positive test", &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;: "Negative test", &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;: "Infected", and &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}&lt;/math&gt;: "Not infected". The result of these trials will then determine the reliability of the test in terms of its true positive rate ([[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]) &lt;math&gt;p(x\mid y)&lt;/math&gt; and false positive rate &lt;math&gt;p(x\mid \overline{y})&lt;/math&gt;. The interpretations of the conditionals are: &lt;math&gt;p(x\mid y)&lt;/math&gt;: "The probability of positive test given infection", and &lt;math&gt;p(x\mid \overline{y})&lt;/math&gt;: "The probability of positive test in the absence of infection". The problem with applying these conditionals in a practical setting is that they are expressed in the opposite direction to what the practitioner needs. The conditionals needed for making the diagnosis are: &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid x)&lt;/math&gt;: "The probability of infection given positive test", and &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid \overline{x})&lt;/math&gt;: "The probability of infection given negative test". The marginal probability of infection could then have been conditionally deduced as &lt;math&gt;p(y) = p(y\mid x)p(x) + p(y\mid \overline{x})p(\overline{x})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the degree (probability) of positive test which typically can be set to &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if the test is objectively positive, or to &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if the test is objectively negative. Note that &lt;math&gt;p(\overline{x}) = 1 - p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Unfortunately the required conditionals are usually not directly available to the medical practitioner, but they can be obtained by applying [[Bayes' theorem]] if the [[base rate]] (aka. [[prior probability]]) &lt;math&gt;a(y)&lt;/math&gt; of the infection in the population is known. Two instances of Bayes' theorem are needed to obtain the required conditionals &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid \overline{x})&lt;/math&gt;. These two instances of Bayes' theorem are

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p(y\mid x) = \dfrac{p(x\mid y)a(y)}{p(x\mid y)a(y) +
p(x\mid \overline{y})a(\overline{y})}\\[10pt]
p(y\mid\overline{x}) = \dfrac{p(\overline{x}\mid y)a(y)}{p(\overline{x}\mid y)a(y) +
p(\overline{x}\mid \overline{y})a(\overline{y})}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The full expression for the conditionally abduced marginal probability &lt;math&gt;p(y)&lt;/math&gt; of infection in a tested person, given the outcome (probability) of the test &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the base rate of the infection &lt;math&gt;a(y)&lt;/math&gt;, as well as the test's true and false positive rates &lt;math&gt;p(x\mid y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(x\mid \overline{y})&lt;/math&gt;, is then given by

: &lt;math&gt;
p(y) = \left(\frac{p(x\mid y)a(y)}{p(x\mid y)a(y) +
p(x\mid \overline{y})a(\overline{y})}\right) p(x) + \left(\frac{p(\overline{x}\mid y)a(y)}{p(\overline{x}\mid y)a(y) +
p(\overline{x}\mid\overline{y})a(\overline{y})}\right) p(\overline{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;

This further simplifies to the expression for the marginal probability &lt;math&gt;p(y)&lt;/math&gt; [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] with the [[law of total probability]] as

: &lt;math&gt;
p(y) = p(y\mid x)p(x) + p(y \mid \overline{x}) p(\overline{x}) .
&lt;/math&gt;

Probabilistic abduction can thus be described as a method for probabilistic [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] that uses [[Bayes' theorem]].

A medical test result is typically considered positive or negative, so
when applying the above equation it can be assumed that
either &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt; (positive) or &lt;math&gt;p(\overline{x}) = 1&lt;/math&gt; (negative).  In case the patient tests positive, the above equation can be simplified to &lt;math&gt;p(y) = p(y\mid x)&lt;/math&gt; which in that case gives the correct likelihood that the patient actually is infected.

The [[base rate fallacy]] in medicine,&lt;ref name="Koe96"&gt;Jonathan Koehler. The Base Rate Fallacy Reconsidered: Descriptive, Normative and Methodological Challenges. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. 19, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[prosecutor's fallacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, B., &amp; Vignaux, G. A. (1995). '' Interpreting evidence: Evaluating forensic evidence in the courtroom''. Chichester: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; in legal reasoning, consists of making the erroneous assumption that &lt;math&gt;p(y\mid x) = p(x\mid y)&lt;/math&gt;. While this reasoning error often can produce a relatively good approximation of the correct hypothesis probability value, it can lead to a completely wrong result and wrong conclusion in case the base rate is very low and the reliability of the test is not perfect. An extreme example of the base rate fallacy is to conclude that a male person is pregnant just because he tests positive in a pregnancy test. Obviously, the base rate of [[male pregnancy]] is zero, and assuming that the test is not perfect, it would be correct to conclude that the male person is not pregnant or the person is not biologically male.

The expression for probabilistic abduction can be generalised to multinomial cases,&lt;ref name="Jos08-JMVLSC"&gt;A. Jøsang. Conditional Reasoning with Subjective Logic. ''Journal of multiple valued logic and soft computing''. 15(1), pp. 5–38, 2008.[http://folk.uio.no/josang/papers/Jos2008-JMVLSC.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., with a state space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of multiple &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and a state space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of multiple states &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt;.

===Subjective logic abduction===
[[Subjective logic]] generalises [[probabilistic logic]] by including degrees of uncertainty in the input arguments, i.e. in addition to assigning probabilities, the analyst can assign [[Subjective logic|subjective opinions]] to the argument variables. Abduction in subjective logic is thus a generalization of probabilistic abduction described above.&lt;ref name="Josang2016-SL" /&gt; The input arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions which can be binomial when the opinion applies to a binary variable or multinomial when it applies to an ''n''-ary variable. A subjective opinion thus applies to a variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which takes its values from a domain &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{X}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. a state space of exhaustive and mutually disjoint values &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;), and is denoted by the tuple &lt;math&gt;\omega_{X}=(b_{X}, u_{X}, a_{X})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b_{X}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a belief mass distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{X}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u_{X}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the uncertainty mass, and &lt;math&gt;a_{X}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a base rate distribution over &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. These parameters satisfy &lt;math&gt;u_{X}+\sum b_{X}(x) = 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum a_{X}(x) = 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;b_{X}(x),u_{X},a_{X}(x) \in [0,1].\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume the domains &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Y}&lt;/math&gt; with respective variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the set of conditional opinions &lt;math&gt;\omega_{X\mid Y}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. one conditional opinion for each value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;), and the base rate distribution &lt;math&gt;a_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;. Based on these parameters, the subjective [[Bayes' theorem]] denoted with the operator &lt;math&gt;\;\widetilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; produces the set of inverted conditionals &lt;math&gt;\omega_{Y\tilde{\mid} X}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. one inverted conditional for each value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) expressed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{Y\tilde{|}X}=\omega_{X|Y}\;\widetilde{\phi\,}\;a_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;.

Using these inverted conditionals together with the opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega_{X}&lt;/math&gt; subjective [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] denoted by the operator &lt;math&gt;\circledcirc&lt;/math&gt; can be used to abduce the marginal opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega_{Y\,\overline{\|}\,X}&lt;/math&gt;. The equality between the different expressions for subjective abduction is given below:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_{Y\,\widetilde{\|}\,X} 
&amp;=  \omega_{X\mid Y} \;\widetilde{\circledcirc}\; \omega_{X}\\
&amp;= (\omega_{X\mid Y} \;\widetilde{\phi\,}\; a_{Y}) \;\circledcirc\;\omega_{X}\\
&amp;= \omega_{Y\widetilde{|}X} \;\circledcirc\;\omega_{X}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The symbolic notation for subjective abduction is "&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\|}&lt;/math&gt;", and the operator itself is denoted as "&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\circledcirc}&lt;/math&gt;". The operator for the subjective Bayes' theorem is denoted "&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\phi\,}&lt;/math&gt;", and subjective deduction is denoted "&lt;math&gt;\circledcirc&lt;/math&gt;",&lt;ref name="Josang2016-SL"&gt;A. Jøsang. ''Subjective Logic: A Formalism for Reasoning Under Uncertainty'', Springer 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-319-42337-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of using subjective logic abduction compared to probabilistic abduction is that uncertainty about the input argument probabilities can be explicitly expressed and taken into account during the analysis. It is thus possible to perform abductive analysis in the presence of uncertain arguments, which naturally results in degrees of uncertainty in the output conclusions.

==Applications==

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Applications in [[artificial intelligence]] include [[Diagnosis (artificial intelligence)|fault diagnosis]], [[belief revision]], and [[automated planning]]. The most direct application of abduction is that of automatically detecting faults in systems: given a theory relating faults with their effects and a set of observed effects, abduction can be used to derive sets of faults that are likely to be the cause of the problem.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], abduction can be seen as a component of clinical evaluation and judgment.&lt;ref name="Rapezzi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapezzi|first=C|author2=Ferrari, R|author3= Branzi, A|title=White coats and fingerprints: diagnostic reasoning in medicine and investigative methods of fictional detectives|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=24 December 2005| volume=331| issue=7531| pages=1491–4| pmid=16373725|pmc=1322237| doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rejon2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rejón Altable|first=C|title=Logic structure of clinical judgment and its relation to medical and psychiatric semiology| journal=Psychopathology|date=October 2012| volume=45| issue=6| pages=344–51| pmid=22854297| url=http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/337968| accessdate=17 January 2014| doi=10.1159/000337968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automated planning ===
Abduction can also be used to model [[automated planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Kave Eshghi. Abductive planning with the event calculus. In Robert A. Kowalski, Kenneth A. Bowen editors: Logic Programming, Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference and Symposium, Seattle, Washington, August 15–19, 1988. MIT Press 1988, {{ISBN|0-262-61056-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a logical theory relating action occurrences with their effects (for example, a formula of the [[event calculus]]), the problem of finding a plan for reaching a state can be modeled as the problem of abducting a set of literals implying that the final state is the goal state.

=== Intelligence analysis ===
In [[intelligence analysis]], [[analysis of competing hypotheses]] and [[Bayesian network]]s, probabilistic abductive reasoning is used extensively. Similarly in [[medical diagnosis]] and legal reasoning, the same methods are being used, although there have been many examples of errors, especially caused by the [[base rate fallacy]] and the [[prosecutor's fallacy]].

=== Belief revision ===
[[Belief revision]], the process of adapting beliefs in view of new information, is another field in which abduction has been applied. The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the corpus of beliefs, while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. This process can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency. This use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding [[propositional formula]]e to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the possible worlds. Preference models use fuzzy logic or utility models.

=== Philosophy of science ===
In the [[philosophy of science]], abduction has been the key inference method to support [[scientific realism]], and much of the debate about scientific realism is focused on whether abduction is an acceptable method of inference.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, Peter. (2001). Inference to the Best Explanation, London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-24202-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical linguistics ===
In [[historical linguistics]], abduction during language acquisition is often taken to be an essential part of processes of [[language change]] such as reanalysis and [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;April M. S. McMahon (1994): Understanding language change. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-44665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthropology ===
In [[anthropology]], [[Alfred Gell]] in his influential book ''Art and Agency'' defined abduction (after Eco&lt;ref&gt;Eco, U. (1976). "A theory of Semiotics". Bloomington, IA: Indiana. p 131&lt;/ref&gt;) as "a case of synthetic inference 'where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Gell, A 1984, p 14"&gt;Gell, A. 1984, Art and Agency. Oxford: Oxford. p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Gell criticizes existing "anthropological" studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering "social relationships", specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, R. (2004) A critique of Alfred Gell on Art and Agency. Retrieved Sept 2007 from: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050327073225/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3654/is_200406/ai_n9453295 Find Articles at BNET]&lt;/ref&gt; Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency.  That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a ''sensus communis:'' the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society.&lt;ref name="University of California, Berkeley"&gt;Whitney D. (2006) "Abduction the agency of art". Retrieved May 2009 from: [http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/davis/Gell.pdf University of California, Berkeley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120152801/http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/davis/Gell.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question Gell asks in the book is, "how does it initially 'speak' to people?" He answers by saying that "No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of [[semiosis]]."&lt;ref name="Gell, A 1984, p 14" /&gt; However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the ''sensus communis'' that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.&lt;ref name="University of California, Berkeley" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Afro-pessimism''' is a framework and critical idiom that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of enslavement including the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], and their impact on structural conditions as well as personal, subjective, and lived experience, and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality. 

The term was first coined  in 1990 in an article in ''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeune Afrique Economie]]'' by Francophone Cameroonian author [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71173671 |title=African literature : an anthology of criticism and theory |last=Tansi |first=Sony Labou |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub |isbn=1405112018 |location=Malden, MA |pages=54-60 |chapter=An Open Letter to Africans c/o The Punic One Party State |oclc=71173671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Labou Tansi, "Lettre aux Africains... sous couvert du parti punique," ''Jeune Afrique Economie 1''36 (1990): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[intellectual]] [[Frank B. Wilderson III]] developed the term in his political [[memoir]] about his time spent teaching and participating in the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] during [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/9780822374985-003|work=Incognegro|pages=96–146|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822374985|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Tansi, "Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time," which is the "tragedy" that Africa's position "dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of "accumulation and fungibility" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.

Wilderson, along with [[Hortense Spillers]], [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Jared Sexton]], and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the [[Martinique|Martinician]] psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer [[Frantz Fanon]] as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. 

Afro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a [[wikt:transcendence|transcendent]] position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that [[pessimism]] might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of [[African descent]]. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling [[white supremacy]] would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the [[modern world]].

Discussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an [[online]] context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, [[poetics]], and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Afro-Pessimism:The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|date=2016|issue=29|url=http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|issn=1555-9998|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907061732/http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|archive-date=2017-09-07|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Africanism ==
Afro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about [[pan-African]] identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the [[African Diaspora]] and peoples on the [[Africa|African continent]]. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentricity]] as a move away from the colonialism and violence of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]]. The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], a [[Martinique|Martinican]] psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. 

=== Négritude ===
The [[Pan-African]] movement [[négritude]] represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an [[existentialist]] position. A key figure in the movement, [[Aimé Césaire]], uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.

==In international relations theory==
Afro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilderson|first1=Frank|title=Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4692-0|page=346|oclc=457770963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood.&lt;ref name="de B'eberi and Louw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de B’béri |first1=Boulou Ebanda |last2=Louw |first2=P.

On the [[Quran]] he said:
"When I was a Christian I used to say, as did an uncle of mine who was one of the learned and eloquent men, that eloquence is not one of the signs of prophethood because it is common to all the peoples; but when I discarded (blind) imitation and (old) customs and gave up adhering to (mere) habit and training and reflected upon the meanings of the Qur'an I came to know that what the followers of the Qur'an claimed for it was true. The fact is that I have not found any book, be it by an Arab or a Persian, an Indian or a Greek, right from the beginning of the world up to now, which contains at the same time praises of God, belief in the prophets and apostles, exhortations to good, everlasting deeds, command to do good and prohibition against doing evil, inspiration to the desire of paradise and to avoidance of hell-fire as this Qur'an does. So when a person brings to us a book of such qualities, which inspires such reverence and sweetness in the hearts and which has achieved such an overlasting success and he is (at the same time) an illiterate person who did never learnt the art of writing or rhetoric, that book is without any doubt one of the signs of his Prophethood."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/ijaz1.html#Rab&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Aleem, "I'jaz ul Qur'an", Islamic Culture, Op.

'''Alvin Ira Goldman''' (born 1938) is an American philosopher who is Board of Governors Professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Cognitive Science]] at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]] and a leading figure in [[epistemology]].

==Education and career==

Goldman earned his BA from [[Columbia University]] and PhD from [[Princeton University]], and previously taught at the [[University of Michigan]] (1963–1980), the [[University of Illinois, Chicago]] (1980–1983) and the [[University of Arizona]] (1983–1994). He joined the Rutgers faculty in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/goldman/CV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He has done influential work on a wide range of philosophical topics, but his principal areas of research are [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[cognitive science]].

He is married to the ethicist [[Holly Martin Smith]].

==Philosophical work==

===Action theory===

Goldman's early book, ''A Theory of Human Action'' (a revised version of his Ph.D. thesis), presents a systematic way of classifying and relating the many actions we perform at any time.  Its influence was broad and can be found in, among other writings, John Rawls' book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''.  Goldman's early work in action theory soon gave way to work in other branches of philosophy, most influentially epistemology.

===Epistemology===

Goldman's accounts of knowledge and justified belief, using notions like causation and reliability instead of normative concepts like permissibility and obligation, contributed to a philosophical approach that came to be known in the 1970s as [[naturalized epistemology]].  (Unlike [[W.V.O. Quine]]'s version of naturalized epistemology, however, Goldman's retains a traditional focus on questions of justification.)  Goldman's view emerged initially as part of the efforts in the 1960s to find a "fourth" condition in response to the [[Gettier]] challenge to the account of knowledge as "justified true belief."  In his 1967 paper, "[[A Causal Theory of Knowing]]", Goldman proposed that knowledge amounts to true belief appropriately caused by the fact that makes it true.  Later, he claimed knowledge amounts to true belief that is produced by a reliable process.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Alvin I. ''Liaisons: Philosophy meets the cognitive and social sciences''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1992. (Chapter 5, 85-103)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman has described his "naturalistic" approach to epistemology as splitting "epistemology (individual epistemology, anyway) into two parts.... The first part is dedicated to the 'analytic' task of identifying the criteria, or satisfaction conditions, for various normative epistemic statuses. With respect to the normative status of justifiedness (of belief), the proposed criterion is the reliability of the belief-forming processes by which the belief is produced. Defense of this criterion of justifiedness was not based on scientific psychology, but rather a familiar form of armchair methodology. The second part is the task where science enters the picture. Psychological science is required to identify the kinds of operations or computations available to the human cognizer, how well they work when operating on certain inputs and under certain conditions."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/thinking-about-mindreading-mirroring-and-embedded-cognition/&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Goldman has focused his epistemological efforts on questions of [[social epistemology]], of the different social mechanisms through which knowledge is transmitted in society.  His work in social epistemology has dealt with the law (especially evidence), voting and media, among other topics.  He attempts to provide (in his words) a less radical view of social epistemology than those suggested by [[culture theory|cultural theorists]] and [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] under that name.  His approach uses tools of [[analytic philosophy]] especially [[formal epistemology]] to analyze problems in social knowledge.  Some of this work is summarized in his book ''Knowledge in a Social World''.

===Other work===

Goldman has devoted significant time to showing how research in cognitive science is relevant to a variety of branches of philosophy including epistemology.  Much of this work appears in his books ''Epistemology and Cognition'', ''Philosophical Applications of Cognitive Science'', and ''Simulating Minds''.

The '''argument from poor design''', also known as the '''[[Dysteleology|dysteleological]] argument''', is an argument against the [[Existence of God|existence of]] a [[Creator deity|creator]] [[God]], based on the reasoning that an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and  [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God would not create [[organism]]s with the perceived suboptimal designs that can be seen in nature.

The argument is structured as a basic [[modus tollens]]: if "creation" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.  It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which argues that living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance, so must have been deliberately created by an intelligent God.

Although the phrase "argument from poor design" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as "poor design", "suboptimal design", "unintelligent design" or "[[Dysteleology|dysteology/dysteological]]". The last of these is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism.&lt;ref name="haeckel"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel, in his book ''The History of Creation'', devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of "a theory of the ''unsuitability of parts'' in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the ''suitability of parts''".&lt;ref name="haeckel"/&gt;  The term "incompetent design", a play on "[[intelligent design]]", has been coined by [[Donald Wise]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald |date=2005-07-22 |title="Intelligent" Design versus Evolution |journal=Science |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=556–557 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5734.556c |pmid=16040688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional theological responses generally posit that God's creation was perfect but that humanity's misuse of its [[free will]] to rebel against God&lt;!--[?:], and the consequent damage from hostile spiritual forces,--&gt; has resulted in the corruption of good design.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hahne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K-Ls4CUEWFAC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;f=false ''The Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8, Volume 34'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;f=false ''God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed. Charles Taliaferro, Chad Meister, ''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Philosophical Theology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KJQyhzY4PucC&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;f=false page 160]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|right|Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest.]]

The argument runs that:

# An [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] creator God [[Creation myth|would create]] [[organism]]s that have optimal [[design]].
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

It is sometimes used as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

"Poor design" is consistent with the predictions of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the [[heredity|hereditary]] mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In [[fitness landscape]] terms, natural selection will always push "up the hill", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', 6th ed., Ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; modern proponents have included [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. [[Theistic evolutionists]] generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===In humans===

====Fatal flaws====
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Ectopic.png|250px|thumb|right|[[Regnier de Graaf|Artist's]] representation of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the '[[watchmaker analogy]]'.]]
Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:
* In the human female, a [[zygote|fertilized egg]] can implant into the [[fallopian tube]], [[cervix]] or [[ovary]] rather than the [[uterus]] causing an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the [[vagina|birth canal]] passes through the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the [[baby]]'s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery ([[caesarean section]]), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as [[breech birth]] are worsened by this position of the birth canal.
* In the human male, [[testes]] develop initially within the [[abdomen]]. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the [[scrotum]]. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where [[hernia]]s can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and [[gangrene]], usually resulted in death.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Colby |author2=Loren Petrich |year=1993 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |title=Evidence for Jury-Rigged Design in Nature |publisher=[[Talk.Origins]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/615A4Dvf5?url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of the [[pharynx]], a passage used for both [[ingestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of [[choking]]. 
* The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of [[oxygen]] but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide.  A result is that, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate.
* The human [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] is a [[vestigial organ]] with no known purpose (suggested purposes are either unproven or incidental/non-essential){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and no deleterious effects come from its removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However [[appendicitis]], an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention.

====Other flaws====
* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the [[plantaris muscle]] of the foot,&lt;ref name="selim"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selim |first=Jocelyn |date=June 2004 |title=Useless Body Parts |journal=Discover |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817155923/http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |archivedate=2011-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to [[scoliosis]], [[sciatica]] and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The [[spinal cord]] cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association."

* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own [[vitamin C]], but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene ΨGULO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishikimi M, Yagi K |title=Molecular basis for the deficiency in humans of gulonolactone oxidase, a key enzyme for ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Am.

The gene is also non-functional in other [[primate]]s and in [[guinea pig]]s, but is functional in most other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta Y, Nishikimi M |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochim.

* The prevalence of [[congenital disease]]s and genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]].
* Crowded [[teeth]] and poor [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other [[primates]] and humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with [[wisdom teeth]], which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;"Wisdom Teeth."

* The structure of [[human eye|humans' eye]]s (as well as those of all vertebrates). The [[retina]] is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the ''surface'' of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many [[invertebrate]] species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;Nave, R. "The Retina." of the Human Eye. N.p., n.d.

===Other life===

* In the [[Africa]]n [[locust]], [[nerve]] cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* Intricate reproductive devices in [[orchid]]s, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by [[panda]]s of their enlarged [[sesamoid bone#Other animals|radial sesamoid bones]] in a manner similar to how other creatures use [[thumb]]s.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The route of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the [[aortic arch]]. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the [[giraffe]], this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* The [[Tetrachromacy|loss of tetrachromatic vision]] by mammals as compared to other tetrapods.
* The enzyme [[RuBisCO]] has been described as a "notoriously inefficient" enzyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME |title=Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=449–75 |year=2002 |pmid=12221984 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibited]] by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a [[competitive inhibition|competitive enzyme inhibitor]]. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in [[carbon fixation]], and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Biochemistry: Tackling unintelligent design |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7278 |pages=164–5 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20075906 |doi=10.1038/463164a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The enzyme [[nitrogenase]] actually preferentially binds with [[acetylene]] over di-nitrogen, despite its being the key enzyme used in nitrogen fixation in many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].
* Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly.
* Various [[vestigial]] body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution says the ancestor of whales lived on land).
* [[Turritopsis dohrnii]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] genus have [[biological immortality]], but most animals do not.
* Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a [[supernormal stimulus]] - like a [[moth]] flying into a flame.
* Plants are green and not black, as [[chlorophyll]] absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy.
* [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.
* [[Albatross]]es cannot take off or land properly.

== Criticism ==

===Unproven assumptions===
Several generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument – that a [[Creator deity]] would have designed things 'optimally'.  The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] in the [[Book of Job]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible.  Job 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Book of Job]] goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Optimal design engineering and trade-offs===
Others argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a [[trade-off]] to improve overall optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fazale|first=Rana|title=Responding to a Skeptic|url=http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|accessdate=2018-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927013720/http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific examples===
[[Intelligent design]] proponent [[William Dembski]] questions the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between "intelligent design" and optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dembski |first=William |authorlink=William Dembski |title=Intelligent design: the bridge between science &amp; theology |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8308-2314-X |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[John Woodmorappe]] on the [[Creation Ministries International]] website says that the [[Sesamoid bone|panda's "thumb"]] works well for what the panda uses it for – to strip leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|title=Panda thumbs its nose at the dysteleological arguments of the atheist Stephen Jay Gould - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130704051258/http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[veriform appendix|appendix]] has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.

Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|title=Is our 'inverted' retina really 'bad design'? - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130627193627/http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|title=Mueller cells backwardly wired retina v Dawkins - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130626233057/http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticism==

In addition, the [[plantaris]] muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit. "Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population."&lt;ref name=selim/&gt;

In response to the claim that uses have been found for "junk" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include [[pseudogenes]] that are nonfunctional "junk", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Isaak |year=2004 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |title=Claim CB130 |publisher=Talk.Origins |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911070043/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |archivedate=2006-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original study that suggested that the ''Makorin1-p1'' served some purpose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotsune | first1 = S | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = N | last3 = Chen | first3 = A | last4 = Garrett | first4 = L | last5 = Sugiyama | first5 = F | last6 = Takahashi | first6 = S | last7 = Yagami | first7 = K | last8 = Wynshaw-Boris | first8 = A | last9 = Yoshiki | first9 = A. | year = 2003 | title = An expressed pseudogene regulates the messenger-RNA stability of its homologous coding gene | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6935 | pages = 91–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature01535 | pmid = 12721631 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080425042454/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | archivedate = 2008-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = TA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = A | last3 = Fortin | first3 = PJ | last4 = Nicholls | first4 = RD | year = 2006 | title = The putatively functional Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene is neither expressed nor imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue =  | pages = 12039–12044 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602216103 | pmid = 16882727 | pmc = 1567693 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001043736/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | archivedate = 2007-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=16337157008352528383|title=Google Scholar|author=|date=|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an [[argument against the existence of God]], or against characteristics commonly attributed to a [[creator deity]], such as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of "poor design" (as well as the perceived prodigious "wastefulness" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a "poor" designer, or a "blind" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, "If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda%27s-thumb.html |title=The Panda's Peculiar Thumb |work=NATURAL HISTORY |date=November 1978 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928063454/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda's-thumb.html |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by [[theistic evolutionists]] to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses [[natural selection]] as a mechanism of his creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Collins|Collins, Francis S.]] ''The Language of God'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), 2006. p 191. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a [[false dilemma]], imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of [[intelligent design]] to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry pick]] which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the [[unfalsifiability]] of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|free will]] that caused the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:16 has [[Yahweh]] saying to [[Eve]] "I will increase your trouble in pregnancy").

'''Aurel Thomas Kolnai''' (December 5, 1900 – June 28, 1973&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt;) was a 20th-century philosopher and political theorist.

==Life==
Kolnai was born (as Aurel Stein) in [[Budapest, Hungary]] to Jewish parents, but moved to [[Vienna]] before his twentieth birthday to enter [[Vienna University]], studying under Heinrich Gomperz, Moritz Schlick, Felix Kaufmann, Karl Bühler, and [[Ludwig von Mises]].  It was also at this time that he became attracted to the thinking of [[Franz Brentano]] and the phenomenological thought of Brentano’s student [[Edmund Husserl]].  Kolnai studied under Husserl briefly in 1928 in Freiburg.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolyn Korsmeyer]] and Barry Smith.  “Visceral Values: Aurel Kolnai on Disgust.”  On Disgust  Open Court Publishing Company, a division of Carus Publishing Company: Peru, Illinois.  2004.  Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1920s, Kolnai wrote as an independent scholar with little success.  He graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1926, publishing his dissertation on ''Der Ethische Wert und die Wirklichkeit'', which was received favorably in Germany.  In 1926, he also converted to [[Catholicism]], largely influenced by [[G. K. Chesterton]], whom Kolnai viewed as “a brilliant, if unsystematic phenomenologist of common experience.”&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Daniel J.  “The Recovery of the Common World: An Introduction to the Moral and Political Reflection of Aurel Kolnai.”  Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy.  Lexington Books: Lanham, Maryland.  1999.  Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;   He then began a career of political journalism, writing for ''Der Österreichische Volkswirt'' and ''Die Schöne Zukunft''.  Acutely aware of the real threat posed by the [[Nazi Party]] in Austria, he began writing for ''Der Österreichische Ständestaat'', a periodical founded to combat Nazism and edited by [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]].  During this time, he also published some of his own philosophical writings including his ''Sexualethik'', ''Der Ekel'', ''Der Inhalt der Politik'', and ''Der Versuch über den Haß''.  Kolnai's philosophical writings, though producing little profit for the author, were well received and generated excellent reviews. [[Salvador Dalí]] was impressed by ''Der Ekel''; in a 1932 essay for the journal ''This Quarter'', the painter recommended Kolnai's text strongly to other surrealists, praising its analytical power.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, 'Genaue Imagination', in: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' No. 106 (7 May 2008), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, the encroachment of the Nazi Party in Austria remained a major concern. In 1938, Kolnai published his critique of National Socialism titled ''[[The War Against the West]]''.  The Nazi threat compelled Kolnai to leave Austria in 1937, where he was then a citizen, and depart for [[France]] where he married Elisabeth Gemes in 1940, also a Catholic convert.  The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] threat prevented the newly-wed Kolnai from remaining in France, and after a brief stay in England, Kolnai and his wife moved to [[Quebec]] where he accepted a teaching position at the University of Laval.  Frustrated by what he saw as the oppressive parochial Catholicism and the rigid neo-Thomism, Kolnai left Quebec in 1955 and returned to England on a Nuffield Foundation Travel Grant.  Though he had quite an extensive list of publications in five different languages, Kolnai had little luck finding a permanent professorship in Britain, and fraught with financial worries, his health began to rapidly decline.  Due largely to the influence of Harry Acton, Bernard Williams, and David Wiggins, Kolnai was able to secure a part-time “Visiting Lectureship” at Bedford College at London University.  In England at this time, Kolnai became very influenced by the English common-sense philosophy of G.E. Moore and other British intuitionists such as H.A. Prichard, E.F. Carritt, and W.D. Ross.&lt;ref&gt;David Wiggins and Bernard Williams.  “Aurel Thomas Kolnai.”  Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai.  University of London Athlone Press: 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1961, he received a one-year research fellowship at Birmingham.  In 1968, he accepted a visiting professor position at [[Marquette University]] in [[Wisconsin]] which he maintained until 1973 when he died of a heart attack.  Kolnai’s wife Elisabeth worked on compiling, translating, and publishing his work until her death in 1982.

== Philosophical writings and major themes ==
Kolnai is an eclectic, well-read thinker in the fields of philosophy, economics, and politics.  His major philosophical influences were the phenomenological school of Husserl and British analytic philosophy.  A major theme in his writings is the effort to recover the givenness of reality and the sovereignty of the object in order to develop a common-sense approach to philosophy.  Kolnai drew on the philosophical realism of Thomas Aquinas and believed that Aquinas could provide a valuable contribution to the recovery of broad dialectical objectivism, but he was opposed to the rigidity of 20th century neo-Thomistic orthodoxy and the dogmatic claims of Thomistic ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Daniel J.  “The Recovery of the Common World: An Introduction to the Moral and Political Reflection of Aurel Kolnai.”  Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy.  Lexington Books: Lanham, Maryland.  1999.  Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;   Kolnai’s objectivism rests on four claims:

#The importance of ordinary experience to provide access to the real
#The importance of secular experience and common sense in the standards of ‘tradition’
#The importance of philosophical teachers and Authorities to ‘guide, instruct, and inform’
#The importance of receptivity to the ‘multiplicity of objects and modes of cognition’ to overcome subjectivity&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai.  Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai.  University of London Athlone Press: 1977.  Pages 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolnai was critical of Martin Heidegger’s and Sartre’s existentialism, claiming that “they have nothing to offer but doom-consciousness spiced with a high-sounding idealistic demand—or worse: a new version of the aesthete’s surrender to active barbarism, an espousal of totalitarian tyranny as the next best substitute for the impossible pursuit of total freedom.”&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai.  Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai.  University of London Athlone Press: 1977.  Page 136.  Quoted in Mahoney, “The Recovery of the Common World.”  Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the world was fallen and tension-ridden, Kolnai thought that Christianity should make its concern the secular world, in order to instill in it practical reason and morality, as expressed in a revealing passage in The War Against the West:

''&lt;blockquote&gt;
Personally I am inclined to think that in spite of its Christian polish, Luther’s pessimism is more pagan than Hegel’s pagan optimism, the latter being not entirely foreign to nineteenth-century progressive and constitutionalist views.  For black despair is the very core of overweening arrogance.  It is true that with Luther this is wrapped in the thread-bare guise of reckless belief in God’s grace independent of man’s conduct.  Hegel, on the other hand, preserves some elements of actual morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai, The War Against the West.  Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

Another major theme in Kolnai’s writings is his anti-utopianism.  Daniel Mahoney contextualizes Kolnai’s anti-utopianism among such thinkers as Alain Besançon and Václav Havel as well as Solzhenitsyn who viewed utopian thinking as the ideological underpinning of totalitarianism.  Kolnai explores what he calls the “utopian mind” phenomenologically, which he links with what he calls the “perfectionist illusion,” which is marked by the view that human goods existing in a state of tension can somehow be reconciled.  The reconciliation of value and reality, according to Kolnai “suggests the idea of a rupture between the given reality of the world and the counter-reality ‘set apart.’”&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai, The Utopian Mind.  Page 157.  Quoted in Mahoney “The Recovery of the Common World.”  Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Kolnai thought that the identification of utopianism with a search for justice was misguided, led to the “forced negation of ineliminable tensions.”&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai, The Utopian Mind.  Page 158, 185-95.  Quoted in Mahoney, Ibid, Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The quest for a utopia was, in its essence, a quest for a world no longer fraught with tension or human alienation—a quest which Kolnai saw as doomed to inevitable failure.

Kolnai’s political thought arises from both his phenomenological method and his belief in the importance of philosophy for human life.  His emphasis on common sense and his practical point of view frames his political discussions in which he expresses himself as a genuine conservative, praising such concepts as social privilege and hierarchy.  However, though Kolnai was sympathetic to what he called “the conservative ethos,” he was not a partisan thinker but rather a self-proclaimed centrist opposed to all forms of totalitarianism.  Kolnai had an ongoing concern that unrestrained liberalism would inevitably end in totalitarianism, and his critiques of liberalism as he saw it manifest in the United States and Europe center on preventing such consequences.  While supporting the cause of the liberal West and affirming pluralism, Kolnai also aptly stated that “to love democracy well, it is necessary to love it moderately.”&lt;ref&gt;Manent, Pierre.  Tocqueville and the Nature of Democracy.  Rowman &amp; Littlefield: Lanham, MD.  1996.  Page 32.  Quoted in Mahoney “The Recovery of the Common World.”  Page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolnai’s ethical thought is characterized by strong loves and hates and expressed in terms of values and universal meanings.  Broadly, his ethical thought can be described as Christian imperfectionism opposed to the elevation of morality beyond the everyday life.  The negative character of moral duties was key for Kolnai, as expressed in his treatise on “Morality and Practice II:”

''&lt;blockquote&gt;
When we speak of ‘respecting’ alien property (as also life or rights) we use that word in its weak sense of ‘leaving alone,’ ‘not touching,’ ‘not interfering with,’ much as it is used in French medical language (the rash of typhus fever ‘respects’ the face, i.e. in the soberer style of English textbooks, the face ‘escapes’), not in its strong sense of positive appreciation for something distinctively noble and respectable . . .&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai, “Morality and Practice II.”” Page 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

Kolnai was strongly influenced by Max Scheler’s value ethics, and he thought that if all things were viewed axiologically, assessed first for value, as opposed to the language of ‘ought’ or ‘must,’ then one was provided with “a realm of approbative or disapprobative insights . . . without stressing the unbridgeable gulf between Is and Ought.”  Thus,

''&lt;blockquote&gt;
“value ethics precludes the classic pitfalls in Ethics: Hedonism or Eudemonism; Utilitarianism and Consequentialism of any kind, i.e. the interpretation of moral in terms of allegedly more evident primary, natural cognitive experiences; and various kinds of Imperativism: ‘duty’ cut off from Good and Bad, and its interpretation in terms either of a concrete (social, monarchical, fashionable . . . ) authority, or the ‘rational ego,’ or of ‘Conscience. . . . Axiological ethic directs our attention not only to the plurality of moral values and disvalues, but to the falseness of every monism in regard to the object of moral valuation: be it action, intention, maxim or motive, virtue and vice, character, and all the more of course wisdom or again ontological perfection.”&lt;ref&gt;Kolnai, Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai.  University of London Athlone Press: 1977.  Page xx-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

Kolnai currently remains relatively unknown, but especially in the light of the dialectical return to classical political theory in the writings of Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, as well as the recent debates concerning neo-Conservative philosophy, it is likely that Kolnai will receive increasingly more attention in the near future.  Kolnai has been praised by influential figures such as [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], [[H.B. Acton]], [[Bernard Williams]], and [[Pierre Manent]].

[[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] share significant similarities. Those similarities have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention,{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405-413}} and have also been criticised by concurring schools. The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, though some deny such influences, or see them as expressions of the same eternal truth.&lt;ref&gt;N.V. Isaeva (1993), ''Shankara and Indian Philosophy'', SUNY Press, pages 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta ([[IAST]], ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}''; {{lang-sa|अद्वैत वेदान्त}}; literally, ''[[nondualism|not-two]]'') is the oldest extant sub-school of [[Vedanta]] – an [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] and religious practice. [[Advaita Vedanta|''Advaita'']] {{IAST|''darśana''}} (philosophies, world views, teachings) is one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1988|p=4}} It took shape with the writings of Gaudapada in the 6th century CE.

[[Buddhism]] is a [[religion]]{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=239}} and [[dharma]] that encompasses a variety of [[tradition]]s, [[belief]]s and [[spiritual practice]]s based on [[Original Teachings of the Buddha|teachings]] attributed to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] (5th century BCE), but diversified since then in a wide variety of practices and traditions. Buddhism originated in [[India]], from where it spread through much of [[Asia]]. It [[Decline of Buddhism in India|declined in India]] during the middle ages, after the rise of new forms of Hinduism, including Advaita Vedanta.

==Similarities with Buddhism==
Advaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology and doctrines with Buddhism. Of the various schools, the similarities between Advaita and Buddhism have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention.{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405-413}} Isaeva states in her analysis of scholarly views, that these have historically and in modern times ranged from "Advaita and Buddhism are very different", to "Advaita and Buddhism absolutely coincide in their main tenets", to "after purifying Buddhism and Advaita of accidental or historically conditioned accretions, both systems can be safely regarded as an expression of one and the same eternal absolute truth".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=12-14}}

===Scholarly comments===
Scholars such as Belvalkar, Hiriyanna, Radhakrishnan and Thibaut state that Advaita's and Buddhism's theories on True Reality and [[Maya (illusion)#Mahayana|Maya]] are similar,&lt;ref name=helmithglasenapp2&gt;Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta &amp; Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 2-3, '''Quote:''' "Vedanta and Buddhism have lived side by side for such a long time that obviously they must have influenced each other. The strong predilection of the Indian mind for a doctrine of universal unity has led the representatives of Mahayana to conceive Samsara and Nirvana as two aspects of the same and single true reality; for [[Nagarjuna]] the '''empirical world is a mere appearance''', as all dharmas, manifest in it, are perishable and conditioned by other dharmas, without having any independent existence of their own. Only the indefinable "Voidness" (''Sunyata'') to be grasped in meditation, and realized in Nirvana, has '''true reality''' [in Buddhism]".&lt;/ref&gt; and the influence of Buddhism on Advaita Vedanta has been significant.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}} Both traditions hold that "the empirical world is transitory, a show of appearances",&lt;ref name=helmithglasenapp2/&gt;{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|pp=351-352}} and both admit "degrees of truth or existence".{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=354}} Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions.{{sfn|Loy|1982|pp=65-74}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helmuth von Glasenapp]] writes: "The Buddhist Nirvana is, therefore, not the primordial ground, the eternal essence, which is at the basis of everything and form which the whole world has arisen (the Brahman of the Upanishads) but the reverse of all that we know, something altogether different which must be characterized as a nothing in relation to the world, but which is experienced as highest bliss by those who have attained to it ([[Anguttara Nikaya]], Navaka-nipata 34). Vedantists and Buddhists have been fully aware of the gulf between their doctrines, a gulf that cannot be bridged over. According to [[Majjhima Nikaya]], Sutta 22, a doctrine that proclaims "The same is the world and the self. This I shall be after death; imperishable, permanent, eternal!" (see [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4, 4, 13), was styled by the Buddha a perfectly foolish doctrine. On the other side, the [[Katha Upanishad]] (2, 1, 14) does not see a way to deliverance in the Buddhist theory of dharmas (impersonal processes): He who supposes a profusion of particulars gets lost like rain water on a mountain slope; the truly wise man, however, must realize that his [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is at one with the [[Brahman|Universal Atman]], and that the former, if purified from dross, is being absorbed by the latter, "just as clear water poured into clear water becomes one with it, indistinguishably."&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta &amp; Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frank Whaling states that the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, it includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}

Yet, according to Natalia Isaeva, "Probably because of these similarities, even such an astute Buddhologist as Rozenberg was of the opinion that a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}}

===Concurring schools===
The similarities with Buddhism have been criticised by concurring Indian schools. [[Ramanujacharya]], the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a ''Prachanna Bauddha'', that is, a "crypto-Buddhist",{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405-413}} and someone who was undermining theistic [[Bhakti]] devotionalism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}} The non-Advaita scholar [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] of the Bhedabheda tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as "this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}

Mahadevan states, "At the outset it must be pointed out that, when the critics hurl the charge of pseudo-Buddhism against Advaita, they use the word Buddhism rather in a vague and general sense. The doctrine of unreality of the world, and the theory of non-recognition are found to be common as between the idealistic schools of Buddhism and Advaita. Most critics believe that these are not Upanishadic doctrines, and so, their conclusion is that Advaita must have borrowed them from the Mahayana schools. And the earliest teacher who effected this borrowing, in their view, is Gaudapada."{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285-288}}

==Influence of Mahayana Buddhism==
Scholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], given the common terminology, methodology and some doctrines.{{sfn|Grimes|1998|pp=684–686}} {{harvtxt|Sharma|2000|pp=60–63}} points out that the early commentators on the Brahma Sutras were all [[Philosophical realism|realists]], or [[Pantheism|pantheist]] realists. He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th-6th centuries CE when Buddhist thought developing in the [[Yogacara]] school. [[Eliot Deutsch]] and Rohit Dalvi state:
{{quote|In any event a close relationship between the Mahayana schools and Vedanta did exist with the latter borrowing some of the dialectical techniques, if not the specific doctrines, of the former.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=126, 157}}}}

===Gaudapada===
Scholars are divided on possible Buddhist influence on Gaudapada's writing.

The influence of Mahayana on Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, goes back at least to Gaudapada, where he "clearly draws from Buddhist philosophical sources for many of his arguments and distinctions and even for the forms and imagery in which these arguments are cast".{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=126, 157}}

Gaudapada, in his Karikas text, uses the leading concepts and wording of Mahayana Buddhist school but, states John Plott, he reformulated them to the Upanishadic themes.{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285-288}} The influence of Buddhism on Gaudapada, states {{harvtxt|Plott|2000|pp=285–288}}, is undeniable and to be expected. He writes,
{{Quote|We must emphasize again that generally throughout the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta Dynasty]], and even more so after its decline, there developed such a high degree of syncretism and such toleration of all points of view that Mahayana Buddhism had been Hinduized almost as much as Hinduism had been Buddhaized.}}

Michael Comans states Gaudapada, an early Vedantin, utilised some arguments and reasoning from [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhist texts by quoting them almost verbatim. However, Comans adds there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of [[Dependent Origination]] according to which "everything is without an essential nature (''nissvabhava''), and everything is empty of essential nature (''svabhava-sunya'')", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada's ''Ajativada'' is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which "there exists a Reality (''sat'') that is unborn (''aja'')" that has essential nature (''svabhava'') and this is the "eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman".{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}}

Mahadevan suggests that Gaudapada adopted Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285-288}}

Some scholars suggests that [[Gaudapada]] (6th Century CE) bridged Buddhism and Vedanta, by taking over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|vijñapti-mātra]]''){{refn|group=note|It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only''.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}} and "that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation".{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=60-63}}{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}}{{refn|group=note|1. Something is. 2. It is not. 3. It both is and is not. 4. It neither is nor is not.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.hiartx.com/nagarjunapyrrho.htm Anthony Peter Iannini (2001), ''Nāgārjuna's Emptiness and Pyrrho's Skepticism'']&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Garfield|2003}}}} According to Gaudapada, the Absolute Reality, that is Brahman, is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=127}}&lt;ref name=johnplottghp286&gt;John Plott (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Patristic-Sutra period (325 - 800 AD), Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805507}}, pages 285-288&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] also opines that Gaudapada's philosophy is different from that of Adi Shankara and Badarayan.{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} {{harvtxt|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}, {{harvtxt|Renard|2010|p=157}} and {{harvtxt|Comans|2000|pp=35–36}} suggest that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist concept of [[Ajativada|''ajāta'']] from [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, which uses the term [[Anutpada|''anutpāda'']].{{refn|group=note|''An'' means "not", or "non"; ''utpāda'' means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together ''anutpāda'' means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada, states {{harvtxt|Raju|1992|pp=177–178}}, "wove Buddhist doctrines into a philosophy of the ''Mandukaya Upanisad'', which was further developed by Shankara".{{refn|group=note|The influence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the [[Visuddhimagga]] of Theravada Buddhism tradition contains "some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the [[Yogacara|Yogacarins]]".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206}}}} At the same time, Gaudapada emphatically rejected some theories of the Buddhists, such as the multiplicity and momentariness of consciousnesses, which were core doctrines of the Vijnanavada school, and their techniques for achieving liberation.{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=152–154}} The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is the seeing into the [[Kensho|true nature]] of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are without self-substance".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}}}} An equivalent theory of [[Ajativada|''Ajātivāda'']], "the Doctrine of no-origination"{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=127}}{{refn|group=note|"A" means "not", or "non" as in Ahimsa, non-harm; "jāti" means "creation" or "origination;{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=127}} "vāda" means "doctrine"{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=127}}}} or "non-creation", is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=127}}

Other scholars, however, refute this idea. According to {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}, Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century, state both Murti and Richard King, never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three. While there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different, states {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}.&lt;ref name=iepgauda&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/gauḍapad/ Gaudapada], Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} refutes the argument for Buddhist influence on Gaudapada's philosophy by arguing that the whole purpose of Gaudapada was to demonstrate the ultimate reality of the birth-less and non-dual Atman, a concept foreign to [[Buddhism]]. Scholars such as Murti state that, while there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.{{sfn|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=81}}

===Shankara===
Given the principal role attributed to Shankara in Advaita tradition, his works have been examined by scholars for similarities with Buddhism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|pp=349-352}} Buddhism supporters have targeted Shankara, states {{harvtxt|Biderman|1978|pp=405–413}}, while his Hindu supporters state that "accusations" concerning explicit or implicit Buddhist influence are not relevant. [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]] writes, "If we are to adopt a metaphysical and static view of philosophy there is little difference between Shankara and Vijnanavada Buddhism, so little, in fact that the whole discussion is fairly pointless. But if we try to think our way back into minds of philosophers whose works we read, there is a very real difference between the antagonists".{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405-413}}

[[Ninian Smart]], a historian of religion, quotes Mudgal view that "the differences between Shankara and Mahayana doctrines are largely a matter of emphasis and background, rather than essence".&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart (1992), ''Doctrine and Argument in Indian Philosophy''. Brill, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Ninian Smart is a proponent of the so-called "common core thesis", which states that all forms of mysticism share a common core. See also &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Mysticism, ''Mysticism'']&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://csp.org/chrestomathy/orientalism_and.html Richard King (1999), ''Orientalism and Religion: Postcolonial Theory, India, and 'The Mystic East.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} Mudgal additionally states that the Upanishadic and Buddhist currents of thought "developed separately and independently, opposed to one another, as the orthodox and heterodox, the thesis and antithesis, and a synthesis was attempted by the Advaitin Shankara".&lt;ref&gt;S Mudgal (1975), Advaita of Shankara: A Reappraisal, Motilal Banarasidass, page 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent "different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara."{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}}{{refn|group=note|This development did not end with Advaita Vedanta, but continued in Tantrism and various schools of Shaivism. Non-dual [[Kashmir Shaivism]], for example, was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika,{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=26}}}}

==Differences from Buddhism==

===Atman and anatta===
Advaita Vedanta holds the premise, "Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or ''Anatta'', non-self)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman ("the self")."&lt;/ref&gt; is self evident".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Plott|2000|p=63}}{{refn|group=note|Plott: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism."{{sfn|Plott|2000|p=63}}}}

Buddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;'''[a]''' KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; '''[b]''' Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence."; '''[c]''' Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'', pages 2-4; '''[d]''' Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist ‘No-Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (''maya''), asserting instead the theory of "no-self" and "no-soul".{{sfn|Plott|2000|p=63}}&lt;ref&gt;Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823922406}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the "self, soul" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to ''nirvana'', in its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;{{sfn|Loy|1982|pp=65-74}}

===Epistemology===
The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|p=238}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1966|pp=291–300}}; {{harvnb|Potter|1977|pp=155–174, 227–255}}; {{harvnb|Clayton|2010|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's ''Śabda'' pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.{{sfn|Wayman|1999|pp=xix-xx}}

===Ontology===
Advaita Vedanta is a [[Substance theory|substance ontology]], an ontology "which holds that underlying the seeming change, variety, and multiplicity of existence there are unchanging and permanent entities (the so-called substances)".{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=49-50}} In contrast, [[Buddhism]] is normally understood as a [[Process philosophy|process ontology]], according to which "there exists nothing permanent and unchanging, within or without man".{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=40-50}} {{harvtxt|Kalupahanan|1994}} describes that there is also a current in Buddhism which favours substance ontology and sees [[Madhyamaka]] and [[Yogacara]] as reactions against developments toward substance ontology in Buddhism.

''Advaita'''s three levels of reality theory, states {{harvtxt|Renard|2010|p=130}}, is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika.

The '''Camphill Movement''' is an initiative for social change based on the principles of [[anthroposophy]]. Camphill [[Intentional community|communities]] are residential communities and schools that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with [[developmental disabilities]], mental health problems, or other special needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2013-10-05/news/42721660_1_camphill-soltane-disabilities-communities At Camphill Kimberton, crafting a different way to live - Pilly.com 2013-10-05]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 100 Camphill communities in more than 20 countries across [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Southern Africa]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
The movement was founded in 1939 at Kirkton House near [[Aberdeen]] by a group that included [[Austria]]n [[paediatrician]] [[Karl König]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Jackson, The role of [[social pedagogy]] in the training of residential child care workers, ''Journal of Intellectual Disabilities'', 2006 Vol. 10, No. 1, 61-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holistic Special Education: Camphill Principles and Practice''. 2006, Floris Books, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; It was König's view that every human being possessed a healthy inner personality that was independent of their physical characteristics, including characteristics marking developmental or mental disability, and the role of the school was to recognize, nurture and educate this essential self.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt; The communities' philosophy, [[anthroposophy]], states that "a perfectly formed spirit and destiny belong to each human being."&lt;ref name="BPR"&gt;Busalle, Rebecca, Cornelius Pietzner, and Stephan Rasch. "The life of the soul". ''Aperture'', Summer 1996 n144: 26(10).&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying principles of König's Camphill school were derived from concepts of education and social life outlined decades earlier by [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925).&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;Marga Hogenboom,''Living With Genetic Syndromes Associated With Mental Disability'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are over 100 communities worldwide, in more than 20 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in North America and Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="BPR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Saunders, ''Ecology and Community Design: Lessons from Northern European Ecological Communities'', Alternatives Journal, Vol 22, Apr/May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Camphill Movement takes its name from Camphill Estate in the [[Milltimber]] area of [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], where the Camphill pioneers moved to with their first community for [[Special education in the United Kingdom|children with special needs]] in June 1940. Camphill Estate is now{{when|date=September 2013}} a campus of Camphill School Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114201243/http://www.prpartnership.co.uk/home/default_press.asp?pageid=247 Report Demonstrates Standards of Excellence at Aberdeen Special Needs School], press release, 12 September 2007.

[[File:Tiffany Education (center).JPG|thumb|Science and Religion are portrayed to be in harmony in the [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] window ''[[Education (Chittenden Memorial Window)|Education]]'' (1890).]]
Most sources of knowledge available to early Christians were connected to [[pagan]] world-views. There were various opinions on how Christianity should regard pagan learning, which included its ideas about nature. For instance, among early Christian teachers, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–220) held a generally negative opinion of [[Greek philosophy]], while [[Origen]] (c. 185–254) regarded it much more favorably and required his students to read nearly every work available to them.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Edward B. | contribution = Christianity, History Of Science And Religion | year = 2003 | title = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion | editor-last = Van Huyssteen | editor-first = Wentzel | volume =  | pages = 123–7 | place = | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA  | isbn=978-0-02-865704-2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Historically, Christianity has often been a patron of sciences. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many clergy have been active in the sciences. [[History of Science|Historians of science]] such as [[Pierre Duhem]] credit medieval Catholic mathematicians and philosophers such as [[John Buridan]], [[Nicole Oresme]] and [[Roger Bacon]] as the founders of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. (1984). ''Prelude, Galileo and his Sources. The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science''. N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Duhem concluded that "the mechanics and physics of which modern times are justifiably proud to proceed, by an uninterrupted series of scarcely perceptible improvements, from doctrines professed in the heart of the medieval schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Lindberg |editor-first1=David C. |editor-link1=David C.

== Overview ==
[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|Science, and particularly [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], was linked directly to the divine for most medieval [[scholar]]s. The [[compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of creation.]]
Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp., 11, 14-16, 48-55, 68-69, 90-91, 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], [[beauty]] and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by [[God]], given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68–69 --&gt; [[Robert John Russell]] has examined consonance and dissonance between modern physics, evolutionary biology, and Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Robert John|title=Cosmology: From Alpha to Omega|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=978-0-8006-6273-8|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Christopher C.|year=2008|title=God's Action in Nature's World: Essays in Honour of Robert John Russell|journal=Science &amp; Christian Belief|volume=20|issue=2|pages=214–215|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=34154239&amp;site=ehost-live|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Handmaiden" tradition, which saw secular studies of the universe as a very important and helpful part of arriving at a better understanding of scripture, was adopted throughout Christian history from early on.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 2006, pp. 111–114&lt;/ref&gt; Also the sense that God created the world as a self operating system is what motivated many Christians throughout the Middle Ages to investigate nature.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 2006, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians of science such as [[J.L.

In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries, St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development.

David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg reports that "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led. There was no warfare between science and the church."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Peters, Ted. "Science and Religion". ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' writes that although there is some truth in the "Galileo's condemnation" story but through exaggerations, it has now become "a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ted Peters, "Science and Religion", ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Catholic Church]]'s seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the [[Galileo affair|media]].

A degree of concord between science and religion can be seen in religious belief and empirical science. The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], "Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period "characterized by dramatic revolutions in science" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged. As science advanced, acceptance of a literal version of the Bible became "increasingly untenable" and some in that period presented ways of interpreting scripture according to its spirit on its authority and truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enlightenment |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perspectives on evolution ==

Later that year, a similar law was passed in Mississippi, and likewise, Arkansas in 1927. In 1968, these "anti-monkey" laws were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as unconstitutional, "because they established a religious doctrine violating both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of Rights, Roger E. Salhany, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver:Carswell p. 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientists have rejected creation science for several reasons, including that its claims do not refer to natural causes and cannot be tested. In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that creationism is [[religion]], not science, and cannot be advocated in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;The legislative history demonstrates that the term "creation science," as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html Edwards v.

[[Theistic evolution]] is a discipline that accepts the current scientific understanding of the age of the Earth and the theory of evolution. It includes a range of beliefs, including views described as [[old earth creationism|evolutionary creationism]], which accepts most findings of modern science but also upholds classical religious understandings of God and creation in Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|title=The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief|year=2007|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1-4165-4274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconciliation in Britain in the early 20th century ==
In ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] argues that in contrast to the conflicts between science and religion in the U.S. in the 1920s (most famously the [[Scopes Trial]]), during this period Great Britain experienced a concerted effort at reconciliation, championed by intellectually conservative scientists, supported by liberal theologians but opposed by younger scientists and secularists and [[British Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative Christians]]. These attempts at reconciliation fell apart in the 1930s due to increased social tensions, moves towards [[neo-orthodox]] theology and the acceptance of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J.

In the 20th century, several [[ecumenical]] organizations promoting a harmony between science and Christianity were founded, most notably the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], [[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]], [[Christians in Science]], [[Society of Ordained Scientists|The Society of Ordained Scientists]], and [[Veritas Forum|The Veritas Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

[[File:Gregor Mendel Monk.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gregor Mendel]], Augustinian Friar and scientist, who developed theories on [[genetics]] for the first time.]]
While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981  [[John Paul II]], then [[pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.

One view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are narratives of the Church in relation to [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].

In opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as [[J.L. Heilbron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=J.L. Heilbron|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/contribhome.php?get=heil01 |publisher=London Review of Books |accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alistair Cameron Crombie|A.C. Crombie]], [[David C.

They hold that, not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[medieval university|universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. St.[[Thomas Aquinas]], the Church's "model theologian," argued that reason is in harmony with faith, and that reason can contribute to a deeper understanding of revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Fides et Ratio'' (Faith and Reason), IV|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were [[Jesuit]]s, have been among the leading lights in [[astronomy]], [[genetics]], [[geomagnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], and [[solar physics]], becoming some of the "fathers" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the [[Augustinian]] abbot [[Gregor Mendel]] (pioneer in the study of genetics), [[Roger Bacon]] (a [[Franciscan]] friar who was one of the early advocates of the [[scientific method]]), and Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]] (the first to propose the [[Big Bang]] theory). Other notable priest scientists have included [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Nicholas Steno]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Roger Boscovich]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:[[Henri Becquerel]] who discovered [[radioactivity]]; [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]], [[Ampere]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], pioneers in [[electricity]] and [[telecommunications]]; [[Lavoisier]], "father of modern [[chemistry]]"; [[Vesalius]], founder of modern [[human anatomy]]; and [[Cauchy]], one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of [[calculus]].

Throughout history many [[List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists|Catholic clerics]] have made significant contributions to science.

The [[Jesuit China missions]] of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China. One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were "regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Jesus introduced, according to [[Thomas Woods]], "a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas E.|last=Woods|authorlink=Thomas Woods|title=How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVDR2ZePzvUC&amp;hl=en|publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]]|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2005|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zVDR2ZePzvUC&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22a+substantial+body+of+scientific+knowledge+and+a+vast+array+of+mental+tools+for+understanding+the+physical+universe,+including+the+Euclidean+geometry+that+made+planetary+motion+comprehensible.%22 101]|id={{ISBN|0-895-26038-7}}; {{ISBN|978-089526-038-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another expert quoted by Woods said the scientific revolution brought by the Jesuits coincided with a time when science was at a very low level in China.

== Influence of a biblical world view on early modern science ==
According to [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s [[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]] from the 19th century, a biblical world view affected negatively the progress of science through time. Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself. For instance, when [[Georg Calixtus]] ventured, in interpreting the Psalms, to question the accepted belief that "the waters above the heavens" were contained in a vast receptacle upheld by a solid vault, he was bitterly denounced as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White. History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (Kindle Locations 1970–2132)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, much of the scholarship in which the conflict thesis was originally based is considered to be inaccurate. For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the "handmaiden" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15–18|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;Jeffrey Russell.

Modern scholars regard this claim as mistaken, as the contemporary historians of science [[David C. Lindberg]] and [[Ronald L.

Floris Cohen]], University of Chicago Press 1994, 680 pages, {{ISBN|0-226-11280-2}}, pages 308-321&lt;/ref&gt; He presented Dutch historian [[Reijer Hooykaas|R. Hooykaas]]' argument that a biblical world-view holds all the necessary antidotes for the hubris of Greek rationalism: a respect for manual labour, leading to more experimentation and [[empiricism]], and a supreme God that left nature and open to emulation and manipulation.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; It supports the idea early modern science rose due to a combination of Greek and biblical thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Finally, and most importantly, Hooykaas does not of course claim that the Scientific Revolution was exclusively the work of Protestant scholars."  Cohen(1994) p 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen(1994) p 313. Hooykaas puts it more poetically: "Metaphorically speaking, whereas the bodily ingredients of science may have been Greek, its vitamins and hormones were biblical."&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford historian [[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] is another who has argued that a biblical worldview was significant for the development of modern science.  Harrison contends that Protestant approaches to the book of scripture had significant, if largely unintended, consequences for the interpretation of the book of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science'' (Cambridge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=July 2013}}  Harrison has also suggested that literal readings of the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Fall motivated and legitimated scientific activity in seventeenth-century England.  For many of its seventeenth-century practitioners, science was imagined to be a means of restoring a human dominion over nature that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science'' (Cambridge, 2007); see also Charles Webster, ''The Great Instauration'' (London: Duckworth, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Historian and professor of religion [[Eugene Marion Klaaren|Eugene M. Klaaren]] holds that "a belief in divine creation" was central to an emergence of science in seventeenth-century England. The philosopher [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael Foster]] has published analytical philosophy connecting Christian doctrines of creation with empiricism. Historian William B. Ashworth has argued against the historical notion of distinctive mind-sets and the idea of Catholic and Protestant sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs2edDIGCqEC|title=God and Nature|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians James R. Jacob and Margaret C. Jacob have argued for a linkage between seventeenth century [[Anglican]] intellectual transformations and influential English scientists (e.g., [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Jacob%20&amp;%20Jacob%20Anglican%20Fdn%20of%20Modern%20Science.htm The Anglican Origins of Modern Science], [[Isis (journal)|Isis]], Volume 71, Issue 2, June 1980, 251-267; this is also noted on page 366 of ''Science and Religion'', [[John Hedley Brooke]], 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dillenberger]] and [[Christopher B. Kaiser]] have written theological surveys, which also cover additional interactions occurring in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dillenberger]], ''Protestant Thought and Natural Science'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher B. Kaiser]], ''Creation and the History of Science'' ([[Eerdmans]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of Religion, Richard Jones, has written a philosophical critique of the "dependency thesis" which assumes that modern science emerged from Christian sources and doctrines. Though he acknowledges that modern science emerged in a religious framework, that Christinaity greatly elevated the importance of science by sanctioning and religiously legitimizing it in medieval period, and that Christianity created a favorable social context for it to grow;  he argues that direct Christian beliefs or doctrines were not primary source of scientific pursuits by natural philosophers, nor was Christianity, in and of itself, exclusively or directly necessary in developing or practicing modern science.

[[Oxford University]] historian and theologian [[John Hedley Brooke]] wrote that "when natural philosophers referred to ''laws'' of nature, they were not glibly choosing that metaphor. Laws were the result of legislation by an intelligent deity. Thus the philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) insisted that he was discovering the "laws that God has put into nature." Later Newton would declare that the regulation of the solar system presupposed the "counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke]], ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-23961-3}}, page 19.  See also Peter Harrison, "Newtonian Science, Miracles, and the Laws of Nature", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 56 (1995), 531-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ronald L. Numbers]] stated that this thesis "received a boost" from mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925). Numbers has also argued, "Despite the manifest shortcomings of the claim that Christianity gave birth to science—most glaringly, it ignores or minimizes the contributions of ancient Greeks and medieval Muslims—it too, refuses to succumb to the death it deserves."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Christianity in pulpit and pew'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, [[Ronald L. Numbers]], p. 4, and p.138 n. 3 where Numbers specifically raises his concerns with regards to the works of [[Michael B. Foster]], [[Reijer Hooykaas]], [[Eugene M. Klaaren]], and [[Stanley L. Jaki]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] of [[Baylor University]], argued in contrast that "Christian theology was essential for the rise of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark]], ''For the glory of God: how monotheism led to reformations, science, witch-hunts and the end of slavery'', 2003, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-11436-6}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protestant influence on science ==
[[File:Butler Library - 1000px - AC.jpg|thumb|[[Columbia University]] was established by the [[Church of England]].]]
[[Protestantism]] had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a  positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), ''Robert King Merton'', in ''[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]], Malden, Massachusetts Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0595-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century [[England]] and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory,  Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642-660&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study [[God]]'s influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt;

According of ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, have identified from [[Protestant]] background.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977 , p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population. Thus 72 percent of the seventy-one laureates but about two thirds of the American population were reared in one or another Protestant denomination-)&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Protestant have won a total of 84.2% of all the American Nobel Prizes in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]],&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"/&gt; 60% in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Medicine]],&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"/&gt; 58.6% in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]],&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"/&gt; between 1901 and 1972.

=== Quakers in science ===
{{See also|Quakers in science}}
The Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as [[Quakers]], encouraged some values which may have been conducive to encouraging scientific talents.  A theory suggested by [[David Hackett Fischer]] in his book ''Albion's Seed'' indicated early Quakers in the US preferred "practical study" to the more traditional studies of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[Latin]] popular with the elite. Another theory suggests their avoidance of dogma or clergy gave them a greater flexibility in response to science.

Despite those arguments a major factor is agreed to be that the Quakers were initially discouraged or forbidden to go to the major law or humanities schools in Britain due to the [[Test Act]]. They also at times faced similar discriminations in the United States, as many of the colonial universities had a [[Puritan]] or [[Anglican]] orientation. This led them to attend "Godless" institutions or forced them to rely on hands-on scientific experimentation rather than academia.

Because of these issues it has been stated Quakers are better represented in science than most religions. There are sources, Pendlehill {{harv|Thomas|2000}} and [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], that indicate that for over two centuries they were overrepresented in the [[Royal Society]]. Mention is made of this possibility in studies referenced in [[religiosity and intelligence]] and in a book by Arthur Raistrick. Whether this is still accurate, there have been several noteworthy members of this denomination in science. The following names a few.

== Criticism ==
Events in [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] such as the [[Galileo affair]], associated with the [[Scientific revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], led scholars such as [[John William Draper]] to postulate a [[conflict thesis]], holding that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. This thesis is held by several scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[PZ Myers]], [[Jerry Coyne]], [[Steven Weinberg]], and [[Sean M. Carroll]]. While the conflict thesis remains popular in [[anti-theist]]ic circles, it has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science&lt;ref name="Russel, C.A. 2002 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russel, C.A.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=7|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapin1996&gt;{{cite book| author = Shapin, S.| year = 1996| title = The Scientific Revolution| page = 195| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]| isbn =| quote = In the late Victorian period it was common to write about the ‘warfare between science and religion’ and to presume that the two bodies of culture must always have been in conflict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">'''Creative peacebuilding''' is the larger name for artist approaches to [[peacebuilding]] within individuals, groups, and societies. It includes various forms of [[art therapy]], whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of [[violence]], as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.

== War and conflict ==
According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/|title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.&lt;ref name="Lederach2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL8VDAAAQBAJ|title=The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace|last=Lederach|first=John Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-974758-0|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLGcNb1_H1YC|title=Promoting Peace, Inciting Violence: The Role of Religion and Media|last=Mitchell|first=Jolyon P.|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-55746-7|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishaq|first=Ashfaq|date=December 2006|title=Development of children’s creativity to foster peace|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69915-7/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=368|pages=26–27|via=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art therapy==
Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate [[child soldiers]] in [[Uganda]] as well as to help children who lost their homes in the [[tsunami]] of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prutzman|first=Priscilla|date=October 1981|title=Children's Creative Response to Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x|journal=Peace and Change|volume=7|issue=4|pages=77–79|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[Music therapy]] can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their [[stress (biology)|stress]] levels and express their feelings.&lt;ref name="Sutton2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3jtH_qeIIC|title=Music, Music Therapy and Trauma: International Perspectives|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84310-027-0|editor-last=Sutton|editor-first=Julie P.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual arts ===
Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avrahami|first=Dalia|date=2006|title=Visual Art Therapy's Unique Contribution in the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J229v06n04_02|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|volume=6|issue=4|pages=5–38|doi=10.1300/j229v06n04_02|issn=1529-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visualization and technology ===
If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially [[virtual reality]] simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of [[Iraq War|the Iraq war]] who are suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental [[Creative visualization|visualization]], in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/world/iraq/2007-06-18-iraq-virtual-reality_n.htm|title=Iraq vets use virtual reality to ease post-battle trauma|last=Jones|first=Brent|date=18 June 2007|website=www.usatoday.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Create Peace Project===
Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.createpeaceproject.org|title=Create Peace Project|last=Holzman|first=Ross|date=8 May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barefoot artists===
Artist [[Lily Yeh]] has helped to heal the wounds [[genocide]] left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://barefootartists.org/|title=Barefoot Artists|last=Yeh|first=Lily|date=|website=Barefoot Artists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===River City Drum Corps===
In the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, Ky]] provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rivercitydrumcorpky.com/rcdc/|title=About RCDC|last=|first=|date=|website=River City Drum Corp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dark Side of the Rainbow''' – also known as '''Dark Side of Oz''' or '''The Wizard of Floyd''' – refers to the pairing of the 1973 [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' with the visual portion of the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]].''

== History ==
In August 1995, the ''[[Fort Wayne Journal Gazette|Fort Wayne (Indiana) Journal Gazette]]'' published the first mainstream media article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://members.aol.com/rbsavage/floydwizard.html |title=The Dark Side of the Rainbow |date=August 1, 1995 |newspaper=The Fort Wayne Journal Gazette |first=Charles |last=Savage |via=rbsavage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013213037/http://members.aol.com/rbsavage/floydwizard.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the "[[synchronicity]]", citing the [[Usenet]] discussion group alt.music.pink-floyd. Soon afterward, several fans began creating websites in which they touted the experience and tried to comprehensively catalogue the corresponding moments. A second wave of awareness began in April 1997, when  [[Boston]] [[radio DJ]] [[George Taylor Morris]] discussed "Dark Side of the Rainbow" on the air, leading to further [[mainstream media]] articles and a segment on [[MTV news]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1433194/the-pink-floydwizard-of-oz-connection/|title=The Pink Floyd/Wizard Of Oz Connection|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, the cable channel [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired a version of ''Oz'' with the ''Dark Side'' album as an alternate [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=%28dark%20side%20of%20oz%29%20AND%20date%287/2/2000%20to%207/4/2000%29&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=7/2/2000%20to%207/4/2000%29&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22dark%20side%20of%20oz%22%29Êl_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:DÊl_useweights=no |title=Dark Side of Oz |date=July 3, 2000 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]] has owned the rights to the film since 1986.

== Synchronicity ==
There are various approaches regarding when to start synchronizing ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' audio with the film. Several involve the MGM lion as the cue. Most suggest the third roar, while some prefer the second or first. Others suggest starting the album not immediately after the lion's roar, but after the lion fades to black—exactly when the film begins. Viewing recommendations include reducing the film's audio and using [[Closed captioning|captions]] or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] to follow the dialogue and plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t1489-the-dark-side-of-rainbow.html |title=The Dark Side of the Rainbow |work=All Pink Floyd Fan Network |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709203835/http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t1489-the-dark-side-of-rainbow.html |archivedate=July 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconic [[dispersive prism]] of the album's cover purportedly reflects the movie's transition from black-and-white Kansas to [[Technicolor]] Oz; further examples include music changes at dramatic moments, such as the tornado near the start of the movie aligning with the screaming section of "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]", and thematic alignments such as the scarecrow dance during "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]". This synergy effect has been described as an example of [[synchronicity]], defined by the psychologist [[Carl Jung]] as a phenomenon in which coincidental events "seem related but are not explained by conventional mechanisms of causality." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/synchronicity |title=synchronicity – Definition |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detractors argue that the phenomenon is the result of the mind's tendency to think it recognizes patterns amid disorder by discarding data that does not fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mdarkside.html |title=Does the music in Pink Floyd's ''Dark Side of the Moon'' coincide with the action of ''The Wizard of Oz''? |work=The Straight Dope |date=May 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists refer to this tendency as [[apophenia]], or [[confirmation bias]]. In this theory, a Dark Side of the Rainbow enthusiast will focus on matching moments while ignoring the greater number of instances where the film and the album do not correspond.

== Coincidence versus intent ==
Pink Floyd band members have repeatedly said that the reputed phenomenon is coincidence. In an interview for the 25th anniversary of the album, guitarist/vocalist [[David Gilmour]] denied the album was intentionally written to be synchronized with the film, saying "Some guy with too much time on his hands had this idea of combining ''Wizard of Oz'' with ''Dark Side of the Moon''."&lt;ref name="response"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.cox.net/stegokitty4/sounds/dv_dsotmwo-oz.mp3 |title=David Gilmour interview |accessdate=November 19, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505004534/http://members.cox.net/stegokitty4/sounds/dv_dsotmwo-oz.mp3 |archivedate=May 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On an [[MTV]] special about Pink Floyd in 2002, the band dismissed any relationship between the album and the movie, saying there were no means of reproducing the film in the studio at the time they recorded the album.

''Dark Side of the Moon'' [[Audio engineering|audio engineer]] [[Alan Parsons]] in 2003 dismissed the supposed effect:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was an American radio guy who pointed it out to me. It's such a non-starter, a complete load of eyewash. I tried it for the first time about two years ago. One of my fiancée's kids had a copy of the video, and I thought I had to see what it was all about. I was very disappointed. The only thing I noticed was that the line "balanced on the biggest wave" came up when Dorothy was kind of tightrope walking along a fence. One of the things any audio professional will tell you is that the scope for the drift between the video and the record is enormous; it could be anything up to twenty seconds by the time the record's finished. And anyway, if you play any record with the sound turned down on the TV, you will find things that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=John |last=Harris |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons |title="Dark Side" at 30: Alan Parsons: Pink Floyd |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date= March 12, 2003 |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112644/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pink Floyd drummer [[Nick Mason]] told [[MTV]] in 1997, "It's absolute nonsense. It has nothing to do with ''The Wizard of Oz''. It was all based on [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433194/pink-floydwizard-oz-connection.jhtml |title=The Pink Floyd/Wizard Of Oz Connection |date=May 30, 1997 |work=MTV |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical considerations ==
Film critic [[Richard Roeper]] published his assessment of the phenomenon, which he referred to as "Dark Side of Oz." Roeper concluded that while the band may have had the resources and technical know-how to produce an alternative film soundtrack, undergoing such an endeavor would have been highly impractical. Roeper also noted the technical issue of the roughly 43-minute ''Dark Side of the Moon'' being short compared to the 101-minute ''The Wizard of Oz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Roeper |first=Richard |title=Urban Legends |publisher=New Page Books |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd]]'', Nick Mason noted that the band was becoming proficient at creating movie soundtracks by the time they started the recording of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', and that they even interrupted their work on the album so they could score yet another film. He explained the technical process that Pink Floyd used to score movies when he wrote about the recording of the 1972 ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'' movie soundtrack:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the success of ''[[More (soundtrack)|More]]'', we had agreed to do another sound track for [[Barbet Schroeder]]. His new film was called ''[[La Vallée (film)|La Vallée]]'' and we travelled over to France to record the music in the last week of February... We did the recording with the same method we had employed for ''More'', following a rough cut of the film, using stopwatches for specific cues and creating interlinking musical moods that would be cross-faded to suit the final version... The recording time was extremely tight. We only had two weeks to record the soundtrack with a short amount of time afterwards to turn it into an album.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Variations on the theme ==
The fame of Dark Side of the Rainbow has prompted some to search for synchronicities among other albums by other bands and films by other directors.  The lengthy Pink Floyd song "[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]" from the 1971 album ''[[Meddle]]'' has been paired with "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite," the fourth act in the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]].''  Again the correspondences are primarily formal/structural and not grounded in the content of the lyrics. Both the track and the sequence are approximately 23 minutes.&lt;ref name="Shaffner"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shaffner | first = Nicholas | title = Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey | publisher = [[Harmony Books]] | year = 1991 | page = 142 | isbn = 0-517-57608-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian Matt Herzau claims that the [[Pixar]] film ''[[WALL-E]]'' syncs up with Pink Floyd's rock opera ''[[The Wall]],'' which he has called "Another Brick in the WALL-E", after the album's three-part song "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2009/jul/22/dark-side-moon-and-wall-e-sync-fans-claim/ |title=Another Brick in the Wall-E?

Additionally, [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]] by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] has been synced up with this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://vimeo.com/3497479 |title=Oraelius |date=March 6, 2009 |work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian dance music artist [[Rich Aucoin]]'s second album ''Ephemeral'' (released September 2014 in North America) is an adaptation of the themes of the novella ''[[The Little Prince]]'' and is meant to sync up to the 1979 short [[claymation]] film of the same name, along the lines of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' and ''The Wizard of Oz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/rich_aucoin_details_ephemeral |first=Alex |last=Hudson |date=June 18, 2014 |title=Rich Aucoin Details 'Ephemeral,' Premieres New Single |work=exclaim.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French avant-jazz band Ghost Rhythms's third album ''Madeleine'' is meant to sync up with Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3hZAW5YRHI |title=negativertigo |date=March 24, 2015 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 Disney film [[Treasure Planet]] is said to link up with [[The Mars Volta]]'s debut album [[De-Loused In The Comatorium]], in rare form, where several themes and lyrics are highlights. 

After the final two parts of ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks: The Return]]'' aired on Sunday, September 4, 2017, a rumor developed on social media advancing the theory that the final two parts (17 &amp; 18) were meant to be watched and interpreted simultaneously. During a Reddit interview on September 10, 2017, ''The Return'''s executive producer Sabrina S. Sutherland summarily dismissed these rumors, saying "This is definitely not the way to watch these parts", although later leaving the possibility somewhat more open-ended by conceding "Maybe it's something I'm not aware of - could be. I'm not infallible!"

Podcaster [[Griffin McElroy]] jokingly watched the film ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]'' alongside ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' as part of the eternal podcast "Til Death do us Blart," noting several thematic, rhythmic, and lyrical synchronicities. McElroy described the viewing as "a religious experience." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7wyfTsIm1k |last= MACROTAH |title=BLART Side of the MALL |date=November 23, 2017 |work=YouTube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'s 2008 episode on the video game adaptation of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (video game)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', all the episode's events are deliberately synced up to Pink Floyd's ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' if one plays the first four songs of the album in sync to this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemassacre.com/2008/08/04/dark-side-of-the-nerd/ |title=Dark Side of the Nerd |work=Cinemassacre |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 film ''[[Fun Size]]'', the main character ([[Victoria Justice]]) decides to dress as Dorothy for a high school [[Halloween]] party after listening to ''The Dark Side of the Moon''. The film briefly includes a visual clip of the album in its record form.

In a 2014 [[Drum Corps International]] show, performed by the [[Colts Drum and Bugle Corps|Colts]], Dark Side of the Rainbow is portrayed as a world in which the Scarecrow rules Oz after Dorothy has left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kinoshita |first1=Steve |title=Corps Repertiore |url=http://www.corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsyr&amp;corps=36&amp;yearqry=2014&amp;corpstype=Junior |website=corpseps.com |accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Daughters of Wisdom''' is a [[Catholic]] organisation founded  by Saint [[Louis de Montfort]] and Blessed [[Marie Louise Trichet]].

==History==
In 1707, when he was temporary chaplain of the hospital of [[Poitiers]], Louis de Montfort assembled some pious young women into a small community, and gave them a rule to live by. Its main points have been retained in the Rule of the Daughters of Wisdom. The congregation strives to acquire heavenly wisdom by imitating the Incarnate Wisdom, [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Bemelmans&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15668a.htm Bemelmans, John. "Daughters of Wisdom." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 Sept. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

When St Louis died in 1716, the community numbered only four sisters, led by Blessed Marie Louise Trichet who had met Louis de Montfort in 1701 and became known as the "First Daughter of Wisdom" when she offered her services to the hospital. Her mother is said to have told her: "You will become as mad as that priest". There followed a forty-three year career during which she nursed the sick, gave food to beggars and administered the great maritime hospital of France. The poor people of the Hospital of [[Niort]] (Deux-Sèvres) called her "good Mother Jesus". In 1714, she was joined by Catherine Brunet.&lt;ref name=companyuk&gt;[http://www.montfort.org.uk/Life_MLT.php "Life of Blessed Marie-Louise Trichet", Company of Mary, Vice-Province of Great Britain and Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1715, at the request of the Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of La Rochelle and Saintes|La Rochelle]], the sisters moved to that city. Henceforth the congregation undertook both care of the sick and teaching. Sister Marie-Louise was superior of the congregation. On 22 August 1715, Montfort gave the habit of Wisdom to Sister Ste Croix and Sister Incarnation. In 1720 the site of their mother-house was acquired at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre]]. Henceforth the life of Marie-Louise was to be a series of travels necessitated by new foundations and by visits to all her communities; in 1750 there were already thirty. She died on 27 April 1759.&lt;ref name=Bemelmans/&gt; 

By the time of the [[French Revolution]], the sisters numbered 700. During the Revolutionary era, they were severely persecuted and imprisoned. Two sisters were [[guillotine]]d at [[Nantes]]; and another two, Sisters Véronique and Jouin, at [[Rennes]].&lt;ref name=Bemelmans/&gt; Under [[Napoleon]], the community regained most of their former houses and were granted 30,000 francs for building purposes. It was in 1810, when Napoleon was temporarily the master of Europe, that, at his call, the Daughters of Wisdom left French soil for the first time to nurse wounded soldiers at [[Antwerp]]. Numerous medals were bestowed on the congregation by Napoleon, and by every French Government since; Spain, Prussia, and Belgium have honoured them for nursing the wounded or plague-stricken soldiers of those countries; as a congregation they have been acknowledged in the Apostolic Brief of [[Pope Leo XII]] in 1825; they were canonically approved, together with the Fathers of the [[Company of Mary]], in 1853; they were placed under Cardinal [[Vincenzo Vannutelli]] as protector, and favoured by two important decrees in 1893 and 1898 securing the integrity of Montfort's institution; and they received the definitive approbation of the constitutions of Montfort's double foundation in 1904.

Since then the Daughters of Wisdom has grown to a multinational organisation with houses across the world.

'''''The Dhammapada: With introductory essays, Pali text, English translation and notes''''' is a 1950 book written by [[philosopher]] and (later) [[President of India]], Dr. [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] (1888–1975), about the [[Dhammapada]], an important [[Buddhist]] [[scripture]]. Originally published in 1950 by [[Oxford University Press]], the book has been republished numerous times by the same publisher, most recently in 1997. A 2007 Indian edition was published by [[Pilgrims Publishing]]. The book has been reviewed in several professional journals.&lt;ref name=ashby52/&gt;&lt;ref name=stede52/&gt;&lt;ref name=brough51/&gt;&lt;ref name=horner51/&gt; All editions have had 194 pages and have used the same title.

==Outline of book==
[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan's]] ''Dhammapada'' contains original [[Pali]] text as well as English translations of the [[Dhammapada|Dhammapada's]] 26 chapters. It begins with a preface composed in 1950 in which Radhakrishnan states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To-day... We have come to recognize that it is either one world or none. The effort to build one world requires a closer understanding among the peoples of the world and their cultures. This translation of the ''[[Dhammapada]]''... is offered as a small contribution to world understanding. The central thesis of the book, that human conduct, [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|righteous behaviour]], reflection, and [[meditation]] are more important than vain speculations about the transcendent - has an appeal to the modern mind.... Books so rich in significance... require to be understood by each generation in relation to its own problems.&lt;ref name=rk50&gt;First edition (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|v}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The preface also states that  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The ''Dhammapada'''s] teaching - to repress the instincts entirely is to generate neuroses; to give them full rein is also to end up in neuroses - is supported by [[History of psychology|modern psychology]].&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|v}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Next is a 57-page introduction that is divided into two main sections. The first introductory section, less than 3 pages in length, is entitled simply "The ''Dhammapada''," and briefly summarizes the ''Dhammapada'''s historical context, noting that its verses connect with incidents in the Buddha's life "and illustrate the method of teaching adopted by him."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|3}} The second section, entitled "Gautama the Buddha,"&lt;ref&gt;"The second Introductory Essay on ''Gautama the Buddha'' is reprinted with the kind permission of the British Academy from the ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', Volume XXIV, being the Annual Lecture on a Master Mind delivered on 28 June 1938." p. vi, Radhakrishnan's 1950 Preface).&lt;/ref&gt; has several subsections:
:*I. Life (pp. 4-15). Contains a biographical outline of the Buddha's early life, marriage, renunciation, search for and encounter with truth, founding of his order, some major manners and themes of his teaching, and passing away. Notes that "the Buddha was more definitely opposed to Vedic orthodoxy and ceremonialism than was Socrates to the State religion of Athens, or Jesus to Judaism, and yet he lived till eighty.... Perhaps the Indian temper of religion is responsible for the difference in the treatment of unorthodoxies."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|15}}
:*II. The Four Truths (pp. 15-26). Describes the [[Four Noble Truths]] taught in Buddhism, that 1) sorrow (''[[duhkha]]'') is pervasive in life as we know it, 2) Sorrow has a cause (''[[samudaya]]''), 3) sorrow can be removed (''[[nirodha]]''), and there is a path (''[[Noble Eightfold Path|marga]]'') beyond sorrow, the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]].&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|16}}
:*III. The Buddha and the [[Upanishads|Upaniṣads]] (pp. 26-35). "Gautama the Buddha," Radhakrishnan argues, "has suffered as much as anyone from critics without a sense of history. He has been cried up, and cried down, with an equal lack of historical imagination."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|26}} He explains that "To know what the Buddha actually taught or what his earliest followers thought he did, we must place ourselves in imagination in the India of the sixth century B.C.... Great minds make individual contributions of permanent value to the thought of their age; but they do not, and cannot, altogether transcend the age in which they live.... Even when they are propounding answers which are startlingly new, they use the inadequate ideas and concepts of tradition to express the deeper truths towards which they are feeling their way."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|26}} He quotes the Buddha as stating that "'there are... four truths of the [[Brahmin|Brāhmins]] which have been realized by me... and made known"&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref name=brahmins&gt;"'there are these four truths of the [[Brahmin|Brāhmins]] which have been realized by me by my own higher knowledge and made known (''Aṅguttara'', iv. 195; ''Saṁyutta'', xxii. 90). He characterizes his ''[[dharma]]'' as ancient (''purāṇa'') - as eternal (''ṥāṥvata'' or ''sanātana''). He compares it to the discovery of an old buried forgotten city (''Nagara Sutta''). He is said to be a knower of the Veda (''vedajña'') or of the [[Vedānta]] (''vedāntajña'') (''Saṁyutta'', i. 168; ''Sutta Nipāta'', 463)." (p. 29, footnote 1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muller&gt;Radhakrishnan quotes [[Max Müller]] (1901), who states that Buddhism is "the highest Brāhmanism popularized, everything esoteric being abolished, the priesthood replaced by monks, and these monks being in their true character the successors and representatives of the enlightened dwellers in the forest of former ages" (Müller, ''Last Essays'', 2nd series, p. 121).&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the Buddha's teaching "is derived"&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|29}} from the [[Upanishads|Upaniṣads]].
:*IV.  Metaphysical Views (pp. 35-52). Notes that "the Buddha discouraged doctrinal controversies as prejudicial to inward peace and ethical striving."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|35}} Discusses attempts to view the Buddha as adhering to various [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] positions, especially 1) [[agnosticism]], 2) [[atheism]], or 3) belief in a "transempirical reality in the universe" and a "time-transcending element in the self."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|36}} Argues that the third interpretation (belief in a transempirical reality) is most consistent with what is known of the Buddha.
:*V. Spiritual Absolutism (pp. 52-57). Here, Radhakrishnan states that "The tradition of teaching by silence has been an ancient one in India,"&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|52}} and argues that "If the Buddha declined to define the nature of this absolute or if he contented himself with negative definitions, it is only to indicate that absolute being is above all determinations. It is difficult to differentiate this supreme being from the Absolute ''[[Brahman]]'' of [[Advaita Vedanta]] or the super-God of [[Christian mysticism]] as formulated in the writings of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|pseudo-Dionysius]]."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|52–53}} "The Buddha's reasons for his silence are quite intelligible,"&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|54}} states Radhakrishnan, and he enumerates five motives for the Buddha's silence.&lt;ref name=fivereasons&gt;1. A climate of bold speculation, pungent speech in which "it was difficult to draw a shap line between the supersititon of the ignorant and the sophistry of the learned" (p. 54); 2. Doctrinal controversies could distract from the need for each adherent to realize the truth by personal effort; 3. The Buddha's mission was "to interest not merely the intellectuals, but the common people" (pp. 54-55); 4. "Fourthly, the affirmative theology, in its anxiety to bring the absolute into relation with the relative, makes the absolute itself relative." (p. 55); 5. "Fifthly, the nature of absolute reality is supra-logical, and it is idle to insist on giving logical accounts of it" (p. 55).&lt;/ref&gt;

|(The mental) natures are the result of what we have thought, are chieftained by our thoughts, are made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, sorrow follows him (as a consequence) even as the wheel follows the foot of the drawer (i.e. the ox which draws the cart). [1]

|If, by surrendering a pleasure of little worth one sees a larger pleasure, the wise man will give up the pleasure of little worth, and look to the larger pleasure. [290]
|}Also in the fifth section, Radhakrishnan offers his interpretation of three "inadequacies" or "exaggerations" in the Buddha's thought, which "revealed themselves in [Buddhism's] later history and relation to Hinduism."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|56}} These are that i) "Philosophy is a natural necessity of the human mind,"&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|56}} and the Buddha's hearers were unable to adopt suspended judgement on the ultimate questions; ii) "The Buddha's conception of ''[[dharma]]'' as the absolute reality was not sufficiently concrete for practical purposes";&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|56}} and iii) The Buddha taught that one could renounce householder duties at any age. Radhakrishnan states that these "exaggerations" are understandable if we realize that in the Buddha's time, attempts to lead the spiritual life had to contend with "three great enemies... the theologians, the ritualists, and the worldlings."&lt;ref name=rk50/&gt;{{rp|56}}

The largest part of the book (pp.&amp;nbsp;58–187) consists of a romanized transliteration of the original [[Pali]] text, plus a verse-by-verse English translation. Two examples are shown in the table at right. Many verses are augmented with footnotes or are followed by commentary, presented in a smaller font size than the verses themselves. The book concludes with a short selected bibliography, a 4-page [[Pali]] index (indicating which verses contain a specified word), and a 2-page general index.

Ashby stated that "the distinct contribution of this volume is the Introduction,"&lt;ref name=ashby52/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuller quote: "As is so often the case in new translations of works previously available, the distinct contribution of this volume is the Introduction..." (Ashby, p. 147).&lt;/ref&gt; where "[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] sets out in clear and penetrating fashion to give the reader a basic understanding of the thought-world in which Buddhist ethical teaching moves. His discussion of the relation of the teachings of the Buddha to the [[Upanishads]] and his examination of the [[Buddhist philosophy|metaphysical views]] of [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]] will prove valuable ... [and his] insistence upon the positive nature of the Buddhist conception of [[Nirvana]] is recommended reading for... victims of the 'annihilation-extinction' theory of Nirvana."&lt;ref name=ashby52/&gt;

Horner noted that the same Pali word is translated differently by Radhakrishnan in different places. "[[Pali]] technical terms are, of course, recognized to contain a subtle variety of meanings. Some of these will be appreciated by anyone making... the reasonably intensive study of this volume which it deserves as well as makes possible."&lt;ref name=horner51/&gt;{{rp|123}} For example, "Professor Radhakrishnan translates ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma]]'' in the text by 'virtue' and by 'law.... Thus, ''[[asava]]'' is rendered by 'passions', 'taints', 'impurities', and... ''[[Samadhi]]'' is usually 'tranquillity', once (ver. 271) 'meditative calm'."&lt;ref name=horner51/&gt;{{rp|123}}

Brough described the book as "a convenient presentation of the Pali text, and... a useful introduction to the work for beginners in Pali," although "a comprehensive textual study in the light of the Tibetan and Central Asian parallel verses is still awaited."&lt;ref name=brough51/&gt;{{rp|1067}}

In the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', Stede stated that "On the whole, the translation is clear and accurate."&lt;ref name=stede52/&gt;{{rp|377}} She added that the translated verses are "frequently... supplemented by explanations taken from the early commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] and by comparative passages selected from philosophical and theological texts of East and West. Although perhaps too numerous, these extraneous references give evidence of the translator's wide learning."&lt;ref name=stede52/&gt;{{rp|377}}

In Buddhism, the '''eight precepts''' ({{lang-sa|aṣṭāṇga-śīla or aṣṭā-sīla|italic=yes}}, {{lang-pi|aṭṭhaṅga-sīla or aṭṭha-sīla|italic=yes}}) is a list of precepts that are observed by lay devotees on observance days and festivals.

== Description ==
The first five of the eight precepts are similar to the [[five precepts]], that is, to refrain from killing living beings, stealing, wrong speech and to abstain from intoxicating drink or drugs,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religions{{nowrap| –}} Buddhism: Theravada Buddhism |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/subdivisions/theravada_1.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=30 November 2018 |date=2 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the third precept is [[brahmacharya|abstinence of all sexual activity]] instead of refraining from sexual offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tucci |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Kitagawa |first2=Joseph M. |title={{nowrap|Buddhism -}} Popular Religious Practices |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism/Popular-religious-practices |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=30 November 2018 |date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final three precepts are to abstain from eating at the wrong time (after midday); to abstain from entertainment such as dancing, singing, music, watching shows, as well as to abstain from wearing garlands, perfumes, cosmetics, and personal adornments; and to abstain from luxurious seats and beds.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=22}}{{sfn |Getz |2004 |p=673}}

To surmise, following anthropologist {{ill|Barend Terwiel's|de|Barend Jan Terwiel}} translation from [[Pali|Pāli]] language used in Thai ceremonies:
{{blockquote|
# "I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from taking life
# I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from taking what is not given
# I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from unchastity
# I undertake (to observe) the rule of abstinence from false speech
# I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from intoxicants which cause a careless frame of mind
# I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from taking food at the wrong time
# I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from dancing, music, visiting shows, flowers, make-up, the wearing of ornaments and decorations
# I undertake [to observe] the rule of abstinence from a tall, high sleeping place."{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=191}}}}

In Thailand, when the eight precepts are taken, it is believed that if one of them is broken, they are all broken.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=201}} In some medieval Chinese texts, the order of the last three items is different, though the precepts are the same.{{sfn |McBride |2014 |loc=Buddhist Rituals}}

According to ethicist [[Damien Keown]], the eight precepts were derived from the regulations described in the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta]]'', an [[Early Buddhist Texts|Early Buddhist Text]].&lt;!--28-30--&gt; Since in this [[sutra|discourse]] the Buddha describes his own behavior, Keown argues that the eight precepts and several other moral doctrines in Buddhism are derived from the Buddha as a model figure.&lt;!--31--&gt;{{sfn |Keown |2016 |pp=28{{en dash}}31}}

== Practice ==
On regular [[uposatha|observance days]] ({{lang-sa|poṣadha|link=no}}, {{lang-pi|uposatha|link=no}}), Buddhist lay devotees often observe the eight precepts. In that context, the eight precepts are also called the '''uposatha vows''' (Sanskrit and {{lang-pi|upavāsa|italic=yes |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|poṣadhaśīla|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-pi|uposatha-sīla|italic=yes |link=no}}).{{sfn |Keown |2004 |loc=Uposatha}}{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Aṣṭāṅgasamanvāgataṃ upavāsaṃ}} When laypeople stay in a Buddhist monastery&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; or go on a meditation retreat,{{sfn |Surinrut |Auamnoy |Sangwatanaroj|2017 |p=650}} they also observe the eight precepts often; they are also upheld during yearly festivals such as [[Vesak]].{{sfn |Vithararta |1990 |pp=230{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Baguan zhai}} Presently, the ''uposatha'' vows are mostly associated with Theravāda Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; but it was a widespread practice in China as well,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Baguan zhai}} and is still practiced.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=88}} In practice, in Theravāda traditions, the precepts are mostly observed by faithful devotees above 40 years of age.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=87}} Since the eight precepts are often  observed for one day, they are also known as the '''one-day precepts'''.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Upavāsa}} Sometimes a formula is recited confirming the observance for one day (and one night):

{{blockquote|"I undertake to observe in harmony during this day and this night these eight precepts that have been designed by the wisdom of the Buddha."{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=191}}}}

Observance does not need to be temporary, however: some lay devotees choose to  undertake the eight precepts continuously to improve themselves in morality.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |p=673}} Furthermore, many nuns in Buddhist countries, such as the ''[[mae chi]]'' in Thailand or the ''[[dasa sil mata]]'' in Sri Lanka, observe the eight or ten precepts all the time as part of their way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |via=Encyclopedia.com |title=Nuns: Buddhist Nuns |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/nuns-buddhist-nuns |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |accessdate=1 December 2018 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |via=Encyclopedia.com |title=Nuns |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/nuns |publisher=[[Gale Group]] |accessdate=1 December 2018 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The [[Pali Canon|Pāli texts]] describe that one undertakes the eight precepts on the observance days following the example of the [[arhat|enlightened disciples of the Buddha]].{{sfn |Witanachchi |2003 |p=555}} The eight precepts are meant to give lay people an impression of what it means to live as a monastic,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Aṣṭāṅgasamanvāgataṃ upavāsaṃ}} and the precepts "may function as the thin end of a wedge for attracting some to monastic life."{{sfn |Whitaker|Smith|2018 |loc=Ethics (sīla)}} People who are observing the eight precepts are sometimes also addressed differently.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=192}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=78}} The objective of the eight precepts is different from the five in that they are less moral in nature, but more focused on developing [[samadhi|meditative concentration]], and preventing distractions.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=87}} Indeed, in Sri Lanka, lay devotees observing the eight precepts are expected to spend much time and effort on meditation, focusing especially on [[Patikulamanasikara|meditation on the parts of the body]]. This is intended to develop detachment.{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |pp=314, 329}}

Among the eight precepts, the third precept is about maintaining chastity. Buddhist tradition therefore requires lay people to be chaste on observance days,&lt;!--201--&gt; which is similar to the historical Indian tradition of being chaste on ''[[parvan (Indian history)|parvan]]'' days. As for the sixth rule, this means not having food after midday, in imitation of a [[Patimokkha#Pacittiya|nearly identical rule]] for monks. Fluids are allowed.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=201{{en dash}}2}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=87}} The seventh precept is sometimes also interpreted to mean not wearing colorful clothes, which has led to a tradition for people to wear plain white when observing the eight precepts.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=87}}{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ugraparipṛcchā}} This does not necessarily mean, however, that a Buddhist devotee dressed in white is observing the eight precepts all the time.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=187, n.16}} As for the eighth precept, not sitting or sleeping on luxurious seats or beds, this usually comes down to sleeping on a mat on the floor. Though not specified in the precepts themselves, in Thailand and China, people observing the precepts usually stay in the temple overnight. This is to prevent temptations at home which break the eight precepts, and helps foster the community effort in upholding the precepts.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Terwiel |2012 |p=203}} and {{harvtxt |Harvey |2000 |p=87}}. Only Harvey mentions China, and the sitting.}}

== History ==
In 6th-century Korea, the eight precepts came to be associated with worship of [[Maitreya]], due to the work of Hyeryang, a Korean monk that wrote a tract about these matters.{{sfn |McBride |2014 |loc=Buddhist Rituals}} In the late 1800s in Sri Lanka, there was a renewed interest in the tradition of observing the eight precepts, during the time of the [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka#Buddhist revival|Buddhist revival]]. This was mostly because of the influence of [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who observed the ten precepts (similar to the eight) continuously, maintaining a status between lay person and monk.{{sfn |Harvey |2013 |pp=378{{en dash}}9}} The interest was further fostered by campaigns emphasizing Buddhist religious practice on [[poya|traditional observance days]].{{sfn |Bloss |1987 |p=8}}

[[File:Therapeutic horseback riding 2.JPG|thumb|Equine-assisted therapy has been used by medical professionals such as occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, social workers, and recreational therapist ]]

'''Equine-assisted therapy''' ('''EAT''') encompasses a range of treatments that involve activities with horses and other [[equine]]s to promote human physical and mental health.&lt;ref name=PATHaboutEAAT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.pathintl.org/resources-education/resources/eaat/60-resources/efpl/201-what-is-efpl

| author     = Smith, Cher
| accessdate = 16 January 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of EAT has roots in antiquity, and EAT applies to physical health issues in modern form dates to the 1960s.  Modern use of horses for mental health treatment dates to the 1990s.  [[Systematic review]] of studies of EAT as applied to physical health date only to about 2007, and a lack of common terminology and standardization has caused problems with [[meta-analysis]].&lt;!--sourced in body--&gt; Due to a lack of high-quality studies assessing the efficacy of equine-assisted therapies for mental health treatment, concerns have been raised that these therapies should not replace or divert resources from other evidence-based mental health therapies.&lt;ref name=anestis /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson2016" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
An overall term that encompasses all forms of equine therapy is Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapy (EAAT).&lt;ref name=autism /&gt; Various therapies that involve interactions with [[horse]]s and other equines are used for individuals with and without special needs, including those with physical, cognitive and emotional issues.&lt;ref name=PATHaboutEAAT&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within that framework, the more common therapies and terminology used to describe them are:

* '''Therapeutic horseback riding''' uses a therapeutic team, usually including a certified therapeutic riding instructor, two or more volunteers, and a horse, to help an individual ride a horse and work with it on the ground.&lt;ref name=autism /&gt;
* '''Hippotherapy''' involves an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, or a speech and language therapist working with a client and a horse. Different movements of the horse present challenges to the client to promote different postural responses of the client by the horse influencing the client rather than the client controlling the horse.&lt;ref name=autism /&gt;  &lt;!--this is here because there is confusion over the definition, take to talk--&gt; The word "Hippotherapy" is also used in some contexts to refer to a broader realm of equine therapies.&lt;ref name="aetna_cpb"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Equine-assisted learning''' (EAL) is described as an "experiential learning approach that promotes the development of life skills ... through equine-assisted activities."&lt;ref name="PATH defs"&gt;{{cite web

| website    = PATH International
| accessdate = 16 January 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Equine-assisted psychotherapy''' (EAP) does not necessarily involve riding, but may include grooming, feeding and ground exercises. Mental health professionals work with one or more clients and one or more horses in an experiential manner to help the clients learn about themselves and others, while processing or discussing the client's feelings, behaviours, and patterns.&lt;ref name=autism /&gt; The goal is to help the client in social, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral ways.  Other terms for equine psychotherapy include Equine-facilitated psychotherapy (EFP), equine-assisted therapy (EAT), '''Equine Facilitated Wellness''' (EFW), '''Equine Facilitated Counselling''' (EFC) and Equine Facilitated Mental Health (EFMH).
* '''Interactive [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]]''' involves vaulting activities in a therapeutic milieu.&lt;ref name=autism /&gt;
* '''Therapeutic [[combined driving|carriage driving]]''' involves controlling a horse while driving from a carriage seat or from a wheelchair in a carriage modified to accommodate the wheelchair.&lt;ref name=autism /&gt;
* '''Equine-Assisted Activities''' (EAA) incorporates all of the above activities plus [[horse grooming]], and [[stable]] management, shows, parades, demonstrations, and the like.&lt;ref name="PATH defs" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed the rhythmical gait of a horse acts to move the rider's pelvis in the same rotation and side-to-side movement that occurs when walking; the horse's adjustable gait promotes riders to constantly adjust to encourage pelvic motion while promoting strength, balance, coordination, flexibility, posture, and mobility.&lt;ref name=Whalen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borzo, G. (2002). Horsepower. American Medical News, 45 (23), 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

EAAT have also been used to treat other disabilities, such as [[autism]], [[behavioral disorder]]s and [[psychiatric disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="aetna_cpb" /&gt; Due to a lack of rigorous [[scientific evidence]], there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate if equine therapy for mental health treatment provides any benefit.&lt;ref name=anestis /&gt;

=== Therapeutic horseback riding ===
Therapeutic riding is used by disabled individuals who ride horses to relax, and to develop muscle tone, coordination, confidence, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most research has focused on the physical benefit of therapeutic work with horses, with the most rigorous studies being subject to [[systematic review]] since about 2007.&lt;ref name="Selby2013" /&gt; Claims made as to the efficacy of equine therapies for mental health purposes have been criticized as lacking proper [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] due in large part to poor study design and lack of quantitative data. Ethical questions relating to its expense and its continued promotion have been raised in light of this lack of evidence. While such therapies do not appear to cause harm, it has been recommended they not be used as a mental treatment at this time unless future evidence shows a benefit for treating specific disorders.&lt;ref name=anestis /&gt;

=== Hippotherapy ===
Hippotherapy is an intervention used by a physical therapist, recreational therapist, occupational therapist, or speech and language pathologist.  The movement of the horse affects a rider's posture, balance, coordination, strength and sensorimotor systems.  It is thought that the warmth and shape of the horse and its rhythmic, three-dimensional movement along with the rider's interactions with the horse and responses to the movement of the horse can improve the flexibility, posture, balance and mobility of the rider.&lt;ref name=Park&gt;{{cite journal

They guide the rider's posture and actions while the horse is controlled by a horse handler at the direction of the therapist.

=== Equine-assisted psychotherapy ===
Equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP) or Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) is the use of equines to treat human psychological problems in and around an [[equestrian facility]]. It is not the same as therapeutic riding or hippotherapy.&lt;ref name=Parish-Plass /&gt;{{rp|221}}  Though different organizations may prefer one term over the other for various reasons, in practice, the two terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Parish-Plass /&gt;{{rp|287}} Other terms commonly used, especially in Canada, include Equine Facilitated Wellness (EFW), Equine Facilitated Counselling (EFC) and Equine Facilitated Mental Health (EFMH).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

While some mental health therapies may incorporate vaulting and riding,&lt;ref name=PATHaboutEAAT /&gt; most utilize groundwork with horses.&lt;ref name=autism /&gt; Some programs only use ground-based work.&lt;ref name=eagalamodel /&gt; There are also differences between programs over whether the horse is viewed as a co-facilitator, or simply as a tool.&lt;ref name=Parish-Plass /&gt;{{rp|287}}

The field of equine-assisted psychotherapy did not publicly become a part of the equine-assisted therapy world until the 1990s, although individuals had been experimenting with the concept prior to that time.  The first national group in the United States, the Equine-Facilitated Mental Health Association (EFMHA), now a part of PATH International, formed in 1996.  The mental health area of equine-assisted therapy became subject to a major rift when a second group, the Equine Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) formed in 1999, splitting from EFMHA (now PATH) over differences of opinion about safety protocols.&lt;ref name=Parish-Plass&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}  EAGALA itself had a further split between its founders in 2006 due to legal issues, with yet another new organization formed.&lt;ref name=Hallberg /&gt;{{rp|52}}

As a result, although PATH and EAGALA remain the two main certification organizations in the United States, there has been a significant amount of misunderstanding amongst practitioners, client, and within the scientific literature.  To resolve these differences, an independent organization, the Certification Board for Equine Interaction Professionals (CBEIP) formed, beginning in 2007, to promote professional credibility in the field.&lt;ref name=Parish-Plass /&gt;{{rp|286}} However, the world of equine-assisted psychotherapy remains disorganized and has not standardized its requirements for education or credentialing.&lt;ref name=Parish-Plass /&gt;{{rp|287}}

== History ==
Horses have been utilized as a therapeutic aid since the [[ancient Greeks]] used them for those people who had incurable illnesses. Its earliest recorded mention is in the writings of [[Hippocrates]] who discussed the therapeutic value of riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Hippotherapy as currently practiced was developed in the 1960s, when it began to be used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as an adjunct to traditional [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name="The History of Hippotherapy"&gt;{{cite web
| url   = http://www.americanhippotherapyassociation.org/aha_hpot_a_history.htm
| title = The History of Hippotherapy
| quote = American Hippotherapy Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment was conducted by a [[physiotherapist]], a specially trained horse, and a horse handler. The physiotherapist gave directives to the horse handler as to the gait, tempo, cadence, and direction for the horse to perform. The movement of the horse was carefully modulated to influence [[neuromuscular medicine|neuromuscular]] changes in the patient. The first standardized hippotherapy curriculum would be formulated in the late 1980s by a group of Canadian and American therapists who travelled to Germany to learn about hippotherapy and would bring the new discipline back to North America upon their return.&lt;ref name="The History of Hippotherapy" /&gt; The discipline was formalized in the United States in 1992 with the formation of the American Hippotherapy Association (AHA). Since its inception, the AHA has established official standards of practice and formalized therapist educational curriculum processes for occupational, physical and speech therapists in the United States.&lt;ref name="The History of Hippotherapy" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her legs were paralyzed from polio but with therapy she was able to win the silver medal for dressage in the 1952 [[Olympic Games]]. At about that time, in Germany, therapeutic riding was used to address orthopaedic dysfunctions such as [[scoliosis]]. The first riding centers in North America began in the 1960s and the [[North American Riding for the Handicapped Association]] (NARHA) was launched in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Benda, W., Fredrickson, M., Flanagan, S., Zembreski-Ruple, J., &amp; McGibbon, N. H. (2000). Animal-assisted therapy: A highly versatile modality. Complementary Medicine for the Physician, 5(6), 41-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Therapeutic riding was introduced to the United States and Canada in 1960 with the formation of the Community Association of Riding of the Disabled (CARD). In the United States riding for the disabled developed as a form of recreation and as a means of motivation for education, as well as its therapeutic benefits. In 1969 the Cheff Therapeutic Riding Center for the Handicapped was established in Michigan, and remains the oldest center specifically for people with disabilities in the United States.&lt;ref name="stablelifeinc.org" /&gt;

The North American Riding for Handicapped Association (NARHA) was founded in 1969 to serve as an advisory body to the various riding for disabled groups across the United States and its neighboring countries. In 2011, NARHA changed its name to the [[Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship]] (PATH) International.&lt;ref name="PATH home"&gt;{{cite web

== Horses used ==
In most cases, horses are trained and selected specifically for therapy before being integrated into a program. Therapy programs choose horses of any breed that they find to be calm, even-tempered, gentle, serviceably sound, and well-trained both under saddle and on the ground. As most equine-assisted therapy is done at slow speeds, an older horse that is not in its athletic prime is sometimes used.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equine-assisted therapy programs try to identify horses that are calm but not lazy and physically suited with proper balance, structure, muscling and [[horse gait|gaits]].  Muscling is not generally considered to be as important as the balance and structural correctness, but proper conditioning for the work it is to do is required. Suitable horses move freely and have good quality gaits, especially the walk. Unsound horses that show any signs of lameness are generally avoided.&lt;ref name=Team&gt;{{Cite web

The [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the horse is taken into consideration.  Each individual animal has natural biological traits but also has a unique personality with its own likes, dislikes and habits.  Paying attention to what the animal is trying to communicate is helpful both in sessions of EAAT, but also to prevent burnout for the horse. Some programs refer to the therapy horse as an "equine partner".&lt;ref name=PATHaboutEAAT /&gt; Other programs view the horse as a "metaphor" with no defined role other than to "be themselves."&lt;ref name=eagalamodel&gt;{{cite web

In Canada, centers and instructors for Therapeutic Riding are regulated by CanTRA, also known as The Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association.  The field of Equine Facilitated Wellness is regulated by Equine Facilitated Wellness – Canada (EFW-Can) which provides a national certification program and certifies trainers and mentors to provide independent training at approved programs across Canada.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The American Hippotherapy Association offers certification for working as a hippotherapist.  Hippotherapy Clinical Specialty (HPCS) Certification is a designation indicating board certification for therapists who have advanced knowledge and experience in hippotherapy. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists in practice for at least three years (6,000 hours) and have 100 hours of hippotherapy practice within the prior three years are permitted to take the Hippotherapy Clinical Specialty Certification Examination through the American Hippotherapy Certification Board. Those who pass are board-certified in hippotherapy, and entitled to use the HPCS designation after their name. HPCS certification is for five years. After five years the therapist can either retake the exam or show written evidence of 120 hours of continuing education distributed over the five years. Continuing education must include 50% (60 hours) in education related to equine subject matter: [[psychology]], training, [[Equestrianism|riding skills]] and so on; 25% (30 hours) in education related to direct service in the professional discipline and 25% (30 hours) in any other subject related to hippotherapy. An alternative is to provide written evidence of scholarly activity appropriate to the field of hippotherapy.  Acceptable scholarly activity may include graduate education in hippotherapy, publication of articles on hippotherapy in juried publications, [[scientific research]] related to hippotherapy, the teaching or development of hippotherapy, or acting as AHA-approved course faculty. AHA, Inc. now recognizes two different AHCB credentials: AHCB Certified Therapist and AHCB Certified Hippotherapy Clinical Specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ethics of justice deals with moral choices through a measure of rights of the people involved and chooses the solution that seems to damage the fewest people. Rooted in a respect for the legal system{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}, it applies in the Western democracy ideas like [[social contract theory]] to everyday moral decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9009">'''Exemplification theory''' is a [[theory]] that states that an event is the exemplification of a property in an entity. This identity is often modeled as an "ordered triple" of an entity, property type, and time).&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, N. (2006, May 15). Towards a More Plausible Exemplification Theory of Events. Philosophical Studies, 129(2), 349–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Much of exemplification theory is based on logic arguing that there are evolutionary advantages that stem from the ability to group events together. Humans do this by sifting through experiences to group those that seem to go together and coding the occurrence of events in a quantitative manner that allows them to make judgments (most often nonconsciously) of how frequently different events occur.&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (2000). Mood management in the context of selective exposure theory. In M. Roloff (Ed.), Communication Yearkbook 23 (pp. 103–123). Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; These judgments are considered based on two cognitive devices: the [[availability heuristic]] and the [[representativeness heuristic]].

The availability heuristic tells us that judgments of social phenomena are greatly influenced by the ease with which information comes to mind.&lt;ref name="Gibson, R. 1998"&gt;Gibson, R. &amp; Zillmann, D. (1998). Effects of citation in exemplifying testimony on issue perception. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, 75, 1, 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Availability heuristics can be a useful tool for assessing frequency or probability of an event.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbart, M., Fulero, S., Jensen, C., Howard, J., &amp; Birrell, P. (1978). From individual to group impressions: Availability heuristics in stereotype formation. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 14, 237–255.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals that employ the availability heuristic evaluate the frequency of events based on the quickness with which pertinent instances come to mind.&lt;ref name="Zillmann, D. 1996"&gt;Zillmann, D., Gibson, R., Sundar, S.S., &amp; Perkins, J.W. (1996). Effects of exemplification in news reports on the perception of social issues. Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 73, 2, 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

The representativeness heuristic is a special case of availability. It stipulates that abstract base-rate information plays little role in quantitative judgments about event populations. Instead, these judgments are based on the sample of more concrete exemplars that are available to the individual at the time of decision making. Exemplification theory is a simple combination of these heuristics. It posits that since exemplars come to mind more easily than base-rates when accessing information, available exemplars will dominate base-rate information when making judgments of event populations.&lt;ref&gt;Worrell, T.R. &amp; Tamborini R. (2009). The TV made me do it: The impact of exemplars and base- rates on behavioral intentions. A paper presented at the 95th meeting of the National Communication Association, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral intentions are the direct determinants of behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I. &amp; Fishbein, M. (1980). Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this research focuses on the manipulation of attitudes, subjective norms, and/or behavioral control with the message having a direct impact on receivers based on the information provided and the presentation of base-rates and exemplars. Exemplification theory examines the role of base-rates and exemplars in communication messages.&lt;ref name="Zillmann, D. 2002 pp. 19-41"&gt;Zillmann, D. (2002). Exemplification theory of media influence. In J. Bryant &amp; D. Zillmann (Eds.), Media effects: Advances in theory and research (pp. 19–41). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals pay attention to (and are more influenced by) exemplars than by base-rate data.&lt;ref name="Gibson, R. 1998"/&gt; Base-rates are not always inconsequential.&lt;ref name="Zillmann, D. 2002 pp. 19-41"/&gt;

Criticism in the 1980s rejected exemplificationism, charging that it ultimately conﬂates events with facts.&lt;ref&gt;10. Bennett, J. (1988): Events and Their Names. Hackett Publishing Company. Goldman, A. (1970): A Theory of Human Action. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lombard, L. (1986): Events: A Metaphysical Study. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, exemplificationism has lost almost all of its previous popularity.

== Exemplars and base-rates ==
An '''exemplar''' is an instance of an event population that shares essential features with all other instances from the group of events that is defined by those features. In a sense, exemplars are case reports used to represent characteristics typical of a group of event.&lt;ref&gt;12. Zillmann, D. &amp; Brosius, H.B. (2000). Exemplification in Communication: The influence of case reports on the perception of issues. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, exemplars are illustrative representations of information. An exemplar will provide a demonstration of an event.

Exemplars used in conjunction with base-rates as case illustrations of event populations to enhance or detract from given base-rate information as the salient features of the exemplar are representative of the event population.&lt;ref&gt;Brosius, H.B. &amp; Bathelt, A. (1994). The utility of exemplars in persuasive communications. Communication Research, 21, 1, 48–79.&lt;/ref&gt; As with news reports, exemplars are often added to provide a description of an event being discussed within a report and are chosen for their entertaining qualities.&lt;ref name="Gibson, R. 1994"&gt;Gibson, R. &amp; Zillmann, D. (1994). Exaggerated versus representative exemplification in news reports. Communication Research, 21, 5, 603–625.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Base-rates]] present descriptions limited to certain general features of the event population. Base-rate information often comes in the form of a numerical representation such as the frequency with which an event occurs. Typically it is thought of as quantitative information
about population events&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. &amp; Brosius, H.B. (2000). Exemplification in Communication: The influence of case reports on the perception of issues. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; or a general description of the number of things or people in the setting.&lt;ref name="Zillmann, D. 1996"/&gt;

Base-rates are said to be less illustrative or vivid than exemplar information. They have not been examined as often as exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler, J.J. (1996). The base rate fallacy reconsidered: descriptive, normative, and methodological challenges. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 19, 1, 1–54.&lt;/ref&gt; They are overwhelmed by exemplars in many circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;Berger, C.R. (2000). Quantitative depictions of threatening phenomena in news reports: The scary world of frequency data. Human Communication Research, 26, 1, 27–52.&lt;/ref&gt; it does not appear that they are always ignored. Prior investigations suggest that base-rates are perceived by decision makers as more reliable and can influence decisional confidence more than exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, J.E. (1997). If the base rate fallacy is a fallacy, does it matter how frequently it is committed? Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 20, 4, 774–776.&lt;/ref&gt; Base-rates are perceived as more truthful,&lt;ref name="Zillmann, D. 2002 pp. 19-41"/&gt; precise,&lt;ref name="Zillmann, D. 1996"/&gt; and accurate&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D., Perkins, J.W., &amp; Sundar, S.S. (1992). Impression formation effects of printed news varying in descriptive precision and exemplification. Medienpsychologie, 4, 168–185.&lt;/ref&gt;  than exemplars. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that exemplification effects are prone to other perceptual phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Scherr, S., Müller, P., &amp; Fast, V. (2013). Do third-person perceptions amplify exemplification effects? International Journal of Communication, 7, 1603–1621.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests several disadvantages to the use of exemplars, particularly in relation to perceptual bias that might result from their use. Exemplars are also said to play a role in perpetuating negative stereotypes, and in isolation are frequently found to be inefficient sources of information.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, J.W. (1996). Development and mental representation of stereotypes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, 6, 1126–1142.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Exemplar information has largely been found to be less reliable than base-rate information. In part, because it is seldom collected or presented in a systematic manner.&lt;ref name="Gibson, R. 1994"/&gt;

Exemplification research demonstrates that individuals often base their assessment of social reality more strongly on attributes of the exemplars selected for inclusion in media reports than statistical representations of information. This has been found problematic when the exemplar is atypical and chosen for its entertaining or sensational qualities, a common occurrence within news stories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">{{for|a broader discussion of faux pas in China|etiquette in Asia}}
The following faux pas are derived from [[homonym]]s in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]].  While originating in   [[Greater China]], they may also apply to [[Chinese language|Chinese-speaking]] people around the world. However, most homonymic pairs listed work only in some varieties of Chinese (for example, Mandarin only or Cantonese only), and may appear bewildering even to speakers of other varieties of Chinese.

Certain customs regarding good and bad [[luck]] are important to many [[Chinese people]].  Although these might be regarded as  [[superstition]]s by people from other cultures, these customs are often tied to [[religion|religious traditions]] and are an important part of many people's [[World view|belief systems]], even among well-educated people and affluent sectors of society.

==Clocks==
[[Clock#Purposes|Giving a clock]] (送鐘/送钟, sòng zhōng) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act is a homophone with the term for the act of attending another's funeral (送終/送终, sòngzhōng).&lt;ref name="Brown(2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 别人过节喜庆的时候，不送钟表。送终和送钟谐音。&lt;/ref&gt; A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|website=[[BBC]]|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cantonese people]] consider such a gift as a curse.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Kurth Clot deBroissia [http://www.netique.com/giftsearch/international.html#anchor317728 ''International Gift Giving Protocol'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called "''zhong''", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.

However, should such a gift be given, the "unluckiness" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'送'}} ("give") expression of the phrase.

==Fans and umbrellas==
It is undesirable to give someone a [[Fan (implement)|fan]] or an [[umbrella]] as a gift. The words fan "shàn" ({{lang|zh|扇}}) and umbrella "sǎn" ({{zh|t=傘|s=伞}}) sound like the word "sǎn/sàn" ({{lang|zh|散}}), meaning to scatter, or to part company, to separate, to break up with someone, to split.&lt;ref name="gifts_in_chinese_culture.htm"&gt;Wong Yee Lee [http://www.chinatownconnection.com/gifts_in_chinese_culture.htm Gifts in Chinese Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

These homonymic pairs work in Mandarin and Cantonese, though Cantonese has a more idiomatic term for umbrellas ("ze1" in Cantonese, {{lang|zh|遮}}) to avoid precisely this association.

==Books==
As a book ({{zh|t=書|s=书|p=shū}}) is a Mandarin homophone of "loss, to lose" ({{zh|t=輸|s=输|p=shū}}), carrying or looking at a book ({{zh|t=帶書, 看書|s=带书, 看书|p=dài shū, kàn shū}}) where  people are taking a risk, such as gambling or investing in stocks, may be considered to invite bad luck and loss ({{zh|t=帶輸, 看輸|s=带输, 看输|p=dài shū, kàn shū}}). This bad luck does not apply to carrying or reading newspapers ({{zh|t=帶報, 看報|s=带报, 看报|p=dàibào, kànbào}}) as newspapers ({{zh|t=報紙|s=报纸|p=bàozhǐ}}) are not books.&lt;ref name="gifts_in_chinese_culture.htm"/&gt;

This homonymic pair works in Mandarin.

==Pears==
Sharing a pear with friends or loved ones can be a mistake. "Sharing a pear" ({{lang|zh|分梨}}) is a homophone of "to separate, to part, to leave" ({{zh|t=分離|s=分离}}), both pronounced "fēnlí" in Mandarin. Sharing with distant friends is okay.

This homonymic pair works in Mandarin.

==Shoes==
It is also thought to be bad luck to give [[shoes]] as a gift. "Shoes" ({{lang|zh|鞋}} xié) in Mandarin is a homophone of "evil" ({{lang|zh|邪}} xié).&lt;ref name="giving-gifts-to-chinese-what-to-give-and-what-to-avoid"&gt;Gift Canyon [http://giftcanyon.com/giving-gifts-to-chinese-what-to-give-and-what-to-avoid/  Chinese Gifts to Give and Avoid]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Chinese people believe that gifting shoes equips a person to "walk away" from a relationship.

This homonymic pair works in Mandarin only and, other than part of northern China, there is no such superstition in any other part of China.

==Biography==

After devoting his doctoral thesis (1983) to the [[Annales School]], Dosse turned his research interests to [[structuralism]], the philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] (his biography, ''Paul Ricœur. Les sens d'une vie'' (published in 1997), has become the standard authority) and the historian [[Michel de Certeau]]. François Dosse is one of the founders of the journal ''[[EspacesTemps.net|EspacesTemps]]''. In 2007, he published ''[[Gilles Deleuze]] et [[Félix Guattari]], biographie croisée'' (English trans. ''Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari: Intersecting Lives'' [2010]), where he advocated the rehabilitation of Guattari in an intellectual history that had made place only for Deleuze.&lt;ref&gt;Alan D.

'''Georg Bernhard Bilfinger''' (23 January 1693 – 18 February 1750), [[German people|German]] philosopher, mathematician and statesman, son of a [[Lutheran]] minister.

==Life==
He was born at [[Cannstatt]] in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

As a boy he showed great aptitude for study, and at first devoted himself to [[theology]], but under the influence of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s writings he took up mathematics and philosophy on the lines of Wolff and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Returning to theology, he attempted to connect it with philosophy in a treatise, ''Dilucidationes philosophicae, de deo, anima humana, mundo'' (Tübingen, 1725, 1746, 1768). This work contains nothing original but giving a clear representation of Wolff's philosophy. It met with great success, and the author was appointed to the office of preacher at the castle of [[Tübingen]] and of reader in the school of theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1721, after two years study under Wolff, he became professor of philosophy at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], and in 1724 professor of mathematics. His friends at Tübingen disapproved of his new views, and in 1725, on Wolff's recommendation, he was invited by [[Peter I of Russia]] to lecture in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was well received. His success in winning the prize of a thousand crowns offered for a dissertation on the cause of [[gravity]] by the [[Académie des Sciences]] of [[Paris]] secured his return to his native land in 1731.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1735, largely on account of his knowledge of military engineering, [[Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg]] (reigned 1733–1737) made him a [[privy councillor]], but his hands were tied owing to the frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke, however, he became a member of the Regency Council, and devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion, agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly successful, and he became in a real sense the head of the state. He died at [[Stuttgart]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After his return from [[Imperial Russia]], he won the highest respect at home and abroad, and [[Frederick II of Prussia]] is recorded to have said of him, "He was a great man whom I shall ever remember with admiration."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Beside the ''Dilucidationes'', he wrote ''De harmonia animi et corporis humani commentatio'' (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1735; Tübingen, 1741); ''De origine et permissione mali'' (1724), an account of the Leibnitzian theodicy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

{{Divine Comedy}}
[[File:Inferno.jpg|thumb|250px|Canto I from the ''Inferno'', the first part of the ''Divine Comedy'' by Dante Alighieri.]]
{{Christian mysticism}}
'''''Inferno''''' ({{IPA-it|imˈfɛrno|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "Hell") is the first part of Italian writer [[Dante Alighieri]]'s 14th-century [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. It is followed by ''[[Purgatorio]]'' and ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''. The ''Inferno'' tells the journey of Dante through [[Christian views on hell|Hell]], guided by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] poet [[Virgil]]. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the "realm ... of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ciardi]], ''The Divine Comedy'', Introduction by Archibald T. MacAllister, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[allegory]], the ''Divine Comedy'' represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the ''Inferno'' describing the recognition and rejection of sin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

===Cantos I–II===
[[File:Gustave Dore Inferno1.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]'s engravings illustrated the ''Divine Comedy'' (1861–1868). Here, Dante is lost in Canto I of the ''Inferno'']]
'''''Canto I'''''
&lt;br /&gt;
The poem begins on the night of [[Maundy Thursday]] on March 24 (or April 7), A.D. 1300, shortly before dawn of [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, Robert (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gkCBRhm3x9wC&amp;pg=PA14 Note on ''Inferno'' I.11]. In Robert and Jean Hollander, trans., ''The Inferno'' by Dante. New York: Random House. p. 14. {{ISBN|0-385-49698-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen Mandelbaum, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto I, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator, Dante himself, is thirty-five years old, and thus "midway in the journey of our life" (''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 1&lt;/ref&gt;) – half of the Biblical lifespan of seventy ([[Psalms|Psalm]] 89:10&lt;!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 --&gt;, Vulgate; Psalm 90:10, KJV). The poet finds himself lost in a dark [[forest|wood]] (''selva oscura''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 2&lt;/ref&gt;), astray from the "straight way" (''diritta via'',&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 3&lt;/ref&gt; also translatable as "right way") of salvation. He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain, but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade: a ''lonza''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 32&lt;/ref&gt; (usually rendered as "[[leopard]]" or "[[leopon]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Gloria | last = Allaire | title = New evidence towards identifying Dante's enigmatic ''lonza'' |publisher = Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America | date = 7 August 1997 | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~dante/ebdsa/ga97.htm | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}} – defines ''lonza'' as the result of an unnatural pairing between a leopard and a lioness in [[Andrea da Barberino]] ''Guerrino meschino''.&lt;/ref&gt; a ''leone''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 45&lt;/ref&gt; ([[lion]]), and a ''lupa''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 49&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gray wolf|she-wolf]]). The three beasts, taken from the [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 5:6, are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell. According to [[John Ciardi]], these are [[Incontinence (philosophy)|incontinence]] (the she-wolf); [[violence]] and bestiality (the lion); and [[fraud]] and malice (the leopard);&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto I, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] assigns the leopard to incontinence and the she-wolf to fraud/malice.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto I.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now dawn of Good Friday, April 8, with the sun rising in [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]]. The beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error, a "lower place" (''basso loco''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 61&lt;/ref&gt;) where the sun is silent (''l sol tace''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 60&lt;/ref&gt;). However, Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born ''sub Iulio''&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto I, line 70&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. in the time of [[Julius Caesar]]) and lived under [[Augustus]]: it is the shade of the Roman poet [[Virgil]], author of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', a [[Latin literature|Latin epic]].

'''''Canto II'''''
&lt;br&gt;
On the evening of Good Friday, Dante is following Virgil but hesitates; Virgil explains how he has been sent by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], the symbol of Divine Love. Beatrice had been moved to aid Dante by the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (symbolic of compassion) and [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]] (symbolic of illuminating Grace). [[Rachel]], symbolic of the contemplative life, also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil. The two of them then begin their journey to the [[underworld]].

===Vestibule of Hell===
'''''Canto III'''''
&lt;br&gt;
Dante passes through the gate of Hell, which bears an inscription ending with the famous phrase "''Lasciate ogne&lt;!--Please do not "correct" this to ogni. Please consult a critical edition of the Commedia first. Online, see the Princeton Dante Project: http://etcweb.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/dante/campuscgi/mpb/GetCantoSection.pl?LANG=2&amp;INP_POEM=Inf&amp;INP_SECT=3&amp;INP_START=7&amp;INP_LEN=15 --&gt; speranza, voi ch'intrate&lt;!--Please do not "correct" to entrate; see prev. comment.--&gt;''",&lt;ref&gt;''Inf.'' Canto III, line 9&lt;/ref&gt; most frequently translated as "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."{{refn|group=nb|There are many English translations of this famous line. Some examples include
*''All hope abandon, ye who enter here'' – [[Henry Francis Cary]] (1805–1814)&lt;!--depending on which edition it first appeared in--&gt;
*''All hope abandon, ye who enter in!'' – [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] (1882)
*''Leave every hope, ye who enter!'' – [[Charles Eliot Norton]] (1891)
*''Leave all hope, ye that enter'' – [[Carlyle Okey-Wicksteed]] (1932)
*''Lay down all hope, you that go in by me.'' – [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (1949)
*''Abandon all hope, ye who enter here'' – [[John Ciardi]] (1954)
*''Abandon every hope, you who enter.'' – [[Charles S. Singleton]] (1970)
*''No room for hope, when you enter this place'' – [[C. H. Sisson]] (1980)
*''Abandon every hope, who enter here.'' – [[Allen Mandelbaum]] (1982)
*''Abandon all hope, you who enter here.'' – [[Robert Pinsky]] (1993); [[Robert Hollander]] (2000)
*''Abandon every hope, all you who enter'' – [[Mark Musa]] (1995)
*''Abandon every hope, you who enter.'' – [[Robert M. Durling]] (1996)
Verbatim, the line translates as "Leave (''lasciate'') every (''ogne'') hope (''speranza''), ye (''voi'') that (''ch''') enter (''intrate'')."}} Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted. These are the souls of people who in life took no sides; the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil, but instead were merely concerned with themselves. Among these Dante recognizes a figure implied to be [[Pope Celestine V]], whose "cowardice (in selfish terror for his own welfare) served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church".&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto III, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the [[War in Heaven|Rebellion of Angels]]. These souls are forever unclassified; they are neither in Hell nor out of it, but reside on the shores of the [[Acheron]]. Naked and futile, they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive, wavering banner (symbolic of their pursuit of ever-shifting [[self-interest]]) while relentlessly chased by swarms of [[wasp]]s and [[hornet]]s, who continually sting them.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothly L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto III&lt;/ref&gt; Loathsome [[maggot]]s and worms at the sinners' feet drink the putrid mixture of blood, pus, and tears that flows down their bodies. This symbolizes the sting of their guilty [[conscience]] and the repugnance of sin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived.

[[File:Gustave Doré - Dante Alighieri - Inferno - Plate 9 (Canto III - Charon).jpg|thumb|left|Gustave Doré's illustration of Canto III: Arrival of Charon.]]
After passing through the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], who does not want to let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, ''Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole'' ("It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed"),&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto III, lines 95–96, Longfellow translation&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the ''[[Purgatorio]]''. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side.

==Nine circles of Hell==

===Overview===
'''''Canto IV'''''

Virgil proceeds to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are [[concentric]], representing a gradual increase in [[wickedness]], and culminating at the centre of the earth, where [[Satan]] is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a ''[[contrapasso]]'', a symbolic instance of [[poetic justice]]. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter [[fortune-teller]]s who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they tried to see the future through forbidden means. Such a ''contrapasso'' "functions not merely as a form of [[Divine retribution|divine revenge]], but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny [[Free will|freely chosen]] by each soul during his or her life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Brand|first2=Lino |last2=Pertile|url={{Google books|3uq0bObScHMC|page=PA63|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=The Cambridge History of Italian Literature|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-66622-8|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant.

Dante's Hell is structurally based on the ideas of [[Aristotle]], but with "certain Christian symbolisms, exceptions, and misconstructions of Aristotle's text".&lt;ref name="John Ciardi pg. 94"&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XI, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Dante's three major categories of sin, as symbolized by the three beasts that Dante encounters in Canto I, are [[Incontinence (philosophy)|Incontinence]], [[Violence]] and Bestiality, and [[Fraud]] and Malice.&lt;ref name="John Ciardi pg. 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sayers139&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto XI, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Sinners punished for incontinence (also known as wantonness) — the lustful, the gluttonous, the hoarders and wasters, and the wrathful and sullen — all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites, desires, and natural urges; according to Aristotle's ''[[Nicomachean Ethics|Ethics]]'', incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality, and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of Upper Hell (Circles 2–5). These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell, located within the walls of the City of Dis, for committing acts of violence and fraud — the latter of which involves, as Dorothy L. Sayers writes, "abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason".&lt;ref name=sayers139 /&gt; The deeper levels are organized into one circle for violence (Circle 7) and two circles for fraud (Circles 8 and 9). As a Christian, Dante adds Circle 1 (Limbo) to Upper Hell and Circle 6 (Heresy) to Lower Hell, making 9 Circles in total; incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile, this leads to Hell containing 10 main divisions.&lt;ref name=sayers139/&gt; This "9+1=10" structure is also found within the ''Purgatorio'' and ''Paradiso''. Lower Hell is further subdivided: Circle 7 (Violence) is divided into three rings, Circle 8 (Simple Fraud) is divided into ten ''bolge'', and Circle 9 (Complex Fraud) is divided into four regions. Thus, Hell contains, in total, 24 divisions.

===First Circle (Limbo)===
[[File:Harrowhell.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The [[Harrowing of Hell]], in a 14th-century [[illuminated manuscript]], the ''[[Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry|Petites Heures de Jean de Berry]]'']]
Dante wakes up to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, [[Limbo]], where Virgil himself resides. The first circle contains the [[Baptism|unbaptized]] and the [[virtuous pagan]]s, who, although not sinful, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, "After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward."&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto IV&lt;/ref&gt; Limbo shares many characteristics with the [[Asphodel Meadows]]; thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism ("the portal of the faith that you embrace"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto IV, line 36, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;) they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw [[Jesus]] ("a Mighty One") descend into Limbo and take [[Noah]], [[Moses]], [[Abraham]], [[David]], and [[Rachel]] (see [[Limbo#Limbo of the Patriarchs|Limbo of the Patriarchs]]) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the [[Harrowing of Hell]], would have occurred in A.D. 33 or 34.

Dante encounters the poets [[Homer]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], and [[Lucan]], who include him in their number and make him "sixth in that high company".&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto IV, line 103, Ciardi translation.&lt;/ref&gt; They reach the base of a great [[Castle]] – the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity – surrounded by seven gates, and a flowing brook. After passing through the seven gates, the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and Dante encounters the inhabitants of the Citadel. These include figures associated with the Trojans and their descendants (the Romans): [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]] (mother of Troy's founder [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]]), [[Hector]], [[Aeneas]], [[Julius Caesar]] in his role as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] general ("in his armor, falcon-eyed"),&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto IV, line 123, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]], [[Penthesilea]] (Queen of the [[Amazons]]), King [[Latinus]] and his daughter, [[Lavinia]], [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] (who overthrew [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin]] to found the [[Roman Republic]]), [[Lucretia]], [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], [[Marcia (wife of Cato the Younger)|Marcia]], and [[Cornelia Africana]]. Dante also views [[Saladin]], a [[Muslim]] military leader known for his struggle against the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] as well as his generous, chivalrous, and merciful conduct.

Dante next encounters a group of philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] with [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] at his side, as well as [[Democritus]], "Diogenes" (either [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes the Cynic]] or [[Diogenes of Apollonia]]), [[Anaxagoras]], [[Thales]], [[Empedocles]], [[Heraclitus]], and "Zeno" (either [[Zeno of Elea]] or [[Zeno of Citium]]). He sees the scientist [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]]; the mythical Greek poets [[Orpheus]] and [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]]; and Roman statesmen [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Dante sees the Alexandrian geometer [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer, as well as the physicians [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]]. He also encounters [[Avicenna]], a Persian polymath, and [[Averroes]], a [[Al-Andalus|medieval Andalusian]] polymath known for his commentaries on Aristotle's works. Dante and Virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey.

Although Dante implies that all virtuous non-Christians find themselves here, he later encounters two ([[Cato the Younger|Cato of Utica]] and [[Statius]]) in Purgatory and two ([[Trajan]] and [[Ripheus]]) in Heaven. In ''Purg.'' XXII, Virgil names several additional inhabitants of Limbo who were not mentioned in the ''Inferno.''&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXII, lines 97–114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Circle (Lust)===
[[File:Inferno Canto 5 line 4 Minos.jpg|thumb|left|Gustave Doré's depiction of [[Minos]] judging sinners at the start of Canto V]]

;'''''Canto V'''''
Dante and Virgil leave Limbo and enter the Second Circle – the first of the circles of Incontinence – where the punishments of Hell proper begin. It is described as "a part where no thing gleams".&lt;ref&gt;''in parte ove non è che luca'' (''Inferno'', Canto IV, line 151, Mandelbaum translation.)&lt;/ref&gt; They find their way hindered by the serpentine [[Minos]], who judges all of those condemned for active, deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles. Minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a corresponding number of times. Virgil rebukes Minos, and he and Dante continue on.

In the second circle of Hell are those overcome by [[lust]]. These "carnal malefactors"&lt;ref&gt;''i peccator carnali'' (''Inferno'', Canto V, line 38, Longfellow translation.)&lt;/ref&gt; are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolizes the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly: "as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried sway by their passions, so now they drift for ever. The bright, voluptuous sin is now seen as it is – a howling darkness of helpless discomfort."&lt;ref name=sayers101&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto V, p. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not, therefore, completely self-centered, Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper.&lt;ref name=sayers101 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto V, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The "ruined slope"&lt;ref&gt;''la ruina'' (''Inferno'', Canto V, line 34, Mandelbaum translation.)&lt;/ref&gt; in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;John Yueh-Han Yieh, ''One Teacher: Jesus' Teaching Role in Matthew's Gospel Report'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2005) page 65; Robert Walter Funk, ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus'' (Harper San Francisco, 1998) pages 129–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianciotto Discovers Paolo and Francesca Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|upright|right|thumb|''Gianciotto Discovers Paolo and Francesca'' by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]]]
In this circle, Dante sees [[Semiramis]], [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], [[Cleopatra]], [[Helen of Troy]], [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Achilles]], [[Tristan]], and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life. Dante comes across [[Francesca da Rimini]], who married the deformed [[Giovanni Malatesta]] (also known as "Gianciotto") for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother [[Paolo Malatesta]]; the two began to carry on an [[Adultery|adulterous]] affair. Sometime between 1283 and 1286, Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca's bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death. Francesca explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Love, which in gentlest hearts will soonest bloom
   seized my lover with passion for that sweet body
   from which I was torn unshriven to my doom.
Love, which permits no loved one not to love,
   took me so strongly with delight in him
   that we are one in Hell, as we were above.
Love led us to one death. In the depths of Hell
   [[Inferno (Dante)#Ninth Circle (Treachery)|Caïna]] waits for [[Giovanni Malatesta|him who took our lives]]."
   This was the piteous tale they stopped to tell.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto V, lines 100–108, Ciardi translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Francesca further reports that she and Paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]] in the Old French romance ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Lancelot du Lac]]''. Francesca says, "''Galeotto fu 'l libro e chi lo scrisse''".&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'' Canto V, line 137&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Galeotto" means "[[Procuring (prostitution)|pander]]" but is also the Italian term for [[Galehaut|Gallehaut]], who acted as an intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere, encouraging them on to love. John Ciardi renders line 137 as "That book, and he who wrote it, was a pander."&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', line 137, Ciardi translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Dante, author [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] invoked the name ''Prencipe Galeotto'' in the alternative title to ''[[The Decameron]]'', a 14th-century collection of novellas. The English poet [[John Keats]], in his sonnet "On a Dream," imagines what Dante does not give us, the point of view of Paolo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... But to that second circle of sad hell,&lt;br&gt;
Where 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw&lt;br&gt;
Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell&lt;br&gt;
Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,&lt;br&gt;
Pale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form&lt;br&gt;
I floated with, about that melancholy storm.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Keats]], ''[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keats/john/poems/on-a-dream.html On a Dream]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As he did at the end of Canto III, Dante – overcome by pity and anguish – describes his swoon: "I fainted, as if I had met my death. / And then I fell as a dead body falls"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto V, lines 141–142, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Circle (Gluttony)===
[[File:Stradano Inferno Canto 06.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The third circle, illustrated by [[Stradanus]]]]
[[File:Inferno Canto 6 lines 24-26.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cerberus]] as illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
'''''Canto VI'''''
&lt;br /&gt;
In the third circle, the [[gluttony|gluttonous]] wallow in a vile, putrid slush produced by a ceaseless, foul, icy rain – "a great storm of putrefaction"&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', Canto VI, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; – as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite. [[Cerberus]] (described as "''il gran vermo''", literally "the great worm", line 22), the monstrous three-headed beast of Hell, ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire, mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs. Virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud.

Dorothy L. Sayers writes that "the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary self-indulgence".&lt;ref name="DLS6"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto VI.&lt;/ref&gt; The gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves, sightless and heedless of their neighbors, symbolizing the cold, selfish, and empty sensuality of their lives.&lt;ref name="DLS6"/&gt; Just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle, here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality – which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink, but also other kinds of addiction.&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', Introduction, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this circle, Dante converses with a Florentine contemporary identified as [[Ciacco]], which means "hog".&lt;ref name="WF51"&gt;Wallace Fowlie, ''A Reading of Dante's Inferno'', University of Chicago Press, 1981, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; A character with the same nickname later appears in ''[[The Decameron]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/decameron/engDecShowText.php?myID=nov0908 |title=Giovanni Boccaccio, ''The Decameron'', Ninth Day, Novel VIII |publisher=Stg.brown.edu |accessdate=2013-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018033821/http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/decameron/engDecShowText.php?myID=nov0908 |archivedate=October 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciacco speaks to Dante regarding strife in Florence between the "White" and "Black" [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]], which developed after the Guelph/Ghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the Ghibellines. In the first of several political [[prophecy|prophecies]] in the ''Inferno'', Ciacco "predicts" the expulsion of the White Guelphs (Dante's party) from Florence by the Black Guelphs, aided by [[Pope Boniface VIII]], which marked the start of Dante's [[Dante Alighieri#Exile and death|long exile from the city]]. These events occurred in 1302, prior to when the poem was written but in the future at Easter time of 1300, the time in which the poem is set.&lt;ref name="WF51"/&gt;

===Fourth Circle (Greed)===
[[File:Gustave Doré - Dante Alighieri - Inferno - Plate 22 (Canto VII - Hoarders and Wasters).jpg|thumb|In [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrations for the fourth circle, the weights are huge money bags]]
'''''Canto VII'''''
&lt;br&gt;
The Fourth Circle is guarded by a figure Dante names as ''Pluto'': this is [[Plutus]], the deity of wealth in classical mythology. Although the two are often conflated, he is a distinct figure from [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] (Dis), the classical ruler of the underworld.{{refn|group=nb|Mandelbaum, note to his translation, p. 357 of the Bantam Dell edition, 2004, says that Dante may simply be preserving an ancient conflation of the two deities; [[Peter Bondanella]] in his note to the translation of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''The Inferno: Dante Alighieri'' (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, 2003), pp. 202–203, thinks Plutus is meant, since Pluto is usually identified with Dis, and Dis is a distinct figure.}} At the start of Canto VII, he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase ''[[Papé Satàn, papé Satàn aleppe]]'', but Virgil protects Dante from him.

Those whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]] are punished in the fourth circle. They include the [[Greed|avaricious]] or miserly (including many "clergymen, and popes and cardinals"),&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto VII, line 47, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; who [[wikt:hoard|hoarded]] possessions, and the [[spendthrift|prodigal]], who [[wikt:squander|squandered]] them. The hoarders and spendthrifts [[jousting|joust]], using as weapons great weights that they push with their chests:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Here, too, I saw a nation of lost souls,
   far more than were above: they strained their chests
   against enormous weights, and with mad howls
rolled them at one another. Then in haste
   they rolled them back, one party shouting out:
   "Why do you hoard?" and the other: "Why do you waste?"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto VII, lines 25–30, Ciardi translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Relating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it (lust and gluttony), Dorothy L. Sayers writes, "Mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite; now, that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people. Indifference becomes mutual antagonism, imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering."&lt;ref name="sayers114"/&gt; The contrast between these two groups leads Virgil to discourse on the nature of [[Rota Fortunae|Fortune]], who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty, as she shifts, "those empty goods from nation unto nation, clan to clan".&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto VII, lines 79–80, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; This speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem, since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that Virgil tells Dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them – indeed, they have lost their individuality and been rendered "unrecognizable"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto VII, lines 54, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth Circle (Wrath)===
[[File:Stradano Inferno Canto 08.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The fifth circle, illustrated by [[Stradanus]]]]
[[File:La Barque de Dante (Delacroix 3820).jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]
In the swampy, stinking waters of the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] – the Fifth Circle – the actively [[wrath]]ful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, "into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe".&lt;ref name=sayers114&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto VII, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh, Dorothy L. Sayers writes, "the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another; at the bottom, the sullen hatreds lie gurgling, unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them".&lt;ref name=sayers114 /&gt; As the last circle of Incontinence, the "savage self-frustration" of the Fifth Circle marks the end of "that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion".&lt;ref name=sayers114 /&gt;

'''''Canto VIII'''''
&lt;br&gt;
[[Phlegyas]] reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across the Styx in his [[skiff]]. On the way they are accosted by [[Filippo Argenti]], a [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Black Guelph]] from the prominent Adimari family. Little is known about Argenti, although [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] describes an incident in which he lost his temper; early commentators state that Argenti's brother seized some of Dante's property after his exile from Florence.&lt;ref name="Durling"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Dante|first1= Alighieri|last2= Durling|first2= Robert M.|last3= Martinez|first3= Ronald L.|date= March 6, 1997|title= The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri|url= |location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= |isbn= 0195087445|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Argenti enabled the seizing of Dante's property, he himself is "seized" by all the other wrathful souls.

When Dante responds "In weeping and in grieving, accursed spirit, may you long remain,"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto VIII, lines 37–38, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil blesses him with words used to describe Christ himself ([[Gospel of Luke|''Luke'' 11:27]]). Literally, this reflects the fact that souls in Hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen, but allegorically, it reflects Dante's beginning awareness of his own sin.&lt;ref name="DLS8"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Entrance to Dis====
In the distance, Dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red [[mosque]]s. Virgil informs him that they are approaching the [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|City of Dis]]. Dis, itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Mandelbaum, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto VIII, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Dis is one of the names of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. The walls of Dis are guarded by [[fallen angel]]s. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter, and Dante is threatened by the [[Erinyes|Furies]] (consisting of [[Alecto]], [[Megaera]], and [[Tisiphone]]) and [[Medusa]].

'''''Canto IX'''''
&lt;br&gt;An [[angel]] sent from Heaven secures entry for the poets, opening the gate by touching it with a wand, and rebukes those who opposed Dante. Allegorically, this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that [[philosophy]] and [[humanism]] cannot fully understand. Virgil also mentions to Dante how [[Erichtho]] sent him down to the lowest circle of Hell to bring back a spirit from there.&lt;ref name="DLS8"/&gt;

{{clear}}
[[File:Stradano Inferno Map Lower.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lower Hell, inside the walls of [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]], in an illustration by [[Stradanus]]. There is a drop from the sixth circle to the three rings of the seventh circle, then again to the ten rings of the eighth circle, and, at the bottom, to the icy ninth circle.]]

===Sixth Circle (Heresy)===
'''''Canto X'''''
&lt;br&gt;
In the sixth circle, [[Christian heresy|heretics]], such as [[Epicurus]] and [[Epicureanism|his followers]] (who say "the soul dies with the body")&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto X, line 15, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; are trapped in flaming tombs. Dante holds discourse with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs: [[Farinata degli Uberti]], a famous [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] leader (following the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in September 1260, Farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of Florence at the meeting of the victorious Ghibellines; he died in 1264 and was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1283); and [[Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti]], a [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who was the father of Dante's friend and fellow poet, [[Guido Cavalcanti]]. The political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of Florentine politics. In response to a question from Dante about the "prophecy" he has received, Farinata explains that what the souls in Hell [[Theory of knowledge|know]] of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when "the portal of the future has been shut",&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto X, lines 103–108, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; it will no longer be possible for them to know anything. Farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], commonly reputed to be an Epicurean, and [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]], to whom Dante refers to as ''il Cardinale''.

'''''Canto XI'''''
&lt;br&gt;
Dante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to [[Pope Anastasius II]] – although some modern scholars hold that Dante erred in the verse mentioning Anastasius ("''Anastasio papa guardo, / lo qual trasse [[Photinus|Fotin]] de la via dritta''", lines 8–9), confusing the pope with the Byzantine emperor of the time, [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]].&lt;ref name=McBrien&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard P.

In his explanation, Virgil refers to the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' of [[Aristotle]], with medieval interpretations. Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources ("Nature") and human labor and activity ("Art"). [[Usury]], to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.&lt;ref name = sayersXI&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars' positions. The "Wain", the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], now lies in the northwest over [[Classical compass winds|Caurus]] (the northwest wind). The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] (the Fish) is just appearing over the horizon: it is the zodiacal sign preceding [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] (the Ram). Canto I notes that the sun is in Aries, and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at two-hour intervals, it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise: 4:00 A.M. on [[Holy Saturday]], April 9.&lt;ref name=sayersXI /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XI, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh Circle (Violence)===
'''''Canto XII'''''
&lt;br&gt;
The Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent. Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle, having first to evade the [[Minotaur]] (''L'infamia di Creti'', "the infamy of [[Crete#Minoan civilization|Crete]]", line 12); at the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, [[Theseus]]. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 27:51), at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. Ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell (the entrance of the [[Inferno (Dante)#Second Circle (Lust)|Second Circle]], Canto V).

[[File:Inf. 12 anonimo fiorentino.jpg|thumb|130px|left|"Along the brink of the vermilion boiling, / Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments. / People I saw within up to the eyebrows ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XII, lines 101–103, Longfellow translation.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''Ring 1: Against Neighbors''': In the first round of the seventh circle, the murderers, war-makers, plunderers, and tyrants are immersed in [[Phlegethon]], a river of boiling blood and fire. Ciardi writes, "as they wallowed in blood during their lives, so they are immersed in the boiling blood forever, each according to the degree of his guilt".&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', Canto XII, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centaur]]s, commanded by [[Chiron]] and [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]], patrol the ring, shooting arrows into any sinners who emerge higher out of the boiling blood than each is allowed. The centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]] guides the poets along Phlegethon and points out [[Alexander the Great]], "Dionysius" (either [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius I]] or [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]], or both; they were bloodthirsty, unpopular tyrants of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Sicily]]), [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] (the cruelest of the Ghibelline tyrants), [[Obizzo II d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Obizzo d'Este]], and [[Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola|Guy de Montfort]]. The river grows shallower until it reaches a ford, after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where Dante and Virgil first approached it; immersed here are tyrants including [[Attila|Attila, King of the Huns]] (''flagello in terra'', "scourge on earth", line 134), "Pyrrhus" (either the bloodthirsty [[Neoptolemus|son of Achilles]] or King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]), [[Sextus Pompey|Sextus]], Rinier da Corneto, and Rinier Pazzo. After bringing Dante and Virgil to the shallow ford, Nessus leaves them to return to his post. This passage may have been influenced by the early medieval ''[[Visio Karoli Grossi]]''.{{refn|group=nb|The punishment of immersion was not typically ascribed in Dante's age to the violent, but the ''Visio'' attaches it to those who ''facere praelia et homicidia et rapinas pro cupiditate terrena'' ("make battle and murder and rapine because of worldly cupidity"). Theodore Silverstein (1936), "Inferno, XII, 100–126, and the ''Visio Karoli Crassi''," ''[[Modern Language Notes]]'', '''51''':7, 449–452, and Theodore Silverstein (1939), "The Throne of the Emperor Henry in Dante's Paradise and the Mediaeval Conception of Christian Kingship," ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'', '''32''':2, 115–129, suggests that Dante's interest in contemporary politics would have attracted him to a piece like the ''Visio''. Its popularity assures that Dante would have had access to it. [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Arthur Goldhammer|Goldhammer, Arthur]], tr. (1986), ''The Birth of Purgatory'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-47083-0}}), states definitively that ("we know [that]") Dante read it.}}

[[File:DVinfernoForestOfSuicides m.jpg|thumb|right|''Harpies in the wood of the suicides'', from ''Inferno'' Canto XIII, by [[Gustave Doré]], 1861]]
'''''Canto XIII'''''

* '''Ring 2: Against Self''': The second round of the seventh circle is the Wood of the Suicides, in which the souls of the [[suicide|people who attempted or committed suicide]] are transformed into gnarled, thorny trees and then fed upon by [[Harpy|Harpies]], hideous clawed birds with the faces of women; the trees are only permitted to speak when broken and bleeding. Dante breaks a twig off one of the trees and from the bleeding trunk hears the tale of [[Pietro della Vigna]], a powerful minister of Emperor Frederick II until he fell out of favor and was imprisoned and blinded. He subsequently committed suicide; his presence here, rather than in the Ninth Circle, indicates that Dante believes that the accusations made against him were false.&lt;ref name=sayersXIII&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harpies and the characteristics of the bleeding bushes are based on Book 3 of the ''[[Aeneid]]''. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, the sin of suicide is an "insult to the body; so, here, the shades are deprived of even the semblance of the human form. As they refused life, they remain fixed in a dead and withered sterility. They are the image of the self-hatred which dries up the very sap of energy and makes all life infertile."&lt;ref name=sayersXIII /&gt; The trees can also be interpreted as a metaphor for the state of mind in which suicide is committed.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Fowlie, ''A Reading of Dante's Inferno'', University of Chicago Press, 1981, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;{{paragraph break}} Dante learns that these suicides, unique among the dead, will not be corporally resurrected after the Final Judgement since they threw their bodies away; instead, they will maintain their bushy form, with their own corpses hanging from the thorny limbs. After Pietro della Vigna finishes his story, Dante notices two shades (Lano da Siena and Jacopo Sant' Andrea) race through the wood, chased and savagely mauled by ferocious [[Dog|bitches]] – this is the punishment of the violently [[Spendthrift|profligate]] who, "possessed by a depraved passion ... dissipated their goods for the sheer wanton lust of wreckage and disorder".&lt;ref name=sayersXIII /&gt; The destruction wrought upon the wood by the profligates' flight and punishment as they crash through the undergrowth causes further suffering to the suicides, who cannot move out of the way.

[[File:DVinfernoBrunettoLatiniAccostsDante m.jpg|thumb|left|Brunetto Latini speaks with Dante in Canto XV, an engraving by Gustave Doré.]]
'''''Canto XIV'''''

* '''Ring 3: Against God, Art, and Nature''': The third round of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand scorched by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky, an image derived from the fate of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] (''[[Book of Genesis|Gen]]''. 19:24.) The '''[[Blasphemy|Blasphemers]]''' (the Violent against God) are stretched supine upon the burning sand, the '''[[Sodomy|Sodomites]]''' (the Violent against Nature) run in circles, while the '''[[Usury|Usurers]]''' (the Violent against Art, which is the Grandchild of God, [[Inferno (Dante)#Sixth Circle (Heresy)|as explained in Canto XI]]) crouch huddled and weeping. Ciardi writes, "Blasphemy, sodomy, and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions: thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners; and thus the rain, which in nature should be fertile and cool, descends as fire".&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', Canto XIV, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Dante finds [[Capaneus]] stretched out on the sands; for blasphemy against [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]], he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the [[Seven Against Thebes|Siege of Thebes]]; he is still scorning Jove in the afterlife. The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the First Round, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second round) and crosses the Burning Plain. Virgil explains the origin of the rivers of Hell, which includes references to the Old Man of Crete.

'''''Canto XV'''''
&lt;br&gt;
Protected by the powers of the boiling rivulet, Dante and Virgil progress across the burning plain. They pass a roving group of Sodomites, and Dante, to his surprise, recognizes [[Brunetto Latini]]. Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection, "paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the ''Inferno''",&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', Canto XV, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto XV.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works ("you taught me how man makes himself eternal; / and while I live, my gratitude for that / must always be apparent in my words"),&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XV, lines 85–87, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunetto prophesies Dante's bad treatment by the Florentines. He also identifies other sodomites, including [[Priscian]], [[Franciscus Accursius|Francesco d'Accorso]], and Bishop [[Andrea dei Mozzi|Andrea de' Mozzi]].

[[File:Inferno Canto 17 verse 117.jpg|thumb|upright|right|160px|A Gustave Doré wood engraving of [[Geryon]], Canto XVII.]] 
'''''Canto XVI'''''
&lt;br /&gt;
The Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle when three shades break from their company and greet them. They are [[Iacopo Rusticucci]], Guido Guerra, and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi – all Florentines much admired by Dante. Rusticucci blames his "savage wife" for his torments. The sinners ask for news of Florence, and Dante laments the current state of the city. At the top of the falls, at Virgil's order, Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge; as if in answer, a large, distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss.

'''''Canto XVII'''''
&lt;br&gt;
The creature is [[Geryon]], the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a [[heraldic device]] emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck ("On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast"&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', Canto XVII, line 56&lt;/ref&gt;). The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of [[Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi]], [[Ciappo Ubriachi]], the Paduan [[Reginaldo degli Scrovegni]] (who predicts that his fellow Paduan [[Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani]] will join him here), and [[Giovanni di Buiamonte]]. Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.

Geryon, the winged monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the Eighth Circle, was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies.&lt;ref name="DLS17"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XVII.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante's Geryon, meanwhile, is an image of fraud,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Fowlie, ''A Reading of Dante's Inferno'', University of Chicago Press, 1981, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; combining human, bestial, and reptilian elements: Geryon is a "monster with the general shape of a [[wyvern]] but with the tail of a [[scorpion]], hairy arms, a gaudily-marked reptilian body, and the face of a just and honest man".&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XVII, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions "behind the face" are all monstrous, cold-blooded, and stinging with poison.

==={{anchor|Malebolge|Eighth circle}}Eighth Circle (Fraud)===
{{See also|Malebolge}}
'''''Canto XVIII'''''
&lt;br&gt;
Dante now finds himself in the Eighth Circle, called [[Malebolge]] ("Evil ditches"): the upper half of the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an [[amphitheatre]] around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, concentric ditches or trenches called ''bolge'' (singular: ''bolgia''). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like umbrella ribs or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is, "the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence – all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified".&lt;ref name="DLS18"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Inferno, Canto XVIII - WGA02854.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Sandro Botticelli]]: Dante and Virgil visit the first two ''bolge'' of the Eighth Circle.]]
* '''Bolgia 1 – [[Procuring (prostitution)|Panderers]] and [[Seduction|seducers]]''': These sinners make two files, one along either bank of the ditch, and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned [[demon]]s for eternity. They "deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests, are themselves driven and scourged".&lt;ref name="DLS18" /&gt; Dante makes reference to a recent traffic rule developed for the [[Jubilee (Christian)#The first Christian jubilee|Jubilee]] year of 1300 in Rome.&lt;ref name="DLS18" /&gt; In the group of panderers, the poets notice Venedico Caccianemico, a Bolognese Guelph who sold his own sister Ghisola to the [[Obizzo II d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Marchese d'Este]]. In the group of seducers, Virgil points out [[Jason]], the Greek hero who led the [[Argonauts]] to fetch the [[Golden Fleece]] from [[Aeëtes]], King of [[Colchis]]. He gained the help of the king's daughter, [[Medea]], by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for [[Creusa (daughter of Creon)|Creusa]].&lt;ref name="DLS18"/&gt; Jason had previously seduced [[Hypsipyle]] when the Argonauts landed at [[Lemnos]] on their way to Colchis, but "abandoned her, alone and pregnant".&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XVIII, line 94, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bolgia 2 – [[Flattery|Flatterers]]''': These also exploited other people, this time abusing and corrupting language to play upon others' desires and fears. They are steeped in [[Feces|excrement]] (representative of the false flatteries they told on earth) as they howl and fight amongst themselves. Alessio Interminei of Lucca and [[Thaïs]] are seen here.&lt;ref name="DLS18"/&gt;

* '''Bolgia 3 – [[Simony|Simoniacs]]''': Dante now forcefully expresses his condemnation of those who committed simony, or the sale of ecclesiastic favors and offices, and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to God: "Rapacious ones, who take the things of God, / that ought to be the brides of Righteousness, / and make them fornicate for gold and silver! / The time has come to let the trumpet sound / for you; ...".&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XIX, lines 2–6, Mandelbaum translation&lt;/ref&gt; The sinners are placed head-downwards in round, tube-like holes within the rock (debased mockeries of [[baptismal font]]s), with flames burning the soles of their feet. The heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt. The [[simile]] of baptismal fonts gives Dante an incidental opportunity to clear his name of an accusation of malicious damage to the font at the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery of San Giovanni]].&lt;ref name="DLS19"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Magus]], who offered gold in exchange for holy power to [[Saint Peter]] and after whom the sin is named, is mentioned here (although Dante does not encounter him). One of the sinners, [[Pope Nicholas III]], must serve in the hellish baptism by fire from his death in 1280 until 1303 – the arrival in Hell of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] – who will take his predecessor's place in the stone tube until 1314, when he will in turn be replaced by [[Pope Clement V]], a puppet of King [[Philip IV of France]] who moved the [[Holy See|Papal See]] to [[Avignon]], ushering in the [[Avignon Papacy]] (1309–77). Dante delivers a denunciation of simoniacal corruption of the Church.

'''''Canto XX'''''

* '''Bolgia 4 – [[Magician (paranormal)|Sorcerers]]''': In the middle of the bridge of the Fourth Bolgia, Dante looks down at the souls of [[Fortune-telling|fortune tellers]], [[Divination|diviners]], [[astrology|astrologers]], and other [[false prophets]]. The punishment of those who attempted to "usurp God's prerogative by prying into the future",&lt;ref name="DLS20"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XX.&lt;/ref&gt; is to have their heads twisted around on their bodies; in this horrible contortion of the human form, these sinners are compelled to walk backwards for eternity, blinded by their own tears. John Ciardi writes, "Thus, those who sought to penetrate the future cannot even see in front of themselves; they attempted to move themselves forward in time, so must they go backwards through all eternity; and as the arts of sorcery are a distortion of God's law, so are their bodies distorted in Hell."&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XX, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; While referring primarily to attempts to see into the future by forbidden means, this also symbolises the twisted nature of magic in general.&lt;ref name="DLS20" /&gt; Dante weeps in pity, and Virgil rebukes him, saying, "Here pity only lives when it is dead; / for who can be more impious than he / who links God's judgment to passivity?"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XX, lines 28–30, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil gives a lengthy explanation of the founding of his native city of [[Mantua]]. Among the sinners in this circle are King [[Amphiaraus]] (one of the [[Seven Against Thebes]]; foreseeing his death in the war, he sought to avert it by hiding from battle but died in an earthquake trying to flee) and two Theban soothsayers: [[Tiresias]] (in Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' III, 324–331, Tiresias was transformed into a woman upon striking two coupling serpents with his rod; seven years later, he was changed back to a man in an identical encounter) and his daughter [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]]. Also in this ''bolgia'' are Aruns (an Etruscan soothsayer who predicted the Caesar's victory in the [[Caesar's Civil War|Roman civil war]] in Lucan's ''[[Pharsalia]]'' I, 585–638), the Greek augur [[Eurypylus (king of Thessaly)|Eurypylus]], astrologers [[Michael Scot]] (served at Frederick II's court at Palermo) and [[Guido Bonatti]] (served the court of [[Guido I da Montefeltro|Guido da Montefeltro]]), and Asdente (a shoemaker and soothsayer from Parma). Virgil implies that the moon is now setting over the [[Pillars of Hercules]] in the West: the time is just after 6:00 A.M., the dawn of Holy Saturday.

[[File:Gustave Dore Inferno Canto 21.jpg|thumb|Dante's guide rebuffs [[Malacoda]] and his fiends between ''Bolge'' V and VI, Canto XXI]]
'''''Canto XXI'''''

* '''Bolgia 5 –  [[Graft (politics)|Barrators]]''': Corrupt politicians, who made money by trafficking in public offices (the political analogue of the simoniacs), are immersed in a lake of boiling [[tar|pitch]], which represents the sticky fingers and dark secrets of their corrupt deals.&lt;ref name="DLS21"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; They are guarded by demons called the [[Malebranche (Divine Comedy)|Malebranche]] ("Evil Claws"), who tear them to pieces with claws and grappling hooks if they catch them above the surface of the pitch. The Poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting Senator of [[Lucca]] and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him. Virgil secures safe-conduct from the leader of the Malebranche, named [[Malacoda]] ("Evil Tail"). He informs them that the bridge across the Sixth Bolgia is shattered (as a result of the earthquake that shook Hell at the death of Christ in 34 AD) but that there is another bridge further on. He sends a squad of demons led by [[Barbariccia]] to escort them safely. Based on details in this Canto (and if Christ's death is taken to have occurred at exactly noon), the time is now 7:00 A.M. of Holy Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XXI, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Allen Mandelbaum on Canto XXI, lines 112–114: "the bridges of Hell crumbled 1266 years ago – at a time five hours later than the present hour yesterday. Dante held that Christ died after having completed 34 years of life on this earth – years counted from the day of the Incarnation. Luke affirms that the hour of His death was the sixth – that is, noon. If this is the case, then Malacoda is referring to a time which is 7 A.M., five hours before noon on Holy Saturday."&lt;ref&gt;Allen Mandelbaum, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XXI&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The demons provide some savage and satirical [[black comedy]] – in the last line of Canto XXI, the sign for their march is provided by a fart: "and he had made a trumpet of his ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/vpatterson/2011/11/great-farts-in-literature/|title=Great Farts in Literature|last=Patterson|first=Victoria|work=The Nervous Breakdown|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canto XXII'''''
&lt;br&gt;One of the grafters, an unidentified Navarrese (identified by early commentators as [[Ciampolo]]) is seized by the demons, and Virgil questions him. The sinner speaks of his fellow grafters, Friar Gomita (a corrupt friar in [[Gallura]] eventually hanged by [[Nino Visconti]] (see ''[[Purgatorio|Purg.]]'' VIII) for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michel Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King [[Enzo of Sardinia]]). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. [[Alichino (devil)|Alichino]] and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party. Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away.

'''''Canto XXIII'''''

* '''Bolgia 6 – [[Hypocrisy|Hypocrites]]''': The Poets escape the pursuing Malebranche by sliding down the sloping bank of the next pit. Here they find the hypocrites listlessly walking around a narrow track for eternity, weighted down by leaden robes. The robes are brilliantly gilded on the outside and are shaped like a monk's habit – the hypocrite's "outward appearance shines brightly and passes for holiness, but under that show lies the terrible weight of his deceit",&lt;ref name="Ciardi XXIII"&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XXIII, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; a falsity that weighs them down and makes spiritual progress impossible for them.&lt;ref name="DLS23"&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXIII&lt;/ref&gt; Dante speaks with Catalano dei Malavolti and [[Loderingo degli Andalò]], two Bolognese brothers of the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Jovial Friars]], an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by Papal decree.&lt;ref name="DLS23"/&gt; Friar Catalano points out [[Caiaphas]], the High Priest under [[Pontius Pilate]] who counseled the [[Pharisees]] to crucify Jesus for the public good ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:49–50). He himself is crucified to the floor of Hell by three large stakes, and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him: he "must suffer upon his body the weight of all the world's hypocrisy".&lt;ref name="Ciardi XXIII"/&gt; The Jovial Friars explain to Virgil how he may climb from the pit; Virgil discovers that Malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the Sixth Bolgia.

[[File:Inferno Canto 24 verses 89-92.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Thieves tortured by Serpents'': engraving by Gustave Doré illustrating Canto XXIV of the ''Inferno''.]]
'''''Canto XXIV'''''

* '''Bolgia 7 – [[Theft|Thieves]]''': Dante and Virgil leave the ''bolgia'' of the Hypocrites by climbing the ruined rocks of a bridge destroyed by the great earthquake, after which they cross the bridge of the Seventh Bolgia to the far side to observe the next chasm. The pit is filled with monstrous [[reptile]]s: the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s, who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their hands behind their backs. The full horror of the thieves' punishment is revealed gradually: just as they stole other people's substance in life, their very identity becomes subject to theft here.&lt;ref name="DLS24"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt; One sinner, who reluctantly identifies himself as [[Vanni Fucci]], is bitten by a serpent at the [[jugular vein]], bursts into flames, and is re-formed from the ashes like a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. Vanni tells a dark prophecy against Dante.

'''''Canto XXV'''''
&lt;br&gt;Vanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him. The centaur [[Cacus]] arrives to punish the wretch; he has a fire-breathing [[dragon]] on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. (In Roman mythology, Cacus, the monstrous, fire-breathing son of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], was killed by [[Hercules]] for raiding the hero's cattle; in ''Aeneid'' VIII, 193–267, Virgil did not describe him as a centaur). Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations. Agnello Brunelleschi, in human form, is merged with the six-legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati. A figure named Buoso (perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati, the latter of whom is mentioned in ''Inf.'' XXX.44) first appears as a man, but exchanges forms with Francesco de' Cavalcanti, who bites Buoso in the form of a four-footed serpent. Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being.

[[File:Inferno Canto 26 verses 46-49.jpg|thumb|upright|Dante and Virgil observe the false counsellors, Canto XXVI]]
'''''Canto XXVI'''''

* '''Bolgia 8 – [[Deception|Counsellors of Fraud]]''': Dante addresses a passionate lament to Florence before turning to the next ''bolgia''. Here, fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about, hidden from view inside individual flames. These are not people who gave false advice, but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud.&lt;ref name="DLS26"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXVI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and [[Diomedes]] are punished together within a great double-headed flame; they are condemned for the stratagem of the [[Trojan Horse]] (resulting in the [[Trojan War#Sack of Troy|Fall of Troy]]), persuading Achilles to sail for Troy (causing [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]] to die of grief), and for the theft of the sacred statue of Pallas, the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]] (upon which, it was believed, the fate of Troy depended). Ulysses, the figure in the larger horn of the flame, narrates the tale of his last voyage and death (Dante's invention). He tells how, after his detainment by [[Circe]], his love for neither [[Telemachus|his son]], [[Laertes|his father]], nor [[Penelope|his wife]] could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to "gain experience of the world / and of the vices and the worth of men".&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXVI, lines 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; As they approach the [[Pillars of Hercules]], Ulysses urges his crew:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
'Brothers,' I said, 'o you, who having crossed 
   a hundred thousand dangers, reach the west, 
   to this brief waking-time that still is left
unto your senses, you must not deny 
   experience of that which lies beyond 
   the sun, and of the world that is unpeopled.
Consider well the seed that gave you birth: 
   you were not made to live your lives as brutes, 
   but to be followers of worth and knowledge.'&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXVI, lines 112–120, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Ulysses tells how he and his men traveled south across the equator, observed the southern stars, and found that the North Star had sunk below the horizon; they sight Mount Purgatory in the Southern Hemisphere after five months of passage.

'''''Canto XXVII'''''
&lt;br&gt;Dante is approached by [[Guido I da Montefeltro|Guido da Montefeltro]], head of the Ghibellines of [[Romagna]], asking for news of his country. Dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of Romagna. Guido then recounts his life: he advised [[Pope Boniface VIII]] to offer a false amnesty to the [[Colonna family]], who, in 1297, had walled themselves inside the castle of [[Palestrina]] in the Lateran. When the Colonna accepted the terms and left the castle, the Pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge. Guido describes how [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], founder of the [[Franciscan]] order, came to take his soul to Heaven, only to have a devil assert prior claim. Although Boniface had [[Absolution|absolved]] Guido in advance for his evil advice, the devil points out the invalidity: absolution requires [[contrition]], and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it&lt;ref name="DLS27"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canto XXVIII'''''

* '''Bolgia 9 – Sowers of [[Schism|Discord]]''': In the Ninth Bolgia, the Sowers of Discord are hacked and mutilated for all eternity by a large demon wielding a bloody sword; their bodies are divided as, in life, their sin was to tear apart what God had intended to be united;&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XXVIII, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; these are the sinners who are "ready to rip up the whole fabric of society to gratify a sectional egotism".&lt;ref name="DLS28"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; The souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch, their wounds healing in the course of the circuit, only to have the demon tear them apart anew. There are divided into three categories: (i) religious schism and discord, (ii) civil strife and political discord, and (iii) family disunion, or discord between kinsmen. Chief among the first category is [[Muhammad]], the founder of [[Islam]]: his body is ripped from groin to chin, with his entrails hanging out. Dante apparently saw Muhammad as causing a schism within Christianity when he and his followers splintered off.&lt;ref name="DLS28"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Fowlie, ''A Reading of Dante's Inferno'', University of Chicago Press, 1981, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante also condemns Muhammad's son-in-law, [[Ali]], for schism between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shiite]]: his face is cleft from top to bottom. Muhammad tells Dante to warn the schismatic and heretic [[Fra Dolcino]]. In the second category are Pier da Medicina (his throat slit, nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows, a wound where one of his ears had been), the Roman tribune [[Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (who advised Caesar to [[Crossing the Rubicon|cross the Rubicon]] and thus begin the [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil War]]; his tongue is cut off), and Mosca dei Lamberti (who incited the Amidei family to kill Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, resulting in conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines; his arms are hacked off). Finally, in the third category of sinner, Dante sees [[Bertran de Born|Bertrand de Born]] (1140–1215). The knight carries around [[Decapitation|his severed head]] by its own hair, swinging it like a lantern. Bertrand is said to have caused a quarrel between [[Henry II of England]] and his son Prince [[Henry the Young King]]; his punishment in Hell is decapitation, since dividing father and son is like severing the head from the body.&lt;ref name="DLS28"/&gt;

'''''Canto XXIX'''''

* '''Bolgia 10 – [[Forgery|Falsifiers]]''': The final ''bolgia'' of the Eighth Circle, is home to various sorts of falsifiers. A "disease" on society, they are themselves afflicted with different types of afflictions:&lt;ref name="DLS29"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; horrible [[disease]]s, stench, thirst, filth, darkness, and screaming. Some lie prostrate while others run hungering through the pit, tearing others to pieces. Shortly before their arrival in this pit, Virgil indicates that it is approximately noon of Holy Saturday, and he and Dante discuss one of Dante's kinsmen (Geri de Bello) among the Sowers of Discord in the previous ditch. The first category of falsifiers Dante encounters are the '''[[Alchemy|Alchemists]]''' (Falsifiers of Things). He speaks with two spirits viciously scrubbing and clawing at their leprous [[Wound healing|scabs]]: Griffolino d'Arezzo (an alchemist who extracted money from the foolish Alberto da Siena on the promise of teaching him to fly; Alberto's reputed father the Bishop of Siena had Griffolino burned at the stake) and Capocchio (burned at the stake at Siena in 1293 for practicing alchemy).

[[File:William Bouguereau - Dante and Virgile - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dante et Virgile'' by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]: Capocchio, an alchemist, is attacked by Gianni Schicchi, who impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to claim his inheritance, Canto XXX.]]
'''''Canto XXX'''''
&lt;br&gt;
Suddenly, two spirits – Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and [[Myrrha]], both punished as '''[[List of impostors|Imposters]]''' (Falsifiers of Persons) – run rabid through the pit. Schicchi sinks his tusks into Capocchio's neck and drags him away like prey. Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit [[incest]] with her father [[Cinyras|King Cinyras]], while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the '''[[Counterfeit money|Counterfeiters]]''' (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine [[florin]]s of twenty-one (rather than twenty-four) [[Fineness|carat gold]], he was burned at the stake in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome [[Edema|dropsy]]-like disease, which gives him a [[Abdominal distension|bloated stomach]], prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable [[thirst]]. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the '''[[Perjury|Perjurers]]''' (Falsifiers of Words). These are [[Potiphar and his wife|Potiphar's wife]] (punished for her false accusation of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], ''[[Book of Genesis|Gen]]''. 39:7–19) and [[Sinon]], the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (''Aeneid'' II, 57–194); Sinon is here rather than in ''Bolgia'' 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning [[fever]]. Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide. Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge "began with the sale of the sexual relationship, and went on to the sale of Church and State; now, the very money is itself corrupted, every affirmation has become perjury, and every identity a lie"&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt; so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed.

====Central Well of Malebolge====
[[File:Gustave Doré - Dante Alighieri - Inferno - Plate 65 (Canto XXXI - The Titans).jpg|thumb|left|Titans and giants, including [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] on the left, in Doré's illustrations.]]
'''''Canto XXXI'''''
&lt;br /&gt;
Dante and Virgil approach the Central Well, at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The [[Giants (Greek mythology)|classical]] and biblical [[giant (mythology)|Giants]] – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of [[Betrayal|treachery]]&lt;ref name="DLS31"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge.&lt;ref name="DLS32"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXXII.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies [[Nimrod]] (who tried to build the [[Tower of Babel]]; he shouts out the unintelligible ''[[Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi]]''); [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] (who with his brother Otus tried to storm [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] during the [[Gigantomachy]]; he has his arms chained up) and [[Hekatonkheires|Briareus]] (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and [[Tityos]] and [[Typhon]], who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant [[Antaeus]], who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.

===Ninth Circle (Treachery)===
[[File:Gustave Dore Inferno32.jpg|thumb|Dante speaks to the traitors in the ice, Canto XXXII.]]
'''''Canto XXXII'''''
&lt;br&gt;
At the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: [[Cocytus]], the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or "rounds") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of [[liege lord|lords]]. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, "The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice."&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XXXII, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers (its most famous inmate is [[Judas Iscariot]]).

* '''Round 1 – Caïna''': this round is named after [[Cain and Abel#Cain|Cain]], who killed [[Cain and Abel#Abel|his own brother]] in the first act of [[murder]] (''[[Book of Genesis|Gen]]''. 4:8). This round houses the '''Traitors to their Kindred''': they have their necks and heads out of the ice and are allowed to bow their heads, allowing some protection from the freezing wind. Here Dante sees the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, who killed each other over their inheritance and their politics some time between 1282 and 1286. Camiscion de' Pazzi, a Ghibelline who murdered his kinsman Ubertino, identifies several other sinners: [[Mordred]] (traitorous nephew of [[King Arthur]]); Vanni de' Cancellieri, nicknamed Focaccia (a White Guelph of [[Pistoia]] who killed his cousin, Detto de' Cancellieri); and Sassol Mascheroni of the noble Toschi family of Florence (murdered a relative). Camiscion is aware that, in July 1302, his relative Carlino de' Pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the Castle of Piantravigne to the Blacks, betraying the Whites. As a traitor to his party, Carlino belongs in Antenora, the next circle down – his greater sin will make Camiscion look virtuous by comparison.&lt;ref name="DLS32" /&gt;

[[File:Ugolino and His Sons MET DP247545.jpg|thumb|''[[Ugolino and His Sons (Carpeaux)|Ugolino and His Sons]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) depicts [[Ugolino della Gherardesca]]'s story from Canto XXXIII. Imprisoned for treachery, Ugolino starves to death with his children, who, before dying, beg him to eat their bodies.]]
* '''Round 2 – Antenora''': the second round is named after [[Antenor (mythology)|Antenor]], a [[Troy|Trojan]] soldier who betrayed his city to the Greeks. Here lie the '''Traitors to their Country''': those who committed [[treason]] against political entities (parties, cities, or countries) have their heads above the ice, but they cannot bend their necks. Dante accidentally kicks the head of Bocca degli Abati, a traitorous Guelph of Florence, and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met. Also punished in this level are Buoso da Duera (Ghibelline leader bribed by the French to betray Manfred, King of Naples), Tesauro dei Beccheria (a Ghibelline of Pavia; beheaded by the Florentine Guelphs for treason in 1258), Gianni de' Soldanieri (noble Florentine Ghibelline who joined with the Guelphs after Manfred's death in 1266), [[Ganelon]] (betrayed the rear guard of [[Charlemagne]] to the [[Muslim]]s at [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|Roncesvalles]], according to the French epic poem [[The Song of Roland]]), and Tebaldello de' Zambrasi of [[Faenza]] (a Ghibelline who turned his city over to the Bolognese Guelphs on Nov. 13, 1280). The Poets then see two heads frozen in one hole, one gnawing the nape of the other's neck.

'''''Canto XXXIII'''''
&lt;br /&gt;
The gnawing sinner tells his story: he is [[Ugolino della Gherardesca|Count Ugolino]], and the head he gnaws belongs to [[Ruggieri degli Ubaldini|Archbishop Ruggieri]]. In "the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the ''Inferno''",&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Inferno'', notes on Canto XXXIII, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri in 1288 to oust [[Nino Visconti|his nephew]] and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa. However, as soon as Nino was gone, the Archbishop, sensing the Guelphs' weakened position, turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the [[Torre dei Gualandi]]. In March 1289, the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to [[Immurement|death by starvation]] in the tower.
* '''Round 3 – Ptolomaea''': the third region of Cocytus is named after [[Ptolemy (son of Abubus)|Ptolemy]], who invited his father-in-law [[Simon Thassi|Simon Maccabaeus]] and his sons to a banquet and then killed them ([[1 Maccabees|1 ''Maccabees'']] 16).&lt;ref name="DLS33"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXXIII.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Traitors to their Guests''' lie supine in the ice while their [[tears]] freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them. Dante encounters [[Fra Alberigo]], one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark [[Atropos]] has [[Moirai|cut their thread]]"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXXIII, line 125, Ciardi translation&lt;/ref&gt;). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, Bolgia 5) and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the ''bolgia'' of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice ("And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXXIII, lines 149–150, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Canto XXXIV'''''

* '''Round 4 – Judecca''': the fourth division of Cocytus, named for [[Judas Iscariot]], contains the '''Traitors to their Lords''' and benefactors. Upon entry into this round, Virgil says "''[[Vexilla Regis|Vexilla regis prodeunt]] inferni''" ("The banners of the King of Hell draw closer").&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXXIV, line 1, Mandelbaum translation&lt;/ref&gt; Judecca is completely silent: all of the sinners are fully encapsulated in ice, distorted and twisted in every conceivable position. The sinners present an image of utter immobility: it is impossible to talk with any of them, so Dante and Virgil quickly move on to the centre of Hell.

====Centre of Hell====

{{see also|Dante's Satan}}
In the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin (personal treachery against God), is the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]], referred to by Virgil as [[Dīs Pater|Dis]] (the Roman god of the underworld; the name "Dis" was often used for [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] in antiquity, such as in Virgil's ''Aeneid''). The arch-traitor, [[Lucifer]] was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God, resulting in his expulsion from Heaven. Lucifer is a giant, terrifying beast trapped waist-deep in the ice, fixed and suffering. He has three faces, each a different color: one red (the middle), one a pale yellow (the right), and one black (the left):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
... he had three faces: one in front bloodred;
and then another two that, just above
   the midpoint of each shoulder, joined the first;
   and at the crown, all three were reattached;
the right looked somewhat yellow, somewhat white;
   the left in its appearance was like those
   who come from where the Nile, descending, flows.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXXIV, lines 39–45, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dorothy L. Sayers notes that Satan's three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three [[Race (human categorization)|human races]]: red for the Europeans (from [[Japheth]]), yellow for the Asiatic (from [[Shem]]), and black for the African (the race of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]).&lt;ref name="DLS34"/&gt; All interpretations recognize that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the [[Trinity]]: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, in contrast to the [[Omnipotence|all-powerful]], [[omniscience|all-knowing]], and [[omnibenevolence|all-loving]] nature of God.&lt;ref name="DLS34"/&gt; Lucifer retains his six wings (he originally belonged to the angelic order of [[Seraph]]im, described in ''[[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]'' 6:2), but these are now dark, [[bat]]-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] (March 15, 44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world.&lt;ref name="DLS34"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto XXXIV.&lt;/ref&gt; In the central, most vicious mouth is [[Judas Iscariot]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, "just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world".&lt;ref name="DLS34" /&gt;

At about 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Saturday evening, Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first. When they reach Satan's genitalia, the poets pass through the [[Geocentric model|center of the universe]] and [[center of gravity|of gravity]] from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water. When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb "upward" towards the surface of the Earth at the [[antipodes]], Dante, in his confusion, initially believes they are returning to Hell. Virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the [[Liturgy of the Hours|canonical hours]] of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] (6 a.m.) and [[Terce]] (9 a.m.) – that is, 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. of the same Holy Saturday which was just about to end. Dante is confused as to how, after about an hour and a half of climbing, it is now apparently morning. Virgil explains that as a result of passing through the Earth's center into the Southern Hemisphere, which is twelve hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]], the central city of the Northern Hemisphere (where, therefore, it is currently 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.).

Virgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land, but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean. Meanwhile, the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the center of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him, forming the [[Purgatorio|Mountain of Purgatory]]. This mountain – the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere – rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem. The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the "space contained between the floor formed by the [[wikt:convex|convex]] side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above,"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hollander and Jean Hollander, ''The Inferno'', notes on Canto XXXIV, p. 641.&lt;/ref&gt; moving in opposition to [[Lethe]], the river of oblivion, which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory. The poets finally emerge a little before dawn on the morning of [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] (April 10, 1300 A.D.) beneath a sky studded with stars.

'''Jazz meditation''' refers to [[guided meditation]] practice that incorporates live instrumental [[jazz]] music. During a typical jazz meditation performance, a meditation guide or teacher is accompanied by one or more musicians, and [[musical improvisation]] is used as an anchor for [[mindfulness]] techniques such as [[Creative visualization|visualization]] and breathing exercises. An audience of seated participants meditate in response to live music and the teacher's spoken instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lenkin|first1=Elysha|title=Live Jazz As An Anchor For Meditation|url=http://www.yogacitynyc.com/#!Live-Jazz-As-An-Anchor-For-Meditation/c1m6q/55101faa0cf21e26baa3971e|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=YogaCity NYC|date=March 23, 2015|ref=Yoga City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Roots in Buddhism and jazz===
Since the mid-20th Century, there has been an evolving relationship between jazz musicians and [[Buddhist]] meditative practices. From the emergence of the [[Beat Generation]] artists in the post [[World War II]] era United States, through the counter-culture 1960s and [[New Age]] and experimental aesthetics of the late 20th Century, musicians have found rich inspiration as well as discipline in many of the same concepts that are fundamental to Buddhist practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernonfrazer.net/Extending%20the%20Age%20of%20Spontaneity%20to%20a%20New%20Era_%20Post-Beat%20Poe.pdf |format=PDF |title=Extending the age of Spontaneity to a New Era : Post-Beat Poets in America |author=Vernon Frazer |website=Vernonfrazer.net |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation concepts that have been integrated into jazz theory and performance include: being in the present moment; concentration; following the mind; following the breath; returning to the anchor concept of focus; placing priority on the action in the present, not in a theory. Particular Buddhist teachings such as [[esoteric]] ideas of non-verbal deep insight and communication, and the benefits of [[chanting]] (rhythmic repetition of sound) - have strong analogues in jazz performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_y334T06JP0C&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=jazz+20th+century+buddhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eYnYVLTqI6&amp;sig=jPCF0qHCL3VisGzJu5DMNZrBRrM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfzoLim-bLAhWHVh4KHWeXDwQQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=jazz%2020th%20century%20buddhism&amp;f=false |title=Buddha Or Bust: In Search of Truth, Meaning, Happiness, and the Man Who ... - Perry Garfinkel - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several late 20th Century and contemporary jazz musicians have acknowledged drawing inspiration from meditation and Buddhist practices, including [[John Coltrane]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin,]] [[Don Cherry]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Yusef Lateef]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[Herbie Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/4/herbie-hancock-first-norton/ |title=Miles Davis, Buddhism, and Jazz featured in Hancock’s First Lecture as Norton Professor &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Harvard Crimson |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/blog/herbie-hancock-his-buddhist-practice |title=Herbie Hancock on his Buddhist practice |publisher=Tricycle |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Josh |url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/06/sonny-rollins-50-years-of-practicing-yoga.html |title=Sonny Rollins Describes How 50 Years of Practicing Yoga Made Him a Better Musician |publisher=Open Culture |date=2015-10-08 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"When [John Coltrane] created A Love Supreme. He had meditated that week. I almost didn't see him downstairs. And it was so quiet! There was no sound, no practice! He was up there meditating, and when he came down he said, "I have a whole new music!" He said, "There is a new recording that I will do, I have it all, everything." And it was so beautiful! He was like Moses coming down from the mountain. And when he recorded it, he knew everything, everything. He said this was the first time that he had all the music in his head at once to record." - Alice Coltrane''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azquotes.com/quote/722489 |title=Alice Coltrane quote: It was so interesting, when [John Coltrane&amp;#93; created A Love |publisher=Azquotes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Contemporary practice===
Several academic institutions offer courses and degree programs linking contemplative practice with jazz, including the [[Berklee School of Music]] and the [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/livewell/yoga-and-meditation |title=Yoga, Meditation and Kirtan &amp;#124; Berklee College of Music |publisher=Berklee.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/departments/jazz_improv/bfa_jazz_contemplative.htm |title=U-M School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance - Department of Jazz &amp; Contemporary Improvisation - Degree Programs |publisher=Music.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Verve Records' compilation album ''Jazz for Meditation'' was released in the UK in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alice Coltrane |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Meditation-Club-Various-Artists/dp/B000LXGS0W |title=Various Artists - Jazz for Meditation (Jazz Club) - Amazon.com Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jazz meditation as a live music program originated at the Shinnyo Center for Meditation and Well-being in New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogacitynyc.com/#!Live-Jazz-As-An-Anchor-For-Meditation/c1m6q/55101faa0cf21e26baa3971e|title=YogaCity NYC|work=YogaCity NYC|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Mass Bliss Arts and Awareness Festival in the Berkshires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/travel/spiritual-healing-and-arts-festival-in-the-berkshires.html|title=Spiritual Healing and Arts Festival in the Berkshires|date=21 June 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2015, the Festival Jazz à Saint-Germain-des-Prés Paris has been proposing "Jazz &amp; Meditation" sessions with a therapist specialized in MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction), Elisabeth Petit-Lizop, and the Festival artistic director Frédéric Charbaut.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazz &amp; Meditation|url=http://festivaljazzsaintgermainparis.com/event/jazz-meditation/|website=festivaljazzsaintgermainparis.com|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johannine literature''' refers to the collection of [[New Testament]] works that are traditionally attributed to [[John the Apostle]] or to [[Johannine Christianity|Johannine Christian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bruce|Cain|Davis|Faherty|2012|loc=The Johannine Letters: I, II, and III John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannine literature is traditionally considered to include the following works:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moloney|Harrington|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Gospel of John]]
*The [[Johannine epistles]]
**The [[First Epistle of John]]
**The [[Second Epistle of John]]
**The [[Third Epistle of John]]
*The [[Book of Revelation]]

Of these five books, the only one that explicitly identifies its author as a "John" is Revelation. Modern scholarship generally rejects the idea that this work is written by the same author as the other four documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bruce|Cain|Davis|Faherty|2012|loc=The Johannine Letters: I, II, and III John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel identifies its author as the [[Beloved Disciple]], who is traditionally identified with [[John the Apostle]],&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' Book iii. Chapter xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; though again the authorship is debated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">'''John Grote''' (5 May 1813, [[Beckenham]] &amp;ndash; 21 August 1866, [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire]]) was an [[English people|English]] moral philosopher and [[Anglican]] clergyman.

==Life and career==
The son of a banker, John Grote was younger brother to the historian, philosopher and reformer [[George Grote]]. He was educated at Beckenham School, Kent. He then went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], in 1831, graduating with a first-class degree in the Classics Tripos in 1835, and became a fellow of Trinity in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GRT831J|name=Grote, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1847 until his death, he was vicar of [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire|Trumpington]], where he was a neighbour of his close friend [[Robert Leslie Ellis]], the paralysed mathematician and Bacon scholar. In 1855, Grote succeeded [[William Whewell]] as [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy|Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy]] at Cambridge University.

Grote published relatively little during his life: volume I of ''Exploratio Philosophica: Rough Notes on Modern Intellectual Science'' appeared in 1865, but ''An Examination of the Utilitarian Philosophy'' was only published posthumously (1870). Grote's literary executor and editor, Joseph Bickersteth Mayor, also put together a ''Treatise on Moral Ideals'' (1876) and volume II of ''Exploratio Philosophica'' (1900).

A philosophical idealist and opponent of utilitarianism (as befitted his Cambridge and Anglican clerical identity), Grote was nevertheless happy to admit the new experimental psychology of someone like [[John Stuart Mill]]'s disciple [[Alexander Bain]] – as long as such 'phenomenal' and more properly 'philosophical' investigations were not conflated with each other. Grote had the (perhaps unenviable) distinction of coining the word '[[relativism]]', though he did not use it in quite the same sense as it is used today.

Grote was frequently acknowledged as a major influence by [[Michael Oakeshott]], and had an important influence on a diverse group of philosophers and scholarship emerging from Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/a-trailblazer-rescued-from-a-footnote/209567.article#&lt;/ref&gt;

{{New Thought beliefs}}

In the [[New Thought]] philosophy, the '''Law of Attraction''' is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, "Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour", ''Journal of Australian Studies'': 101&lt;/ref&gt; The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from pure energy, and that through the process of like energy attracting like energy a person can improve their own health, wealth, and personal relationships.

The [https://realpsychicnow.biz/ways-to-attract-abundance-and-prosperity-in-your-life/ Law of Attraction] is among the most popular of the Universal Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellison|first1=A|title=Metaphysics and Universal Laws|url=http://mysticculture.com/metaphysics-and-universal-laws/|website=Mystic Culture|publisher=Mystic Culture|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of this mind-power paradigm generally combine [[Cognitive reframing|cognitive reframing techniques]] with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive ("negative") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive ("positive") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also "feel" (through creative visualization) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/|title=What Is The Law Of Attraction|last1=Hurst|first1=Katherine|date=|website=The Law Of Attraction|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[New Thought]] movement (Law of Attraction Origins) grew out of the teachings of [[Phineas Quimby]] in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, medicinal treatment wasn't working, so he began carriage riding through his hometown, Lebanon, New Hampshire. He then regained his health and recovered, an event that prompted his study of "mind over body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=n|title=Phineas Parkhurst Quimby|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he never used the words 'Law of Attraction', he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: {{quote|the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness. This I do partly mentally and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impressions and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quimby Manuscripts|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/quimbyPhineas/manuscripts/pages/quimby-manuscripts-194.htm|publisher=New Thought library|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In 1877, the term 'Law of Attraction' appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]], in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu1-10.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press, page 340|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Her book ''Isis Unveiled'' discusses esoteric mysteries of ancient theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blavatsky|first1=Helena|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

But the one who really first articulated the Law as general principle was [[Prentice Mulford]]. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in, for example, his essay "The Law of Success",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Forces and How to Use  Them, Vol. 1|url=https://archive.org/stream/yourforcesandho09mulfgoog#page/n66/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1886-1887. In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his ''God’s Image in Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=God's Image in Man, Ch. 6, "The Universality of Law"|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsimageinmans01woodgoog#page/n134/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1892), and [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] (starting with his first book, ''What All the World's A-Seeking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What All the World's A-Seeking|url=https://archive.org/details/whatallworldsas00tringoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1896). For these authors, the Law of Attraction is concerned not only about health but every aspect of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Tune With The Infinite|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trineRalphWaldo/inTune/pages/in-tune-with-the-infinite-026.htm#TopOfText|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE GOD IN YOU|url=http://prenticemulford.wwwhubs.com/tgiy.htm|publisher=Cornerstone Publishing, 2001|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw a surge in interest in the subject with many books being written about it, amongst which are two of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] of all time; [[Think and Grow Rich]] (1937) by [[Napoleon Hill]] and [[You Can Heal Your Life]] (1984) by [[Louise Hay]].

Even if the [[New Age|New Age movement]] adopted many New Thought ideas, including that of the Law of Attraction, the Law of Attraction remains a new thought philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Company Aims to Put Good Karma and Energy Close at Hand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/us/seeking-good-karma-a-company-aims-to-put-it-close-at-hand.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times, 28 March 2014|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the concept of the Law of Attraction gained a lot of renewed exposure with the release of the film ''[[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'' (2006) which was then developed into a book of the same title in 2007. The movie and book gained widespread media coverage.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/spirit/The-Law-of-Attraction-Real-Life-Stories_1 |title=The Law of Attraction: Real-Life Stories - Oprah.com |work=oprah.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Go-Beyond-The-Secret_1 |title=Go Beyond 'The Secret' - Oprah.com |work=oprah.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhonda Byrne]]'s book also has influenced the creation of an untitled fiction film based on The Secret, starring Katie Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/the-secret-movie/|title=The Secret Movie (2018) Based on The Secret by Rhonda Byrne|date=2017-09-08|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a sequel, [[The Power (self-help book)|The Power]] in 2010 that talks about the law of attraction being the law of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/power-author-rhonda-byrnes-book/story?id=11421349|title=The Secret Is Out: Megahit Writer Says Power of Love Will Fill Your Bank Account|last=NANCE-NASH|first=SHERYL|date=August 18, 2010|work=ABC News|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
New Thought authors believe that the Law of Attraction is always in operation and that it brings to each person the conditions and experiences that they predominantly think about, or which they desire or expect.

[[Charles F. Haanel|Charles Haanel]] wrote in ''[[The Master Key System]]'' (1912):
{{quote|The law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the conditions, environment, and experiences in life, corresponding with your habitual, characteristic, predominant mental attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master Key System. Chapter 8, part 18.|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Ralph Trine wrote in ''In Tune With The Infinite'' (1897):
{{quote|The law of attraction works universally on every plane of action, and we attract whatever we desire or expect. If we desire one thing and expect another, we become like houses divided against themselves, which are quickly brought to desolation. Determine resolutely to expect only what you desire, then you will attract only what you wish for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Tune With The Infinite, by Ralph Trine|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trineRalphWaldo/inTune/pages/in-tune-with-the-infinite-035.htm#TopOfText|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Rhonda Byrne published in 2006 the film [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]] wherein she emphasized thinking about what each person wants to obtain, but also to infuse the thought with the maximum possible amount of emotion. She claims the combination of thought and feeling is what attracts the desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tameyourmind.org/articles/how-can-it-possibly-be-law-attraction-works|title=How can it possibly be that the law of attraction works?|last=Henry|first=Juliette|date=|website=www.tameyourmind.org|publisher=Transformation guide|access-date=3 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secret says your subconscious mind can control everything that happens around you, including both positive experiences, like having someone call you from miles away, and negative experiences, like death. The Byrne underlines the power of the subconscious mind by asking the reader to take full control of these thoughts, in order to achieve things in life, with the mind, as much as with action. Another similar book is [[James Redfield]]'s ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'', which says reality can be manifested by man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redfield|first1=James|title=The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure|date=1993|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man and the universe have a force of attraction between them similar to a magnetic attraction. ''The Power of Your Subconscious Mind'' by Joseph Murphy, says readers can achieve seemingly impossible goals by learning how to bring the mind itself under control. ''The Power'' by Rhonda Byrne, ''The Alchemist'' by Paulo Coelho, and ''The Power of Now'' by Eckhart Tolle are similar. While personal testimonies claim the secret and the law to have worked for them, a number of skeptics have criticized Rhonda Byrne's film and book. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' called the secret pseudoscience and an "illusion of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chabris|first1=Christopher F.|last2=Simons|first2=Daniel J.|title=The Pseudoscience of ‘The Secret’ and ‘The Power’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Chabris-t.html|accessdate=2017-08-13|work=The New York Times|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious basis==
The New Thought concept of the Law of Attraction is rooted in ideas that come from various philosophical and religious traditions.  In particular, it has been inspired by [[Hermeticism]], [[New England transcendentalism]], specific verses from the [[Bible]], and [[Hinduism]],

Hermeticism influenced the development of European thought in the [[Renaissance]]. Its ideas were transmitted partly through [[alchemy]]. In the 18th century, [[Franz Mesmer]] studied the works of alchemists such as [[Paracelsus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Aoust|first1=Maja|title=The Secret Source|date=2012|publisher=Process|isbn=978-1-934170-32-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]].&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; Van Helmont was a 17th-century [[Flemish people|Flemish]] physician who proclaimed the curative powers of the imagination.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedesan|first1=Georgiana D.|title=Paracelsian Medicine and Theory of Generation in ‘Exterior homo’, a Manuscript Probably Authored by Jan Baptist Van Helmont (1579–1644), ref 52|journal=Medical History|date=July 2014|volume=58|issue=03|pmc=4103403|pmid=25045180|doi=10.1017/mdh.2014.29|pages=375–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedesan|first1=Delia Georgiana|title=‘Christian Philosophy’: Medical Alchemy and Christian Thought in the Work of Jan Baptista Van Helmont (1579-1644)|date=2012|page= 31|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/4083/HedesanD.pdf?sequence=4|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead Mesmer to develop his ideas about [[Animal magnetism]] which [[Phineas Quimby]], the founder of New Thought, studied.&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braden|first1=Charles S.|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE NEW THOUGHT MOVEMENT.(1963)|url=http://www.surrenderworks.com/library/downloads/braden.pdf|publisher=surrenderworks.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHINEAS PARKHURST QUIMBY 1802 - 1866 Father of New Thought|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|publisher=phineasquimby|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcendentalist movement developed in the United States immediately before the emergence of New Thought and is thought to have had a great influence on it. [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], an important figure in that movement, stated that its leading idea was "the supremacy of mind over matter".&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikics|first1=David|title=The Annotated Emerson|date=2012|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=978-0674049239|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nI3uBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22george+ripley%22+%22the+supremacy+of+mind+over+matter%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F4dN_3p4mO&amp;sig=kr_BiWEHcVDvCHTbSaxHUW6apJI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMInfvbtLacyQIVim8UCh0YTg1T#v=onepage&amp;q=%22george%20ripley%22%20%22the%20supremacy%20of%20mind%20over%20matter%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Thought authors often quote certain verses from the Bible in the context of the Law of Attraction. An example is [[Mark 11]]:24: "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark 11:24|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+11%3A24&amp;version=RSV|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master Key System, by Charles Haanel (1912).

In the late 19th century [[Swami Vivekananda]] traveled to the United States and gave lectures on [[Hinduism]]. These talks greatly influenced the New Thought movement and in particular, [[William Walker Atkinson]] who was one of New Thought's pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Aoust|first1=Maja|title=The Secret Source|date=2012|publisher=Process|isbn=978-1-934170-32-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=John|title=Shakti and Shâkta, Chapter 24, 12th paragraph|date=1918|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co|isbn=978-1595479204|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/sas/sas24.htm|

==Criticism==
''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine criticized the lack of [[falsifiability]] and [[testability]] of these claims.&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mary Carmichael |author2=Ben Radford |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/secrets_and_lies/ |title=CSI &amp;#124; Secrets and Lies |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually [[anecdotal]] and that, because of the [[publication bias|self-selecting nature of the positive reports]], as well as the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to [[confirmation bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name="Kaptchuck"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk, T., &amp; Eisenberg, D. |year=1998 |title=The Persuasive Appeal of Alternative Medicine |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=129 |issue=12 |pmid=9867762 |pages=1061–5 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-129-12-199812150-00011|last2=Eisenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Ali Alousi]], for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;

The Law of Attraction has been popularized in the early 21st century by books and films such as ''[[The Secret (book)|The Secret]]''. This 2006 film and the subsequent book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret |year=2006 |first=Rhonda |last=Byrne |publisher=Beyond Words Publishing |isbn=978-1-58270-170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; use interviews with New Thought authors and speakers to explain the principles of the proposed metaphysical law that one can attract anything that one thinks about consistently. Writing for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, [[Mary Carmichael]] and [[Ben Radford]] wrote that "neither the film nor the book has any basis in scientific reality", and that its premise contains "an ugly flipside: if you have an accident or disease, it's your fault".&lt;ref name="csicop.org"/&gt;

Others have questioned the references to modern scientific theory, and have maintained, for example, that the Law of Attraction misrepresents the electrical activity of [[Neural oscillation|brainwaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Scientific American |date=June 2007 |volume=296 |issue=6 |pages=39–39 |title=The (Other) Secret |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-other-secret |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0607-39|last1=Shermer |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Stenger]] and [[Leon Lederman]] are critical of attempts to use [[quantum mysticism]] to bridge any unexplained or seemingly implausible effects, believing these to be traits of modern [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=Cosmic Mind |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |publisher=University of Colorado |authorlink=Victor_Stenger |pages=8–19 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon Lederman 1993 189–198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

==Prominent supporters==

* In 1891 Californian author and humorist [[Prentice Mulford]] used the term Law of Attraction in his essays ''Some Laws of Health and Beauty'' and ''Good And Ill Effects of Thought''.
* In 1897 [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] wrote ''In Tune with the Infinite''. In the second paragraph of chapter 9 he writes, "The Law of Attraction works unceasingly throughout the universe, and the one great and never changing fact in connection with it is, as we have found, that like attracts like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trine|first1=Ralph|title=In Tune With The Infinite|publisher=G Bell and Sons, LTD.  Published 1911|location=London|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Troward]], a strong influence in the New Thought Movement, gave a 1904 lecture in which he claimed that thought precedes physical form and "the action of Mind plants that nucleus which, if allowed to grow undisturbed, will eventually attract to itself all the conditions necessary for its manifestation in outward visible form."&lt;ref&gt;Judge Thomas Troward, ''The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science'', 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1902 English New Thought writer [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] (best known for writing ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'') wrote a series of books and articles between 1901 and 1912, after which his wife [[Lily L. Allen|Lily]] continued his work.
* [[Emmet Fox]] wrote about metaphysics and the power of prayer in essays and books. His teachings are founded in Christianity and bible stories. He cites Jesus Christ as being the greatest teacher of metaphysics who ever lived and explains that thoughts are our most important emanation, more important than what we say or what we do. In the books ''Power Through Constructive Thinking'' and ''Find and Use your Inner Power'' Fox speaks about "building the mental equivalent of what you want and to expunge those that you don't".
* In his New Thought Movement book [[William Walker Atkinson]] used the phrase ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World'' (1906), stating that "like attracts like".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gitacademy.tripod.com/GodsInTraining/ThoughtVibration.htm William Walker Atkinson. ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction''. Advanced Thought Publishing. 1906.] Out of Copyright version&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bruce MacLelland]]'s ''Prosperity Through Thought Force'' (1907), a [[prosperity theology]] book, summarizes the principle as "You are what you think, not what you think you are." It was published by [[Elizabeth Towne]], the editor of ''[[The Nautilus (magazine)|The Nautilus Magazine, a Journal of New Thought]]''.&lt;ref name="maclelland"&gt;MacLelland, Bruce, ''Prosperity Through Thought Force,'' Elizabeth Towne, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 1910 ''The Science of Getting Rich'' [[Wallace D. Wattles]] espoused similar principles — that simply believing in the object of your desire and focusing on it will lead to that object or goal being realized on the material plane (Wattles claims in the Preface and later chapters of this book that his premise stems from the [[monistic]] [[Hindu]] view that God provides everything and can deliver what we focus on). The book also claims negative thinking will manifest negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich |title=The Science of Getting Rich - Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] author [[William Quan Judge]] used the phrase in ''The Ocean of Theosophy'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Judge | first = William Quan |title = The Ocean of Theosophy |publisher =United Lodge of Theosophists |year= 1915 | page = 103|isbn= 0-7661-0544-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another theosophical author [[Annie Besant]] discussed the 'Law of Attraction' in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPULAR LECTURES ON THEOSOPHY|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Popular_Lectures_On_Theosophy-AB.htm|publisher=anandgholap|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besant compared her version of it to [[gravitation]], and said that the law represented a form of [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karma|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Karma-AB.htm|publisher= Theosophical Publishing House|accessdate=16 May 2012|author=Annie Besant|year=1895|edition= First}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Napoleon Hill]] published two books on the theme. The first, ''[[The Law of Success|The Law of Success in 16 Lessons]]'' (1928), directly and repeatedly references the Law of Attraction and proposes that it operates by use of radio waves transmitted by the brain. The second, ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), went on to sell 100 million copies by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Think and Grow Rich |url=http://www.naphill.org/shop/books/think-and-grow-rich/ |date=2015 |publisher=Napoleon Hill Foundation |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill insisted on the importance of controlling one's own thoughts in order to achieve success, as well as the energy that thoughts have and their ability to attract other thoughts. He mentions a "secret" to success and promises to indirectly describe it at least once in every chapter. It is never named and he says that discovering it on one's own is far more beneficial. Many people have argued over what it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why The Law of Attraction has been a Secret|url=http://www.law-of-attraction.com/131/law-of-attraction-has-been-a-secret/|publisher=Positive Inspiration|access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; actually is, some claim it's the Law of Attraction. Hill states the "secret" is mentioned no fewer than a hundred times, yet reference to "attract" is used less than 30 times in the text. He further claims that people can obtain what they desire through thought of definite purpose.{{sfn|Hill|2010|pp=23-24}}
* [[Israel Regardie]] published books with the Law of Attraction theme as one of his prevailing Universal Laws. In, ''The Art of True Healing: A Treatise on the Mechanism of Prayer and the Operation of the Law of Attraction in Nature'' (1937), he taught a focused meditation technique to help the mind to learn to heal itself on a physical and spiritual level. Regardie claimed that the Law of Attraction was a valid method for attracting good physical health and for improvement in any aspect of one's life.&lt;ref name="Regardie 1974 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Regardie | first=I. | title=The Art of True Healing: A Treatise on the Mechanism of Prayer and the Operation of the Law of Attraction in Nature | year=1974 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QumgEACAAJ | access-date=3 August 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1960 [[W. Clement Stone]] and Napoleon Hill co-wrote ''Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude''.&lt;ref name="Hill Stone 1991 p.

* In his 1988 ''The American Myth of Success'' Richard Weiss states that the principle of "non-resistance" is a popular concept of the New Thought movement and is taught in conjunction with the Law of Attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Myth of Success|publisher=Illini Books|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The views on the right show Charle's lovelock]]
[[File:Sir Thomas Meautys white background.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Thomas Meautys]] (1592–1649) with a long lovelock.]]
A '''Lovelock''' was popular amongst European "men of fashion" from the end of the 16th century until well into the 17th century. The lovelock was a long [[lock of hair]], often plaited ([[braid]]ed) and made to rest over the left shoulder (the heart side) to show devotion to a loved one.{{sfn|Hall|2008|p=278}}

Robin Bryer, author of ''The History of Hair: Fashion and Fantasy Down the Ages'' (2003), speculates that the lovelock may have originated as an alternative to the [[Courtly love|love token]] worn by knights during the medieval period.{{sfn|Dobranski|2015|p=154}}

[[James I of England]] wore a lovelock, and at the court of his son, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] many courtiers (including women) wore them in the French fashion (where they were called ''denette''). Charles I can be seen wearing one in the ''[[Triple portrait of Charles I|Triple portrait]]'' by [[Antony Van Dyck]].{{sfn|Dobranski|2015|p=154}}

[[William Prynne]], a puritan pamphleteer, wrote ''Health's Sickness. The Unloveliness of Lovelocks'' (1628), in which he states that for men to wear their hair long was "unseemly and unlawful unto Christians", while it was "mannish, unnatural, impudent, and unchristian" for women to cut it short. He related the story of a nobleman who was dangerously ill, and who, on his recovery, "declared publicly his detestation of his effeminate, fantastic lovelock, which he then sensibly perceived to be but a cord of vanity, by which he had given the Devil holdfast to lead him at his pleasure, and who would never resign his prey as long as he nourished this unlovely bush", and so he ordered the barber to cut it off. [[Thomas Hall (minister)|Thomas Hall]] wrote a pamphlet ''The Loathsomnesse of Long Haire. ...'' (1654) in which he also attacked the fashion. These different views on fashion are in part reflected in  the uncomplimentary nicknames the two sides gave each other during the [[English Civil War]]: the Royalists called their enemies [[Roundhead]]s while the Parliamentarians called the Royalists [[Cavalier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planché|1876|p=278}}; {{harvnb|Firth|1896|p=436}}; {{harvnb|Gordon|1890|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lê Quýnh''' ({{lang-vi-hantu|黎[[File:⿰亻冏.svg|16px]]}}, 1750&amp;ndash;1805) was a [[Vietnam]]ese mandarin during [[Revival Lê dynasty]]. 

In 1787, a [[Tây Sơn dynasty|Tây Sơn]] general, [[Vũ Văn Nhậm]], marched north to attack the capital [[Thăng Long]] (now [[Hanoi]]). After the fall of Thăng Long, [[Lê Chiêu Thống]], the emperor of Lê dynasty, fled to Bảo Lộc mountain, and sent Quýnh to seek aid from the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of [[Qing China]].&lt;ref name=dainam&gt;''[[Đại Nam thực lục|Đại Nam chính biên liệt truyện]]'', [[:s:zh:大南正編列傳初集/卷三十|vol. 30]]&lt;/ref&gt; Qing army invaded Vietnam to reinstall the deposed emperor, but was defeated by [[Nguyễn Huệ]], the emperor of Tây Sơn dynasty.

After this war, Nguyễn Huệ was recognized as the new ruler of Vietnam by Qianlong Emperor, and Lê Chiêu Thống did not manage to receive aid from Qing China any more. [[Fuk'anggan]], the [[Viceroy of Liangguang]], forced Lê Chiêu Thống and his followers to [[Queue (hairstyle)|cut off their hair]] and change to [[Changshan|Manchurian attire]]. Only Quýnh refused to do, and said: "Our heads can be cut off, but hairs cannot; skins can be flayed, but attires cannot be changed."&lt;ref name=vietnam11&gt;''[[Việt Nam sử lược]]'', [[:s:vi:Việt Nam sử lược/Quyển II/Tự chủ thời đại/Chương XI|Quyển 2, Chương 11]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned in [[Guangxi]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hoàng Lê nhất thống chí]]'', [[:s:zh:皇黎一統志/第十五回|chapter 15]]: "我輩頭可斷髮不可雉皮可削服不可易也"&lt;/ref&gt; He was not allowed to return to Vietnam until 1804.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2461">The term '''Lübke English''' (or, in German, '''''Lübke-Englisch''''') refers to [[nonsense|nonsensical]] [[English language|English]] created by literal word-by-word [[translation]] of [[German language|German]] phrases, disregarding differences between the languages in syntax and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Learnen von Lübke | author = Hellmuth Karasek | publisher = Hamburger Abendblatt | date = 2006-01-16 | accessdate = 2008-07-29 | url = http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2006/01/16/523630.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lübke English'' is named after [[Heinrich Lübke]], a [[president of Germany]] in the 1960s, whose limited English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What shalls | author = Christoph Winder | url = http://derstandard.at/druck/?id=2592842 | date = 2006-09-26 | accessdate = 2008-07-29 | publisher = derStandard.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; made him a target of German humorists. 

In 2006, the German magazine ''[[konkret]]'' unveiled that most of the statements ascribed to Lübke were in fact invented by the editorship of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', mainly by staff writer Ernst Goyke and subsequent [[Letter to the editor|letters to the editor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[konkret]]'' 3/2006, S. 74: „In Wahrheit ist das angebliche Lübke-Zitat ‚Equal goes it loose‘ […] eine Erfindung des Bonner Spiegel-Korrespondenten Ernst Goyke, genannt Ego […] Auch alle anderen Beiträge zum »Lübke-Englisch« haben in der Woche nach Egos Story Redakteure des Spiegel unter falschen Absendern für die Leserbrief-Seiten des Magazins verfasst.“&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, comedian [[Otto Waalkes]] had a routine called "'''English for Runaways'''", which is a nonsensical literal translation of ''Englisch für Fortgeschrittene'' (actually an idiom for 'English for advanced speakers' in German – note that ''fortschreiten'' divides into ''fort'', meaning "away" or "forward", and ''schreiten'', meaning "to walk in steps"). In this mock "course", he translates every sentence back or forth between English and German at least once (usually from German literally into English). Though there are also other, more complex language puns, the title of this routine has gradually replaced the term ''Lübke English'' when a German speaker wants to point out naive literal translations.

'''Mark C. Taylor''' (born 13 December 1945) is a [[Philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] and cultural critic who has published more than twenty books on theology, philosophy, art and architecture, media, technology, economics, and the natural sciences.  After graduating from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1968, he received his doctorate in the study of religion from [[Harvard University]] and began teaching at [[Williams College]] in 1973. In 2007, Taylor moved from Williams College to [[Columbia University]], where he chaired the Department of Religion until 2015.

==Work==
Taylor's first book, ''Kierkegaard’s Pseudonymous Authorship: A Study of Time and the Self'' was published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 1975. This was followed in 1980 by the work for which Taylor received his Doctorgrad, ''Journeys to Selfhood: Hegel and Kierkegaard'' ([[University of California Press]]; reissued by [[Fordham University Press]] in 2000).  Taylor's early study of Kierkegaard and Hegel forms the foundation for all his subsequent work.

In the early 1980s, Taylor began exploring the texts of [[Jacques Derrida]] and his most important followers.  ''Erring: A Postmodern A/Theology'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], 1984) was one of the earliest attempts to study religion from the standpoint of [[poststructuralist]] philosophy and was followed by two closely related works, the sourcebook ''Deconstruction in Context: Literature and Philosophy'' (Chicago,1986) and ''Altarity'' (Chicago, 1987).  In 1989, Taylor founded the [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Complete/Series/RP.html Religion and Postmodernism] series at the University of Chicago Press as a forum for translations and new scholarship. 
 
During the late 1980s, Taylor was drawn into debates about architecture and the visual arts, and in 1992 published a theological study of religious twentieth-century visual arts, ''Disfiguring: Art, Architecture and Religion''.  In later essays and books, Taylor considers a broad range of artists: [[Mark Tansey]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Ann Hamilton (artist)|Ann Hamilton]], [[Joseph Beuys]] and others.  His extensive work on architecture includes essays on [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Daniel Liebeskind]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Frank Gehry]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].

While writing on the visual arts, Taylor became interested in media and new information technologies.  In 1992 he and [[Esa Saarinen]], a Finnish philosopher, taught the first global seminar using teleconferencing technology.  Their book, ''Imagologies: Media Philosophy'' ([[Routledge]], 1994) grew out of this seminar.  The book's unusual design in turn inspired the Finnish design company, [[Marimekko]], to develop a product line derived from pages of the book.  Taylor’s subsequent book, ''Hiding'' (Chicago, 1997), extended the use of graphic design to create hypertextual effects within the limits of a conventional bound book.  As a companion to ''Hiding'', Taylor and [[José Marquez]] issued a CD-ROM video game entitled ''The Réal – Las Vegas, Nevada''.

While Taylor was exploring art and new media, he extended his experiments with technology in the classroom.  In 1993, he was awarded the Rector’s Medal by the [[University of Helsinki]] and in 1995 the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] named him the national Professor of the Year for his innovative teaching.  In 1998, Taylor and New York investment banker [[Herbert Allen, Jr.]], founded [[Global Education Network]], whose mission was to provide high-quality, low-cost online education in the liberal arts, humanities, and sciences.

Taylor’s work with technology led to a growing interest in the expanding fields of network theory and scientific studies of complex adaptive systems.  In a series of books--''The Picture in Question: Mark Tansey and the Ends of Representation'' (Chicago, 1999), ''The Moment of Complexity'' (Chicago, 2001), and ''Confidence Games: Money and Markets in a World Without Redemption'' (Chicago, 2004)--Taylor deploys complexity theory to explore a range of social, cultural and economic developments.

Taylor’s interest in the visual arts and graphic design has led to his own artistic experiments.  In ''Grave Matters'' (Reaktion, 2002), Taylor and [[Dietrich Christian Lammerts]] collaborated on a book featuring Lammerts's photographs of the graves of one hundred and fifty modern writers, theologians, philosophers, artists and architects.  In 2003, Taylor expanded this project beyond the format of the book to create an exhibition at the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]], which included not only the photographs but also sculpture and video art.  In 2006, Taylor published ''Mystic Bones'', featuring forty of Taylor's own photographs of deer, cattle and elk bones, accompanied by aphorisms and an essay, "Rubbings of Reality," on the place of deserts in the imagination. More recently, Taylor has been creating a complex work of art entitled "NeXus," which includes land art, and stone, bone, and steel sculptures.  In the summer of 2016 he co-curated an exhibition at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, MA entitled "Sensing Place: Reflections on Stone Hill."  NeXus was part of this exhibition.  His book Recovering Place: Reflections on Stone Hill (Columbia University Press, 2014) was the catalog for this show. 

Taylor's work attempts to give sustained attention to the theological, philosophical, and artistic issues that were framed in Europe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  Taylor's ''After God'', published in the fall of 2007 ([[University of Chicago Press]]), weaves together the many strands of his oeuvre.

Taylor's additional books include: Refiguring the Real: In Conversation with William Gaddis, Richard Powers, Mark Danielewski, and Don Dillo (Columbia University Press, 2013), Refiguring the Spiritual: Beuys, Barney, Turrell, Goldsworthy (Columbia University Press, 2012), Speed Limits: Where Time Went And Why We Have So Little Left (Yale, 2014), Last Works: Lessons in Leaving (Yale, 2018), and Abiding Grace: Time, Modernity, Death (University of Chicago Press, 2018)
On August 31, 2010, Taylor published ''Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities'' (Knopf, {{ISBN|0-307-59329-0}}), in which he identified and analyzed major problems facing higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark C. Taylor |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/01/crisis-college-campus-education-opinions-best-colleges-10-taylor.html |title=Controlling The Crisis On Campus |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael S. Roth |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/19/entertainment/la-ca-mark-taylor-20100919 |title=Book review: 'Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities' by Mark C. Taylor |publisher=LA Times |date=2010-09-19 |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to his own writing, Taylor has been involved in a number of editorial projects. In the late 1970s, he chaired the Research and Publications Committee of the [[American Academy of Religion]], which initiated a series of major publishing programs.  The Religion and Postmodernism book series he founded continues at the University of Chicago Press under the editorship of [[Thomas A. Carlson]].  Taylor has also edited a textbook, ''Critical Terms for the Study of Religion'' (Chicago, 1998), designed for college courses on method in religious studies.

==Criticisms==
Taylor achieved notoriety outside academe in 2009 with an NYT op-ed piece entitled "End the University As We Know It" (Apr. 27), in which he advocated the end of tenure and academic departments. He followed it up quickly with a book in which he expanded on his reform, ''Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities'' (Knopf, 2010). Critics accused Taylor of hypocrisy, writing as a tenured Columbia professor drawing annual salary and benefits estimated at over $200,000, and charged him, after a career spent in elite private colleges, of being out of touch with the work loads and pay packets of faculty at non-elite institutions. Reviewer David Bell wrote of Taylor's book, "Its logic is fragile and its evidence is thin," and called it "unbelievably misguided," mocking Taylor's "enraptured" invocation of interdisciplinarity and conflation of "forms of communication and forms of knowledge."

==Positions==
Taylor began teaching at Williams College in 1973, attained Preston S. Parish Third Century Professor of Humanities in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Back cover of the 1987 paperback edition of ''Erring: A Postmodern A/theology''&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of his departure in 2007 was Cluett Professor of Humanities.  He has also held visiting appointments at Harvard University, [[Smith College]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], and [[University of Sydney]].  After being a visiting professor of religion and architecture at Columbia University, he joined the faculty there full-time in 2007 as chair of the religion department.

==Trivia==
Mark Taylor was a close friend of [[Jacques Derrida]]. When Derrida died on October 8, 2004, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published a highly critical obituary of the philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kandell|first1=Jonathan|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html?ex=1255147200&amp;en=bc84f1b2c5f092c5&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=10 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor felt that the obituary was not an accurate reflection of Derrida, and proceeded to write another obituary, which the ''Times'' published a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Mark C.|title=What Derrida Really Meant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/14/opinion/what-derrida-really-meant.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=14 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism}}
Some Marxists{{Who?|date=December 2017}} posit what they deem to be '''Karl Marx's theory of human nature''', which they accord an important place in his critique of [[capitalism]], his conception of [[communism]], and his '[[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]'. [[Karl Marx|Marx]], however, does not refer to [[human nature]] as such, but to ''Gattungswesen'', which is generally translated as 'species-being' or 'species-essence'. According to a note from the [[young Marx]] in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|Manuscripts of 1844]]'', the term is derived from [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]’s philosophy, in which it refers both to the nature of each human and of humanity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn20]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the sixth ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that the conception of human nature is formed by the totality of [[social relations]]. Thus, the whole of human nature is not understood, as in classical idealist philosophy, as permanent and universal: the ''species-being'' is always determined in a specific social and historical formation, with some aspects being biological.

==The sixth thesis on Feuerbach and the determination of human nature by social relations==
The sixth of the ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'', written in 1845, provided an early discussion by Marx of the concept of human nature. It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [''menschliches Wesen'' = ‘human nature’]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations. Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged'': 
:1. ''To abstract from the historical process and to define the religious sentiment regarded by itself, and to presuppose an abstract — isolated - human individual.''
:2. ''The essence therefore can by him only be regarded as ‘species’, as an inner ‘dumb’ generality which unites many individuals only in a natural way.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Marx appears to say that human nature is no more than what is made by the 'social relations'. [[Norman Geras]]'s ''[[Marx and Human Nature]]'' (1983), however, offers an argument against this position.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; In outline, Geras shows that, while the social relations are held to 'determine' the nature of people, they are not the only such determinant. However, Marx makes statements where he specifically refers to a human nature which is more than what is conditioned by the circumstances of one's life. In ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', in a footnote [[Utilitarianism#Karl Marx's criticisms|critiquing utilitarianism]], he says that utilitarians must reckon with 'human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm#n50]&lt;/ref&gt; Marx is arguing against an abstract conception of human nature, offering instead an account rooted in sensuous life. While he is quite explicit that '[a]s individuals express their life, so they are. Hence what individuals are depends on the material conditions of their production',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; he also believes that human nature will condition (against the background of the productive forces and relations of production) the way in which individuals express their life.  History involves 'a continuous transformation of human nature',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; though this does not mean that every aspect of human nature is wholly variable; what is transformed need not be wholly transformed.

Marx did criticise the tendency to 'transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm], a process sometimes called "[[reification (Marxism)|reification]]".&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he would likely have wanted to criticise certain ''aspects'' of some accounts of human nature.  Some people believe, for example, that humans are naturally selfish - [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~allenw/webpapers/KantProblem.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/3x.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (Both Hobbes and Kant thought that it was necessary to constrain our human nature in order to achieve a good society - Kant thought we should use rationality, Hobbes thought we should use the force of the state - Marx, as we shall see, thought that the good society was one which allows our human nature its full expression.)  Most Marxists will argue that this view is an ideological illusion and the effect of [[commodity fetishism]]: the fact that people act selfishly is held to be a product of scarcity and capitalism, not an immutable human characteristic. For confirmation of this view, we can see how, in ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' Marx argues that capitalists are not motivated by any essential viciousness, but by the drive toward the bare 'semblance of a human existence'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch04.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; (Marx says 'semblance' because he believes that capitalists are as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from their human nature under capitalism as the proletariat, even though their basic needs are better met.)

==Needs and drives==
In the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|1844 Manuscripts]]'' the [[young Marx]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Man is directly a natural being. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand endowed with natural powers, vital powers – he is an active natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities – as instincts. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous objective being he is a suffering, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the objects of his instincts exist outside him, as objects independent of him; yet these objects are objects that he needs – essential objects, indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/hegel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' Marx says his nature is a 'totality of needs and drives'.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch05.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The German Ideology'' he uses the formulation: 'their ''needs'', consequently their nature'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch03o.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; We can see then, that from Marx's early writing to his later work, he conceives of human nature as composed of 'tendencies', 'drives', 'essential powers', and 'instincts' to act in order to satisfy 'needs' for external objectives.  For Marx then, an explanation of human nature is an explanation of the needs of humans, together with the assertion that they will act to fulfill those needs. (c.f. ''The German Ideology'', chapter 3).&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch03abs.htm#p305-7].&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Geras gives a schedule of some of the needs which Marx says are characteristic of humans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...for other human beings, for sexual relations, for food, water, clothing, shelter, rest and, more generally, for circumstances that are conducive to health rather than disease.  There is another one ... the need of people for a breadth and diversity of pursuit and hence of personal development, as Marx himself expresses these, 'all-round activity', 'all-round development of individuals', 'free development of individuals', 'the means of cultivating [one's] gifts in all directions', and so on.''&lt;ref&gt;Norman Geras, quoting Marx in his ''Marx and Human Nature'' (1983, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marx says 'It is true that eating, drinking, and procreating, etc., are ... genuine human functions. However, when abstracted from other aspects of human activity, and turned into final and exclusive ends, they are animal.'&lt;ref&gt;First chapter of the ''1844 Manuscripts''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productive activity, the objects of humans and actualisation==

===Humans as free, purposive producers===
In several passages throughout his work, Marx shows how he believes humans to be essentially different from other animals. 'Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage from ''The German Ideology'', Marx alludes to one difference: that humans produce their physical environments. But do not a few other animals also produce aspects of their environment as well? The previous year, Marx had already acknowledged:

:It is true that animals also produce. They build nests and dwellings, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they produce only their own immediate needs or those of their young; they produce only when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need; they produce only themselves, while man reproduces the whole of nature; their products belong immediately to their physical bodies, while man freely confronts his own product. Animals produce only according to the standards and needs of the species to which they belong, while man is capable of producing according to the standards of every species and of applying to each object its inherent standard; hence, man also produces in accordance with the laws of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same work, Marx writes:

:The animal is immediately one with its life activity. It is not distinct from that activity; it is that activity. Man makes his life activity itself an object of his will and consciousness. He has conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life activity directly distinguishes man from animal life activity. Only because of that is he a species-being. Or, rather, he is a conscious being – i.e., his own life is an object for him, only because he is a species-being. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being, makes his life activity, his essential being, a mere means for his existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the segment on Estranged Labour:

:Man is a species-being, not only because he practically and theoretically makes the species – both his own and those of other things – his object, but also – and this is simply another way of saying the same thing – because he looks upon himself as the present, living species, because he looks upon himself as a universal and therefore free being.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than twenty years later, in ''Capital'', he came to muse on a similar subject:

:A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his ''modus operandi'', and to which he must subordinate his will. And this subordination is no mere momentary act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

From these passages we can observe something of Marx's beliefs about humans. That they characteristically produce their environments, and that they would do so, even were they not under the burden of 'physical need' - indeed, they will produce the 'whole of [their] nature', and may even create 'in accordance with the laws of beauty'. Perhaps most importantly, though, their creativity, their production is ''purposive'' and ''planned''. Humans, then, make plans for their future activity, and attempt to exercise their production (even lives) according to them. Perhaps most importantly, and most cryptically, Marx says that humans make both their 'life activity' and 'species' the 'object' of their will.  They relate to their life activity, and are not simply identical with it. [[Michel Foucault]]'s definition of [[biopower|biopolitics]] as the moment when "man begins to take itself as a conscious object of elaboration" may be compared to Marx's definition hereby exposed.

===Life and the species as the objects of humans===
To say that A is the object of some subject B, means that B (specified as an agent) acts upon A in some respect. Thus if 'the proletariat smashes the state' then 'the state' is the object of the proletariat (the subject), in respect of smashing. It is similar to saying that A is the ''objective'' of B, though A could be a whole sphere of concern and not a closely defined aim.  In this context, what does it mean to say that humans make their 'species' and their 'lives' their 'object'? It's worth noting that Marx's use of the word 'object' can imply that these are things which humans produces, or makes, just as they might produce a material object. If this inference is correct, then those things that Marx says about human production above, also apply to the production of human life, by humans. And simultaneously, 'As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

To make one's life one's object is therefore to treat one's life as something that is under one's control. To raise in imagination plans for one's future and present, and to have a stake in being able to fulfill those plans. To be able to live a life of this character is to achieve 'self-activity' (actualisation), which Marx believes will only become possible after communism has replaced capitalism. 'Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations. The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

What is involved in making one's species one's object is more complicated (see Allen Wood 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–21). In one sense, it emphasises the essentially social character of humans, and their need to live in a community of the species. In others, it seems to emphasise that we attempt to make our lives expressions of our species-essence; further that we have goals concerning what becomes of the species in general. The idea covers much of the same territory as 'making one's life one's object': it concerns self-consciousness, purposive activity, and so forth.

===Humans as ''homo faber''?===
It is often said that Marx conceived of humans as ''[[homo faber]]'', referring to [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s definition of 'man as the [[tool]]-making animal' - that is, as 'man, the maker',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130110083614/http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Marx/MARXW3.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt; though he never used the term himself. Above, we indicated that one of Marx's central contentions about humans was that they were differentiated by the manner in which they produce and that thus, somehow, production was one of humans' essential activities. In this context, it is worth noting that Marx does not always address 'labour' or 'work' in such glowing terms. He says that communism 'does away with labour'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, 'If it is desired to strike a mortal blow at private property, one must attack it not only as a material state of affairs, but also as activity, as labour. It is one of the greatest misapprehensions to speak of free, human, social labour, of labour without private property. “Labour” by its very nature is unfree, unhuman, unsocial activity, determined by private property and creating private property.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/03/list.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Under Capitalism '[t]he capitalist functions only as capital personified, capital as a person, just as the worker only functions as the personification of labour, which belongs to him as torment, as exertion'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/ch02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally held that Marx's view was that productive activity is an essential human activity, and can be rewarding when pursued freely. Marx's use of the words 'work' and 'labour' in the section above may be unequivocally negative; but this was not always the case, and is most strongly found in his early writing. However, Marx was always clear that under capitalism, labour was something inhuman, and dehumanising. 'labour is external to the worker – i.e., does not belong to his essential being; that he, therefore, does not confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy, but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; While under communism, 'In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly confirmed and realised my true nature, my human nature, my communal nature'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/james-mill/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature and historical materialism==
[[Marx's theory of history]] attempts to describe the way in which humans change their environments and (in dialectical relation) their environments change them as well. That is:

:Not only do the objective conditions change in the act of reproduction, e.g. the village becomes a town, the wilderness a cleared field etc., but the producers change, too, in that they bring out new qualities in themselves, develop themselves in production, transform themselves, develop new powers and ideas, new modes of intercourse, new needs and new language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch09.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Marx sets out his 'materialist conception of history' in opposition to 'idealist' conceptions of history; that of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], for instance. 'The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'History does nothing, it “possesses no immense wealth”, it “wages no battles”. It is man, real, living man who does all that, who possesses and fights; “history” is not, as it were, a person apart, using man as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of man pursuing his aims'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#history]&lt;/ref&gt; So we can see that, even before we begin to consider the precise character of human nature, 'real, living' humans, 'the activity of man pursuing his aims' is the very building block of Marx's theory of history.  Humans act upon the world, changing it and themselves; and in doing so they 'make history'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; However, even beyond this, human nature plays two key roles. In the first place, it is part of the explanation for the growth of the [[productive forces]], which Marx conceives of as the driving force of history. Secondly, the particular needs and drives of humans explain the class antagonism which is generated under capitalism.

===Human nature and the expansion of the productive forces===
It has been held by several writers that it is Marx's conception of human nature which explains the 'development thesis' (Cohen, 1978) concerning the expansion of the productive forces, which according to Marx, is itself the fundamental driving force of history.  If true, this would make his account of human nature perhaps the most fundamental aspect of his work. Geras writes, (1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;107–108, italics in original) ''historical materialism itself, this whole distinctive approach to society that originates with Marx, rests squarely upon the idea of a human nature''. It highlights that specific nexus of universal needs and capacities which explains the human productive process and man's organized transformation of the material environment; which process and transformation it treats in turn as the basis both of the social order and of historical change.' G.A. Cohen (1988, p.&amp;nbsp;84): 'The tendency's autonomy is just its independence of social structure, its rootedness in fundamental material facts of human nature and the human situation.' Allen Wood (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;75): 'Historical progress consists fundamentally in the growth of people's abilities to shape and control the world about them.  This is the most basic way in which they develop and express their human essence' (see also, the quotation from Allen Wood above).

In his article ''Reconsidering Historical Materialism'', however, Cohen gives an argument to the effect that human nature cannot be the premise on which the plausibility of the expansion of the productive forces is grounded.

:'Production in the historical anthropology is not identical with production in the theory of history.  According to the anthropology, people flourish in the cultivation and exercise of their manifold powers, and are especially productive - which in ''this'' instance means creative - in the condition of freedom conferred by material plenty.  But, in the production of interest to the theory of history, people produce not freely but because they have to, since nature does not otherwise supply their wants; and the development in history of the productive power of ''man'' (that is, of man as such, of man as a species) occurs at the expense of the creative capacity of the ''men'' who are agents and victims of that development.' (p. 166 in ed. Callinicos, 1989)

The implication of this is that hence 'one might ... imagine two kinds of creature, one whose essence it was to create and the other not, undergoing similarly toilsome histories because of similarly adverse circumstances. In one case, but not the other, the toil would be a self-alienating exercise of essential powers' (p.&amp;nbsp;170). Hence, 'historical materialism and Marxist philosophical anthropology are independent of, though also consistent with, each other' (p.&amp;nbsp;174, see especially sections 10 and 11). The problem is this: it seems as though the motivation most people have for the work they do isn't the exercise of their creative capacity; on the contrary, labour is alienated by definition in the capitalist system based on [[salary]], and people only do it because they have to. They go to work not to express their human nature but to find theirs means of subsistence.&lt;!-- see the end of first chapter 1844 Manuscripts: all of labour is alienated, there is no sense in saying "most" --&gt; So in that case, why do the productive forces grow - does human nature have anything to do with it?  The answer to this question is a difficult one, and a closer consideration of the arguments in the literature is necessary for a full answer than can be given in this article. However, it is worth bearing in mind that Cohen had previously been committed to the strict view that human nature (and other 'asocial premises') were ''sufficient'' for the development of the productive forces - it could be that they are only one ''necessary'' constituent. It is also worth considering that by 1988 (see quotation above), he appears to consider that the problem is resolved.

Some needs are far more important than others. In ''The German Ideology'' Marx writes that 'life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things'. All those other aspects of human nature which he discusses (such as 'self-activity') are therefore subordinate to the priority given to these. Marx makes explicit his view that humans develop new needs to replace old: 'the satisfaction of the first need (the action of satisfying, and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature, Marx's ethical thought and alienation==
Geras says of Marx's work that: 'Whatever else it is, theory and socio-historical explanation, and scientific as it may be, that work is a moral indictment resting on the conception of essential human needs, an ethical standpoint, in other words, in which a view of human nature is involved' (1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;83–84).

===Alienation===
:''For the main article on this topic, see [[Marx's theory of alienation]]''
Alienation, for Marx, is the estrangement of humans from aspects of their human nature. Since - as we have seen - human nature consists in a particular set of vital drives and tendencies, whose exercise constitutes flourishing, alienation is a condition wherein these drives and tendencies are stunted.  For essential powers, alienation substitutes disempowerment; for making one's own life one's object, one's life becoming an object of capital.  Marx believes that alienation will be a feature of all society before communism. The opposite of, alienation is 'actualisation' or 'self-activity' - the activity of the self, controlled by and for the self.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Gerald Cohen's criticism ==
One important criticism of Marx's 'philosophical anthropology' (i.e. his conception of humans) is offered by [[Gerald Cohen]], the leader of [[Analytical Marxism]], in ''Reconsidering Historical Materialism'' (in ed. Callinicos, 1989).  Cohen claims: 'Marxist philosophical anthropology is one sided.  Its conception of human nature and human good overlooks the need for self-identity than which nothing is more essentially human.' (p.&amp;nbsp;173, see especially sections 6 and 7).  The consequence of this is held to be that 'Marx and his followers have underestimated the importance of phenomena, such as religion and nationalism, which satisfy the need for self-identity.  (Section 8.)' (p.&amp;nbsp;173).  Cohen describes what he sees as the origins of Marx's alleged neglect: 'In his anti-Hegelian, Feuerbachian affirmation of the radical objectivity of matter, Marx focused on the relationship of the subject to an object which is in no way subject, and, as time went on, he came to neglect the subject's relationship to itself, and that aspect of the subject's relationship to others which is a mediated (that is, indirect), form of relationship to itself' (p.&amp;nbsp;155).

Cohen believes that people are driven, typically, not to create identity, but to preserve that which they have in virtue, for example, of 'nationality, or race, or religion, or some slice or amalgam thereof' (pp.&amp;nbsp;156–159).  Cohen does not claim that 'Marx denied that there is a need for self-definition, but [instead claims that] he failed to give the truth due emphasis' (p.&amp;nbsp;155).  Nor does Cohen say that the sort of self-understanding that can be found through religion etc. is accurate (p.&amp;nbsp;158).  Of nationalism, he says 'identifications [can] take benign, harmless, and catastrophically malignant forms' (p.&amp;nbsp;157) and does not believe 'that the state is a good medium for the embodiment of nationality' (p.&amp;nbsp;164).&lt;!--- ===Unjustified optimism and generalisation===
As scared above, Maxiiii seems to deny that there is anything essentially negative about human nature, though vicious activities can arise from the tendency to selfishly fulfill basic needs.  Theorists of [[evolutionary psychology]] might dispute Marx's contention, though they would not take the diametrically opposed view.  (See, for example, [[Matt Ridley]]'s ''[[The Origins Of Virtue]]''.)  Also, though Marx does stress the importance for each person of development along their own individual lines, he does not recognise (if there really are such to recognise), distinct '[[personality types]]' (see also [[Personality psychology#Personality tests|personality tests]]).  If it were possible to show that some people were essentially leaders, and others followers (for example), it might provide problems for Marx's conception of Communism as a society in which everyone was equal ''and'' able to fully express their human nature.  This might be difficult for his theory, in the same way as would discovery of natural human viciousness.  It should be clearly stated, though, that it has not thus far been possible to show that humans are essentially vicious, or divided pre-socialisation into rigid and immutable types.

===Primary texts===
&lt;small&gt;
The two texts in which Marx most directly discusses human nature are the [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/james-mill/index.htm ''Comments on James Mill''] and the piece on [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm  ''Estranged Labour''] in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932).  Both of these pieces date from 1844, and as such were written by the [[young Marx]]; some analysts ([[Louis Althusser]], etc.) assert that work from this period differs markedly in its ideas from the later work.

===Accounts prior to 1978===
&lt;small&gt;
In certain aspects, the views of many earlier writers on this topic are generally believed to have been superseded.  Nevertheless, here is a selection of the best writing prior to 1978.  Much of it addresses human nature through the strongly related concept of alienation:
* [[Erich Fromm]], ''Marx's Concept of Man. With a Translation of Marx's Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts by T. B. Bottomore'', (1961).
* [[Eugene Kamenka]], ''The Ethical Foundations of Marxism'' (1962).  The entire book can be read online [https://www.marxists.org/archive/kamenka/1962/ethical-foundations/index.htm].
* [[István Mészáros (professor)|István Mészáros]], ''Marx’s Theory of Alienation'' (1970).  Sections can be read online [https://www.marxists.org/archive/meszaros/works/alien/].
* [[Bertell Ollman]], ''Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society'' (1971). Many chapters, including some directly relevant to human nature, can be read online [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/books/a.php].
* [[John Plamenatz]], ''Karl Marx's Philosophy of Man'', (1975).
&lt;/small&gt;

===Recent general accounts===
&lt;small&gt;
* ''Marx and Human Nature: Refutation of a Legend'' by [[Norman Geras]] (1983) is a concise argument against the view that Marx did not believe there was something such as human nature, in particular the confusion surrounding the sixth of the ''Theses on Feuerbach''.
* Part I of ''Karl Marx'' by Allen Wood provides a highly readable survey of the evidence concerning what Marx thought of human nature and his concept of alienation.  See especially chapter 2.  The preface to the second edition (2004) of Wood's book can be read online [http://www.stanford.edu/~allenw/webpapers/Marxpreface.pdf].  The first edition was published in 1983.
* ''Marx and the Missing Link: Human Nature'' by W. Peter Archibald (1989).
* ''Marxism and Human Nature'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=1EGb3bRY2dIC] by Sean Sayers (1998).
* ''The young Karl Marx: German philosophy, Modern politics, and human flourishing'' by David Leopold (2007) See Chapter 4 for close reading of Marx's 1843 texts, relating human nature to human emancipation. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5zDtOu1z9fAC]
&lt;/small&gt;

===The debate over human nature and historical materialism===
&lt;small&gt;
* Pages 150–160 (i.e. chapter 6, section 4) of [[G.A. Cohen]]'s seminal ''Karl Marx's Theory of History'' (''KMTH'') (1978) contain an account of the relation of human nature to historical materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Cohen | first = G.A. | author-link = Gerald Cohen | contribution = The primacy of the productive forces: the case for primacy | editor-last = Cohen | editor-first = G.A. | editor-link = Gerald Cohen | title = [[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence|Karl Marx's theory of history: a defence]] | pages = 150–160 | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2001 | origyear = 1978 | isbn = 9780691070681 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen argues that the former is necessary to explain the development of the productive forces, which Marx holds to drive history.
* This basic view is endorsed by Geras (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Geras | first = Norman | title = [[Marx and Human Nature: Refutation of a Legend|Marx and human nature: refutation of a legend]] | publisher = Verso | location = UK | year = 2016 | origyear = 1983 | isbn = 9781784782351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Woods (1983, 2004).
* The view, however, was criticised by [[Erik Olin Wright]] and Andrew Levine in an article entitled ''Rationality and Class Struggle'', first published in the ''[[New Left Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Erik Olin | last2 = Levine | first2 = Andrew | author-link1 = Erik Olin Wright | title = Rationality and class struggle | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 23 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 1980 | url = https://newleftreview.org/I/123/andrew-levine-erik-olin-wright-rationality-and-class-struggle | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found as chapter 1 of ''Marxist Theory'' (ed. [[Alex Callinicos]], 1989).&lt;ref name=Callinicos&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Callinicos | editor-first = Alex | title = Marxist theory | editor-link = Alex Callinicos | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England New York | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780198272953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was also criticised by Joshua Cohen, in a review of ''KMTH'' in the ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cohen | first = Joshua | author-link = Joshua Cohen (philosopher) | title = Reviewed Work: ''Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence'' by G. A. Cohen | journal = [[The Journal of Philosophy]] | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 253–273 | publisher = The Journal of Philosophy Inc. | doi = 10.2307/2026062 | jstor = 2026062 | date = May 1982 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2026062 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* G.A. Cohen draws out some difficulties with his own presentation in ''KMTH'' in the article ''Reconsidering Historical Materialism''. (First published 1983 in ''Marxism: NOMOS XXVI'', ed. Chapman and Pennock;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Peacock | editor-first1 = J. Roland | editor-last2 = Chapman | editor-first2 = John W. | title = Marxism: NOMOS XXVI | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780814765869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; now available in ''Marxist Theory'' ed. Alex Callinicos, 1989;&lt;ref name=Callinicos /&gt; and in ''[[History, Labour, and Freedom]]'', G.A. Cohen, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohen | first = G A. | author-link = Gerald Cohen | title = [[History, Labour, and Freedom|History, labour, and freedom: themes from Marx]] | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780198247791 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article's contentions (for a five-point summary, see Callinicos pp.&amp;nbsp;173–4) concern the connection of Marx's historical materialism to his 'philosophical anthropology' - basically, his conception of human nature.
* Chapter 5 of G.A. Cohen's ''History, Labour and Freedom'' (1988) is entitled ''Human Nature and Social Change in the Marxist Conception of History'' and is co-authored by Cohen and [[Will Kymlicka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Cohen | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Kymlicka | first2 = Will | author-link1 = Gerald Cohen | author-link2 = Will Kymlicka | contribution = Human nature and social change in the Marxist conception of history | editor-last = Cohen | editor-first = G A. | editor-link = Gerald Cohen | title = [[History, Labour, and Freedom|History, labour, and freedom: themes from Marx]] | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780198247791 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (First published 1988 in the Journal of Philosophy.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Kymlicka | first2 = Will | author-link1 = Gerald Cohen | author-link2 = Will Kymlicka | title = Human nature and social change in the Marxist conception of history | journal = [[The Journal of Philosophy]] | volume = 85 | issue = 4 | pages = 171–191 | publisher = The Journal of Philosophy Inc. | doi = 10.2307/2026743 | jstor = 2026743 | date = April 1988 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2026743 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the chapter is to defend Cohen's contention in his ''KMTH'' that there is an ''autonomous'' tendency of the productive forces to develop, where 'autonomous' means 'independent of particular social relations'.  The text is a response to the criticisms of J. Cohen, Levine and Wright.  That is, G.A. Cohen and Kymlicka seek to show that there are no grounds for an ''a priori'' denial' of the claim that 'extra-social features of human nature and the human situation operate powerfully enough to generate an historical tendency capable of overcoming recaltricant social structures' (p.&amp;nbsp;106).  There may be thought to be a tension between the claims of this article and those of ''Reconsidering Historical Materialism''.

'''Mundamala''' ({{Lang-sa|मुण्डमाला}}, muṇḍamālā), also called '''kapalamala''' or '''rundamala,''' is a garland of severed human heads and/or skulls, in [[Hindu iconography]] and [[Buddhist_symbolism#Vajrayana_Iconography|Tibetan Buddhist iconography]].  In Hinduism, the mundamala is a characteristic of fearsome aspects of the [[Devi|Hindu Divine Mother]] and the god [[Shiva]]; while in Buddhism, it is worn by [[wrathful deities]] of Tibetan Buddhism.

== Hindu iconography ==

=== Fearsome goddesses ===
The mundamala is often found in the iconography of the [[Mahavidyas]], a group of ten fearsome Tantric goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kali]], the foremost Mahavidya, often wears a garland of freshly severed heads. The blood from her bleeding garland bathes her nude body. The number of heads in the mundamala is generally described as fifty.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley pp. 67–8&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Mahavidyas like [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]], [[Chhinnamasta]], [[Bhairavi]], [[Dhumavati]] and [[Matangi]] are depicted or at least described wearing mundamalas; the goddess may also hold a severed head or skull ([[kapala]]) in her hand.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kinsley p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; In description of Bhairavi, the heads are said to be so fresh that they vomit blood over her breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fierce goddess depicted often wearing the mundamala is [[Chamunda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Nepal: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection|last=Art|first=|last2=Pal|first2=Pratapaditya|date=|publisher=LACMA in association with University of California Press|year=1985|isbn=9780520054073|location=|pages=S32|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shiva ===
[[File:Shiva and family picnic beside a burning-ground, stringing severed heads into a garland, 1790 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Shiva and his family stringing severed heads into a garland (mundamala), c. 1810]]
The god [[Shiva]] and his fierce manifestations are often depicted wearing the mundamala; Shiva is covered with ashes and skulls adorn him.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series|last=Daniélou|first=Alain|date=|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|year=1991|isbn=9780892813544|location=|pages=218|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pahari painting]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s often picture Shiva's family making mundamalas. His son [[Kartikeya]] helps him or his mother [[Parvati]] handing over a head, while the latter threads them. Another scene depicts the parents making the mundamala, while Kartikeya and his brother [[Ganesha]] play nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Storm p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iconography of Śiva in Pahāṛī Paintings|last=Panthey|first=Saroj|date=|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=1987|isbn=9788170990161|location=|pages=61|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ferocious manifestation of Shiva, [[Bhairava]] ("The Terrible") as well as Bhairava's various forms like Vatuk-Bhairava are depicted wearing the mundamala.&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 177, 179&lt;/ref&gt; Other fierce forms of Shiva wearing the mundamalas include [[Virabhadra]], [[Gajasurasamhara]] ("Slayer of the Elephant demon") and the eight-armed [[Aghoramurti]].&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 200-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolism ===
The fifty or fifty-two heads or skulls in the mundamala are described to symbolize the letters of the [[Sanskrit]] alphabet in Kali's iconography, thus signifying the wearer Kali as ''sabda [[Brahman]]'', Ultimate Reality recognized as Sound and the primal sound of  the sacred syllable [[Om]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley pp. 88–9&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation links the mundamala symbolizing the heads of foes and demons slain by the wearer goddess in battle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mundamala in the context of Chhinnamasta's iconography is said to signify her victory over Time and fear of Death.&lt;ref&gt;Benard p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shiva's iconography, the mundamala represents the continual creation and destruction cycles of human existence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Buddhist iconography ==
[[File:Tibetan Mahakala.jpg|thumb|Mahakala wearing the mundamala]]
Various [[wrathful deities]], including the [[Dharmapala|dharmapalas]], wear the mundamala, a five-skull crown and human or animal skins.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; Manifestations of [[Akshobhya]] are generally fearsome and are depicted wearing the mundamala as well as skulls and serpents. These include [[Acala]], [[Heruka]], [[Chakrasamvara]] and [[Yamantaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson pp. 219–222, 230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahākāla|Mahakala]], who from adopted from the Hindu Shiva also wears the mundamala.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hevajra]] and his terrific emanations also adore the mundamala.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrathful Buddhist goddesses like [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marichi]], [[Vajravārāhī|Vajravarahi]], Guhyeshvari and [[dakini]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are depicted wearing the mundamala.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson pp. 304, 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntington p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntington p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]], a girl worshipped as a goddess in Nepal, is identified with Vajravarahi by Buddhists. She wears a silver mundamala signifying her identity as Vajravarahi and her ferocious nature.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington p. 417
&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in Hindu iconography, the mundamala symbolizes the Sanskrit alphabet in Buddhist iconography too.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; In Chakrasamvara's iconography, it symbolizes the "abandonment of phenomenal appearances" as well as his union with his consort Vajravarahi (when depicted with him).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington pp. 270, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

# A [[rationalist]] accepts any position that can be justified or established by appeal to the rational criteria or authorities.
# He accepts only those positions that can be so justified.

The first problem that needs to be dealt with is: what is the rational criterion or authority to which they appeal? Here the panrationalists diverge into two groups:
# Intellectualists &amp;ndash;  to whom the rational authority lies in the human intellect, in the faculty of reason.
# [[Empiricist]]s &amp;ndash; to whom the rational authority is achieved by [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] (such as seeing or hearing).

[[Descartes]] is considered the founder of rationalism and gave the illustration ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' as the paradigm to demonstrate what he believed.

The problem of both these appeals is that:
# Intellectualism is "too wide" by letting too much in (basically everything, in a strict sense). 
# Empiricism is "too narrow" in that it excludes too much (basically everything, in a strict sense).

In his ''[[The Critique of Pure Reason]]'' [[Kant]] sought to reconcile both appeals.

The '''politicization of science''' is the manipulation of [[science]] for political gain. It occurs when [[government]], [[business]], or [[advocacy group]]s use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported or interpreted.  The politicization of science may also negatively affect [[academic freedom|academic]] and [[scientific freedom]]. Historically, groups have conducted various campaigns to promote their interests in defiance of [[scientific consensus]], and in an effort to manipulate [[public policy]].&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC-News&amp;id=2445 Evolution or design debate heats up.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=nejm&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging – Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Volume 354:2277–81  May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;    On the other hand, policy makers are required to take timely action regardless of the raging debates and/or apparent credibility of alternative viewpoints.  Politics cannot be completely divorced from policy.

==Overview==
Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science. These can range, for example, from [[Populism|populist]] [[anti-intellectualism]] and perceived threats to religious belief to [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[subjectivism]] and fear for business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Jeanne |title=The Politicization of Scientific Issues: Looking through Galileo's Lens or through the Imaginary Looking Glass |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=34–39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816182350/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/politicization_of_scientific_issues |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicization occurs as scientific information is presented with emphasis on the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence. The emphasis capitalizes on the lack of consensus, which influences the way the studies are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolsen|first1=Toby|last2=Druckman|first2=James N.|title=Counteracting the Politicization of Science|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2015|issue=65|page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] describes how this point is sometimes intentionally ignored as a part an "Orwellian tactic." Organizations and politicians seek to disclaim all discussion on some issues as 'the more probable conclusion is still uncertain' as opposed to 'conclusions are most scientifically likely' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horgan|first1=John|title=The Republican War on Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/political-science.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to further discredit scientific studies.

Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence. "[[Merchants of Doubt]]," ideology-based interest groups that claim expertise on scientific issues, have ran successful "disinformation campaigns" in which they highlight the inherent uncertainty of science to cast doubt on scientific issues such as human-caused climate change, even though the scientific community has reached virtual consensus that humans play a role in climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Linden|first1=Sander|last2=Leiserowitz|first2=Anthony|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Seth|last4=Maibach|first4=Edward|title=Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change|journal=Global Challenges|volume=1|issue=2|page=1|doi=10.1002/gch2.201600008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William R. Freudenburg and colleagues have written about politicization of science as a rhetorical technique and states that it is an attempt to shift the burden of proof in an argument.&lt;ref name="William F 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenberg|first1=William F.|title=Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs): Science and the Politics of Doubt|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=78|pages=2–38|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the example of cigarette lobbyists opposing laws that would discourage smoking. The lobbyists trivialize evidence as uncertain, emphasizing lack of conclusion. Freudenberg concludes that politicians and lobby groups are too often able to make "successful efforts to argue for full 'scientific certainty' before a regulation can be said to be 'justified' and maintain that what is needed is a balanced approach that carefully considers the risks of both Type 1 and Type 2 errors in a situation while noting that scientific conclusions are always tentative.&lt;ref name="William F 2008"/&gt;

President of the American Council on Science and Health Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow have described "feel-good fallacies" used in politics, where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs. They have claimed that progressives have had these kinds of issues with policies involving genetically modified foods, vaccination, overpopulation, use of animals in research, nuclear energy, and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hank Campbell|first=Alex Berezow,|title=Science Left Behind : Feel-good Fallacies and the Rise of the Anti-Scientific Left|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781610391641|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politicization by advocacy groups==

===Global warming===
{{Main|Global warming controversy|Politicization of global warming}}
{{See also|I'm not a scientist}}

Both mainstream climatologists and their critics have accused each other of politicizing the science behind [[climate change]]. There is a [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased]] in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Oreskes| first = Naomi| authorlink = Naomi Oreskes| title = Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change| journal = Science| volume = 306| page = 1686| date = December 2004| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686| doi = 10.1126/science.1103618| pmid = 15576594| issue = 5702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher=The National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-14588-0| last = America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council| title = Advancing the Science of Climate Change| location = Washington, D.C.| year = 2010| url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices"&gt;{{cite web | title = Understanding and Responding to Climate Change| url = https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1048006.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a US corporate coalition including the [[National Coal Association]], the [[Western Fuels Association]] and [[Edison Electrical Institute]] created a [[public relations]] organization called the "[[Information Council on the Environment]]" (ICE). ICE launched a $500,000 advertising campaign to, in ICE's own words, "reposition global warming as theory (not fact)." Critics of industry groups have charged that the claims about a global warming controversy are part of a deliberate effort to reduce the impact any international treaty, such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]], might have on their business interests.&lt;ref name=earthisland&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+PR+plot+to+overheat+the+earth.-a020556371 |title=The PR Plot to Overheat the Earth|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, John Vidal, environment editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', asserted the existence of [[US State Department]] papers showing that the Bush administration thanked [[Exxon]] executives for the company's "active involvement" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the US stance on Kyoto. Input from the industry advocacy group [[Global Climate Coalition]] was also a factor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange/story/0,12374,1501646,00.html Revealed: how oil giant influenced Bush, White House sought advice from Exxon on Kyoto stance]  John Vidal. The Guardian, June 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''Guardian'' columnist [[George Monbiot]] reported that according to data found in official Exxon documents, 124 organizations have taken money from ExxonMobil or worked closely with those that have, and that "These organizations take a consistent line on climate change: that the science is contradictory, the scientists are split, environmentalists are charlatans, liars or lunatics, and if governments took action to prevent global warming, they would be endangering the global economy for no good reason. The findings these organisations dislike are labelled 'junk science'. The findings they welcome are labelled 'sound science'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1875762,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1 The Denial Industry] The Guardian, September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pacinist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacinst.org/topics/integrity_of_science/case_studies/selective_use_climate_update.pdf|title=The Political and Selective Use of Data: Cherry-Picking Climate Information in the White House|author=Peter H.

===Intelligent design===
{{Main|Intelligent design|Teach the controversy}}

The [[intelligent design movement]] associated with the [[Discovery Institute]], attempts to "defeat [the] [[Materialism|materialist]] [[world view]]" represented by the theory of [[evolution]] in favor of "a science consonant with [[Christian]] and [[Theism|theistic]] convictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ncse.com/files/pub/creationism/The_Wedge_Strategy.pdf|title= Wedge Document|year= 1999|publisher= Discovery Institute}} - cited in Handley P. [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC-News&amp;id=2445 Evolution or design debate heats up.] ''The Times of Oman'', 7 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Discovery Institute portrays [[evolution]] as a "theory in crisis" with scientists criticizing evolution and that "fairness" and "equal time" requires educating students about "the controversy."

One of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science is that all forms of life on Earth are related by common descent with modification.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine | title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism | publisher=National Academy Press | year=2008|isbn=0-309-10586-2 | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, any controversial aspects of evolution are a matter of religion and politics, not science.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;"Some bills seek to discredit evolution by emphasizing so-called "flaws" in the theory of evolution or "disagreements" within the scientific community. Others insist that teachers have absolute freedom within their classrooms and cannot be disciplined for teaching non-scientific "alternatives" to evolution. A number of bills require that students be taught to "critically analyze" evolution or to understand "the controversy." But there is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of the theory of evolution. The current controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution is not a scientific one."
{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044657/https://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|archivedate=4 February 2012|title=AAAS Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|date=16 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That this controversy is one largely manufactured by the proponents of creationism and intelligent design may not matter, and as long as the controversy is taught in classes on current affairs, politics, or religion, and not in science classes, neither scientists nor citizens should be concerned."

Annas, [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Volume 354:2277–81  May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 ruling in the Dover trial, ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a [[United States federal courts|United States federal court]] concluded that intelligent design is not science, that it "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents", and concluded that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court  |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

In 2006 the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published survey finding that the U.S. ranks second from last in acceptance of the theory of evolution among thirty-four developed countries surveyed. The article said: "The
acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Japan or Europe, largely because of
widespread fundamentalism and the politicization of science in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, Jon D.|author2=Scott, Eugenie C.|author3= Okamoto, Shinji|year=2006|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/313/5788/765|title=Public Acceptance of Evolution|journal= Science|volume=313|issue=5788|pages=765–66|doi=10.1126/science.1126746|pmid=16902112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tobacco and cancer===
[[File:Surgeon General's warning cigarettes.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A cigarette carton warns about the health risks of smoking. Public awareness was delayed by a SCAM (Scientific Certainty Argumentation Method).&lt;ref name=SCAMs&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219.x | volume=78 | title=Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs): Science and the Politics of Doubt* | year=2008 | journal=Sociological Inquiry | pages=2–38 | last1 = Freudenburg | first1 = William R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By the mid-1950s there was a scientific consensus that smoking promotes lung cancer, but the [[tobacco industry]] fought the findings, both in the public eye and within the scientific community. Tobacco companies funded [[think tank]]s and lobbying groups, started health reassurance campaigns, ran advertisements in medical journals, and researched alternate explanations for lung cancer, such as pollution, asbestos and even pet birds. Denying the case against tobacco was "closed," they called for more research as a tactic to delay regulation.&lt;ref name=physorg&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news91078097.html Tobacco companies obstructed science, history professor says]&lt;/ref&gt; John Horgan, notes a rhetoric tactic that has been used by tobacco companies. It is summarized in a line that appeared in a confidential memo from a tobacco company, in 1969, when they sought to cast doubt on evidence that supports smoking causes cancer. It read, "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."&lt;ref name=HorganReview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/18horgan.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Republican War on Science - Book Review |work=Sunday Book Review, Political Science|author=John Horgan|date = 18 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoubtIs&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=xqkd0134|title=Original "Doubt is our product..." memo|date=21 August 1969|publisher=University of California, San Francisco|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugenics===
{{Main|Eugenics}}

[[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] was well known for [[eugenics]] programs which attempted to maintain a "pure" German race through a series of programs that ran under the banner of [[Racial Hygiene]]. The Nazis manipulated scientific research in Germany, by forcing some scholars to emigrate, and by allocating funding for research based on ideological rather than scientific merit.&lt;ref name="DeichmannDunlap1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ute Deichmann|author2=Thomas Dunlap|title=Biologists Under Hitler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPrtE4K0WC8C|date=15 May 1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}

In the early 20th century, Eugenics enjoyed substantial international support, from leading politicians and scientists. The First International Congress of [[Eugenics]] in 1912 was supported by many prominent persons, including: its president [[Leonard Darwin]], the son of [[Charles Darwin]]; honorary vice-president [[Winston Churchill]], then First Lord of the Admiralty and future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; [[Auguste Forel]], famous Swiss pathologist; [[Alexander Graham Bell]], the inventor of the telephone; among other prominent people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blom|first=Philipp|authorlink=Philipp Blom|title=The Vertigo Years: Change and Culture in the West, 1900–1914|year=2008|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart, Ltd.|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-7710-1630-1|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of support for Eugenics research by the Nazis prompted an American Eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of the American program, with the complaint that "the Germans are beating us at our own game".&lt;ref name="Lynn2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynn|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Lynn|title=Eugenics: a reassessment|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|isbn=0-275-95822-1|page=18|quote=By the middle decades of the twentieth century, eugenics had become widely accepted throughout the whole of the economically developed world, with the exception of the Soviet Union.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a strong connection between American and Nazi Eugenics research. Nazis based their [[Eugenics]] program on the United States' programs of forced [[Sterilisation (medicine)|sterilization]], especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 9, 2003|title=Eugenics and the Nazis – the California connection|last=Black|first= Edwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government politicization==

===Soviet Union===
{{Main|Suppressed research in the Soviet Union}}

In the [[Soviet Union]], scientific research was under strict political control. A number of research areas were declared "[[bourgeois pseudoscience]]" and forbidden. This has led to significant setbacks for the Soviet science, notably in [[biology]] due to ban on [[genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first=Bentley | last=Glass |date=May 1962

 | title=Scientists in Politics | volume=18 | issue=5
 | page=3 | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgkAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see "[[Lysenkoism]]") and in [[computer science]], which drastically influenced the Soviet economy and technology.

===United States===
The General Social Survey (GSS) of 1974 recorded that conservatives had the highest rates of trust in science between the three major political demographics; conservatives, liberals, and moderates.  This study was repeated annually between 1972 through 1994, and biannually from 1994 until 2010.  In 2010 when the same study was repeated, conservatives trust rates had decreased from 49% to 38%, moderates from 45% to 40%, and liberals staying relatively stable, rising slightly from 48% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gauchat|first1=Gordon|title=Politicization of Science in the Public Sphere: A Study of Public Trust in the United States, 1974 to 2010|journal=American Sociological Review|date=2012|volume=77|issue=2|pages=168–187|doi=10.1177/0003122412438225|url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Apr12ASRFeature.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study by Gordon Gauchat, which investigates time trends in the public trust of science in the United States, suggests that the increase of distrust of conservatives can be attributed to the two cultural shifts.  The first was during the post-Reagan era when the [[New Right]] emerged, and the second during the G.W. Bush era when the NR intensified and conservatives commenced the “war on science”.

Barack Obama and other politicians, since Bush’s Presidency, have expressed their concerns with the politicization of science in both the public and government sphere.  In 2011, during his State of the Union speech, Obama discussed his dissatisfaction of the relationships between organized science, private economic interests, and the government.

The data collected in this study reveals the Public Trust in Science, the Public Confidence in Science, and the Predicted Probabilities between Liberals and Conservatives.  The survey examines variables including gender, ethnicity, level of education, income, religion, age, political party preference, political demographics, and changes over time.  Conclusively, the empirical findings of this study have shown that that although the distrust of conservatives has increased over time, the overall public trust in science has not changed since the 1970s.

====George W. Bush administration====
In 2004, The ''[[Denver Post]]'' reported that the [[George W. Bush administration]] "has installed more than 100 top officials who were once lobbyists, attorneys or spokespeople for the industries they oversee." At least 20 of these former industry advocates helped their agencies write, shape or push for policy shifts that benefit their former industries. "They knew which changes to make because they had pushed for them as industry advocates."&lt;ref name=denver_post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0523-02.htm|title=When Advocates Become Regulators|author= Anne C.

Also in 2004, the scientific [[advocacy]] group [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] issued a report, ''Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science''&lt;ref name=americanprogress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/atf/cf/%7BE9245FE4-9A2B-43C7-A521-5D6FF2E06E03%7D/UCSINTEGRITY.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214221941/https://www.americanprogress.org/atf/cf/%7BE9245FE4-9A2B-43C7-A521-5D6FF2E06E03%7D/UCSINTEGRITY.PDF|archivedate=14 February 2006|title= Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An "Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science"|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucsintegrity&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/scientists-signon-statement.html "Restoring Scientific Integrity in Policymaking"] Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/ref&gt; which charged the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;A growing number of scientists, policy makers, and technical specialists both inside and outside the government allege that the current Bush administration has suppressed or distorted the scientific analyses of federal agencies to bring these results in line with administration policy. In addition, these experts contend that irregularities in the appointment of scientific advisors and advisory panels are threatening to upset the legally mandated balance of these bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; A petition, signed on February 18, 2004, by more than 9,000 scientists, including 49 [[Nobel laureates]] and 63 [[National Medal of Science]] recipients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.ucsusa.org/RSI_list/index.php|title= Scientific Integrity Statement Signatories|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829130606/http://www.ucsusa.org/RSI_list/index.php|archivedate=29 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed the report. The petition stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;When scientific knowledge has been found to be in conflict with its political goals, the administration has often manipulated the process through which science enters into its decisions. This has been done by placing people who are professionally unqualified or who have clear conflicts of interest in official posts and on scientific advisory committees; by disbanding existing advisory committees; by censoring and suppressing reports by the government’s own scientists; and by simply not seeking independent scientific advice. Other administrations have, on occasion, engaged in such practices, but not so systematically nor on so wide a front. Furthermore, in advocating policies that are not scientifically sound, the administration has sometimes misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implications of its policies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same year, Francesca Grifo, executive director of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]]' Scientific Integrity Program, stated "We have reports that stay in draft form and don't get out to the public. We have reports that are changed. We have reports that are ignored and overwritten."&lt;ref name=npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5232410 "Bush Science Push Fails to Transform Critics"] Don Gonyea. National Public Radio, Weekend Edition Sunday, February 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticisms, President Bush in 2006 unveiled a campaign in his [[State of the Union Address]] to promote scientific research and education to ensure American competitiveness in the world, vowing to "double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf0JNNW_rjYC&amp;pg=PT117 | title=Space Studies Board Annual Report 2006 | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | author=Space Studies Board | year=2007 | pages=110| isbn=9780309115551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush, publicly accused the administration in July 2007 of political interference and muzzling him on key issues like [[embryonic stem cell research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/washington/11surgeon.html?_r=1 | title=Surgeon General Sees 4-Year Term as Compromised | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=July 11, 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-03 | first=Gardiner | last=Harris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN1034212120070710 | title=Former Bush surgeon general says he was muzzled | date=July 10, 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-03 | first=Will | last=Dunham | publisher=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Anything that doesn't fit into the political appointees' ideological, theological or political agenda is often ignored, marginalized or simply buried," Carmona testified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-08-05-science-politics_N.htm|publisher=USA Today|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623162918/https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-08-05-science-politics_N.htm|archivedate=23 June 2015|title=Science vs. politics gets down and dirty|date=7 August 2007}} Note: archive.org backup has much better formatting than live URL&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not make personal accusations, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported on July 29 that the official who blocked at least one of Carmona's reports was [[William R. Steiger]].&lt;ref name=Post29&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/28/AR2007072801420.html?nav=hcmodule Bush Aide Blocked Report], Christopher Lee and Marc Kaufman, The Washington Post, July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Food and Drug Administration=====
In July 2006 the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) released survey results that demonstrate pervasive political influence of science at the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/fda-scientists-pressured.html FDA Scientists Pressured to Exclude, Alter Findings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 997 FDA scientists who responded to the survey, nearly one fifth (18 percent) said that they "have been asked, for non-scientific reasons, to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in a FDA scientific document." This is the third survey Union of Concerned Scientists has conducted to examine inappropriate interference with science at federal agencies.

The Department of Health and Human Services also conducted a survey addressing the same topic which generated similar findings.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-12-16-fda-survey-usat_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=FDA scientists question safety | first1=Julie | last1=Schmit | date=December 17, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[USA Today]]'', a survey of [[Food and Drug Administration]] scientists by [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility]] and the Union of Concerned Scientists found that many scientists have been pressured to approve or reject new drugs despite their scientific findings concerns.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; In July 2006, the Union of Concerned Scientists released survey results that they said "demonstrate pervasive political influence of science" at the [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=ucsfda&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/fda-scientists-pressured.html FDA Scientists Pressured to Exclude, Alter Findings; Scientists Fear Retaliation for Voicing Safety Concerns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucsfda2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/scientific_integrity/Scientific-Integrity-at-Risk-FDA.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425224905/http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/scientific_integrity/Scientific-Integrity-at-Risk-FDA.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2016| title=Scientific Integrity at Risk: The Food and Drug Administration|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States Department of the Interior=====
{{Main|Julie A. MacDonald}}

On May 1, 2007, deputy assistant secretary at the [[United States Department of the Interior]] [[Julie A. MacDonald|Julie MacDonald]] resigned after the Interior Department Inspector General, Honorable Earl E. Devaney, reported that MacDonald broke federal rules by giving non-public, internal government documents to oil industry and property rights groups, and manipulated scientific findings to favor Bush policy goals and assist land developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-03-29-interior_N.htm?csp=15 | title = Report: Interior official blasted for twisting environmental data | publisher = USA Today | date = March 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 2007, another report by  Devaney found that MacDonald could have also benefitted financially from a decision she was involved with to remove the [[Sacramento splittail]] fish from the federal endangered species list.&lt;ref name=ensnov29&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/nov2007/2007-11-29-10.html|title=U.S. Endangered Species Program Burdened by Political Meddling|date=29 November 2007|author=Pegg, JR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald's conduct violated the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) under [[5 C.F.R.]] § 2635.703, Use of nonpublic information, and 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101, Basic obligation of public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/swcbd/programs/esa/pdfs/DOI-IG-Report_JM.pdf | title = Report of Investigation: Julie MacDonald, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Fish, Wildlife and Parks | publisher = US Department of the Interior | date = March 23, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; MacDonald resigned a week before a House congressional oversight committee was to hold a hearing on accusations that she had "violated the Endangered Species Act, censored science and mistreated staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service."&lt;ref name=AP-20070501&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18422404/ns/us_news-environment/t/interior-dept-official-quits-ahead-hearing/#.WThCNBPyv1I|title=Interior Dept. official quits ahead of hearing|publisher=AP|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Climate Change=====
In December 2007, the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that at least since 2003, and especially after [[Hurricane Katrina]], the George W. Bush administration broadly attempted to control which [[List of climate scientists|climate scientists]] could speak with reporters, as well as edited scientists' congressional testimony on [[climate science]] and key legal opinions.&lt;ref name=csm&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1212/p03s03-uspo.html Study Finds White House Manipulation on Climate Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have studied organizations that set up to delay action and manufacture uncertainty about the well-established scientific consensus have divided their tactics into three steps: first, deny that there is a problem, second, make the case that there are benefits involved, and, third, insist that there is nothing that can be done.&lt;ref name=goodforyou&gt;[http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-08-15/news/global-warming-is-good-for-you/ Global Warming is Good for You] Dylan Otto Krider, ''Houston Press, 2002''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, "The legitimacy of environmental scientists in the public sphere" by Gordon Gauchat, Timothy O’Brien, and Oriol Mirosa, the researchers conclude that attitudes about environmental scientists as policy advisers are highly politicized. Their results demonstrate that, to be perceived by the public as a reputable policy advisor, the public's perception of their integrity and understanding weigh more strongly than their agreement with scientific consensus.

=====Waxman report=====
In August 2003, [[United States]], Democratic Congressman [[Henry A. Waxman]] and the staff of the [[United States House Committee on Government Reform|Government Reform Committee]] released a report concluding that the [[George W. Bush administration|administration of George W. Bush]] had politicized science and [[sex education]]. The report accuses the administration of modifying performance measures for abstinence-based programs to make them look more effective. The report also found that the Bush administration had appointed Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a prominent advocate of abstinence-only program, to the Advisory Committee to the director of the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. According to the report, information about comprehensive sex education was removed from the CDC's website.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Other issues considered for removal included [[Agriculture#Environmental impact|agricultural pollution]],  the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[breast cancer]]; the report found that a [[National Cancer Institute]] website has been changed to reflect the administration view that there may be a risk of breast cancer associated with [[abortion]]s.&lt;ref name=waxmanreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democrats.reform.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/pdfs/pdf_politics_and_science_rep.pdf|title=Politics and Science in the Bush Administration|publisher=United States House of Representatives|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040924022245/http://democrats.reform.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/pdfs/pdf_politics_and_science_rep.pdf|archivedate=2004-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=waxmanpage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/reform/min/politicsandscience/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207032614/http://democrats.reform.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/index.htm|archivedate=7 December 2006|title=Politics and Science: Investigating the Bush Administration's Promotion of Ideology Over Science|date=August 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was updated after protests and now holds that no such risk has been found in recent, well-designed studies.&lt;ref name="waxmanreport"/&gt;

=====Abortion–breast cancer hypothesis=====
{{Main|Abortion–breast cancer hypothesis}}

The abortion-breast cancer hypothesis is the belief that induced abortions increase the risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref name="RUSSO_505"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Russo J, Russo I |title=Susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis. II. Pregnancy interruption as a risk factor in tumor incidence |journal=Am J Pathol |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=505–06 |year=1980 |pmid=6773421 |pmc=1903536}} "In contrast, abortion is associated with increased risk of carcinomas of the breast. The explanation for these epidemiological findings is not known, but the parallelism between the DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinoma model and the human situation is striking. [...] Abortion would interrupt this process, leaving in the gland undifferentiated structures like those observed in the rat mammary gland, which could render the gland again susceptible to carcinogenesis."&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is in contrast to the scientific consensus that there is no evidence suggesting that abortions can cause breast cancer.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs240/en/index.html |title=WHO - Induced abortion does not increase breast cancer risk |accessdate=2007-12-24 |work=who.int |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214064635/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs240/en/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcog_2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/Public/pdf/induced_abortionfull.pdf |title=The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion |page=43 |format=PDF |work=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |accessdate=2008-06-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627022119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/Public/pdf/induced_abortionfull.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oversight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/example_breast_cancer.htm |title=Politics &amp; Science – Investigating the State of Science Under the Bush Administration |accessdate=2008-04-14 |work=oversight.house.gov |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080327055020/http://oversight.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/example_breast_cancer.htm |archivedate = 2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the scientific community rejecting the hypothesis, many [[pro-life]] advocates continue to argue that a link between abortions and breast cancer exists, in an effort to influence public policy and opinion to further restrict abortions and discourage women from having abortions.&lt;ref name="JASEN"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jasen, P|title=Breast cancer and the politics of abortion in the United States|journal=Med Hist|volume=49|issue=2|pages=423–44|year=2005 |pmid=16562329|pmc= 1251638|doi= 10.1017/S0025727300009145}}&lt;/ref&gt; While historically a controversial hypothesis, the debate now is almost entirely political rather than scientific.&lt;ref name="JASEN" /&gt;

The most notable example of the politicization of this topic was the modification of the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) fact sheet by the George W. Bush administration from concluding no link to a more ambiguous assessment regarding the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis,&lt;ref name="oversight"/&gt; despite the NCI's scientifically-based assessment to the contrary.&lt;ref name="NCI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/ere-workshop-statement |title=Summary Report: Early Reproductive Events Workshop – National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2017-06-07 |format= |work=cancer.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States House Science Subcommittee on Oversight=====
In January 2007, the U.S. [[House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]] announced the formation of a new subcommittee, the [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Oversight|Science Subcommittee on Oversight]], which handles investigative and oversight activities on matters covering the committee's entire jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;"The Subcommittee handles investigative and oversight activities on matters covering the entire jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology. This Subcommittee is new for the 110th Congress." {{cite web|url=http://science.house.gov/subcommittee/oversight.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326204543/http://science.house.gov/subcommittee/oversight.aspx|archivedate=26 March 2008|title=Investigations and Oversight Committee - 110th Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.house.gov/subcommittees/subcommittee-oversight-115th-congress|title=Subcommittee on Oversight - 115th Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subcommittee has authority to look into a whole range of important issues, particularly those concerning manipulation of scientific data at Federal agencies.

In an interview, subcommittee chairman Rep. Brad Miller pledged to investigate scientific integrity concerns under the Bush Administration. Miller noted that there were multiple reports in the media of the Bush Administration's manipulation of science to advance his political agenda, corrupt advisory panels, and minimize scientific research with federal funds. Miller, as part of the House Committee of Science and Technology, collected evidence of interference with scientific integrity by Bush's political appointees.

====Donald Trump administration====
The issue of politicized science surfaced again during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential campaign]] by then Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]].  Trump stated his intention to strip [[NASA]]'s Earth Science division of its funding, a move that ''[[The Guardian]]'' writes "would mean the elimination of NASA's world-renowned research into temperature, ice, clouds and other climate phenomena".&lt;ref name="milman-2016"&gt;

On January 22, 2013, [[United States House of Representatives|New Jersey Representative]] [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.]], a [[Quaker Christian]] and [[nuclear physicist]], introduced a [[United States Congress#Bills and resolutions|resolution]] to the [[United States Congress]] designating February 12, 2013 ([[Charles Darwin]]'s 204th birthday) as "[[Darwin Day]]" in order to recognize "the importance of [[sciences]] in the betterment of [[human]]ity".&lt;ref name="NYT-20130201"&gt;{{cite web |last=Oppenheimer |first=Mark|title=Seeing Darwin Through Christian Eyes?

==Scholarly studies of the politics of science==
The politicization of science is a subset of a broader topic, the politics of science, which has been studied by scholars in a variety of fields, including most notably [[Science and Technology Studies]]; [[history of science]]; political science; and the sociology of science, knowledge, and technology.  Increasingly in recent decades, these fields have examined the process through which science and technology are shaped.  Some of the scholarly work in this area is reviewed in ''The Handbook of Science &amp; Technology Studies'' (1995, 2008), a collection of literature reviews published by the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Science &amp; Technology Studies'', Second Edition, Sage Publications (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Science &amp; Technology Studies'', Third Edition, MIT Press (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an annual award for books relevant to the politics of science given by the Society for Social Studies of Science called the [[Rachel Carson Prize (academic book prize)|Rachel Carson Prize]].

'''Pope Sixtus IV''' (21 July 1414&amp;nbsp;– 12 August 1484), born '''Francesco [[House of della Rovere|della Rovere]]''', was [[Pope]] from 9 August 1471 to his death in 1484. His accomplishments as pope included building the [[Sistine Chapel]] and the creation of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican Archives]]. A patron of the arts, the group of artists that he brought together introduced the Early [[Renaissance]] into [[Rome]] with the first masterpieces of the city's new artistic age.

Sixtus aided the [[Spanish Inquisition]] though he fought to prevent abuses therein, and he annulled the decrees of the [[Council of Constance]]. He was noted for his nepotism and was personally involved in the infamous [[Pazzi conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauro Martines, ''April Blood: Florence and the Plot Against the Medici'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 150–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Francesco was born to a family of modest means from [[Liguria]], [[Italy]], the son of Leonardo della Rovere and Luchina Monleoni. He was born in [[Celle Ligure]], a town near [[Savona]].&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1467.htm Miranda, Salvador. ''Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Della Rovere joined the [[Franciscans|Franciscan Order]], an unlikely choice for a political career, and his intellectual qualities were revealed while he was studying [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Pavia]]. He went on to lecture at Padua and many other Italian universities.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14032b.htm Butler, Richard Urban. "Pope Sixtus IV." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 25 Jul. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1464, Della Rovere was elected [[Minister General of the Franciscan order]] at the age of 50. In 1467, he was appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] by [[Pope Paul II]] with the [[titular church]] being the [[Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli]]. Before his papal election, Cardinal della Rovere was renowned for his unworldliness and had even written learned treatises, entitled ''On the Blood of Christ'' and ''On the Power of God''.&lt;ref&gt;Martines, ''April Blood'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; His pious reputation was one of the deciding factors that prompted the [[College of Cardinals]] to elect him pope upon the unexpected death of Paul II at the age of fifty-four.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, ''Lives of the Popes'', New York: HarpersSanFrancisco, 1997, p.264-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papacy==
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1471}}
Upon being elected pope Della Rovere adopted the name Sixtus, which had not been used since the 5th century. One of his first acts was to declare a renewed [[crusade]] against the [[Ottoman Turks]] in [[Smyrna]]. However, after the conquest of Smyrna, the fleet disbanded.&lt;ref name=Palazzo&gt;[http://www.palazzo-medici.it/mediateca/en/Scheda_Sisto_IV,_papa_(1414-1484) "Sisto IV (1414-1484)", Palazzo-Medici Riccardi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810202309/http://www.palazzo-medici.it/mediateca/en/Scheda_Sisto_IV,_papa_(1414-1484) |date=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some fruitless attempts were made towards unification with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Church]]. For the remainder of his pontificate, Sixtus turned to temporal issues and dynastic considerations.

===Nepotism===
[[Image: Melozzo da Forlì 001.jpg|thumb|left|Pope Sixtus IV appoints Platina as Prefect of the Library, by [[Melozzo da Forlì]], accompanied by his relatives]]

Sixtus IV sought to strengthen his position by surrounding himself with relatives and friends. In the fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]], he is accompanied by his [[Della Rovere]] and [[Riario]] nephews, not all of whom were made cardinals; the [[protonotary apostolic]] [[Pietro Riario]] (on his right), the future Pope [[Julius II]] standing before him; and [[Girolamo Riario]] and [[Giovanni della Rovere]], behind the kneeling [[Bartolomeo Platina|Platina]], author of the first [[Humanism|humanist]] history of the popes.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; His nephew [[Pietro Riario]] also benefited from his nepotism. Pietro became one of the richest men in [[Rome]] and was entrusted with Pope Sixtus' foreign policy. However, Pietro died prematurely in 1474, and his role passed to Giuliano Della Rovere.

The secular fortunes of the Della Rovere family began when Sixtus invested his nephew [[Giovanni della Rovere|Giovanni]] with the lordship of [[Senigallia]] and arranged his marriage to the daughter of [[Federico III da Montefeltro]], duke of [[Urbino]]; from that union came a line of Della Rovere dukes of Urbino that lasted until the line expired, in 1631.&lt;ref&gt;On his premature death (1501), Giovanni entrusted his son [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]] to Federico's successor [[Guidobaldo I da Montefeltro|Guidobaldo]] (Duke of Urbino 1482–1508), who, without an heir, devised the duchy on the boy.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the thirty-four cardinals that he created were his nephews.&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, ''Lives of the Popes'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his territorial aggrandizement of the [[Papal States]], his niece's son Cardinal [[Raffaele Riario]], for whom the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]] was constructed, was a suspected colluder in the failed [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 to assassinate both [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and his brother [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]] and replace them in [[Florence]] with Sixtus IV's other nephew, [[Riario|Girolamo Riario]]. [[Francesco Salviati (archbishop)|Francesco Salviati]], [[Archbishop of Pisa]] and a main organizer of the plot, was hanged on the walls of the Florentine [[Palazzo Della Signoria]]. Sixtus IV replied with an [[interdict]] and two years of war with Florence.

According to the later published chronicle of the Italian historian [[Stefano Infessura]], ''Diary of the City of Rome'', Sixtus was a "lover of boys and sodomites", awarding benefices and bishoprics in return for sexual favours and nominating a number of young men as cardinals, some of whom were celebrated for their good looks.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BM6DAz1tefoC |title=Studies in the psychology of sex |author= Havelock Ellis |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sex Lives of the Popes | publisher=Prion | year=1996 | author=Nigel Cawthorne | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Infessura, ''Diario Della città di Roma (1303–1494)'', Ist.

In class a: Nicolas de Clemanges, Opera Omnia, Elzevirius &amp; Laurentius, Lugduni Batavorum 1593, p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Although such accusations are easily dismissed as anti-Catholic propaganda,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; they still prompted the noted historian of the Catholic Church, [[Ludwig von Pastor]], to issue a firm rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Pastor, ''History of the Popes'' [1889], vol. II, Desclée, Roma 1911, pp. 608-611&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Sixtus continued a dispute with King [[Louis XI of France]], who upheld the [[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]] (1438), which held that papal decrees needed royal assent before they could be promulgated in France.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; That was a cornerstone of the privileges claimed for the [[Gallican Church]] and could never be shifted as long as Louis XI manoeuvred to replace King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] with a French prince. Louis was thus in conflict with the papacy, and Sixtus could not permit it.

On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the [[papal bull]] ''Exigit Sincerae Devotionis Affectus'' through which the [[Spanish Inquisition]] was established in the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Sixtus consented under political pressure from [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]], who threatened to withhold military support from his kingdom of [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Gollmann 1854"/&gt; Nevertheless, Sixtus IV quarrelled over protocol and prerogatives of jurisdiction; he was unhappy with the excesses of the Inquisition and condemned the most flagrant abuses in 1482.&lt;ref&gt;"Sixtus IV." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2008 Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a temporal prince who constructed stout fortresses in the [[Papal States]], he encouraged the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] to attack [[War of Ferrara|Ferrara]], which he wished to obtain for another nephew. [[Ercole I d'Este]], [[Duke of Ferrara]], was allied with the [[Sforza]]s of [[Milan]], the [[Medici]]s of [[Florence]] along with the [[King of Naples]], normally a hereditary ally and champion of the papacy. The angered Italian princes allied to force Sixtus IV to make peace to his great annoyance.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; For refusing to desist from the very hostilities that he himself had instigated and for being a dangerous rival to Della Rovere dynastic ambitions in the [[Marche]], Sixtus placed Venice under [[interdict]] in 1483. He also lined the coffers of the state by unscrupulously selling high offices and privileges.&lt;ref name=Palazzo/&gt;

In ecclesiastical affairs, Sixtus promoted the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception of Mary|Immaculate Conception]], which had been confirmed at the [[Council of Basle]] in 1439,&lt;ref name=Palazzo/&gt; and he designated 8 December as its feastday. In 1476, he issued the apostolic constitution ''Cum Praeexcelsa'', establishing a Mass and Office for the feast. He formally annulled the decrees of the [[Council of Constance]] in 1478.

===Slavery===
The two papal bulls issued by [[Pope Nicholas V]], ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' of 1452 and ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' of 1455, had effectively given the Portuguese the rights to acquire slaves along the African Coast by force or trade. Those concessions were confirmed by Sixtus in his own bull, ''[[Aeterni regis]]'', of 21 June 1481.&lt;ref&gt;Raiswell, p. 469 see also "Black Africans in Renaissance Europe", p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the "ideology of conquest" expounded in those texts became the means by which commerce and conversion were facilitated.&lt;ref&gt;Traboulay 1994, P. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1476, Isabel and Fernando ordered an investigation into rights of conquest in the Canary Islands, and in the spring of 1478, they sent Juan Rejon with sixty soldiers and thirty cavalry to the Grand Canary, where the natives retreated inland.

Sixtus's earlier threats to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians in the bull ''Regimini Gregis'' of 1476 could have been intended to emphasise the need to convert the natives of the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Guinea]] and establish a clear difference in status between those who had converted and those who resisted.&lt;ref&gt;Sued-Badillo (2007), see also O'Callaghan,  p. 287-310&lt;/ref&gt; The ecclesiastical penalties were directed towards those who were enslaving the recent converts.&lt;ref&gt;"''Slavery and the Catholic Church"'', John Francis Maxwell, p. 52, Barry Rose Publishers, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princely patronage===
[[Image:Sixtus IV.png|200px|thumb|left]]
As a civic patron in Rome, even the anti-papal chronicler Stefano Infessura agreed that Sixtus should be admired. The dedicatory inscription in the fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in the [[Vatican Palace]] records: "You gave your city temples, streets, squares, fortifications, bridges and restored the [[Acqua Vergine]] as far as the [[Trevi Fountain|Trevi]]..." In addition to restoring the aqueduct that provided Rome an alternative to the river water, which had made the city famously unhealthy, he restored or rebuilt over 30 of Rome's dilapidated churches such as [[San Vitale, Rome|San Vitale]] (1475) and [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], and he added seven new ones. The [[Sistine Chapel]] was sponsored by Sixtus IV, as was the ''Ponte Sisto'',&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/arts/11iht-conway11.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Morris, Roderick Conway. "When Sixtus IV Needed a Painter", ''New York Times'', May 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sistine Bridge]] (the first new bridge across the [[Tiber]] since Antiquity) and the building of ''Via Sistina'' (later named ''Borgo Sant'Angelo''), a road leading from [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] to Saint Peter. All of that was done to facilitate the integration of the [[Vatican Hill]] and [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] with the heart of Old Rome. That was part of a broader scheme of [[urbanization]] carried out under Sixtus IV, who swept the long-established markets from the [[Capitoline Hill|Campidoglio]] in 1477 and decreed in a bull of 1480 the widening of streets and the first post-Roman paving, the removal of porticoes and other post-classical impediments to free public passage.
[[Image:Ponte Sisto, Rome.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Sisto]], the first bridge built at Rome since the [[Roman Empire]]]]

At the beginning of his papacy, in 1471, Sixtus had donated several historically important Roman sculptures that founded a papal collection of art, which would eventually develop into the collections of the [[Capitoline Museums]]. He also refounded, enriched and enlarged the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; He had [[Regiomontanus]] attempt the first sanctioned reorganisation of the [[Julian calendar]] and increased the size and prestige of the papal chapel choir, bringing singers and some prominent composers ([[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], [[Marbrianus de Orto]] and [[Bertrandus Vaqueras]]) to Rome from the north.

In addition to being a patron of the arts, Sixtus was a patron of the sciences. Before he became pope, he had spent time at the very liberal and cosmopolitan [[University of Padua]], which maintained considerable independence from the Church and had a very international character. As Pope, he issued a [[papal bull]] allowing local bishops to give the bodies of executed criminals and unidentified corpses to physicians and artists for dissection. It was that access to corpses which allowed the anatomist [[Vesalius]], along with [[Titian]]'s pupil [[Jan Van Calcar|Jan Stephen van Calcar]], to complete the revolutionary medical/anatomical text ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]''.

==Death==
[[Image:Tomb of Sixtus IV Color.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Pope Sixtus IV by Antonio del Pollaiolo]]
Pope Sixtus's tomb was destroyed in the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome in 1527]]. Today, his remains, along with the remains of his nephew Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere), are interred in St. Peter's Basilica in the floor, in front of the monument to Pope Clement X. A marble tombstone marks the site.

His bronze funerary monument, now in the basement Treasury of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], like a giant casket of goldsmith's work, is by [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]]. The top of the casket is a lifelike depiction of the Pope lying in state. Around the sides are [[bas-relief]] panels depicting with allegorical female figures the arts and sciences (Grammar, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Painting, Astronomy, Philosophy and Theology). Each figure incorporates the oak tree ("rovere" in Italian) symbol of Sixtus IV. The overall program of the panels, their beauty, complex symbolism, classical references and their relative arrangement are some compelling and comprehensive illustrations of the Renaissance worldview. None of them actually states how he died.

Sixtus created an unusually large number of cardinals during his pontificate (23) who were drawn from the roster of the princely houses of Italy, France and Spain, thus ensuring that many of his policies continued after his death:

==Portrayals==
Pope Sixtus is portrayed by [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] in the historical fantasy ''[[Da Vinci's Demons]]'' as having an identical [[twin]], Alessandro. Shortly after the true Pope Sixtus, Francesco, was elected on conclave, Alessandro usurped the Holy See and had his brother locked up in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. The series implies that many of the more unsavoury parts of Sixtus' reign were really the work of his twin, who was out to gain power for himself.

Pope Sixtus will be portrayed by [[Raul Bova]] in the second season of the TV series ''[[Medici: Masters of Florence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/global/daniel-sharman-bradley-james-netflix-medici-1202522384/|title=Daniel Sharman and Bradley James Join Netflix’s 'Medici' (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Clarke|first=Stewart|date=10 August 2017|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IncunabulumDetail.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail from a rare [[Blackletter]] [[Bible]] (1497) printed and rubricated in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Johann Grüninger]].]]
'''Rubrication''' was one of several steps in the [[medieval]] process of [[manuscript]] making. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called ''rubricators'', were specialized [[scribe]]s who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red [[ink]] for emphasis. The term ''rubrication'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''rubrico'', "to color red".

== History ==
The practice usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term ''[[rubric]]'' was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as [[missal]]s, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated,{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 | pp = 24–25}} and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.

Rubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting [[grapheme |character]] of a [[canto]] or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than [[illumination (manuscript) |illumination]], in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of [[gold]] to give the appearance of [[light]] within the text.

Quite commonly the manuscript's initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of [[annotation]]s made in the [[Margin (typography) |margins]] of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to "rubricate here" or "add rubric". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the rubricator can be used along with [[codicology]] to establish a manuscript's history, or [[provenance]].

Later medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of [[movable type]] printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The "great majority of [[incunable]]s did not issue from the press in a finished state… hardly any incunable was considered 'finished' by its printer…", suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works.  This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink "was not merely decorative… red's original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way".{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}

==Uses==
The title "generally was written in one or more lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title", showing both the importance of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process.{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 |  pp = 24–25}}  As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the [[provenance]] of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.

==Ink==
The recipe for the red ink is given in [[Theophilus Presbyter |Theophilus]]' ''[[De diversis artibus]]'':
{{Quote |
To prepare white-flake, get some sheets of lead beaten out thin, place them dry in a hollow piece of wood and pour in some warm vinegar or urine to cover them. Then, after a month, take off the
cover and remove whatever white there is, and again replace it as at first.  When you have a sufficient amount and you wish to make
red lead from it, grind this flake-white on a stone without water, then put it in two or three new pots and place it over a burning fire.  You have a slender curved iron rod, fitted at one end in a wooden handle and broad at the top, and with this you can stir and mix this flake-white from time to time. You do this for a long time until the red lead becomes visible.{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}}}

The process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials.  The white material is [[White lead |lead carbonate]] and the red material is [[lead(II,IV) oxide]].

'''Ruth Lydia Saw''' (1 August 1901 –  23 March 1986) was a British [[philosopher]] and [[aestheticist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborne|first=Harold|title=PROFESSOR RUTH L. SAW|journal=British Journal of Aesthetics|year=1986|volume=26|issue=4|pages=307–308|url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/4/307.extract|accessdate=19 February 2012|doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/26.4.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Ruth Saw attended the County School for Girls in Wallington, Surrey, followed in 1926 by [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], [[University of London]], where she studied under [[Susan Stebbing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=S|title=Dictionary of Twentieth Century Philosophers|date=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|isbn=184371096X|page=925}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted a position as lecturer in Philosophy at [[Smith College]] and remained there for several years. She then returned to England and was appointed to a Lecturership in Philosophy at Bedford College in 1939 and remained there for the rest of her career. She became Reader in Philosophy in 1946 and then Professor of Aesthetics from 1961–64. She was also Head of Department there from 1953 until her retirement in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waithe|first1=Mary Ellen|title=A History of Women Philosophers|date=1995|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0792328086|pages=357–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saw's philosophical interests began with logic and philosophy of language, particularly on causal induction in [[William of Ockham|Ockham]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saw|first1=Ruth L.|title=William of Ockham on Terms, Propositions, Meaning|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|date=1941|volume=42|pages=45–64|jstor=4544363}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moved towards metaphysics, particularly Leibniz and Spinoza on whom she wrote full-length works. By the 1950s her interests lay with aesthetics. She was appointed Professor of Aesthetics in the 1961 and published three articles on the subject in the early 1960s.

Saw was a founding member of the [[British Society of Aesthetics]]. In 1963 she became Vice-President of the Society, and in 1968, on the death of Sir Herbert, she became President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meager|first1=R|title=Professor Ruth L. Saw|journal=British Journal of Aesthetics|date=1982|volume=22|issue=2|pages=99–102|doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/22.2.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She began to play an active role in the [[Aristotelian Society]] from the mid- 1930s eventually to become the fifth woman to be elected President of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who|date=December 2007|chapter=SAW, Prof. Ruth Lydia|publisher=A &amp; C Black|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U168872|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965.

The Buddhist doctrine of '''the two truths''' ({{bo|w=bden pa gnyis}}) differentiates between two levels of ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit), meaning [[truth]] or "really existing" in the discourse of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]: the "conventional" or "provisional" ({{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}}) truth, and the "ultimate" ({{IAST|''paramārtha''}}) truth.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

The exact meaning varies between the various Buddhist schools and traditions. The best known interpretation is from the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[IAST|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, whose founder was [[Nagarjuna]].{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}} For Nagarjuna, the two truths are ''epistemological truths''. The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, phenomena are empty (''sunyata'') of an inherent self or essence, but exist [[Pratītyasamutpāda|depending on other phenomena]] (''Pratītyasamutpāda'').{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

In Chinese Buddhism, the [[Madhyamaka]] position is accepted and the two truths refer to two ''ontological truths''. Reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

The {{IAST|''śūnyatā''}} doctrine is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn't lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

==Etymology and meaning==
''[[Satya]]'' is usually taken to mean "truth", but does also refer to mean "a reality," "a genuinely real existent."{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=50}} "Satya" (Sat-yá)&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; is derived from [[Sat (Sanskrit)|''Sat'']] and ''ya''. ''Sat'' means being, reality, and is the [[present participle]] of the root ''as'' "to be" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁es-|*h₁es-]]}}''; cognate to English ''[[:wikt:is|is]]'').&lt;ref name=aam&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|A. A. Macdonell]], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120617797}}, page 330-331&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ya'' and ''yam'' means "advancing, supporting, hold up, sustain, one that moves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=yA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 yA] Sanskrit English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html ''yam''] Monier Williams' Sanskrit English Dictionary, Univ of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; As a composite word, ''Satya'' and ''Satyam'' imply that "which supports, sustains and advances reality, being"; it literally means, "that which is true, actual, real, genuine, trustworthy, valid".&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;

The two truths doctrine states that there is:
* ''Provisional ''or conventional truth ([[Sanskrit]] {{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}}''-satya'', [[Pāli]] ''sammuti sacca'', [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] ''kun-rdzob bden-pa''), which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and
* ''Ultimate'' truth (Sanskrit, ''paramārtha-satya'', Pāli ''paramattha sacca'', Tibetan: ''don-dam bden-pa''), which describes the ultimate reality as ''[[sunyata]]'', empty of concrete and inherent characteristics.

[[Chandrakirti|Chandrakīrti]] suggests three possible meanings of {{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}} :{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}
# complete covering or the 'screen' of ignorance which hides truth
# existence or origination through dependence, mutual conditioning
# worldly behavior or speech behavior involving designation and designatum, cognition and cognitum.

The conventional truth may be interpreted as "obscurative truth" or "that which obscures the true nature" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.&lt;ref name="LevinsonAug06"&gt;Levinson, Jules (August 2006) ''[http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf Lotsawa Times Volume II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083326/http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Buddha's teaching of ({{IAST|''dharma''}}) may be viewed as a path ({{IAST|''mārga''}}) of release from the anxieties of life. The first Noble Truth equates life-experiences with pain and suffering. Buddha's language was simple and colloquial. Naturally, various statements of Buddha at times appear contradictory to each other. Later Buddhist teachers were faced with the problem of resolving these contradictions. Nagarjuna and other teachers introduced an exegetical technique level-distinction between two levels of truth, the conventional and the ultimate.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

A similar method is reflected in the Brahmanical exegesis of the Vedic scriptuires which combine the ritualistic injunctions of the [[Brahmanas|Brahmana]] and speculative philosophical questions of the [[Upanishads]] as one whole 'revealed' body of work thereby contrasting the {{IAST|''jñāna kāņḍa''}} with {{IAST|''karmakāņḍa''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

==Origin and development==
While the concept of the two truths is associated with the [[Madhyamaka]] school, its history goes back to the oldest Buddhism.

===Early Indian Buddhism===

====Pali Canon====
In the Pali canon, the distinction is not made between a lower ''truth'' and a higher ''truth'', but rather between two kinds of expressions of the same truth, which must be interpreted differently. Thus a phrase or passage, or a whole sutta, might be classed as ''neyyattha'' or ''samuti'' or ''vohāra'', but it is not regarded at this stage as expressing or conveying a different level of ''truth''.

''Nītattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''nītārtha''), "of plain or clear meaning"&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams"&gt;Monier-Williams&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neyyattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''neyartha''), "[a word or sentence] having a sense that can only be guessed".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams"/&gt; These terms were used to identify texts or statements that either did or did not require additional interpretation. A ''nītattha'' text required no explanation, while a ''neyyattha'' one might mislead some people unless properly explained:&lt;ref&gt;McCagney: 82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There are these two who misrepresent the [[Tathagata]].  Which two?  He who represents a [[Sūtra|Sutta]] of indirect meaning as a Sutta of direct meaning and he who represents a Sutta of direct meaning as a Sutta of indirect meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anguttara Nikaya]]'' I:60 (Jayatilleke: 361, in McCagney: 82)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''{{IAST|Saṃmuti}}'' or ''{{IAST|samuti}}'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|saṃvṛti}}'', meaning "common consent, general opinion, convention",&lt;ref&gt;PED&lt;/ref&gt; and ''paramattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''paramārtha''), meaning "ultimate", are used to distinguish conventional or common-sense language, as used in metaphors or for the sake of convenience, from language used to express higher truths directly. The term ''vohāra'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''vyavahāra'', "common practice, convention, custom" is also used in more or less the same sense as ''samuti''.

====Theravāda====
The [[Theravada|Theravādin]] commentators expanded on these categories and began applying them not only to expressions but to the truth then expressed:
{{quote|The Awakened One, the best of teachers, spoke of two truths, conventional and higher; no third is ascertained; a conventional statement is true because of convention and a higher statement is true as disclosing the true characteristics of events.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Khathāvatthu Aṭṭha kathǎ}}'' (Jayatilleke: 363, in McCagney: 84)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Prajnāptivāda====
The [[Prajñaptivāda]] school took up the distinction between the conventional and ultimate (''paramārtha/{{IAST|saṃvṛti}}''), and extended the concept to [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|metaphysical-phenomenological constituents]] (''dharmas''), distinguishing those that are real (''tattva'') from those that are purely conceptual, i.e., ultimately nonexistent (''prajnāpti'').

===Indian Mahayana Buddhism===

====Madhyamaka====
The distinction between the two truths (''satyadvayavibhāga'') was fully developed by [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) of the [[Madhyamaka]] school.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} The Madhyamikas distinguish between ''loka-samvriti-satya'', "world speech truth" c.q. "relative truth"&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl031604.html ''The Urban Dharma Newsletter. March 16, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; c.q. "truth that keeps the ultimate truth concealed,"{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}} and ''paramarthika satya'', ultimate truth.&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;

''Loka-samvriti-satya'' can be further divided in ''tathya-samvrti'' or ''loka-samvrti'', and ''mithya-samvrti'' or ''aloka-samvrti'',{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=285}}{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}} "true samvrti" and "false samvrti."{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}}&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Lal Mani Joshi, [[Bhāviveka]] (6th century CE), the founder of the [[Svātantrika]]subschool of the Mādhyamaka, classified ''samvrti'' into ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti''.{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}} [[Candrakīrti]] (7th century CE), one of the main proponents of the [[Prasaṅgika]] subschool of Madhyamaka, divided ''samvrti'' into ''loka-samvrti'' and ''aloka-samvrti''.{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=285}} [[Shantideva]] (8th century CE) and his commentator Prajñakaramati (950-1030&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Praj%C3%B1akaramati Rigpawiki, ''Prajñakaramati'']&lt;/ref&gt;) both use the terms ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti''.{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}} [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], an influential 8th-century Mimamsa-philosopher, in commenting on Madhyamaka philosophy, also uses the terms ''loka-samvrti'' and ''aloka-samvrti''.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}} Murti, in his ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', uses the term ''aloka'', and refers to the synonym ''mithya samvrti''.{{sfn|Murti|2013|p=245}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murti: "In calling it 'loka samvrti,' it is implied that there is some appearance which is 'aloka' - non-empirical, i.e. false for the emprical consciousness even."{{sfn|Mrti|2013|p=245}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Seyfort Ruegg further comments: "The ''samvrti'' in worldly usage is termed ''lokasamvrti''; and while it can serve no real purpose to distinguish an ''alokasamvrti'' opposed to it (from the point of view of ultimate reality both are unreal, though in different degrees from the relative standpoint), one may nevertheless speak of an ''alokasamvrti'' as distinct from it when considering that there exist persons who can be described as 'not of the world' (''alokah'') since they have experiences which are falsified because of the fact that their sense-faculties are impaired (and which, therefore, do not belong to the general worldly consensus."{{sfn|Seyfort Ruegg|1981|p=74-75}}}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt; ''Tathya-samvrti'' or "true samvrti" refers to "things" which concretely exist and can be perceived as such by the senses, while ''mithya-samvrti'' or "false samvrti" refers to false cognitions of "things" which do not exist as they are perceived.{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}}&lt;ref group=web name="Sulekha.com"&gt;[http://creative.sulekha.com/refutation-of-advaita-kumarila-part-2_325305_blog Sulekha.com, ''Refutation of Advaita:Kumarila Part 2'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|An often-used explanation in Madhyamaka literature is the perception of a snake.

Ultimately both are false, but "the snake-seen-in-the-rope" is less true than the "snake-seen-in-the-snake."

Atman and Brahman, which according to the Buddha is ''asat'', "something that does not exist."{{sfn|Gombrich|1990|p=15}} Compare also [[Atiśa]]: "One may wonder, "From where did all this come in the first place, and to where does it depart now?"

Nagarjuna's ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' provides a logical defense for the claim that all things are empty ([[sunyata]]) of an inherently-existing self-nature.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata, however, is also shown to be "empty," and Nagarjuna's assertion of "the emptiness of emptiness" prevents sunyata from constituting a higher or ultimate reality.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}}{{refn|group=note|Some have interpreted ''paramarthika satya'' or "ultimate truth" as constituting a metaphysical 'Absolute' or [[noumenon]], an "ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason."{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} For example T.R.V. Murti (1955), ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', who gave a [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] interpretation.{{sfn|Westerhoff|2009|p=9}}}} Nagarjuna's view is that "the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth".{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} According to Siderits, Nagarjuna is a "semantic anti-dualist" who posits that there are only conventional truths.{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} [[Jay L. Garfield]] explains:
{{quote|Suppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts [...] So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness […]. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table’s lack of inherent existence [...] To see the table as empty [...] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}}}

In [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' the two truths doctrine is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') with emptiness (''śūnyatā''):
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna, Mūlamadhyamakakārika 24:8–10. Jay L. Garfield|''Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way'': pp. 296, 298&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Nagarjuna's own words:
{{quote|8. The teaching by the Buddhas of the dharma has recourse to two truths:&lt;br&gt;
The world-ensconced truth and the truth which is the highest sense.&lt;br&gt;
9. Those who do not know the distribution (vibhagam) of the two kinds of truth&lt;br&gt;
Do not know the profound "point" (tattva) in the teaching of the Buddha.&lt;br&gt;
10. The highest sense of the truth is not taught apart from practical behavior,&lt;br&gt;
And without having understood the highest sense one cannot understand nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orientalia.org/article492.html Mūlamadhyamakakārikā Verse 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100348/http://www.orientalia.org/article492.html |date=February 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] based his statement of the two truths on the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta. In the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], speaking to the monk Kaccayana Gotta on the topic of right view, describes the middle Way between nihilsm and eternalism:
{{quote|By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "non-existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html Kaccāyanagotta Sutta on Access to Insight] (accessed: January 2, 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511184737/http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html |date=May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Chattopadhyaya, although Nagarjuna presents his understanding of the two truths as a clarification of the teachings of the Buddha, the two truths doctrine as such is not part of the earliest Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|p=21-3,94,104}}

====Buddhist Idealism====

=====Yogacara=====
The [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism distinguishes the [[Yogacara#The Three Natures|Three Natures]] and the [[Trikaya]]. The Three Natures are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Epistemology|author=S.R. Bhatt &amp; Anu Meherotra|pages=7|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=107|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Paramarthika'' (transcendental reality), also referred to as ''Parinispanna'' in Yogacara literature:''The level of a storehouse of consciousness that is responsible for the appearance of the world of external objects. It is the only ultimate reality.''
*''Paratantrika'' (dependent or empirical reality): ''The level of the empirical world experienced in ordinary life''. For example, the snake-seen-in-the-snake.
*''Parikalpita'' (imaginary). For example, the snake-seen-in-a-dream.

=====Lankavatara Sutra=====
The Lankavatara Sutra took an idealistic turn in apprehending reality. [[D. T. Suzuki]] writes the following:
{{quote|The ''Lanka'' is quite explicit in assuming two forms of knowledge: the one for grasping the absolute or entering into the realm of Mind-only, and the other for understanding existence in its dual aspect in which logic prevails and the Vijnanas are active. The latter is designated Discrimination (''vikalpa'') in the ''Lanka'' and the former transcendental wisdom or knowledge (''prajna''). To distinguish these two forms of knowledge is most essential in Buddhist philosophy.}}

===East Asian Buddhism===

When Buddhism came to China from [[Greco-Buddhism#Gandharan proselytism|Gandhara]] (now Afghanistan) and [[India]] in the first/second century CE, it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}} and [[Taoism|Taoist]]{{sfn|Goddard |2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Verstappen|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} influences. [[Neo-Daoism|Neo-Taoist]] concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|Oh|2000}} Concepts such as [[Essence-Function|"T’i -yung"]] (Essence and Function) and "Li-Shih" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism,{{sfn|Oh|2000}} which consequently influenced Chán deeply.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}}

The two truths doctrine was another point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Taoists at first misunderstood [[sunyata]] to be akin to the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}} In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

====Hua-yen Buddhism====
{{Main article|Huayan school}}

The Huayan school or Flower Garland is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] that flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]]. It is based on the Sanskrit [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'', C. ''Huayan Jing'') and on a lengthy Chinese interpretation of it, the [[Huayan Lun]].  The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of profound understanding.

The most important philosophical contributions of the Huayan school were in the area of its metaphysics. It taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing.

Distinctive features of this approach to Buddhist philosophy include:
* Truth (or reality) is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa
* Good is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating evil
* Similarly, all mind-made distinctions are understood as "collapsing" in the enlightened understanding of emptiness (a tradition traced back to the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]])

Huayan teaches the [[Four Dharmadhatu]], four ways to view reality:
# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events;
# All events are an expression of the absolute;
# Events and essence interpenetrate;
# All events interpenetrate.{{sfn|Garfield|2011|p=76}}

====Absolute and relative in Zen====
{{main article|Zen}}
[[File:DogenP2.JPG|thumb|[[Dogen]]]]

The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature - sunyata,{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative,{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} sudden and gradual enlightenment.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}}

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita Sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[Heart Sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}
The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]].

====Essence-function in Korean Buddhism====
{{See also|Korean Buddhism|Essence-Function}}

The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as "essence-function". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not "exclude any other frameworks such as ''neng-so'' or "subject-object" constructions", though the two "are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae  (1983). ''Buddhist Faith and Sudden Enlightenment.'' SUNY series in religious studies. SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-87395-673-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87395-673-4}}.

In Korean Buddhism, essence-function is also expressed as "body" and "the body's functions":
{{quote|[A] more accurate definition (and the one the Korean populace is more familiar with) is "body" and "the body's functions". The implications of "essence/function" and "body/its functions" are similar, that is, both paradigms are used to point to a nondual relationship between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae (2009). ''One Korean's approach to Buddhism: the mom/momjit paradigm''. SUNY series in Korean studies: SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-7697-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7697-0}}.

A metaphor for essence-function is "A lamp and its light", a phrase from the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', where Essence is lamp and Function is light.&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Whalen (1979). "Ch'an Metaphors: waves, water, mirror, lamp". ''Philosophy East &amp; West''; Vol. 29, no.3, July, 1979, pp.245–253.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

====Nyingma====
The '''Nyingma''' tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. It is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], in the eighth century. [[Ju Mipham]] (1846–1912) in his commentary to the ''[[Madhyamālaṃkāra]]'' of [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) says:&lt;ref&gt;Commentary to the first [[couplet]] of [[quatrain]]/[[śloka]] 72 of the root text, (725–788) — Blumenthal, James (2008). "Śāntarakṣita", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Source: [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/saantarak-sita/] (accessed: February 28, 2009), as rendered into English by the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (2005: p. 304)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If one trains for a long time in the union of the two truths, the stage of acceptance (on the path of joining), which is attuned to primordial wisdom, will arise. By thus acquiring a certain conviction in that which surpasses intellectual knowledge, and by training in it, one will eventually actualize it. This is precisely how the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas have said that liberation is to be gained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Ju Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"Primordial wisdom" is a rendering of ''[[jñāna]]'' and "that which surpasses intellectual knowledge" may be understood as the direct perception (Sanskrit: ''[[pratyakṣa]]'') of(''[[dharmata|dharmatā]]''). "Conviction" may be understood as a gloss of [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (''śraddhā'').  An effective analogue for "union", a rendering of the relationship held by the two truths, is ''[[Interpenetration (Buddhism)|interpenetration]]''.}}}}

The following sentence from [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]]'s exegesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s'' [[Madhyamālaṃkāra]]'' highlights the relationship between the absence of ''[[Catuṣkoṭi#Four Extremes|the four extremes]]'' (''mtha'-bzhi'') and the [[nondual]] or ''[[Two Truths|indivisible two truths]]'' (''bden-pa dbyer-med''):
{{quote|The learned and accomplished [masters] of the Early Translations considered this simplicity beyond the four extremes, this abiding way in which the two truths are indivisible, as their own immaculate way.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Thomas H. (trans.) Mipham, Jamgon Ju.(author)(2004). '' Speech of Delight: Mipham's Commentary of Shantarakshita's Ornament of the Middle Way''. Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-217-7}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blankleder|Blankleder]] and [[Wulstan Fletcher|Fletcher]] of the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] give a somewhat different translation:&lt;br&gt;
"The learned and accomplished masters of the Old Translation school take as their stainless view the freedom from all conceptual constructs of the four extremes, the ultimate reality of the two truths inseparably united."&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

====Dzogchen====
[[Dzogchen]] holds that the two truths are ultimately resolved into non-duality as a lived experience and are non-different.

==Understanding in other traditions==

===Jainism===
The Jain philosopher [[Kundakunda]] was influenced by Nagarjuna to develop a Jain version of the theory of two truths.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In texts such as Pravacanasāra
(‘The Essence of the Doctrine’) and Samayasāra (‘The Essence of the Soul’), Kundakunda distinguishes between two perspectives of truth:

*''vyavahāranaya'' or ‘mundane perspective’
*''niścayanaya'' or ‘ultimate perspective’, also called “supreme” (''paramārtha'') and “pure” (''śuddha'')&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kundakunda, the mundane realm of truth is also the relative perspective of normal folk, where the workings of [[karma]] operate and where things emerge, last for a certain duration and perish. The ultimate perspective meanwhile, is that of the liberated [[jiva]], which is "blissful, energetic, perceptive, and omniscient".&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advaita Vedanta===
Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Chattopadhyaya, the Advaita Vedantists retain the term paramartha-satya or parmarthika-satya for the ultimate truth, and for the ''loka samvriti'' of the Madhyamakas they use the term ''vyahvarika satya'' and for ''aloka samvriti'' they use the term ''pratibhasika'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=107, 104|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
* {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
* {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

===Mīmāṃsā refutation of Two Truths Doctrine===
Chattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century [[Mīmāṃsā]] philosopher [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] rejected the ''Two Truths Doctrine'' in his ''Shlokavartika''.&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"/&gt; Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the [[decline of Buddhism in India]]{{sfn|Sheridan|1995|p=198-201}} since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline.{{sfn|Sharma|1980|p=5-6}} According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that "the theory of the nothingness of the objective world" is absurd:
{{quote|[O]ne should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be.&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa: "The idealist talks of some 'apparent truth' or 'provisional truth of practical life', i.e. in his terminology, of ''samvriti satya''. However, since in his own view, there is really no truth in this 'apparent truth', what is the sense of asking us to look at it as some special brand of truth as it were? If there is truth in it, why call it false at all? And, if it is really false, why call it a kind of truth?

Truth and falsehood, being mutually exclusive, there cannot be any factor called 'truth' as belonging in common to both--no more than there can by any common factor called 'treeness' belonging to both the tree and the lion, which are mutually exclusive.

On the idealist's own assumption, this 'apparent truth' is nothing but a synonym for the 'false'. Why, then, does he use this expression? Because it serves for him a very important purpose. It is the purpose of a verbal hoax. It means falsity, though with such a pedantic air about it as to suggest something apparently different, as it were. This is in fact a well known trick. Thus, to create a pedantic air, one can use the word ''vaktrasava'' [literally mouth-wine] instead of the simpler word ''lala'', meaning saliva [''vancanartha upanyaso lala-vaktrasavadivat''].

But why is this pedantic air? Why, instead of simply talking of falsity, is the verbal hoax of an 'apparent truth' or samvriti? The purpose of conceiving this samvriti is only to conceal the absurdity of the theory of the nothingness of the objective world, so that it can somehow be explained why things are imagined as actually existing when they are not so.

Instead of playing such verbal tricks, therefore, one should speak honestly. This means: one should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be."&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=370–1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;}}

===Correspondence with Pyrrhonism===
[[Thomas McEvilley|McEvilley]] (2002) notes a correspondence between Greek [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Madhyamika]] doctrines:
{{quote|Sextus says &lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empericus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', II.14–18; ''Anthologia Palatina'' (Palatine Anthology), VII. 29–35, and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt; that there are two criteria:
# [T]hat by which we judge reality and unreality, and
# [T]hat which we use as a guide in everyday life.
According to the first criterion, nothing is either true or false[.] [I]nductive statements based on direct observation of phenomena may be treated as either true or false for the purpose of making everyday practical decisions.&lt;br&gt;
The distinction, as Conze&lt;ref&gt;Conze 1959, pp. 140–141)&lt;/ref&gt; has noted, is equivalent to the Madhyamika distinction between "Absolute truth" (''paramārthasatya''), "the knowledge of the real as it is without any distortion,"&lt;ref name="Conze 1959: p. 244"&gt;Conze (1959: p. 244)&lt;/ref&gt; and "Truth so-called" (''saṃvṛti satya''), "truth as conventionally believed in common parlance.&lt;ref name="Conze 1959: p. 244"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 }}, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15229">[[File:Schizophrenia PET scan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The relevant question: what will research discover? Can "types" of mental states be meaningfully described by "types" of physical events ('''type physicalism'''), or is there some other problem with this pursuit?]]
'''Type physicalism''' (also known as '''reductive materialism''', '''type identity theory''',  '''mind–brain identity theory''' and '''identity theory of mind''') is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory, in the [[philosophy of mind]]. It asserts that [[mental event]]s can be grouped into types, and can then be [[correlation|correlated]] with types of physical events in the brain. For example, one type of mental event, such as "mental pains" will, presumably, turn out to be describing one type of physical event (like [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fiber]] firings).

Type physicalism is contrasted by [[anomalous monism|token identity]] physicalism, which argues that mental events are unlikely to have "steady" or categorical biological correlates. These positions make use of the philosophical [[type–token distinction]] (e.g., Two persons having the same "type" of car need not mean that they share a "token", a single vehicle). Type physicalism can now be understood to argue that there is identicalness between types, whereas token identity physicalism says one can only describe a particular, unique, brain event.

There are other ways a physicalist might criticize type physicalism; [[eliminative materialism]] and [[revisionary materialism]] question whether science is currently using the best categorisations. In the same way talk of [[demonic possession]] was questioned with scientific advance, categorisations like "pain" may need to be revised.

==Background==
According to [[Ullin Place|U. T. Place]],&lt;ref&gt;Place, Ullin (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; one of the popularizers of the idea of type-identity in the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of type-identity physicalism originated in the 1930s with the psychologist [[E. G. Boring]] and took nearly a quarter of a century to gain acceptance from the philosophical community. Boring, in a book entitled ''The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness'' (1933) wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the author a perfect correlation is identity. Two events that always occur together at the same time in the same place, without any temporal or spatial differentiation at all, are not two events but the same event. The mind-body correlations as formulated at present, do not admit of spatial correlation, so they reduce to matters of simple correlation in time. The need for identification is no less urgent in this case (p. 16, quoted in Place [unpublished]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The barrier to the acceptance of any such vision of the mind, according to Place, was that philosophers and logicians had not yet taken a substantial interest in questions of identity and referential identification in general. The dominant [[epistemology]] of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] at that time was [[phenomenalism]], in the guise of the theory of sense-data. Indeed, Boring himself subscribed to the phenomenalist creed, attempting to reconcile it with an identity theory and this resulted in a ''reductio ad absurdum'' of the identity theory, since brain states would have turned out, on this analysis, to be identical to colors, shapes, tones and other sensory experiences.

The revival of interest in the work of [[Gottlob Frege]] and his ideas of [[sense]] and [[reference]] on the part of [[Herbert Feigl]] and [[J.J.C. Smart]], along with the discrediting of phenomenalism through the influence of the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[J.L. Austin]], led to a more tolerant climate toward physicalistic and realist ideas. [[Behaviorism|Logical behaviorism]] emerged as a serious contender to take the place of the Cartesian "[[ghost in the machine]]" and, although not lasting very long as a dominant position on the mind/body problem, its elimination of the whole realm of internal mental events was strongly influential in the formation and acceptance of the thesis of type identity.

==Versions of type identity theory==
There were actually subtle but interesting differences between the three most widely credited formulations of the type-identity thesis, those of Place, Feigl and Smart which were published in several articles in the late 1950s. However, all of the versions share the central idea that the mind is identical to something physical.

===U. T. Place===
{{main|Ullin Place}}
U. T. Place's (1956) notion of the relation of identity was derived from [[Bertrand Russell]]'s distinction among several types of ''is'' statements:{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} the ''is'' of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], the ''is'' of equality and the ''is'' of composition. Place's version of the relation of identity is more accurately described as a relation of composition. For Place, higher-level mental events are composed out of lower-level physical events and will eventually be analytically reduced to these. So, to the objection that "sensations" do not mean the same thing as "mental processes", Place could simply reply with the example that "lightning" does not mean the same thing as "electrical discharge" since we determine that something is lightning by looking and seeing it, whereas we determine that something is an electrical discharge through experimentation and testing. Nevertheless, "lightning is an electrical discharge" is true since the one is composed of the other.

===Feigl and Smart===
For [[Herbert Feigl|Feigl]] (1957) and [[J. J. C. Smart|Smart]] (1959), on the other hand, the identity was to be interpreted as the identity between the referents of two descriptions (senses) which referred to the same thing, as in "the morning star" and "the evening star" both referring to Venus, a necessary identity. So to the objection about the lack of equality of meaning between "sensation" and "brain process", their response was to invoke this Fregean distinction: "sensations" and "brain" processes do indeed ''mean'' different things but they refer to the same physical phenomenon. Moreover, "sensations are brain processes" is a contingent, not a necessary, identity.

==Criticism and replies==

===Multiple realizability===
{{main|Multiple realizability}}
One of the most influential and common objections to the type identity theory is the argument from [[multiple realizability]]. The multiple realizability thesis asserts that mental states can be realized in multiple kinds of systems, not just brains, for example.  Since the identity theory identifies mental events with certain brain states, it does not allow for mental states to be realized in organisms or computational systems that do not have a brain. This is in effect an argument that the identity theory is too narrow because it does not allow for organisms without brains to have mental states. However, ''token identity'' (where only particular tokens of mental states are identical with particular tokens of physical events) and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] both account for multiple realizability.

The response of type identity theorists, such as Smart, to this objection is that, while it may be true that mental events are multiply realizable, this does not demonstrate the falsity of type identity. As Smart states:

:"The functionalist second order [causal] state is a state of having some first order state or other which ''causes'' or is ''caused by'' the behavior to which the functionalist alludes. In this way we have a second order type theory."&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Smart, J. J. C., 2007, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/ "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental point is that it is extremely difficult to determine where, on the continuum of first order processes, type identity ends and merely token identities begin. Take Quine's example of English country gardens. In such gardens, the tops of hedges are cut into various shapes, for example the shape of an elf. We can make generalizations over the type ''elf-shaped hedge'' only if we abstract away from the concrete details of the individual twigs and branches of each hedge. So, whether we say that two things are of the same type or are tokens of the same type because of subtle differences is just a matter of descriptive abstraction. The type-token distinction is not all or nothing.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, 1967. "Psychological Predicates," in W. H. Capitan and D. D. Merrill (eds.), ''Art, Mind, and Religion'', Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, pp. 37–48; Putnam, Hilary. ''Representation and Reality''. 1988. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/ "Multiple Realizability" entry at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by John Bickle].&lt;/ref&gt; essentially rejects functionalism because, he believes, it is indeed a second-order type identity theory. Putnam uses multiple realizability against functionalism itself, suggesting that mental events (or kinds, in Putnam's terminology) may be diversely implemented by diverse functional/computational kinds; there may be only a token identification between particular mental kinds and particular functional kinds. Putnam, and many others who have followed him, now tend to identify themselves as generically [[Physicalism#Non-reductive physicalism|non-reductive physicalists]].  Putnam's invocation of multiple realizability does not, of course, directly answer the problem raised by Smart with respect to useful generalizations over types and the flexible nature of the type-token distinction in relation to causal taxonomies in science.

===Qualia===
{{main|Qualia}}
Another frequent objection is that type identity theories fail to account for phenomenal mental states (or [[qualia]]), such as having a pain, feeling sad, experiencing nausea. (Qualia are merely the subjective qualities of [[consciousness|conscious experience]]. An example is the way the pain of jarring ones elbow ''feels'' to the individual.) Arguments can be found in Saul Kripke (1972) and David Chalmers (1996), for example, according to which the identity theorist cannot identify phenomenal mental states with brain states (or any other physical state for that matter) because one has a sort of direct awareness of the nature of such qualitative mental states, and their nature is qualitative in a way that brain states are not.

A famous formulation of the qualia objection comes from [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1982) in the form of the [[Knowledge argument|Mary's room]] thought experiment. Let us suppose, Jackson suggests, that a particularly brilliant super-scientist named Mary has been locked away in a completely black-and-white room her entire life. Over the years in her colour-deprived world she has studied (via black-and-white books and television) the sciences of neurophysiology, vision and electromagnetics to their fullest extent; eventually Mary comes to know all the physical facts there are to know about experiencing colour. When Mary is released from her room and experiences colour for the first time, does she learn something new? If we answer "yes" (as Jackson suggests we do) to this question, then we have supposedly denied the truth of type physicalism, for if Mary has exhausted all the physical facts about experiencing colour prior to her release, then her subsequently acquiring some new piece of information about colour upon experiencing its [[quale]] reveals that there must be something about the experience of colour which is not captured by the physicalist picture. (See [[Mary's room]] page for full discussion).

The type identity theorist, such as Smart, attempts to explain away such phenomena by insisting that the experiential properties of mental events are ''topic-neutral''. The concept of topic-neutral terms and expressions goes back to [[Gilbert Ryle]], who identified such topic-neutral terms as "if", "or", "not", "because" and "and." If one were to hear these terms alone in the course of a conversation, it would be impossible to tell whether the topic under discussion concerned geology, physics, history, gardening, or selling pizza. For the identity theorist, sense-data and qualia are not real things in the brain (or the physical world in general) but are more like "the average electrician." The average electrician can be further analyzed and explained in terms of real electricians but is not itself a real electrician.

The [[Dervish]] idea was a religious cause whose primary goal was to return the authority of Islamic way of life and unite Somali territories under one single centralized administration.

==Genesis of the Somali Dervish movement==

Although the Somali nationalist struggle had had its share of foibles and major victories, the context of its underlying  “worthy causes” should not be dismissed away without a lucid understanding. The [[Dervish]]es were practically indispensable in the early campaigns to liberate [[Somalia]] from both the Anglo-Ethiopian and the Anglo-Italian conspiracies by which Somali-lands were surreptitiously divided and transferred.

There are several books which discuss the political  relationship, which had continued between 1899 -1905 after the Warsangeli embraced the Dervish ideals of a united Somali state. Among them are two books authored by [[Faarax MJ Cawl]], including ''Garbaduubkii gumeysiga'' or the "Shackles of Colonialism" and "Ignorance is the enemy Of love." Andrzejewski, in his review of the latter book, writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The plot unfolds against the background of Somali national history in the first quarter of this century, when members of a [[Muslim Brotherhood]], who called themselves “Dervishes”, were fighting against the foreign powers which had partitioned the Somali territories, and against those of their compatriots who had accepted colonial rule. The struggle was led by Maxamed Cabdule Xasan (1898-1921), who was a Muslim revivalist reformed as well as a nationalist leader"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Connections between the Somali Dervish movement and Warsangeli sultanates==

As usually presented by contemporary historians, the [[Warsangeli]] initially supported the Dervishes from 1899 until 1905. Later, the Warsangeli splintered into several strong factions, only one-third of which supported the reign of Sultan [[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], who took over the sultanate from his ailing father and powerful Garad, Ali Shirreh. He was a Dervish himself but later turned against Sayid Mohammed because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The two could not see eye to eye on many political, religious and social issues, and the Sultan fiercely defended the independence of his Sultanate against the incursions of the Dervish Movement." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to files concerning the Sultan referred to in [[Ray Beachey]]'s book ''The Warrior Mullah'', the three major fronts of the Dervishes were the
#Forces that concentrated with Sayid, [[Dhulbahente]]
#[[Warsangeli]], and
#[[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]] (mainly Bahgeri) -- All from 1899-1905—the Dervishes had successive victories during these periods.
The Dervish movement also had a great deal of influence in central ([[Mudug]]) and southern Somalia ([[Jubaland]]). The joint resistance by the [[Aulihan]] (Ogaden) and the [[Marehan]] challenged the Italian and British administrations in Jubaland and Mudug.

==Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shirreh==

The Sultan was indeed an amazing authority figure and a lot of people believed him to be some type of a [[saint]]. He survived many battles including the battle in which the Dervishes seized control of [[Las Qorey]]. He was said to have marched through the Dervish legion while wearing a white turban—in disguise, according to oral testimonies. The English at the time described him as a "Man of unusual influence", "A man of mercurial image" and "A man of unusual strength".&lt;ref&gt;''Pastoral Democracy'' by I.M Lewis&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warsangeli were divided into three groups: The army of the Sultanate in Sanaag, Dervishes with strong bases in [[Badhan, Sanaag|Badhan]] and Buraan, and the army of Gerad Dhahar in the [[Bari Region|Bari]] region. The Warsangeli sultanate had had no authority over all the clans of Warsangeli. The man whom the English colony conspired to deport to [[Mombasa]] was Dhahar but he escaped and returned as a hero.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Beachey's book. Ps. Beachey notes that a Warsangeli man escaped deportation to Mombasa who became a hero after he returned from escape. I figured it was Mohamoud Jarig as he was the commander chief of Gaadh haye army"&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, The largest three army units of the Dervishes were divided into three major sections.

===Maarraweyn===
The largest unit assigned to Jidali and Xiis all the way to Burco. They were given those areas. Maarre is an etymology that stands for "those equipped with rifles"(Dhulbahante, mostly Mohamoud Gard, and  part of  Warsenge;li   Reer saalax.)

===Indhabaddan===
The second largest unit. This etymology stands for those with many eyes or "vigilant ones. They were assigned to Badhan, Laasqorey, Ceelaayo, Qaw and Boosaaso. They were 95% Warsangeli, mostly Dubeys, Bihi door,  Reer saalax  &amp; Garabsare.

===Garbo===
Garbo is the third largest unit. Mostly Bahgeri, Farah Garad,(Adan Madoobe) Subclan if HabarJeclo and other clans. The etymology suggests "shoulders" or the backs of pack animals. They carried heavy equipment and large amount of booty. They were assigned to the Ethiopian border and Berbera.

The Indhabaddan unit succeeded once in capturing the above towns but was defeated by the Sultan of Warsangeli and Boqor Cisman army with the help of [[Italy]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Without the colonial support, they would not have been defeated. The interest of those sultanates was all about securing their dominion from any outside and direct rule, so they were content with the indirect rule of the colony. This Sayid opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Cawl, 1973, ''Ignorance is the Enemy of Love''&lt;/ref&gt;
