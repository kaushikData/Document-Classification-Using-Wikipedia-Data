'''''A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda''''' is a [[2.5D]] [[side-scrolling]] [[Action game|action]] [[Platform game|platform]]  available for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed by a [[Thailand|Thai]] independent developer [[Extend Studio]].

== Story ==
The game takes place in a future setting where the Earth is contaminated by pollution. A group of scientist were trapped in Deep Space Reprocessing station after a mysterious asteroid emitting unknown fluorescent gas collided into the station. The survivors then discovered that machines in the station becomes violent towards them after being exposed to the gas. Eventually, they managed to send the sample of the gas to the research team back at the United Earth Headquarters to find out a way to rescue them and called the gas ''Zytron''. Player takes control of the game protagonist ''Ares'', the first Zytron immune robot created to battle machines that become malevolent from being exposed to the Zytron gas, in a mission to rescue the survivors from a deep space station.

==Gameplay==
Players control Ares' movement with [[WASD keys]] on the keyboard and aim with [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. Ares can double jump and roll to avoid attacks and obstacles and can change his suit during the course of the game which gives him a different aesthetic appearance and abilities. He can also activate Vakyl Cannon, a rechargeable orbital cannon which destroys all of the enemies on screen. Players can collect parts from destroyed enemies to craft items and upgrade weapons. They can also collect Datacubes which are scattered throughout the stages which not only unlock background information about certain characters and enemies, but also improve Ares' abilities such as lowering the number of parts required to craft items. Throughout the game players will be able to obtain new weapons in each stage. At the end of each stage, Ares will have to defeat bosses in order to progress. Players can go back between stages during the game by accessing the in-game menu.

==Development==
A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda was originally called ''Trashman'', but the development team changed the name to appeal more to international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = X10 Dev Blog &gt;&gt; Blog Archive &gt;&gt; Title Change |url = http://blog.x10studio.com/?p=416|accessdate = 2012-02-27| publisher = Extend Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game reception is mostly average. Critics from major publications praised A.R.E.S. for its soundtrack and detailed vibrant artwork while criticizing the length of the game to be too short. Due to its popularity, the soundtrack of the game was eventually released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] as a [[downloadable content]] on January 2, 2012. A.R.E.S. won second prize in 2010 Microsoft's [[Dream.Build.Play]]. contest along with other notable independent games such as [[Beat Hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Microsoft's Dream.Build.Play 2010 winners announced -Destructoid |url = http://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-s-dream-build-play-2010-winners-announced-172811.phtml|accessdate = 2012-02-27| work = [[Destructoid]]|last = North|first = Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Acting Instructor''' is a person, usually well educated in [[theatrical]] arts, who teaches, or 'instructs', aspiring performers on various acting methods. One example is the French [[mime artist]] [[Jacques Lecoq]], whose [[methodology]] has inspired several [[theatre practitioners]] including [[Steven Berkoff]].

'''''Atari Karts''''' is a [[Kart racing game|kart racing]] [[video game]] developed by Miracle Designs and published by [[Atari Corporation]] exclusively for the [[Atari Jaguar]] first in North America on December 15, {{vgy|1995}} and later in Europe on December 22 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Atari+Corp.%27s+Jaguar+64+hits+mass+market+price%3B+in+time+for+holiday...-a017867020|title=Atari Corp.'s Jaguar 64 hits mass market price; in time for holiday sales, Jaguar now $99|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com#TheFreeLibrary.com|TheFreeLibrary.com]]|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=December 15, 1995|accessdate=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&amp;cmd=article&amp;do=print_article&amp;id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-08-28|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&amp;cmd=article&amp;do=print_article&amp;id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Castle|first=Justin|url=https://issuu.com/amigajay/docs/jaguar_uk_pdf|title=Historical Atari Jaguar UK Magazine Advert/Reviews Collection|publisher=[[Issuu]]|format=PDF|date=July 21, 2018|page=340|accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the first titles developed by Miracle Designs and its gameplay is similar to the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, where items are placed at predetermined points in the tracks.

In ''Atari Karts'', players take control of one of the seven characters available including Bentley Bear, the protagonist of the {{vgy|1983}} [[arcade game]] [[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]], with each one having different capabilities. In single player mode, players race against computer-controlled characters in multi-race cups over four levels of difficulty and during the races, speed boosting and other [[power-up]]s can be used to gain an advantage while in multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups. It features numerous homages to the history of [[Atari]] and its games.

''Atari Karts'' received mixed reception when it was released. While it received praise for its graphics, sound and controls, many were divided in regards to the gameplay and others criticized its lack of offensive power-ups during both single and multiplayer modes, and lack of variety. Critics also compared the game with ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'', which was released three years prior on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]]. Although it never received a direct sequel, Miracle Designs would go on to develop multiple kart racing titles such as ''Merlin Racing'' for the [[Nuon (DVD technology)|Nuon]] and ''Rascal Racers'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miracle-designs.com:80/mr.htm|title=Merlin Racing - Magic, mayhem and mini-karts, - what more could you ask for ?|publisher=Miracle Designs|accessdate=2018-08-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311230224/http://www.miracle-designs.com/mr.htm|archivedate=2014-03-11|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miracle-designs.com:80/rr.htm|title=Rascal Racers - Rascal Racers !|publisher=Miracle Designs|accessdate=2018-08-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311230405/http://www.miracle-designs.com/rr.htm|archivedate=2014-03-11|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are considered [[spiritual successor]]s to the game. Retrospective reviews for the title have been equally divisive in recent years.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:JAG Atari Karts.png|thumb|left|Screenshot from one of the tracks of the game. From top to bottom, the game's interface displays the number of laps remaining, current power-up obtained, time, current position and remaining lives.]]
''Atari Karts'' is a kart racing game, similar to ''Super Mario Kart'', featuring both a single-player and multiplayer modes. During gameplay, players take control of one of seven available characters at the beginning of the game and drive [[go-kart|karts]] around [[Kart circuit|tracks]]. Before starting to drive, a [[traffic light]] will appear and start the countdown. When the light turns green, the race begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|controlled by the computer]] and other players. Unlike ''Super Mario Kart'', however, no battle and/or [[time trial]] modes are present. When starting the game, four levels of difficulty are available to choose from and they are comprised of three cups, though only one difficulty level is accessible at the start and by winning all of the three cups at the selected level of challenge, the "Miracle Race" challenge can be accessed. In the Miracle Race, either one or two players compete in a race against a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] and when defeated, they become playable characters. By pressing Option at the main menu, players can access the options screen where a number of settings can be changed, such as controls and set the type of terrain display when racing, with [[hill]] (which gives tracks a [[roller coaster]]-like feel to them) being the default mode. When selecting a characters, another player can join at any given time on the character select screen. Progress and settings are automatically kept into the cartridge's internal [[EEPROM]] and the game also features support for the [[Atari Jaguar#Peripherals|ProController]].

Tiles marked with a specific mark are arrayed on the race tracks; these give special abilities (power-ups) to a player's kart if the vehicle passes over them. These power-ups can either benefit or harm those who have picked them up, ranging from a [[rabbit]] icon that give players a speed boost for a few seconds to a [[red]] icon that reverse the vehicle's controls for brief period of time as well. On two-player races, a [[green]] icon that reverse the opponent's controls is the only offensive power-up available on the game.&lt;ref name="AKmanual"&gt;Atari Karts game manual (Atari Jaguar, US)&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''Super Mario Kart'', each cup consists of five-lap races and each one takes place on a distinct track, with more being unlocked on higher difficulties but in order to continue through a cup, a fourth or higher position must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in fifth to eighth position, they are "ranked out" and the race must be replayed at the cost of one of a limited number of lives until a placing of fourth or above is earned. If the player has no lives when they rank out, the game is over, though players can pick up a heart icon (extra life) that are placed on a fixed spot on the track.

The game makes numerous homages to Atari's history and its games. Bentley Bear, the main player character of ''Crystal Castles'', is a playable character and has a track based on his game as well. The Borregas Cup is a reference to the company's old address: 1196 Borregas Avenue, [[Sunnyvale, California]]. The Tempest Cup's name is a tribute to [[Dave Theurer]]'s {{vgy|1981}} arcade game ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''. The Miracle Race is named after Miracle Designs, the game's developer.

=== Characters ===
''Atari Karts'' initially features seven playable characters, while four more playable characters can be unlocked by completing the "Mirace Race" challenges on each difficulty level for a total of 11 playable characters to choose from:

== Development ==
[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|The Mode 7 demo created by Miracle Design for the Atari Jaguar became the basis of development for ''Atari Karts''.]]
According to ex-Atari Corporation vice-president in third-party development Bill Rehbock, programmers Filip Hautekeete and Peter Vermeulen at Miracle Designs received an Alpine development kit for the Atari Jaguar from Atari Corp. themselves and started working on with it.&lt;ref name="AK0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Dan|url=https://theretrohour.com/atari-jaguar-bill-rehbock-ep139/|title=The Atari Jaguar with Bill Rehbock – The Retro Hour EP139 (50min 55sec)|website=theretrohour.com|date=September 14, 2018|accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Filip and Peter created a demo showcasing an emulated interpretation of the [[Mode 7]] graphics mode found in the Super Nintendo to test the capabilities of the Jaguar and sent it to Bill and ex-Atari employee J. Patton.&lt;ref name="AK0"/&gt; Impressed with the results seen from the demo, Atari decided to create a game by combining both ''[[F-Zero (video game)|F-Zero]]'' and ''Super Mario Kart'', with Bill suggesting the usage of Bentley Bear from ''Crystal Castles'' along with other characters from Atari, which did not make it into the final release and designing the game with a "cutesy" atmosphere for the family audience.&lt;ref name="AK0"/&gt; This demo became the starting point for the development of ''Atari Karts''.&lt;ref name="AK0"/&gt; 

''Atari Karts'' makes extensive use of the Mode 7 technique developed by Miracle Designs for the system, featuring elevated and lowered terrains when racing on the tracks.&lt;ref name="AK0"/&gt; The soundtrack was composed in {{vgy|1994}} by Fabrice Gillet in [[ProTracker]] on an [[Amiga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amp.dascene.net/detail.php?detail=modules&amp;view=360|title=Amiga Music Preservation - Composer's Database - Arpegiator (Fabrice Gillet)|website=amp.dascene.net|accessdate=2018-08-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829120123/http://amp.dascene.net/detail.php?detail=modules&amp;view=360|archivedate=2018-08-29|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither he nor the people who created the in-game artwork are listed in the game's credits at the end of the game, with the manual just referring to them as the "Miracle Designs Team".&lt;ref name="AKmanual"/&gt; ''Atari Karts'' was developed in [[Belgium]] and was formally announced in early 1995 under the working title ''Kart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/CD%20Consoles/cdconsoles_numero05/Page%20074.jpg|title=Dossier - Ils Arrivent Sur Jaguar - Kart/Jaguar|magazine=CD Consoles|issue=5|publisher=Pressimage|date=March 1995|page=74|lang=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also previewed in a supplementary July 1995 issue by ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' magazine under a new working title; ''Super Karts'', which lead to the confusion that [[Virgin Interactive]]'s similarly named ''[[SuperKarts]]'' was being converted to the Jaguar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Edge/Supplements/Suppl-Edge-022.pdf/#page/6|title=Jaguar: mass market machine - Thirdparty titles|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=22 Supplementary|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=July 1995|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both internal documents from Atari and a list of upcoming games for the system by ''[[VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment#VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine|VideoGames]]'' magazine, listed the title of the project under its final name minus the letter S and as a September 1995 title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vendel|first=Curt|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/jaguar/jagfiles/jag64-payments.PDF|title=Payment Schedule for Jaguar games to Developers|website=atarimuseum.com|format=PDF|date=August 26, 1995|accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Gore|first=Chris|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_The_Ultimate_Gaming_Magazine_Issue_79_August_1995#page/n13/mode/1up|title=The Gorescore - Industry News You Can|magazine=[[VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment#VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine|VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Larry Flynt Publications|L.F.P., Inc.]]|date=August 1995|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development on the game was completed on December 11 1995, a few days before release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dragon|first=Lost|url=http://forums.atari.io/index.php/topic/2674-the-ultimate-jaguar-unreleasedbetasourcedev-master-list/page-5#entry34184|title=The Ultimate Jaguar Unreleased/Beta/Source/Dev Master List! - Page 5|website=atari.io|date=July 5, 2017|accessdate=2018-09-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104015428/http://forums.atari.io/index.php/topic/2674-the-ultimate-jaguar-unreleasedbetasourcedev-master-list/page-5|archivedate=4 November 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamePro_Issue_078_January_1996#page/n61/mode/1up|title=Atari's Fun 'n' Games Day|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=78|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atari Karts'' received mostly mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="DHGFak"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Stalker|first=The|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_4_Issue_01#page/n87/mode/1up|title=Jaguar's Domain - Review - Atari Karts|magazine=[[GameFan]]|issue=Volume 4, Issue 1|publisher=Shinno Media|date=January 1996|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two sports reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave it scores of 5.5 and 5 out of 10, particularly criticizing the dull track design. One of them elaborated that "Although the scenery changes, each race is an exercise in repetition: pick up icons, don't hit anything." They did, however, compliment the smoothness of the controls.&lt;ref name="EGMak"/&gt; 

''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the game was well-made but too simplistic and cutesy to appeal to anyone but young children, concluding, "These races present just the right level of cuteness and challenge for those younger Jaguar gamers. The question, of course, is how many seven-year-olds are out there looking for Jag games?".&lt;ref name="GProak"/&gt; 

A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' agreed that ''Atari Karts'' was chiefly geared to a younger audience and lacks sophistication, and further criticized that the various tracks are visually different but handle and feel the same. However, he said the game "does have a certain charm that makes it hard to avoid."&lt;ref name="NGak"/&gt; 

Reviewers for ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'', ''GamePro'', and ''Next Generation'' all accused the game of being an obvious knockoff of ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''.&lt;ref name="EGMak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GProak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGak"/&gt;

''JustClaws'' website gave the game their maximum rating of 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="JCak"/&gt;

In a retrospective review for ''The Atari Times'', Gregory D. George criticized the lack of interesting power-ups and the limited enemy AI, which results in perfect drivers as the player's competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=George |first=Gregory D |url=http://www.ataritimes.com/article.php?showarticle=193 |title=Atari Karts |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025054957/http://www.ataritimes.com/article.php?showarticle=193 |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After ''Atari Karts'' was released to the market, Miracle Designs started working on a sequel to the game but never moved forward beyond the planning phase.&lt;ref name="AK0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallett|first=Adrian|url=https://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/podcast-april-5-2018/|title=Arcade Attack Podcast – April (5 of 5) 2018|publisher=arcadeattack.co.uk|date=April 30, 2018|accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Merlin Racing'', an racing title developed by the same team and released for the Nuon, is considered a spiritual successor to the game.&lt;ref name="AK0"/&gt;

'''Mad Friday''', '''Frantic Friday''' or '''Black Eye Friday''' is a nickname for the last [[Friday]] before [[Christmas]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

It is the most popular night for office and factories Christmas parties, which consequently makes it one of the busiest nights in the year for ambulances and the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7157423.stm BBC News, 22 December 2007: "'Black Friday' keeps police busy"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7792652.stm BBC News, 20 December 2008: "'Black Friday' keeps crews busy"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/dec/18/black-friday-party The Guardian, 18 December 2008: "Ambulance service braced for 'Black Friday'"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/warning-over-alcohol-at-christmas-parties-as-black-friday-for-999-calls-looms/1954076.article Nursing Times, 18 December 2008: "Warning over alcohol at christmas parties as 'Black Friday. for 999 calls looms"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12012042 BBC News Wales, 17 December 2010: "Second snow band brings disruption across much of Wales"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The term Black Friday originates as "jargon" used by NHS and Police, and has entered the popular lexicon. From 2013, the press began to use the term Mad Friday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527748/Emergency-services-busy-night-Mad-Friday-descends.html Daily Mail, 22 December 2013: "'Mad Friday' fallout: Emergency services inundated as drinkers descend on towns and cities on last weekend before Christmas"] Linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Mad Friday': Christmas revellers given alcohol warning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35135284|website=BBC News|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|History|reason=I've known the term to be used as long as I've worked in the licensed trade since the mid-00s, and presumably predates that|date=November 2017}} to avoid confusion with the American [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] in November, which was growing increasingly popular in the UK due to marketing by American retailers.

In parts of the [[United Kingdom]], the day has been referred to as Black Eye Friday, due to unusually high number of fights that break out in bars, pubs and clubs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/cumbrian-police-braced-for-black-eye-friday-1.286376?firstComment=0&amp;commentview=1 The Cumberland News, 18 December 2008: "Cumbrian Police braced for Black Eye Friday"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211124831/http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/cumbrian-police-braced-for-black-eye-friday-1.286376?firstComment=0&amp;commentview=1 |date=December 11, 2014 }} Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2011/12/14/police-crackdown-on-violence-in-the-countdown-to-black-eye-friday/ Cumbria Crack, 14 December 2011: "Police crackdown on violence in the countdown to ‘Black Eye Friday’"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.real-whitby.co.uk/black-eyed-friday-by-helen-hutchinson Real Whitby, 7 December 2012: ''Black Eyed Friday In Whitby''] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes called Builders' Friday, as it is the last day of work for many construction workers.

==Safety concerns and preventive measures==

In anticipation of the festivities, police and emergency services officials begin their preparations for Black Friday early in December.  Ambulance Trusts around the country plan and set up mobile "drunk tanks" in city centres to help lighten the load on hospitals and police cells.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harley|first1=Nicola|title=Mad Friday: How police and hospitals are preparing|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11301825/Mad-Friday-How-police-and-hospitals-are-preparing.html|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the higher end mobile units can treat up to 11 people at a time with eight beds, seats with restraint straps and two showers, and can cost up to £500,000.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph" /&gt; In Manchester, temporary metal detectors, or "knife arches", are erected in the busiest parts of the city to assure the public that no weapons of any kind will be tolerated.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Greater Manchester Police prepare for 'Mad Friday'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-12015682|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media===

In December 2013, Greater Manchester Police promoted the hashtag #MadMancFriday to expose some of the embarrassing things that revellers would do, in the hopes of discouraging them from getting so publicly drunk again next year.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Evan|title=Mad Friday: Binge-drinking, arrests and dancing with office chairs...Britain at its worst on its busiest night before Christmas|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/21/mad-friday-binge-drinking-arrests-and-dancing-with-office-chairs-britain-at-its-worst-on-busiest-night-before-christmas-4239554/|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=Metro News UK|date=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Nightlife Initiatives launched a "StaySafe" campaign to encourage responsible behaviour via social media.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph" /&gt;

'''Brasil Game Show''' (known by the initials '''BGS''' and originally titled '''Rio Game Show''' ('''RGS''')) is a yearly [[Brazil]]ian video game convention organized by business executive Marcelo Tavares, that is currently held in [[São Paulo]] and is the largest gaming convention in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasil Game Show (BGS) receives more than 150 thousand visitors to its sixth edition|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/204460/Brasil_Game_Show_BGS_receives_more_than_150_thousandvisitors_to_its_sixth_edition.php|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio de Janeiro recebe maior feira de games do Brasil|url=http://mtv.uol.com.br/ultimas/comeca-a-maior-feira-de-games-do-brasil-no-rj|publisher=MTV|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214045934/http://mtv.uol.com.br/ultimas/comeca-a-maior-feira-de-games-do-brasil-no-rj#|archive-date=2011-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Brasil Game Show was first held on June 21, 2009, at [[Rio de Janeiro]] where it ran under the name of Rio Game Show and had an attendance of 4,000 participants. Until that year, Brazil had been holding no similar events for about 3 years. The attendance doubled in the second edition, November 28 and 29, 2009. In the following year the convention retitled itself to the current name of Brasil Game Show and had an attendance of 30,000 convention goers. In 2011 the convention received over 60,000 convention goers, exceeding the 50,000 attendees expectation for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasil Game Show traz para o Rio de Janeiro as novidades do mercado mundial de games|url=http://adrenaline.uol.com.br/games/noticias/10056/brasil-game-show-traz-para-o-rio-de-janeiro-as-novidades-do-mercado-mundial-de-games.html/|publisher=Adrenaline UOL|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still in 2011, it was announced that the 2012 convention would be held in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasil Game Show 2011 bate recorde de público|url=http://www.jb.com.br/ciencia-e-tecnologia/noticias/2011/10/17/brasil-game-show-2011-bate-recorde-de-publico/|publisher=Jornal do Brazil|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the expectation was of about 80,000 visitors for the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasil Game Show 2012|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/tudo-sobre/brasil-game-show.html/|publisher=TechTudo|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Event once again exceeded expectations, hitting the 100,000 attendees mark and consolidating its biggest Latin American games convention title.

The 2013 edition was held in São Paulo, October 25 (press only), 26, 27, 28 and 29 (open to the public). The expectations of 150,000 attendees were once again exceeded and the space allocated to the convention was doubled in comparison with the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasil Game Show (BGS) receives more than 150 thousand visitors to its sixth edition|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/204460/Brasil_Game_Show_BGS_receives_more_than_150_thousandvisitors_to_its_sixth_edition.php|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the space allocated to the Event was once again doubled, and took all five pavilions of Expo Center Norte, in São Paulo. The Event occurred on October 8 (press and business only), 9, 10, 11 and 12 (open to the public), and there was an estimated attendance of 250,000. Until half March, big companies had already announced their presence in the Event, like [[Ubisoft]], [[Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment|Ongame]], [[Razer Inc.|Razer]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The seventh edition of Brasil Game Show was held in five pavilions at Expo Center Norte in São Paulo|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/read/the-seventh-edition-of-brasil-game-show-will-be-held-in-five-pavilions-at-expo-center-norte-in-s-atilde-o-paulo/0128472|publisher=MCV|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314032929/http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/read/the-seventh-edition-of-brasil-game-show-will-be-held-in-five-pavilions-at-expo-center-norte-in-s-atilde-o-paulo/0128472#|archive-date=2014-03-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brasil Game Show's 2014 exhibitor's list|url=http://www.brasilgameshow.com.br/imprensa/expositores/lista-de-expositores|publisher=Site Brasil Game Show|accessdate=13 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313172445/http://www.brasilgameshow.com.br/imprensa/expositores/lista-de-expositores|archivedate=13 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Captain Marvel''' was a [[superhero]] published by Myron Fass' short-lived [[M. F. Enterprises]]. The character is unrelated to those published by [[Fawcett Comics]], [[DC Comics]], or [[Marvel Comics]] and only appeared in a few comics in the late 1960s before legal challenges shut down the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://seanhowe.tumblr.com/post/142724446157/wall-street-journal-november-13-1967-on-the|title=Bam!

==Publication history==
''Captain Marvel'' lasted for four issues ([[cover-date]]d April–Nov. 1966).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/1781/ ''Captain Marvel'' (M. F. Enterprises, 1966)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by two issues of ''Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five'', numbered #1 and #5 (Sept. 1966 and Sept. 1967).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/1782/ ''Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five'' #1 (Sept. 1966)] and [http://www.comics.org/issue/21277/ ''Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five'' #5 (Sept. 1967)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Captain Marvel was a jet-booted and [[laser]]-eyed alien [[android (robot)|android]] powered by an "M"-emblemed [[medallion]] who had been sent to Earth by his creators to escape the atomic destruction of their war-ravaged planet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/19978/ ''Captain Marvel'' #1 (April 1966)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Vowing to protect the peace of his new home, the self-proclaimed "Human Robot" took the [[secret identity]] of journalist turned Dartmoor University professor Roger Winkle in the city of Riverview, USA &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/capmarv1.htm M.F.'s Captain Marvel], International Catalog of Superheroes website&lt;/ref&gt; where he lived with his young [[ward (law)|ward]] Billy Baxton, the first person he met when he arrived on Earth and the only one who knew his true origins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/19978/ ''Captain Marvel'' #1 (April 1966)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Powers and Weaknesses==
Captain Marvel possessed superhuman strength and speed and the ability to fly thanks to his [[jet engine|jet]]-heeled Astro-Boots that enabled him to hurl through sky and space at fantastic speeds. 

His super-durable robotic body was equipped with advanced alien technology that, among other things, allowed him to generate [[force field (fiction)|force fields]] and [[sonic weapon|sonic blasts]] and to shoot metal-melting [[laser|laser beams]] out of his eyes.  He also had a super-intelligent [[computer|computer brain]] programmed with the scientific knowledge of two worlds that could alter his internal mechanisms to do anything from breath underwater to [[time travel|travel through time]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #2 (June 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Captain Marvel's signature ability, however, was the power to detach his head, limbs and hands and send them flying off in all directions whenever he shouted "Split!" and reattach them when he shouted "Xam!"&lt;ref&gt;Howlett, Mike, ''The Weird World of Eerie Publications'', [[Feral House]], 2010 p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these impressive talents, he was by no means invulnerable.  

He had to remember to rub his energy-giving amulet once every twenty-four hours in order to recharge his circuitry or else he would start to lose important functions like memory and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/19978/ ''Captain Marvel'' #1 (April 1966)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Glass barriers and electronic interference could prevent him from reassembling himself, and his metallic structure meant he could be attracted and held by large powerful [[magnet|magnets]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #2 (June 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  What's more his synthetic body parts were made of materials not available on Earth and could not be replaced if lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/1782/ ''Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five'' #1 (Sept. 1966)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antagonists==
''Captain Marvel'''s villains included characters who resembled other companies' characters, or whose names were actually already in use by other companies, such as the super-stretchable alien master of disguise Plastic Man ([[Plastic Man]]), who was renamed Elasticman after his first appearance,&lt;ref name=cm2&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #2 (June 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; and the bristly-mustached [[mad scientist]] Dr. Fate ([[Doctor Fate]]), who was torn between a desire for revenge and his obsession with learning the [[electronics|electronic]] secrets of the android he called a "human thingamajig".&lt;ref name=cm2 /&gt; 

The flying, hypnotic mastermind known as the Bat&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #3 (Sept. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; resembled [[Batman]] enough to prompt a response from DC Comics attorneys threatening to sue for [[plagiarism]]. The character's name was changed to the Ray&lt;ref name="Captain Marvel #4 Nov. 1966"/&gt; (not to be confused with the [[Ray (comics)|Quality Comics character]]) along with the addition of a lightning bolt emblem on his chest.&lt;ref&gt;Howlett, Mike, ''The Weird World of Eerie Publications'', [[Feral House]], 2010 p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/46/|title=DIAL B for BLOG - THE WORLD'S GREATEST COMIC BLOGAZINE|website=Dialbforblog.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other characters were only somewhat less legally contentious. The handsome Prof. Doom&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel presents The Terrible Five'' #1 (Aug. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; of the subversive organization B.I.R.D. (Bureau of International Revolutionary Devices) secretly performed on-campus [[mind control]] experiments which endangered Prof. Winkle's relationship with the university president's daughter Linda Knowles.  Colonel Cold was a [[bioterrorist]] who secretly hid capsules containing a deadly [[virus]] in [[ballpoint pens]] and distributed them throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #3 (Sept. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  Tarzac, the bald and green-[[gills|gilled]] self-styled "King of the Sharks", rode a giant [[seahorse]] and protected an underwater fortress.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel presents The Terrible Five'' vol. 2, #5 (Sept. 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear physicist turned metal-mouthed pirate Atom-Jaw could bite through solid steel.&lt;ref name=cm2 /&gt; 

And then there was Tinyman, a miniature human being who, in an inversion of [[Ant-Man]] and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]'s powers, could grow to normal adult male size and quickly shrink back down again.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #2 (June 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  Working as [[circus]] [[sideshow]] [[freak]] when not engaged in illegal activities, the white-haired, blue and black-clad Tinyman eventually tired of his sordid lifestyle and reformed with the hero's help, taking the name Jack Baker and going back to school to get his [[law degree]], eventually becoming the local [[district attorney]].&lt;ref name="Captain Marvel #4 Nov. 1966"&gt;''Captain Marvel'' #4 (Nov. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Marvel's true [[nemesis]], the only foe he actually "hated" (because he was pre-programmed to by his makers), was the burly, flame-throwing Destroyer, an android like himself, a literally fiery-eyed, skullcap-clad [[weapon of mass destruction]] created by the enemy Volcano People of the hero's home planet who also escaped the death of their world and was now allied with Earth's own hostile subterranean race.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel presents The Terrible Five Vol.2, No. 5'' Sept. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Appearances==
The M. F. Enterprises version of Captain Marvel made a cameo appearance, along with other alternate versions of Captain Marvel, in issue #27 of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' (1997). The character is shown performing his trademark division trick while wearing the traditional thunderbolt costume of [[Fawcett Comics]]' [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

A strikingly similar superhero was [[Mort Todd]] and [[Daniel Clowes]]'s the Divisible Man whose bizarrely dark and humorous stories appeared in issues of ''[[Lloyd Llewellyn]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/68716/ ''Lloyd Llewellyn'' #6 (1986)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Anything Goes! (comic)|Anything Goes!]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/42841/ ''Anything Goes!'' #4 (1986)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; back in the eighties and was, according to Todd, created as an attempt to do something as "nuttily visual" as [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]]'s original [[Plastic Man]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geeksofdoom.com/2007/11/01/eleven-questions-with-te-pouncey-mort-todd "Eleven Questions with T.E. Pouncey" at the Geeks of Doom website&lt;/ref&gt;

A character actor may play characters who are very different from the actor's off-screen real-life personality, while in another sense a character actor may be one who specializes in minor roles.

The term is used primarily to describe [[television]] and [[film]] actors, and is less used to describe [[theater]] actors.&lt;ref name=twsTobolowsky/&gt; An early use of the term was in the 1883 edition of ''[[The Stage]]'', which defined a character actor as "one who portrays individualities and eccentricities".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed., character, ''n.'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Actors with a long career history of playing character roles may be difficult for audiences to recognize as being the same actor.&lt;ref name=twsNYActingSchool/&gt;

Some character actors play essentially the same character over and over, as with [[Andy Devine]]'s humorous but resourceful sidekick, while other actors, such as [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], have the capacity of submerging themselves in any role they play. That being said, some character actors can be known as "chameleons", actors who can play roles that vary wildly. One such example of this is [[Gary Oldman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls070586842/|title=The best chameleon actors.|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some character actors develop a [[cult following]] with a particular audience, such as with the fans of ''[[Star Trek]]'' or ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.

Character actors tend to play the same type of role throughout their careers,&lt;ref name=twsDigitalPolyphony/&gt; including [[Harvey Keitel]] as a "tough and determined guy", [[Dame Maggie Smith]] as an "upstanding lady matriarch",&lt;ref&gt;Note: early in her career Maggie Smith played leading roles including her Oscar-winning performance as Jean Brodie in ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' and Oscar-nominated role as Desdemona in ''[[Othello]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Lloyd]] as an eccentric, [[Claude Rains]] as a "sophisticated, sometimes ambiguously moral man", [[Abe Vigoda]] as a "leathery, sunken-eyed" and tired hoodlum on the verge of retirement,&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, January 26, 2016, NBC News, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/abe-vigoda-beloved-character-actor-dead-94-n504621 Abe Vigoda, Beloved Character Actor, Dead at 94], Retrieved January 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Walken]] as a "speech maker", [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as "the confused guy", [[Fairuza Balk]] as a "moody [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl", [[Steve Buscemi]] as "a quirky, smart guy with a mind just outside of reality" and [[Forest Whitaker]] as a "calm, composed character with an edge and potential to explode".&lt;ref name=twsDigitalPolyphony/&gt; [[Ed Lauter]] usually portrayed a menacing figure because of his "long, angular face" which was easily recognized in public, although audiences rarely knew his name.&lt;ref name=twsUSAToday&gt;Associated Press, 17 October 2013, USA Today, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/10/16/veteran-character-actor-ed-lauter-dies/2997877/ Character actor Ed Lauter dies], Retrieved 7 August 2014, "...long, angular face and stern bearing made him an instantly recognizable figure.."&lt;/ref&gt; Character actors can play a variety of types, such as the [[femme fatale]], [[gunslinger]], [[sidekick]], [[town drunk]], [[villain]], [[Hooker with a heart of gold|whore with a heart of gold]], and many others. A character actor's roles are often perceived as being substantially different from their perceived real-life persona, meaning that they do not portray an extension of themselves, but rather a character substantially different from their off-screen persona.&lt;ref name=twsForeman/&gt; Character actors subsume themselves into the characters they portray, such that their off-screen acting persona is practically unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=twsForeman/&gt; According to one view, great character actors are rarely out of work, and often have long careers that span decades.&lt;ref name=twsForeman/&gt; They are also often highly regarded by fellow actors.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Klein, 20 October 1985, The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/20/nyregion/theater-a-leading-character-actor.html THEATER; A LEADING CHARACTER ACTOR], Retrieved 7 August 2014, "..consummate professional who evokes admiration and awe in his colleagues..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">'''Chopsocky''' (or '''chop-socky'''&lt;ref name=your /&gt;) is a [[colloquial]] term for [[martial arts movies]] and [[kung fu films]] made primarily in [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwan]] between the late 1960s and early 1980s. The term was coined by the American motion picture [[trade magazine]] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' following the explosion of films in the genre released in 1973 in the U.S. after the success of ''[[Five Fingers of Death]]''.&lt;ref name=your&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/chop-socky YourDictionary.com: "Chopsocky"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chopsocky"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Rage of Chop-Socky Films; Karate Breaks Out of Chinatown|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 9, 1974|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a play on [[chop suey]], combining "chop" (as in [[karate chop]] referring to a strike with the edge of the hand) and "sock" (as in a [[Punch (strike)|punch]]).

Chopsocky movies are usually characterized by over-blown story-lines, [[wiktionary:cheesy|cheesy]] special effects (particularly exaggerated and sometimes bizarre sound effects during the actual fight scenes), and excessive violence. The genre also is known for its clumsy [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]]. Although the term "chopsocky" is commonly used as a name of martial arts cinema by the general media, the word can be disparaging as well.  Another common meaning is a generalization for martial arts movies from Asia or Hong Kong in particular without necessarily having the negative connotation. ''Variety'' magazine, the originator of the term, defined "chopsocky" simply as a martial arts film with no negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=slanguage_result&amp;slang=chopsocky&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=Slanguage Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dead air''' is an unintended period of silence that interrupts a [[broadcasting|broadcast]] during which no audio or video program material is transmitted.&lt;ref name=OxfordDefn /&gt; 

== Radio and television==
Dead air occurs in [[radio broadcasting]] when no audio program is transmitted for an extended period of time, usually more than a few seconds. In [[television broadcasting]], the term denotes the absence of both audio and video program material. Technically, a [[carrier wave]] may be still be being transmitted; in radio, the result is silence, and in television, the result is a silent black image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modulation and Radio Building Blocks: How does modulation work?|url=http://www.taitradioacademy.com/topic/how-does-modulation-work-1-1/|website=Radio Academy|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Dead air|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, Eleventh Edition (online) |year=2015 |publisher= Merriam-Webster |location= Springfield, MA, USA |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dead+air |access-date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OxfordDefn&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Dead air|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries (online) |year=2015 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, OXF, GBR |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/dead-air?q=dead+air | access-date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although television directors may use the command "fade to black" or "to black" to indicate a momentary transition to a completely black image,&lt;ref name="Bognar2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Desi Bognar|title=International Dictionary of Broadcasting and Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aqk0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48|date=8 September 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-05401-3|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "dead air" is most often used in cases where program material comes to an unexpected halt, either through operator error or technical malfunction. Among professional broadcasters, dead air is considered one of the worst things that can occur.&lt;ref name="EastmanFerguson2014"&gt;{{citation|author1=Susan Tyler Eastman|author2=Douglas A. Ferguson|author3=Robert Klein|title=Media Promotion &amp; Marketing for Broadcasting, Cable &amp; the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5fcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|date=20 June 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-02482-5|pages=128–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, dead air could affect advertising revenue if it affects the airplay of paid commercials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term "dead air" does not refer to a broadcast transmitter that is intentionally shut down, i.e. "closed", "signed off" or "[[off the air]]", by a control operator.&lt;ref name="JonesLayer2013"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K9N1TVhf82YC&amp;pg=PA2007 National Association of Broadcasters Engineering Handbook: NAB Engineering Handbook]''. Taylor &amp; Francis; 26 April 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-136-03410-7}}. p. 2007–.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson2006"&gt;Harry Henderson.

Infobase Publishing; December 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5748-1}}. p. 84–.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast regulations==
In the US, dead air, if prolonged and occurring without permission, is an actionable offense that can result in fines from the [[FCC]].&lt;ref name="RBR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maryland radio station punished for silence |url=https://www.rbr.com/maryland-radio-station-punished-for-silence/ |website=Radio &amp; Television Business Report - January 2015 |publisher=Streamline RBR, Inc. |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast stations can use programmable devices known as "silence sensors", "off air alarms" or "silence monitors" that will sound an alarm and alert personnel if dead air persists more than a few seconds.&lt;ref name="Kern2008"&gt;Jonathan Kern. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UgCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA339 Sound Reporting: The NPR Guide to Audio Journalism and Production]''. University of Chicago Press; July 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-226-43178-9}}. p. 339–.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesLayer2013" /&gt;

==Examples==
On September 11, 1987, [[Dan Rather]] walked off the set of the [[CBS Evening News]] when a late running [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] tennis match threatened to delay the start of his news broadcast. The match then ended sooner than expected but Rather was gone. The network broadcast six minutes of dead air before Rather was found and returned to the studio.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyer|first1=Peter J.|title=Rather Walked Off Set of CBS News|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/nyregion/rather-walked-off-set-of-cbs-news.html|publisher=The New York Times|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS affiliates criticized Rather for the incident.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharbutt|first1=Jay|title=Rather Criticized For His Cbs News 'Walkout'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-15/entertainment/ca-8170_1_cbs-news-chief|website=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant case of dead air occurred during [[Super Bowl LII]] in 2018, when the [[NBC]] television broadcast experienced 26 seconds of dead air during a commercial break. The network blamed "a brief equipment failure",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/nfl/index.ssf/2018/02/super_bowl_2018_dead_air_5_million_mistake.html|title=Super Bowl 2018: And the most talked-about commercial is ... dead air|last=Campuzano|first=Eder|work=Oregon Live|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that no commercial advertising was lost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/04/media/nbc-brief-blackout-super-bowl/index.html|title=NBC blames 'equipment failure' for brief blackout during Super Bowl|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[Super Bowl XLV]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] radio station [[WKZG|WCHK-FM]] announced that it would intentionally go to dead air during the game, since the hometown [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] were playing in the game.&lt;ref name="ChuckFM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/green-bay-packers-fan-chuck-fm-will-play-nothing-during-the-game-sunday| title=Green Bay Packers fan "Chuck FM" will play "nothing during the game" Sunday | last= | first= | work= | publisher=Radio-Info.com | date=2011-02-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108095953/http://www.radio-info.com/news/green-bay-packers-fan-chuck-fm-will-play-nothing-during-the-game-sunday | archivedate=2012-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Virgin Radio]] host [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]] did not arrive for work on time resulting in Vanessa Feltz filling in for 30 minutes until Evans took the microphone, ''The Guardian'' characterized it as a promotional stunt that forced Feltz "to fill the dead air with jokes".&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Evans 'buying a new alarm clock' after tardy arrival for Radio 2 show|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/jan/21/chris-evans-late-bbc-radio-2-show|website=The Guardian|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donghuamen Night Market''' was a [[night market]] located in the northern end of [[Wangfujing]] in [[Beijing]], China.  Dong Hua Men is written 东华门, the name of the East Gate of the Forbidden City.

==Description==
One can find a row of unusual food stalls. An array of [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food]] delicacies are on display with people bustling around to experience some new tastes. Items such as sheep's particular parts, offal soup, [[Deep frying|deep fried]] crickets, centipedes, silk worms, scorpions and lizards are available to eat on a stick. There are also the more widely recognised Western foods such as [[spring roll]]s, [[dumplings]], [[crab cakes]] and candy fruit. All stalls display their food selections in both Chinese (Mandarin) and English. The food was displayed raw and can be deep fried in a large Wok upon request.

==Closure==
Due to hygiene and noise complaints, the Donghuamen market closed on 24 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=11660489|title=Infamous Beijing bug market to close|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Elastic Heart'''" is a song by Australian singer [[Sia Furler|Sia]], featuring Canadian singer [[The Weeknd]] and American record producer [[Diplo]], taken from [[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the soundtrack]] for the 2013 American film ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]''. [[Djemba Djemba|Andrew Swanson]] assisted the artists in writing the song, with production handled by Diplo and American producer [[Greg Kurstin]]. It was released on 1 October 2013 as a [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Catching Fire'' by [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Republic Records|Republic]] and [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. "Elastic Heart" peaked at number 7 on the [[Record chart|singles chart]] of New Zealand and was [[List of music recording certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Recorded Music NZ]]. It also appeared on the charts of Australia, Belgium, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

In 2014, Sia re-recorded a solo version of "Elastic Heart" for her sixth studio album ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]''. The solo version was released in 2015 as a single from the album and was accompanied by a controversial [[music video]] that features actor [[Shia LaBeouf]] and dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. The clip was the eighth most viewed YouTube music video in 2015, while the single peaked within the top 10 in Australia and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in the United States.

====Controversy====
The video "courted controversy and plaudits in equal measure", with some commentators perceiving it to have [[pedophilia|pedophilic]] undertones because it features an adult and child dancing together clad only in beige dancewear.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Siobhan. [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/ballet-fitness-why-growing-numbers-are-using-plis-and-pirouettes-to-work-out-10386434.html "Ballet fitness: Why growing numbers are using pliés and pirouettes to work out"], ''The Independent'', July 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/11/sia-video-pop-music-not-paedophilia?CMP=soc_567 "Sia's video: let's be wary of seeing paedophilia everywhere"], ''[[Guardian Australia]]'', January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sia explained that the two dancers represented "warring 'Sia' self states," but she apologized on Twitter to anyone who was upset by the video:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://gma.yahoo.com/sia-apologizes-pedophilia-perception-music-video-133650931--abc-news-music.html |title=Sia Apologizes for ‘Pedophilia’ Perception in Music Video |publisher=Yahoo! |date=January 9, 2015 |accessdate= March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ranscombe, Siân.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I anticipated some "pedophelia!!!" Cries for this video. All I can say is Maddie and Shia are two of the only actors I felt could play, these two warring 'Sia' self states. I apologize to those who feel triggered by "Elastic Heart".

[[File:Harry Stradling-Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Audrey Hepburn]] as Eliza Doolittle on the set of the 1964 movie musical ''My Fair Lady.'']]
'''Eliza Doolittle''' is a fictional character from [[London]] who appears in the play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' ([[George Bernard Shaw]], 1912) and the musical version of that play, ''[[My Fair Lady]]''.

Eliza is a [[Cockney]] flower girl, who comes to Professor Henry Higgins asking for [[elocution]] lessons, after a chance encounter at [[Covent Garden]]. Higgins goes along with it for the purposes of a wager: That he can turn her into the toast of elite London society. Her Cockney dialect includes words that are common among working class Londoners, such as [[ain't]]; "I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman" said Doolittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Pygmalion/Act_I|title=Pygmalion/Act I|first=George Bernard|last=Shaw|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doolittle receives voice coaching and learns the rules of [[etiquette]]. The outcome of these attentions varies between the original play and the various adaptations (see ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' article).

==History==

The part of Eliza was originally played by [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], at that time the most famous actress on London's [[West End theatre|West End]] stage. Shaw had written the role for her, and although many considered her too old for the role she triumphed.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Richard (1969). The Truth About Pygmalion. p. 20-27. Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; The unprecedented use of the word "bloody" - as a scripted intensive - caused a sensation when Campbell delivered it.

For the 1938 film ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]'', George Bernard Shaw personally requested the young English actress [[Wendy Hiller]] play Doolittle, a part she had previously played on stage opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as Higgins.  Her performance served as the definitive film portrayal until [[Audrey Hepburn]] played the role in the highly successful 1964 film musical ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''.

[[Julie Andrews]] originated the musical version of Doolittle on stage in ''My Fair Lady'', with [[Rex Harrison]] as Higgins. [[Sally Ann Howes]] took the role of Eliza Doolittle in 1958 when Julie Andrews left. Harrison went on to reprise his role in the 1964 film alongside Audrey Hepburn as Doolittle. At the [[37th Academy Awards]], the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] went to Andrews for her performance as [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]]. Hepburn was not nominated. Despite this, many critics greatly applauded Hepburn's "exquisite" performance.&lt;ref name=telegraphob&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5894883/Audrey-Hepburn.html Audrey Hepburn Obituary]. Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; "The happiest thing about [''My Fair Lady'']", wrote Bosley Crowther, "is that Audrey Hepburn superbly justifies the decision of [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] to get her to play the title role."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9401E6DA1E3FEE32A25751C2A9669D946591D6CF "My Fair Lady (1964) Screen: Lots of Chocolates for Miss Eliza Doolittle:'My Fair Lady' Bows at the Criterion"]. NY Times&lt;/ref&gt; Her co-star Rex Harrison,  also called Hepburn his favourite leading lady and Gene Ringgold of ''Soundstage'' also commented that "Audrey Hepburn is magnificent. She is Eliza for the ages,"&lt;ref name="soundstage"&gt;Ringgold, Gene. "My Fair Lady – the finest of them all!", ''Soundstage'', December 1964&lt;/ref&gt; while adding, "Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice."&lt;ref name="soundstage"/&gt;

[[Martine McCutcheon]] played the role in the 2001 London revival of ''My Fair Lady''. Despite missing many performances (citing health problems), having to have various understudies perform the role and withdrawing nearly five months early from the production's transfer to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], she won the award for best actress in a musical at the 2002 [[Laurence Olivier Awards]]. One of the understudies was then-unknown "First Lady of the West End" [[Kerry Ellis]].

[[Lauren Ambrose]] is currently playing the role in the 2018 [[Lincoln Center Theater]] revival of ''My Fair Lady'' on Broadway, a performance for which she was nominated for the 2018 [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] and won the 2018 [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Kirsten Anderson has been Ambrose's alternate, performing the role once a week. [[Laura Benanti]] will replace Ambrose in October 2018 to perform the role through February 2019.

==Eliza Doolittle Day==

A song from ''My Fair Lady'', titled "Just You Wait", sung by Eliza, includes this passage:

''One day I’ll be famous! I’ll be proper and prim;'' &lt;br&gt;
''Go to St. James so often I will call it St. Jim!''&lt;br&gt;
''One evening the king will say:'' &lt;br&gt;
''‘Oh, Liza, old thing,'' &lt;br&gt;
''I want all of England your praises to sing.''&lt;br&gt;
''Next week on the twentieth of May'' &lt;br&gt;
''I proclaim ‘Liza Doolittle Day!'' &lt;ref name="justyouwaitlyric"&gt;[https://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/myfairlady/justyouwait.htm Just You Wait lyrics] from My Fair Lady&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of ''My Fair Lady'' have ever after been fond of making an informal observance of Eliza Doolittle Day each May twentieth.&lt;ref name="elizadday"&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/article/happy-liza-doolittle-day-com-191217 PlayBill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elizadday2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127010097 NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elizadday3"&gt;[https://www.onthisday.com/articles/my-fair-ladys-special-day On This Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Erfworld'' follows a [[graphic novel]] format, with a new page added with each update. The setting is ''Erfworld'', a fantasy world that adheres to the rules of a fictional [[turn-based strategy]] wargame. The narrative focuses on a complex story about warring factions within this world, but most installments also contain humor, puns, and side-gags about strategy-fantasy [[video games]], [[role-playing game]]s, and references to history or [[popular culture]]. The webcomic's distinctive visual style counters the theme of unending violence with a twee, [[kawaii]] artistic sensibility (described by the creators as "cute"&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/about/nextgen/internedition/spring08/blog/?p=961 |title=NPR - Intern Edition » Blog Archive » An Award-Winning Graphic Novel… On the Web |accessdate=2009-11-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412105445/http://www.npr.org/about/nextgen/internedition/spring08/blog/?p=961|archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in which characters are drawn to look like dolls, or anime characters, or toys. Injuries draw no blood in Erfworld, and damage is cured overnight. That same charming aesthetic follows in its lisping use of letter changes in frequently used names, particularly replacing "r" with "w" (spidews, dwagons, and twolls instead of spiders, dragons, and trolls).  The comic was originally started as an attempt to bring all of author Rob Balder's fantasy-related strips from his other comic, [[PartiallyClips]], into the same universe and tell a story with them.&lt;ref name=PC1610&gt;Balder, R; [http://www.partiallyclips.com/index.php?id=1610&amp;c=1#commentary Swordsman: Commentary], ''PartiallyClips'', 06-02-2009, Retrieved June 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot synopsis==
''Erfworld's'' premise is that overlord Stanley the Plaid is conducting a military campaign to quest for the Arkentools - artifacts of ancient power left behind by the Titans who created the Erfworld. Stanley controls one of these tools, the Arkenhammer, but his quest for the others seems to have been costly and unsuccessful; the story opens as his final living warlord is killed in battle. Stanley's chief adviser, Wanda Firebaugh, convinces him to purchase a "Summon Perfect Warlord" spell as a final attempt to prevent defeat. The spell summons Earth gamer Parson Gotti (whose name is an [[anagram]] for "[[Protagonist]]") into Erfworld, where he is to serve as chief warlord under Stanley.

Meanwhile, Prince Ansom of Jetstone is leading a massive coalition toward Stanley's capital, Gobwin Knob, hoping to destroy Stanley's side forever. Ansom's coalition has many members, but most prominent in the story are Jetstone (Ansom's kingdom), the forces of Transylvito (a [[vampire]]-like people) and Archons (hovering female fighters) he has hired from Charlie, a powerful overlord and [[mercenary]].

Early in the comic, one of Ansom's officers, Jillian Zamussels, flies on a scouting mission, but is captured by Stanley's forces and taken to Gobwin Knob. Wanda interrogates Jillian and, having gained magical or emotional control of her, releases her to become an unwitting double agent. During this time, Parson has been learning the battle mechanics of Erfworld and has planned an attack on Ansom's coalition. He sends a force of dwagons to make hit-and-run raids on the coalition's siege units, then draws Ansom into various traps as the coalition pursues the wounded dwagons. Jillian eventually locates the dwagons but is unwilling to attack because she is under Wanda's mind-control spell. Wanda's spell ultimately fails, however, and Jillian leads an attack that destroys the dwagons. Stanley is enraged about Parson and Wanda's unsuccessful plans and decides to take his last stand back into his own hands. He takes the surviving dwagons, then departs his capital to start his side afresh on the uninhabited site of another capital he sacked some years ago. Stanley's departure is a major turning point in the story, as these events leave Parson in sole command of the limited forces remaining at Gobwin Knob, which he must rally in a final stand against Ansom's much larger coalition.

Parson quickly puts some defensive plans into action. Parson contacts Charlie, and asks him to switch sides; Charlie declines but agrees to sit the fight out. Also, as Ansom's forces scout the mining tunnels under Gobwin Knob to find weak points, Parson orders Sizemore, Stanley's dirtamancer, to ignore all but the scouts closest to the city, but to strike those with overwhelming force. This ploy tricks Ansom into thinking he has found an unguarded route to the main city garrison.

Meanwhile, Ansom has dispatched a force of air units, led by Jillian, to hunt down Stanley. They eventually rendezvous with forces from Transylvito (but without Charlie's promised Archons) and head Stanley off at a narrow pass. When Stanley and his flight of dwagons arrive at this choke point, an intense fight ensues, leaving him with heavy losses. Stanley escapes under a veil cast by his foolamancer and heads back toward Gobwin knob.

While Stanley is still away, the final battle for Gobwin Knob begins in earnest. Ansom first sends a large force of Jetstone units into the tunnels beneath the city, which are all destroyed by hidden traps and forces. Wanda animates the fallen enemies into an army of uncroaked soldiers, which Parson uses to protect the outer walls of Gobwin Knob. Ansom fails to breach the well-protected outer walls until he re-enlists Charlie's help at a high cost. Once the wall is breached, Ansom pours his units into the city and does a ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''-style dance led by Charlie's Archons, which gives his forces a massive bonus and leads them to victory.

Parson does not admit defeat though, and uses a [[perfidy|perfidious]] false surrender offer as a ruse to [[assassinate]] Ansom. Parson's twoll lackey Bogroll tackles Ansom from the parapet and both fall to their deaths. Parson then collapses his own city, killing most coalition forces within the walls, but even this leaves too many enemy units alive. Parson retreats with the casters into the isolated portal room to plan the desperate final attack that will be the story's climax. Gobwin Knob is built atop an extinct [[volcano]], so Parson orders the casters to make it erupt. The casters use magic to link the minds of Wanda the Croakamancer and Sizemore the Dirtmancer, so that with their combined skill they can uncroak the volcano.

Parson and the casters flee though a portal to escape the resulting eruption, and return to find a ruin. The coalition is erased and the terrain itself changed. Sizemore shows Parson that he has discovered a fortune in [[gemstone]]s exposed by the volcano, while Wanda finds the Arkenpliers (Ansom's former arkentool) and attunes to them. With the power of the Arkenpliers, Wanda is able to permanently reanimate dead units to their original strength. She uses them to "decrypt" the late Prince Ansom and most of the other fallen coalition forces as powerful new allies.

The first book concludes as Parson (also known as Lord Hamster) asks Maggie, Gobwin Knob's thinkamancer, to what extent his actions are his own doing, and to what extent they were forced by magical loyalty. She tells Parson he is himself mostly responsible for the death and desolation around him. Parson appears to be both disgusted with the actions he had to take, and also empowered by learning that he has control over his own destiny. He walks away and speaks angrily to the "Erfworld". He ends his monologue by shouting "I won't be a gamepiece. I'm a Player. Fuck You!!", apparently breaking the Erfworld's "censorship", and throws his sword into the lava, where it melts.

In the aftermath of this battle, Gobwin Knob is rebuilt. Wanda and Ansom lead the decrypted army on a campaign to conquer the world and convert all to the belief that attunement to the Arkentools, not royal origin, is the true source of divinely ordained rule. Book Two begins as this army confronts the forces of Jetstone, after the off-screen destruction of their ally Unaroyal. The decrypted Ansom attempts to persuade his still-living brothers to accept Toolism. They refuse, and a battle breaks out in which Ansom's brother Ossomer is captured. Ansom then makes another attempt to persuade him, only to watch Wanda order Ossomer cut down so she can decrypt him. The army then marches on Jetstone's capital city with intent to take the city, which according to the rules of Erfworld ends the side and causes the remaining cities to become "neutral." Wanda and Parson agree that they almost certainly have the forces to win, but then Charlie uses the Arkendish (which he controls) to intervene in the battle by ending Stanley's turn.

==Characters==

===Parson Gotti===

Also known as Lord Hamster, Parson serves as Chief Warlord or warlord of the side Gobwin Knob throughout the story, and as its protagonist, whisked away from Earth to Erfworld at the beginning of the first book.&lt;ref name="overlookreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcomicoverlook.com/2008/08/20/the-webcomic-overlook-52-erfworld/ |title=The Webcomic Overlook #52: Erfworld " The Webcomic Overlook |accessdate=2009-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is an anagram of "Protagonist".

Prior to the story, Parson is depicted as having been the author of the webcomic [http://www.hamstard.com Hamstard]&lt;ref name=erf0014&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0014.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;14)]&lt;/ref&gt; (actually created by the authors of Erfworld as a meta-background for Parson's character and as an [[easter egg (media)|"easter egg"]]). He spent months at a time designing strategy games for his own amusement as an escape from an unsatisfying job and life.&lt;ref name=erf0016/&gt;

Parson questions whether Erfworld is real or just a coma dream of his, if his actions truly are his own (the summoning is supposed to put him under Stanley's command) and the ethics of his situation (his actions makes him responsible for thousands of deaths and he is serving what appears to be the evil side). Still, he chooses to tentatively accept the reality of the situation and the role he has been given. Parson is large by Erfworld standards (and fat by real-world standards), standing roughly twice as tall as Wanda Firebaugh.&lt;ref name=erf0020/&gt; He does not conform to all the rules of the universe (for example, he doesn't have visible "stats" like the in-world characters). Janice has said that he is a Hippiemancer; whether this is true or not is unknown.

===Stanley the Tool===

Overlord of the side "Gobwin Knob" and of the nearly lost Plaid tribe.&lt;ref name=erfcast&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erfcast.html Erfworld cast of characters], GiantITP. Retrieved June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley serves as the superior of the protagonist throughout the story so far, with whom he is initially at odds.&lt;ref name="overlookreview"/&gt;

Originally known as Stanley the Plaid, he started off as a piker unit under King Saline IV and eventually rose to the position of warlord.&lt;ref name=erf0087&gt;Per Sizemore's narration of past events. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0087.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;79)]&lt;/ref&gt; During his service, he came to possess the Arkenhammer, a mysterious tool of divine origin, setting himself apart as a warlord, and later, ruler.&lt;ref name=erf0004&gt;'''Wanda:''' You're using the Arkenhammer to crack walnuts? / '''Stanley:''' Yeah. / '''Wanda:''' But it's ''divine''. A tool of the Titans. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0004.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;4)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toyhammer&gt;Supercoolstuff.com; Squeaky Hammer - #NV680 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20041225030750/http://www.supercoolstuff.com/items/misc/nv680.htm Internet Archive link])&lt;/ref&gt; King Saline IV later paid to have Stanley promoted to Heir Designate.&lt;ref name=erf0087/&gt;  Thus, when King Saline IV was killed in an attack while Stanley was away, Stanley and his side were not dissolved and retook the city.&lt;ref name=erf0087/&gt;

At the time of the story, Lord Stanley is involved in an ongoing war in an effort to find the other Arkentools, believing it is the will of the Titans he control them. At the beginning of the first book, this war has reduced his realm from eleven cities to only Gobwin Knob itself.&lt;ref name=erf0005&gt;'''Wanda:''' Since you began questing for the Arkentools we have not won a battle. We once held 11&amp;nbsp;cities. Now, we hold only the capital. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0005.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;5)]&lt;/ref&gt; He had Wanda summon "the perfect warlord" in an attempt to win the battle for Gobwin Knob, which yielded Parson Gotti.&lt;ref name=erf0016&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0016.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;16)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erf0017&gt;'''Wanda:''' I thought we agreed I was looking for the perfect military mind. [...] / '''Stanley:''' I want that too! Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0017.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;17)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Stanley's first meeting with Parson, Parson convinced him that "[[tool (insult)|tool]]" was a term of honor. Drawing a connection between this title and his search for the Arkentools, Stanley declared that he should henceforth be addressed as "Tool".&lt;ref name=erf0020&gt;'''Stanley:''' I have a higher calling! I am a Tool! / '''Wanda:''' I see, Lord. / '''Stanley:''' ''Not'' Lord. Tool. From now on, everyone addresses me as "Tool!" Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0020.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;20)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanley objects strongly to being called a "bad guy,"&lt;ref name=erf0031&gt;'''Parson:''' [...] I always did like playing the bad guys, which we obviously are. [...] / '''Stanley:''' (menacingly) I'm curious, Hamster... What makes you think we're the "bad guys?" Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0031.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;31)]&lt;/ref&gt; and considers himself to be divinely favored by the Titans.&lt;ref name=erf0032&gt;'''Stanley:''' The Titans left [The Arkenhammer] here for a ''reason''. It chose ''me'' for a divine ''reason.'' Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0032.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;32)]&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley's underlings often suffer from his unchecked ego and limited patience, as well as his limited intelligence. His name (and newly assumed title) is a play on [[Stanley Tools]].

===Wanda Firebaugh===

Chief [[Necromancy|Croakamancer]] serving Lord Stanley, and a member of the lost Croatan tribe. Wanda is the second named character to appear in the first book.&lt;ref name=erf0002&gt;'''Narrator:''' [...] And that made a bad day considerably worse...for Lord Stanley's Chief Croakamancer: Wanda Firebaugh. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0002.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Her name is a play on "wand of fireball."

She is a patient and skilled manager,&lt;ref name=erfcast/&gt; though she is ruthless in battle and not above using seduction as a means of manipulating others.&lt;ref name=erf0054&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0054.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;54)]&lt;/ref&gt; She is skilled at many types of magic, but has stated that only Croakamancy (which she uses to animate fighters "croaked" in battle as [[undead|"uncroaked"]]&lt;ref name=erf0027&gt;'''Stanley:''' Uncroaked. They each fell in battle and Wanda... whatchacallit... / '''Parson:''' Animated them? / '''Stanley:''' Animated them. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0027.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;27)]&lt;/ref&gt;) holds any interest for her.&lt;ref name=erf0013&gt;'''Sizemore:''' [...] I'm good at nothing beyond my specialty. But I do love to study everything. / '''Wanda:''' [...] I can manage quite a number of magicks outside Croakamancy, but I have little interest in them. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0013.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;13)]&lt;/ref&gt; She has demonstrated some ability with Hat Magic, Dollamancy, and Thinkamancy (which are all Fate magics).  By the end of book one, she controls the Arkenpliers, an Arkentool that allows her to perform feats of croakamancy that are normally impossible, such as raising corpses to create lifelike intelligent "decrypted" units.

===Prince Ansom===

During the first book, Prince Ansom serves as Chief Warlord to King Slately of the Jetstone&lt;ref name=erfcast/&gt; and the leader of the Royal Crown Coalition fighting against Stanley, and the primary antagonist.&lt;ref name=erf0021&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0021.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;21)]&lt;/ref&gt; His name is a play on "handsome" (cf. [[Prince Charming]]), while his initial outfit resembled the costume worn by [[Evel Knievel]].

He was a skilled leader, warrior, and tactician but lacked modesty and was prone to reckless behavior when his pride was at stake. His crest was a [[radish]]. He carried the Arkenpliers, though he was not attuned to them, and thus could not use their full abilities.&lt;ref name=erf0022&gt;'''Ansom:''' I wield the Arkenpliers. But I am not attuned to them, as Stanley is to his artifact. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0022.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;22)]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a history of personally riding to Jillian's rescue,&lt;ref name=erf0045&gt;'''Wanda:''' [...] "Ansom, with his long history of personally riding to [Jillian's] rescue, flies his air units out to escort her back to the column." Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0045 ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;45)]&lt;/ref&gt; and Wanda believes he was in love with her.&lt;ref name=erf0043&gt;'''Wanda:''' I know [Ansom's] entire battle plan. [...] As for his weaknesses, he is in love with our prisoner. And I control her mind. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0043.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;43)]&lt;/ref&gt; While he apparently looked down on those not of royal or noble houses—Vinny correctly guessed that he despised Stanley not so much for his attacks on other peoples as for the fact he came to rule by [[regicide]]—he did, according to Jillian, honestly believe in the concept of [[noblesse oblige]], and as a result often put himself in unnecessary danger to protect his troops.

He was croaked by Bogroll and decrypted (improved uncroaking) by Wanda at the end of the first book,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0145.html&lt;/ref&gt; and serves Gobwin Knob as Chief Warlord at the start of the second,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfworld.com/book-2-archive/?px=%2F2009-10-31.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; prior to his capture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfworld.com/book-2-archive/?px=%2F2010-04-21.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jillian Zamussels===

A female barbarian and warlord, fighting for the army of Prince Ansom. She has been known to engage in combat even when directed to avoid it.&lt;ref name=erf0009&gt;'''Ansom:''' AVOID any engagements if you can! / '''Jillian:''' Oh, I am.

She chats casually with Wanda after being tortured and interrogated by her,&lt;ref name=erf0036&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0036.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;36)]&lt;/ref&gt; but later suddenly breaks down and collapses. It is revealed that Wanda is able to influence her feelings and thoughts.&lt;ref name=erf0039&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0039.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;39)]&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated that she was originally the heir of the kingdom of Faq, an isolated and peaceful Utopian kingdom visually modeled after Japanese feudal society, and the daughter of King Banhammer, a philosopher-king who disliked his heir for her violent and aggressive ways.&lt;ref name=erf0082&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0091.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;82)]&lt;/ref&gt; Her name is an approximation of "jillions of muscles." During the intermission between books 1 and 2, she restores Faq with herself as queen, with assistance from Transylvito.

===Sizemore Rockwell===

A Dirtamancer in the army of Gobwin Knob and one of the few remaining members of the Plaid Tribe.&lt;ref name=erfcast/&gt; In the beginning of the first book, he helped Parson learn how magic works in Erfworld.&lt;ref name=erf0040&gt;'''Klog:''' Sizemore and I have been talking magic theory. [...] He's about as knowledgable a guy as I could want for a teacher. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0040.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (Parson's Klog&amp;nbsp;#2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is very curious and loves to study all types of magic, but is unskilled in any beyond his specialty,&lt;ref name=erf0013/&gt; and knows little about military matters.&lt;ref name=erf0044&gt;'''Klog:''' It's harder to get information about this stuff that it was about magic. Sizemore barely knows the basics. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0044.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (Parson's Klog&amp;nbsp;#4)]&lt;/ref&gt; When forced into combat as the battle reaches Gobwin Knob itself, he is very regretful about taking lives, but reluctantly accepts it as his duty to do so.

===Bogroll===

A [[cyclops|one-eyed]] twoll who served as a guardsman in Gobwin Knob and lackey to Parson.&lt;ref name=erf0029&gt;'''Bogroll:''' My Lords! I am reporting as Lackey retainer to Lord Hamster, by the order of my Lady Firebaugh. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0029.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;29)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was loyal and typically good-natured, although a frequent target of the other guardsmen's pranks.&lt;ref name=erf0028&gt;'''Bogroll''': Mung, why do the other henchmen pick on me? / '''Mung''': Because it's fun. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0028.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;28)]&lt;/ref&gt; Bogroll was croaked by Coalition forces, having sacrificed himself in a [[kamikaze]] attack on Ansom, and cannot be decrypted due to the grievous harm inflicted on his body. Bogroll was a character in the [[PartiallyClips]] strip,&lt;ref&gt;Balder, R; [http://www.partiallyclips.com/index.php?id=1009 Bogroll the Cyclops], ''PartiallyClips'', 09-08-2002. Retrieved June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only crossover between PartiallyClips and Erfworld. His name is a British English colloquialism for [[toilet paper]].

===Vinny Doombats===

A [[count]] of the Transylvito tribe who fights for the Royal Crown Coalition. Like other Transylvitans, Vinny has the appearance of a [[vampire]], though sunlight apparently does not harm him. Vinny seems to be a close advisor and friend of Prince Ansom, to whom he has few qualms about speaking frankly. He has confronted Ansom with his opinion that Stanley's commoner origins, not his military aggressions against several coalition members, are at the root of Ansom's antipathy toward Stanley, while assuring Ansom that this issue would not affect his personal loyalty.&lt;ref name=erf0034&gt;'''Vinny:''' You know I gotcher back no matter what. But what I can't figure out is, why are you leading this fight? [...] / '''Ansom:''' Can't it just be that I want to end a great evil? / '''Vinny:''' It could be. [...] But your beef is he's not royal, right? Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0034.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;34)]&lt;/ref&gt; As his name implies, he controls the coalition's bat scouting units. His name is a reference to Vinny Boombatz, a fictional character created by stand-up comedian [[Rodney Dangerfield]].

===Maggie===

A Thinkamancer in the employ of Gobwin Knob. She is very skilled in her specialty and amoral in its application. She can send thinkagrams (telepathic messages) and link multiple casters together to combine their powers. She controlled a link with the Foolamancer Jack Snipe and the Lookamancer Misty, then later a link with the Croakamancer Wanda and the Dirtmancer Sizemore. When she broke the first link, she protected herself from the backlash at the expense of the other two. Parson planned to punish her by explicitly ordering her to break the second link and protect Wanda and Sizemore. She would probably have died from the backlash while doing so, but Parson decided against it at the last moment. She bears a passing physical resemblance to [[Margaret Thatcher]].

===Charlie===

The Overlord of Charlescomm. Charlie has consistently remained offscreen, interacting with other characters via remote communication.  The character of Charlie, his archons, and his penchant for mystery are likely drawn from the titular character of the 1970s television series [[Charlie's Angels]]. However, his Eyebook handle, CharlsNChrg, refers to the 80s TV show, [[Charles in Charge]].

Charlie was first contracted by Prince Ansom during the first book to supply a group of Archons to reinforce the expedition sent to rescue Jillian Zamussels. Later, after Ansom broke off the alliance in the expectation that Charlie would make a new alliance with Transylvito, Charlie instead took advantage of his release from his contract to begin dealing with Parson. Charlie shows no real commitment to either side, but does value his reputation as a mercenary who "stays bought".

===Prince Ossomer===

Prince Ansom's brother and chief warlord of Jetstone after the Battle for Gobwin Knob.  He was captured by Wanda and then killed and 'popped again'; executed and resurrected by the Arkenpliers.  However, he appears to have broken the loyalty to the pliers and became a Jetsone unit again.  His name is an approximation of "awesomer".

===Arkentools===
Four Arkentools have appeared in the comic so far, but only three have been drawn.

====Arkenhammer====

A hammer resembling a toy [[croquet]] mallet. Owned by and attuned to Stanley the Plaid/Tool, the Arkenhammer has the power to control dwagons, glow brightly, levitate itself and its wielder, generate multiple lightning bolts, "rock out" (play heavy rock music to the benefit of combat units) turn approximately 20 percent of walnuts cracked with it into [[Columbidae|pigeons]] and turn some bird-like units into walnuts.&lt;ref name=erf0126&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0126.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page 126)]&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley claims the Arkenhammer has chosen him for divine reasons, and uses this, and Wanda's beckoning, as rationale for his quest to obtain the other tools.

====Arkenpliers====

A sword-sized pair of [[needle-nose pliers]]. Previously owned by but not attuned to Prince Ansom, they served as a close combat weapon and had the power in his hands to "turn most Uncroaked to dust".  Stanley believed that Ansom's attack on Gobwin Knob was divinely directed to bring the Arkenpliers to him. Seen in the hands of the Unaroyal Warlord Lady Sylvia Lazarus of the Coalition immediately prior to a volcanic eruption, the Arkenpliers were recovered by Wanda from the aftermath of the explosion, and have attuned to her. They give Wanda the ability to "decrypt" corpses, restoring them to life (or at least a close approximation thereof) with nearly intact intellect, memories, and abilities - though their loyalty is to the Croakamancer that raised them rather than their previous side.  Wanda can also decrypt units that normally can not be uncroaked.  These abilities are unparalleled in the discipline of Croakamancy.

====Arkendish====

An object resembling a satellite dish. Owned by and attuned to Charlie, it gives him a mastery of Thinkamancy, allowing him to hack into Stanley's communications systems and communicate with Parson via his Eyebook. Parson uses the fact that Charlie is not a Royal but still attuned to it to further provoke Ansom. Parson later learns from Wanda's Decrypted Archons that the Arkendish grants Charlie many additional abilities, some of which are unknown even to them: he can handle an unlimited number of Thinkagrams, and extend some of his abilities to his personal guard of Archons. With the dish, Thinkamancer links can exist over distances, and appear to be able to be broken with little repercussion.  Any commander in the world is able to contact those Archons by concentrating hard enough and long enough - this allows Charlie to contact and hire out to any side in the world. The Arkendish may also be the reason Charlie can produce Archon units.

====Arkenshoes====

A pair of red slippers, they give an attuned wearer unlimited move. The other mentioned ability is that they can send their wearer "home", depending on what home means to the one wearing them. As Overlady Judy's use of them in Book 0 has shown, can send you to a place where the concept of ruler does not apply (as that position was passed to Dame Branch)

==The World==

===Game rules===
The laws of nature governing Erfworld are similar to the rules of a [[turn-based game|turn-based]] strategy game.  Forces are divided into "sides" each of which is controlled by an overlord or monarch; overlords and monarchs have powers over their units that are similar to those of a player in a strategy game.

====Turns and movement====
Battle takes place in turns; each side is able only to attack on its own turn, and no turns occur during the night. Each unit (a term that encompasses both various creatures and sapient beings) has a certain amount of "Move," which governs the maximum distance it may travel during its side's turn. Thus, units may only travel to other locations during their turn, but at other times, they may move around within the bounds of the hexagonal region, or "hex," where they ended up after their own turn.

====Units and stats====
All people in Erfworld appear fully formed as adults.  Any side is able to "pop" new units each turn at each of its city sites.  Units can learn new skills and gain promotion at a cost of time and money, or these abilities and ranks can simply be "popped" along with the unit.  Each unit has an "upkeep" cost, paid by the overlord of its side out of the treasury. At the start of their side's turn, each unit receives rations, heals back to full health, and experiences minor maintenance such as personal cleanup.

Units have various battle stats associated with them.  Each has a "level" as would a unit in a strategy game.  Level determines power in battle and increases with successive victories.  Certain units can also offer bonuses (temporary boosts in level) to the forces they are leading; warlords give a bonus to the troops they lead, as do certain casters.  One of the stranger bonuses available is "dance fighting," a bonus earned by dancing while fighting.

====Boop====
One of the more unusual features of the Erfworld universe is that it appears to be censored.  When Parson is summoned to the world, he discovers almost immediately that whenever he attempts to use a word that could be considered a [[profanity]] it comes out as "Boop". Parson's reaction shows that this is an in-universe mechanic.&lt;ref name=erf0018&gt;Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0018.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;18)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The natives of Erfworld apparently understand that the word represents profanity, but it is unclear whether they understand each boop as the word Parson had intended to use. Sizemore and Wanda are the only characters to have responded appropriately to a word that was "booped out," but it is possible they determine the word's meaning from the context.&lt;ref name=erf0035&gt;'''Sizemore:''' This...is called a "[[chamber pot]]." / '''Parson:''' Magic item? / '''Sizemore:''' You wish. / '''Parson:''' Boop. / '''Sizemore:''' Exactly! Balder, R; Noguchi, J; [http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0035.html ''Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob'' (page&amp;nbsp;35)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one notable exception to the general censorship.  "Crap" has been used by the natives of Erfworld, both before and after Parson is summoned there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0006.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 6 (Lady Firebraugh)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0013.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 13 (Sizemore)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0105.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 95 (Jillian Zamessels)]&lt;/ref&gt; Only Jillian Zamussels' use of the word has been other than literal, though the earliest use by Lady Firebaugh could have been taken as both a literal observation and a curse word. Artist Jamie Noguchi has stated that he does not believe the word "crap" to be profanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2262172&amp;postcount=3 Post in Erfworld forums by Jamie Noguchi.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second night after Stanley the Tool leaves Gobwin Knob, Parson overhears the Gobwin troops singing drinking songs which work around the restriction by alluding to—rather than explicitly describing—deficiencies in manhood among the Jetstone and Transylvito factions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0113.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 101]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he is surprised to learn that Erfworlders can use the word "testes".  Other characters seem to have figured out their own loopholes; for example, one of Ansom's allies remarks that "the Sofa King is Sofa-King finished here" on page 117.

Artist Jamie Noguchi once stated that Boop was originally supposed to be "meep".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1856008&amp;postcount=2 Post in Erfworld forums by Jamie Noguchi.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final page of book one, in an act of defiance and anger Parson yells an uncensored "Fuck you!!" directed at Erfworld itself. Since then, none of Parson's swearing has been censored by Erfworld. The authors explained&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showsinglepost.php?p=6143096&amp;postcount=13 Post in Erfworld forums]&lt;/ref&gt; the page as pointing up the difference between censoring words (harming nobody) while simultaneously depicting or glorifying acts of mass violence (harming many).

===Magic===
Magic can be performed in Erfworld by units called casters. Each caster has a specialty in one of twenty-four magical disciplines, but can theoretically cast in any discipline. These specialties can be combined by mentally linking casters together using the magical discipline of "thinkamancy"- a process that increases magical power but sometimes harms the casters involved when their link is broken.

It is explained in the second Parson's Klog,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0040.html&lt;/ref&gt; that three fundamental elements (Life, Motion, and Matter) are combined in all possible combinations to get eight major classes of magic. Magic within each class can be further aligned to any of three axes (Erf, Fate and Numbers), thus dividing each class into three disciplines. This gives a total of twenty-four disciplines, which are described - along with any known details - in the tables below:

! &lt;small&gt;Predictamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Mathamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Findamancy and Predictamancy were used to summon Parson; Predictamancers have been indicated to be akin to seers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0091.html Erfworld, chapter 1: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 82. Jillian: "His [Banhammer's] Predictamancer told him that his precious toy kingdom would fall someday."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Mathamancy is described as: "Analyzing probabilities... predicting outcomes" and "the raw calculations of that work".&lt;ref name="giantitp.com"&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0060.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 54]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathamancy's primary use is to determine battle odds.
&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Spookism
! &lt;small&gt;Turnamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Dollamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Weirdomancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Turnamancy can increase the rate cities produce new units, turn captured enemy units to your side, and (when linked with another unknown magic class) even force the end of another side's turn. Dollamancy creates Moll and Doll units, and can be used to create magic items.  Twolls also have the 'fabrication' special, which is a form of natural Dollamancy, as is the formation of livery emblems.  Weirdomancy can grant or remove special abilities to units.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Stuffamancy
! &lt;small&gt;Dirtamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Changemancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Dittomancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt; The Dirtamancer, Sizemore Rockwell, has been shown to be able to animate different types of rock into golems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0059.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob page 53]&lt;/ref&gt; to be able to dig through solid rock,&lt;ref&gt;Page 84, Parson's Klog 7&lt;/ref&gt; and to deal with Gobwin Knob's [[night soil]] in ways up to and including animating it into "crap golems". Dirtomancers can upgrade cities cheaper than normal.  Dittomancy can multiply combat bonuses, and the number of creatures and objects.  Dittomancy has been shown quadrupling a volley of arrows and even duplicating an overlord.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Eyemancy
! &lt;small&gt;Lookamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Thinkamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Foolamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Lookamancy has been shown as a form of [[scrying]] and cast blindness on units. Thinkamancy has been shown to deal with [[telepathy]], including creating a mind link with other casters that allows spells that normal casters cannot even comprehend,&lt;ref name="giantitp.com"/&gt; Thinkagrams (a type of long-range communication), and suggestion spells.  Foolamancy creates illusions, to disguise troops. The Eyebooks used by the main characters in Chapter 1 are made through a combination of all three disciplines of Eyemancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0035.html Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Know page 35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Hippiemancy
! &lt;small&gt;Flower Power&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Signamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Date-a-mancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Flower Power creates plant units, poisons, and can prevent units from engaging.  Time perception crumbles in the presence of Flower Power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0011.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be used to "quiet" a battle,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0013.html&lt;/ref&gt; though the precise meaning of "quiet" has not been revealed. Natural Signamancy affects a character's appearance, matching their roles and nature; Signamancers are aware of this interplay and can also create magical contracts. Date-a-mancy deals with interpersonal relationships.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Naughtymancy
! &lt;small&gt;Shockmancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Croakamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;Deletionism&lt;/s&gt;&lt;br&gt;Retconjuration&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Shockmancy includes the aggressive use of [[shock images]] and stunning spells, while Croakamancy includes the raising of the dead, or "uncroaking." [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism Deletionism] was a jab at Wikipedia; following a continuity snag, [[Retcon]]juration is now a theoretical discipline reserved for the Titans alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfworld.com/2009/08/the-ultimate-naughtymancy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Stagemancy
! &lt;small&gt;Hat Magic&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Carnymancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Rhyme-o-mancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;The hat employed by Jillian for sending messages to Ansom is likely a product of Hat Magic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfworld.com/book-1-archive/?px=%2F010.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  Carnymancy is the ability to "rig the game", creating and ignoring natural laws.  Singing is considered Rhyme-o-mancy, though the actual abilities of Rhyme-o-mancy have not been revealed.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Clevermancy
! &lt;small&gt;Healomancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Luckamancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Moneymancy&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Clevermancy consists of none of the Elements, and is described by author Rob Balder as "raw magic dealing with raw magical forces".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2315787&amp;postcount=29 post by Rob Balder in the Erfworld Forums]&lt;/ref&gt; Luckamancy is used for the purpose of increasing the odds of a desirable outcome in the user's favor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0060.html&lt;/ref&gt; but does so by lowering the odds of future desirable outcomes.  Healomancy deals with healing units.  Moneymancy creates shmuckers (currency) and gems for use in trade and upkeep.&lt;/small&gt;

'''''Evil Ed''''' is a 1995 Swedish [[Horror comedy]] film directed by Anders Jacobsson.

The film is a satire towards the harsh censoring that the Swedish Statens biografbyrå (Cinemabureau of the state) ran from 1911 to 1996. The bureau was dismissed in 2011, being the oldest film censoring organization in the world. The filmmakers were publicly ridiculed by the head of the [[Swedish Film Institute]] on national television.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlGLkDBKc5c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Edward Tor Swenson ([[Johan Rudebeck]]) is a [[Film editor|film cutter]] for the ''Loose Limbs'' [[horror film]] series. He slowly goes insane editing the gory scenes and goes on his own rampage as Evil Ed, beating the friendly filmgeek Nick ([[Per Löfberg]]) up, taking his girlfriend hostage and having a shootout with special forces led by [[Gert Fylking]].

'''Federico "Freddy" Ramos''' is a Uruguayan guitarist, arranger, producer and composer based in Santa Monica, California.

He began his career playing with [[Eduardo Mateo]] and [[Uruguayan rock]] bands Psiglo and Dias de Blues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joyasuruguay.blogspot.com/2007/10/rock-uruguay-rock-uruguayo.html Uruguayan Rock Bands]&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with incorporating jazz, blues and rock influences to urban Uruguayan music as it is ascertained in the book "De las Cuevas al Solís"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ururock.com/libros.html De las cuevas al Solís]&lt;/ref&gt; by Fernando Peláez. Federico later moved to southern Spain and eventually to Los Angeles where he is a specialty studio musician. He has shared stage, collaborated with, or recorded for artists [[Andy Williams]], Dr. [[Yusef Lateef]], [[Jon Anderson]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Ray Brown, Jr.]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Cheb Mami]], [[Joan Sebastian]], [[Alejandro Fernández]], [[Vicente Fernández]], [[Jon Hassell]], [[Mark Isham]], [[Elton John]], [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]], [[Terry Plumeri]], [[Alphonso Johnson]], [[Chester Thompson]], and [[Dionne Warwick]]. Federico has participated in many films and television shows along films composers such as [[Hans Zimmer]], [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]], [[James Horner]], Germaine Franco, [[Danny Elfman]] and [[Michael Giacchino]]. 

==Biography==
Born in the big town [[Treinta y Tres]], Uruguay, Federico began his studies in [[Montevideo]], capital of the country. The musical roots of his ancestors first directed him to the Southern Coast of Spain and while residing in Sevilla and Jeréz de la Frontera Federico was involved with flamenco music. Nevertheless, he formally puto el que lee studied classical guitar at the Real Conservatorio de Madrid during the five-year residency. Formal studies were continued first at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Massachusetts and later in California at the [[Guitar Institute of Technology]] (MI). In Valencia, at the California Institute of the Arts, he was the recipient of full scholarships. In due course Federico obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts and taught a course on Cross-Cultural Improvisation at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].

When Federico arrived in the United States in 1980, soon began expanding his musical and cultural spectrum. He settled in Santa Monica. In the eighties Federico co-founded '''Eternal Wind''', a band whose music style was characterized by improvisational compositions of world sounds. '''Eternal Wind''' Dr. Charles Moore, Adam Rudolph, Ralphs Jones and Federico, recorded several albums that were released by the Chicago-based Flying Fish Records Co.. Soon, Eternal Wind toured extensively with Dr.[[Yusef Lateef]], who then wrote and composed two symphonic works intended to be performed and recorded by '''Eternal Wind'''. One of them, ''The African-American Epic Suite for Quintet and Orchestra'' was recorded in Germany with the Köln Radio Orchestra in 1993, and released in Europe by ACT Records. As a member of '''Eternal Wind''', Federico also participated in the recording of ''Metamusic'', also written and conducted by Dr. Lateef exclusively for his quartet. Later on, in 1995, the work ''The World at Peace'' of Yusef Lateef and Adam Rudolph ('''Eternal Wind''') performed by 12 musicians, was released by Meta Records. This live performance at the Jazz Bakery of Los Angeles features Federico playing acoustic, electric and midi guitars throughout the session as well as his performance of percussion instruments and African kudu horn. References to Lateef and '''Eternal Wind''' association are further explored in Yusef Lateef's autobiography ''The Gentle Giant''.

In 1990, Federico Ramos, Eduardo Márquez Del Signore and Bernardo Rubaja worked in a debuting ensemble of compositions and performances. The ensemble fused ancient folk traditions of South America with an array of influences spanning jazz, pop, avant-garde and classical music. The instrumental textures and harmonic tints of their native cultures offered a unique and personalized style. Their recorded work ''Newland'', was released by Narada Productions, featuring [[Mark Isham]] on trumpet, Alex Acuña on drums and percussion and Steve Fowler on flutes. In 1991, Federico was introduced to the Englishman and pioneer artist [[Jon Anderson]] of the legendary progressive rock group "Yes", with whom he recorded. Subsequently, the Windham Hill releases of ''Deseo'', ''Toltec'', ''The Best Of Jon Anderson-South America 1993'' and ''Deseo Remixes'' followed. Federico toured as lead guitarist on Jon's Latin American tour of nine countries in 1993. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Federico was guest guitarist performing with Milton Nascimento, Simone and James Taylor, for a benefit presentation in the fight against hunger, Natal Sem Fome (Christmas Without Hunger).

Later, the Uruguayan drummer José Luis Pérez joined Federico to create '''Pérez &amp; Ramos'''. Their work ''Flip Flop'' expressed a contemporary improvisational music based primarily on the Uruguayan rhythms of [[candombe]] and African rhythms blending tango, Brazilian melodies and jazz. Pérez&amp;Ramos' ''Flip Flop'' was well-reviewed after being released by World Alchemy Records in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldalchemy.net/FlipFlop.html Flip Flop Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; During the year 1994, Federico was co-producer on the project ''Heart of Brazil'' with Dionne Warwick in the recording of Brazilian Artist Eliana Estevão.

During those years, Ramos co-founded the group '''Hecho en México''' with musicians Luis Pérez Ixoneztly and Germaine Franco (with whom now he collaborates for film scores). '''Hecho en México''''s music was a junction of pre-Columbian sounds of instruments and language with other contemporary musical expressions.

North Star released '''Calido''''s ''Tropical Nights'' in the year 1994. The duet of Federico and guitarist [[Ramon Stagnaro]] featured melodic songs with an array of exotic rhythms of Latin and Spanish compositions. Soon followed the collaboration with [[Michael Feinstein]] ''Michael &amp; George: Feinstein Sings Gershwin'', which was nominated for a Grammy. [[The Savage Rose]]'s disc ''For Your Love''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesavagerose.com/SRforyourlove.html Listen to '''For Your Love''' featuring Ramos’ guitars]&lt;/ref&gt; was granted the Gold Sales Award in Denmark in 2002. The recording of "En Vivo Desde el Auditorio Nacional" with Mexican superstar [[Joan Sebastian]] was awarded the Grammy for the 2006 best live disc. Also released in 2006 was a DVD of the Latin American Tour with Jon Anderson. For 2007, an educational disc for DW drums under the guide of Alex Acuña includes a vast array of Latin American styles.

In 1995 Federico again joined with Uruguayan drummer José Luis Pérez and Uruguayan bassist Eduardo Márquez Del Signore (Jon Anderson‘s Latin Band). The Trio found in the combination of their sounds the name of Ritual and the compact disc Presencia was released by Amazone Records. ''Presencia'' was presented in Montevideo, in the Teatro Solís in July 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vuY7AZdSO4E|Listen to '''Ritual''' Live @ Teatro Solís}}&lt;/ref&gt; with sold out tickets. Ritual traveled to Montevideo accompanied by their guest artist, pianist, composer and producer [[Tommy Eyre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|v014h76ob_g|'''Ritual''' en el Solís with Federico Ramos, Eduardo Márquez, José Luis Pérez &amp; Tommy Eyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Englishman that had arranged Joe Cocker's version of ''A Little Help From My Friends''. From 1996, Federico engaged in different work projects, collaborations and special guest performances. Among these musical productions Federico's highlighted participations are: '''Cielo y Tierra''': ''Heaven and Earth'', Warner-México 1996, with [[Jon Anderson]], performing acoustic guitars and choirs; putoInternational Inc. 1997, guest guitarist; [[Adam Rudolph]]'s '''Moving Pictures''': '''Contemplations'', Meta Records 1997, acoustic guitars, charango, oud, bamboo flutes; '''Cayambe''': ''Influences'', Andes Inc. 1997, guitars; Cayambe: America, Andes Inc. 1998, guitars; '''Heart &amp; Soul'', North Sound Music Group 1999, flamenco guitarists (with individual performances also by [[Ramon Stagnaro]] and Adam Del Monte), soloist guitars, composer and arranger.

During the early months of 1997, Sony Music contracted Federico as producer of Alexis Peña ‘s recording project. For this occasion Federico convoked the participation of renowned musicians such as [[Alex Acuña]] and [[Alphonso Johnson]] ("Weather Report"), Alex Ligertwood ("Santana") and [[Tommy Eyre]] (B.B. King, George Michael, Gary Moore). In February 2001 ''The African-American Epic Suite''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejazznews.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=358&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0link Review The African-American Epic Suite]&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. [[Yusef Lateef]] with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.

For over a decade, Federico toured with famed, multi-Grammy award winner Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]] throughout Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and the U.S.. In 2016 and 2017, Federico toured with The [[Alphonso Johnson]] Band, feat. the maestro [[Chester Thompson]] in Chicago, and throughout Argentina and Uruguay, where he also taught clinics. He is a dedicated studio musician collaborating in recordings, and music for films and TV shows.

{{Comics navbar|image=Contractwithgod.png|caption=[[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[A Contract with God]]'' (1978). Eisner is often credited with having 
popularized the term "graphic novel".| title=Graphic novel}}
A '''graphic novel''' is a book made up of [[comics]] content.  Although the word "[[novel]]" normally refers to long fictional works, the term "graphic novel" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term "[[comic book]]", which is generally used for comics [[periodicals]].

[[Comics historian|Fan historian]] Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel" in an essay in the November 1964 issue of the comics [[fanzine]] ''Capa-Alpha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schelly|first=Bill|title=Founders of Comic Fandom: Profiles of 90 Publishers, Dealers, Collectors, Writers, Artists and Other Luminaries of the 1950s and 1960s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9YRzodtmKcC&amp;pg=PA117|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5762-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madden|first1=David|last2=Bane|first2=Charles|last3=Flory|first3=Sean M.|title=A Primer of the Novel: For Readers and Writers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qeX9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-5597-8|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term gained popularity in the comics community after the publication of [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[A Contract with God]]'' (1978) and the start of Marvel's [[Marvel Graphic Novel|Graphic Novel]] [[line (comics)|line]] (1982) and became familiar to the public in the late 1980s after the commercial successes of the first volume of [[Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus]]'' in 1986 and the collected editions of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' in 1986 and [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' in 1987. The [[Book Industry Study Group]] began using "graphic novel" as a category in book stores in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.bisg.org/bisac-subject-headings-list-comics-and-graphic-novels | title= BISAC Subject Headings List, Comics and Graphic Novels | publisher= [[Book Industry Study Group]] | accessdate= July 9, 2015 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150414104950/https://www.bisg.org/bisac-subject-headings-list-comics-and-graphic-novels | archivedate= 2015-04-14 | deadurl= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The term is not strictly defined, though [[Merriam-Webster]]'s full dictionary definition is "a fictional story that is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book", while its simplest definition is given as "cartoon drawings that tell a story and are published as a book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graphic%20novel |title=graphic novel|website= [[Merriam-Webster]].com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[publishing]] trade, the term extends to material that would not be considered a [[novel]] if produced in another medium.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} Collections of [[comic books]] that do not form a continuous story, [[anthology|anthologies]] or collections of loosely related pieces, and even [[non-fiction]] are stocked by [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstores]] as "graphic novels" (similar to the manner in which dramatic stories are included in "comic" books).{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} The term is also sometimes used to distinguish between works created as standalone stories, in contrast to collections or compilations of a [[story arc]] from a comic book series published in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gertler | first =Nat | authorlink =Nat Gertler |author2=[[Steve Lieber]]  | title =The Complete Idiot's Guide to Creating a Graphic Novel | publisher =[[Alpha Books]] | year =2004 | isbn =978-1-59257-233-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Arie|authorlink=Arie Kaplan|title=Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-55652-633-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-novel|title=graphic novel {{!}} literature|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In continental Europe, both original book-length stories such as ''La rivolta dei racchi'' (1967) by [[Guido Buzzelli]],{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;A complete edition was published in 1970 before being serialized in the French magazine ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'', as per {{cite web|author= |year=2004 |title=Dino Buzzati 1965–1975 |format=Italian website |work=Associazione Guido Buzzelli |url=http://www.chez.com/buzzelli/1965-1975.html |accessdate=2006-06-21 }} ([https://www.webcitation.org/5s3tzl5Pk?url=http://buzzelli.chez.com/1965-1975.html WebCitation archive]); {{cite web|author=Domingos Isabelinho |year=2004 |title=The Ghost of a Character: The Cage by Martin Vaughn-James |format= |work=Indy Magazine |url=http://www.indyworld.com/indy/summer_2004/isabelinho_cage/ |accessdate=2006-04-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s3uH40uL?url=http://www.indyworld.com/indy/summer_2004/isabelinho_cage/ |archivedate=2010-08-18 |df= }} ().&lt;/ref&gt; and collections of [[comics]] have been commonly published in hardcover volumes, often called "[[comic album|albums]]", since the end of the 19th century (including such later [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series as ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' in the 1930s).

== History ==
As the exact definition of the graphic novel is debated, the origins of the form are open to interpretation.

''The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck'' is the oldest recognized American example of comics used to this end.&lt;ref name=coville&gt;{{cite web |last=Coville |first=Jamie |url=http://www.thecomicbooks.com/old/Platinum.html |title=The History of Comic Books: Introduction and 'The Platinum Age 1897–1938' |publisher=TheComicBooks.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030415153354/http://www.collectortimes.com/~comichistory/Platinum.html |archivedate=April 15, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.

=== 1920s to 1960s ===
The 1920s saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition, with Belgian [[Frans Masereel]] cited as "the undisputed king" of this revival.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Adult Comics: An Introduction''(Routledge New Accents Library Collection, 2005), p. 291 {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works include ''[[Passionate Journey]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Reissued 1985 as ''Passionate Journey: A Novel in 165 Woodcuts'' {{ISBN|978-0-87286-174-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Lynd Ward]] also worked in this tradition, publishing ''Gods' Man'', in 1929 and going on to publish more during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/lynd-ward-graphic-novel-prize/press-releases-lynd-ward-prize|title=2016 Lynd Ward Prize for Graphic Novel of the Year|last=|first=|date=|website=Pennsylvania Center For the Book|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graphicwitness.org/historic/fm.htm|title=Graphic Witness|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prototypical examples from this period include American [[Milt Gross]]'s ''He Done Her Wrong'' (1930), a wordless comic published as a hardcover book, and ''[[Une semaine de bonté]]'' (1934), a novel in sequential images composed of collage by the surrealist painter [[Max Ernst]]. Similarly, [[Charlotte Salomon]]'s ''Life? or Theater?'' (composed 1941–43) combines images, narrative, and captions.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The 1940s saw the launching of ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'', a [[comic-book]] series that primarily adapted notable, [[public domain]] novels into standalone comic books for young readers. In 1947 [[Fawcett Comics]] published ''Comics Novel'' #1: "Anarcho, Dictator of Death", a 52-page comic dedicated to one story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/511/|title=GCD :: Series :: Comics Novel|website=www.comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a [[film noir]]-influenced slice of steeltown life starring a scheming, manipulative redhead named Rust. Touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover, the 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]] proved successful enough to lead to an unrelated second picture novel, ''The Case of the Winking Buddha'' by [[pulp magazine|pulp novelist]] [[Manning Lee Stokes]] and illustrator [[Charles Raab]].&lt;ref name=ken&gt;{{cite news |last=Quattro |first=Ken |url=http://www.comicartville.com/archerstjohn.htm |title=Archer St. John &amp; The Little Company That Could |publisher=Comicartville Library |date=2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ua9KWSn9?url=http://www.comicartville.com/archerstjohn.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/317082/|title=GCD :: Issue :: It Rhymes With Lust|website=www.comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presaging Will Eisner's multiple-story graphic novel ''A Contract with God'' (1978), cartoonist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] wrote and drew the four-story mass-market paperback ''[[Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book]]'' ([[Ballantine Books]] #338K), published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/543514/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book #338 K|website=www.comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, American comic book creators were becoming more adventurous with the form. [[Gil Kane]] and [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] self-published a 40-page, [[magazine]]-format comics novel, ''[[His Name Is... Savage]]'' (Adventure House Press) in 1968—the same year [[Marvel Comics]] published two issues of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in a similar format. Columnist and comic-book writer [[Steven Grant]] also argues that [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Doctor Strange]] story in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #130–146, although published serially from 1965–1966, is "the first American graphic novel".&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]].

Meanwhile, in continental Europe, the tradition of collecting serials of popular strips such as ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' or ''[[Asterix]]'' led to long-form narratives published initially as serials.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

By 1969, the author [[John Updike]], who had entertained ideas of becoming a cartoonist in his youth, addressed the Bristol Literary Society, on "[[the death of the novel]]". Updike offered examples of new areas of exploration for novelists, declaring he saw "no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and create a comic strip novel masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gravett | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Gravett | year=2005 | title=Graphic Novels: Stories To Change Your Life | edition=1st | publisher=Aurum Press Limited | isbn=978-1-84513-068-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Blackmark.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from ''Blackmark'' (1971) by scripter [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[artist]]-plotter [[Gil Kane]].]]
Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin's ''[[Blackmark]]'' (1971), a [[science fiction]]/[[sword-and-sorcery]] paperback published by [[Bantam Books]], did not use the term originally; the back-cover blurb of the 30th-anniversary edition ({{ISBN|978-1-56097-456-7}}) calls it, retroactively, "the very first American graphic novel". The [[Academy of Comic Book Arts]] presented Kane with a special 1971 [[Shazam Award]] for what it called "his paperback comics novel". Whatever the nomenclature, ''Blackmark'' is a 119-page story of comic-book art, with captions and [[word balloons]], published in a traditional book format. It is also the first with an original heroic-adventure character conceived expressly for this form.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

European creators were also experimenting with the longer narrative in comics form. In the United Kingdom, [[Raymond Briggs]] was producing works such as ''[[Father Christmas (graphic novel)|Father Christmas]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Snowman]]'' (1978), which he himself described as being from the "bottomless abyss of strip cartooning", although they, along with such other Briggs works as the more mature ''[[When the Wind Blows (graphic novel)|When the Wind Blows]]'' (1982), have been re-marketed as graphic novels in the wake of the term's popularity. Briggs notes, however, "I don't know if I like that term too much".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Wroe |last=Nicholas |pages= |title=Bloomin' Christmas |date=December 18, 2004 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1375227,00.html |location=London }} [https://www.webcitation.org/5s3vqF2Ix?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/dec/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First self-proclaimed graphic novels: 1976–1978 ===
In 1976, the term "graphic novel" appeared in print to describe three separate works. ''[[Bloodstar]]'' by [[Richard Corben]] (adapted from a story by [[Robert E. Howard]]) used the term to define itself on its dust jacket and introduction. [[George Metzger (artist)|George Metzger]]'s ''Beyond Time and Again'', serialized in [[underground comix]] from 1967 to 1972, was subtitled "A Graphic Novel" on the inside title page when collected as a 48-page, black-and-white, hardcover book published by Kyle &amp; Wheary.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[digest-sized]] ''[[Chandler: Red Tide]]'' (1976) by [[Jim Steranko]], designed to be sold on newsstands, used the term "graphic novel" in its introduction and "a [[visual novel]]" on its cover, although ''Chandler'' is more commonly considered{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} an [[illustrated fiction|illustrated novel]] than a work of [[comics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Bloodstar.jpg|thumb|''Bloodstar'' (1976) by [[Robert E. Howard]] and [[artist]] [[Richard Corben]] ]]

The following year, [[Terry Nantier]], who had spent his teenage years living in Paris, returned to the United States and formed [[Flying Buttress Publications]], later to incorporate as [[NBM Publishing]] ([[Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine]]), and published ''Racket Rumba'', a 50-page spoof of the [[Hardboiled|noir]]-[[detective]] genre, written and drawn by the single-name French artist Loro. Nantier followed this with [[Enki Bilal]]'s ''[[The Call of the Stars]]''. The company marketed these works as "graphic albums".{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbmpub.com/history/about3.html Company history page], NBM Publishing, n.d.

The first six issues of writer-artist [[Jack Katz (artist)|Jack Katz]]'s 1974 [[Comics and Comix Co.]] series ''[[The First Kingdom]]'' were collected as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ([[Pocket Books]], March 1978),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=12642 Grand Comics Database: ''The First Kingdom'']&lt;/ref&gt; which described itself as "the first graphic novel". Issues of the comic had described themselves as "graphic prose", or simply as a novel.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Similarly, ''[[Sabre (graphic novel)|Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species]]'' by writer [[Don McGregor]] and artist [[Paul Gulacy]] ([[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse Books]], August 1978)—the first graphic novel sold in the newly created "[[direct market]]" of United States comic-book shops&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milehighcomics.com/interviews/donmcgregor.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194521/http://www.milehighcomics.com/interviews/donmcgregor.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |year=2001 |title=Interview with Don McGregor |first=Bob |last=Gough |publisher=MileHighComics.com |accessdate=September 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—was called a "graphic album" by the author in interviews, though the publisher dubbed it a "comic novel" on its credits page. "Graphic album" was also the term used the following year by [[Gene Day]] for his hardcover short-story collection ''Future Day'' ([[NBM Publishing|Flying Buttress Press]]).

Another early graphic novel, though it carried no self-description, was ''The Silver Surfer'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon &amp; Schuster/Fireside Books]], August 1978), by Marvel Comics' [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Significantly, this was published by a traditional book publisher and distributed through bookstores, as was [[cartoonist]] [[Jules Feiffer]]'s ''Tantrum'' ([[Alfred A. Knopf]], 1979)&lt;ref&gt;Tallmer, Jerry. [http://www.nyc-plus.com/nycp1/thethreelive.html "The Three Lives of Jules Feiffer"], ''NYC Plus'' #1, April 2005. [https://www.webcitation.org/5s3xJVhrx?url=http://www.nyc-plus.com/nycp1/thethreelive.html WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; described on its dustjacket as a "novel-in-pictures".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Adoption of the term ===
[[File:Sabre graphic novel.jpg|thumb|left|''Sabre'' (1978), one of the first modern graphic novels. Cover art by [[Paul Gulacy]].]]
Hyperbolic descriptions of longer [[comic book]]s as "novels" appear on covers as early as the 1940s. Early issues of [[DC Comics]]' ''All-Flash Quarterly'', for example, described their contents as "novel-length stories" and "full-length four chapter novels".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/covers.lasso?SeriesID=211 Grand Comics Database: ''All-Flash'' (DC, 1941).] See Issues #2–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earliest known citation, comic book reviewer Richard Kyle used the term "graphic novel" in ''Capa-Alpha'' #2 (November 1964), a newsletter published by the Comic Amateur Press Alliance, and again in an article in [[Bill Spicer]]'s magazine ''Fantasy Illustrated'' #5 (Spring 1966).&lt;ref name=rcharvey&gt;Per [http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,547796,00.html ''Time'' magazine letter].

Harvey]] in response to claims in Arnold, Andrew D., [http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,542579,00.html "The Graphic Novel Silver Anniversary"] ([https://www.webcitation.org/5s3wCDWDT?url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0%2C9565%2C542579%2C00.html WebCitation archive]), [[Time (magazine)|Time.com]], November 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle, inspired by European and East Asian graphic albums (especially the Japanese ''[[manga]]''), used the label to designate comics of an artistically "serious" sort.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, ''Graphic Novels'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Spicer, with Kyle's acknowledgment, edited and published a periodical titled ''[[Graphic Story Magazine]]'' in the fall of 1967.&lt;ref name=rcharvey /&gt; ''[[The Sinister House of Secret Love]]'' #2 (Jan. 1972), one of [[DC Comics]]' line of extra-length, 48-page comics, specifically used the phrase "a graphic novel of Gothic terror" on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/75432/cover/4/?style=default Cover, ''The Sinister House of Secret Love'' #2] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism regarding the content of comic books, and to the establishment of the industry's self-censorship [[Comics Code Authority]], an underground alternative [[Underground comix|comix]] movement was created.&lt;ref name="Carelton"&gt;''Drawn to Change: Comics and Critical Consciousness'', Issue 73, Labour, 2014, p. 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "graphic novel" began to grow in popularity months after it appeared on the cover of the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] edition (though not the [[hardcover]] edition) of [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[A Contract with God]]'' (October 1978). This collection of [[short stories]] was a mature, complex work focusing on the lives of ordinary people in the real world based on Eisner's own experiences.&lt;ref&gt;''Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner’s American Jewish History'', Volume 30, Issue 2, AJS Review, 2006, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; The term "graphic novel" was intended{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} to distinguish it from the traditional serialized nature of comic books, with which it shared a storytelling medium.&lt;!--The graphic novel is considered to be more intellectually advanced than comic books, but it has also allowed for the transition into diversifying comics from simply being a newsstand medium with two main publishers: Marvel and DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Production of the Marvel Graphic Novel Series: The Business and Culture of the Early Direct Market|last = Clarke|first = M.

One scholar used graphic novels to introduce the concept of graphiation, a newly coined term used to describe graphic expression or visual enunciation. Graphiation refers to the theory that the entire personality of an artist is visible through his or her visual representation of a certain character, setting, event, or object in a novel, and as a means to examine and analyze drawing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Graphic Novel: An Introduction|last1 = Baetens|first1= Jan|first2=Hugo |last2= Frey | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Eisner’s ''[[A Contract with God]]'' was finally published in 1978 by a smaller company, Baronet Press, it took Eisner over a year to find a publishing house that would allow his work to reach the mass market.&lt;ref&gt;''Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner’s American Jewish History'', Volume 30, Issue 2, AJS Review, 2006, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner cited{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Lynd Ward's 1930s woodcuts (see above) as an inspiration.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The critical and commercial success of ''A Contract with God'' helped to establish the term "graphic novel" in common usage, and many sources have incorrectly credited Eisner with being the first to use it. These included the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine website in 2003, which said in its correction, "Eisner acknowledges that the term 'graphic novel' had been coined prior to his book. But, he says, 'I had not known at the time that someone had used that term before.' Nor does he take credit for creating the first graphic book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Andrew D. |last= Arnold |title=A Graphic Literature Library – TIME.comix responds | publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time.com]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,547796,00.html |accessdate= 2006-06-21 |date= 2003-11-21}}.

[[File:Will Eisner (San Diego Comic Con, 2004).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Will Eisner in 2004]]

One of the earliest contemporaneous applications of the term post-Eisner came in 1979{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}, when ''Blackmark'''s sequel—published a year after ''A Contract with God'' though written and drawn in the early 1970s—was labeled a "graphic novel" on the cover of Marvel Comics' black-and-white comics magazine ''Marvel Preview'' #17 (Winter 1979), where ''Blackmark: The Mind Demons'' premiered—its 117-page contents intact, but its panel-layout reconfigured to fit 62 pages.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Following this, Marvel from 1982 to 1988 published the ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' line of 10" × 7" trade paperbacks—although numbering them like comic books, from #1 ([[Jim Starlin]]'s ''[[Mar-Vell|The Death of Captain Marvel]]'') to #35 ([[Dennis O'Neil]], [[Mike Kaluta]], and [[Russ Heath]]'s ''Hitler's Astrologer'', starring the radio and [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] character the [[The Shadow|Shadow]], and released in hardcover). Marvel commissioned original graphic novels from such creators as [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[J. M. DeMatteis]], [[Steve Gerber]], graphic-novel pioneer McGregor, [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], [[Walt Simonson]], [[Charles Vess]], and [[Bernie Wrightson]]. While most of these starred Marvel [[superhero]]es, others, such as [[Rick Veitch]]'s ''Heartburst'' featured original SF/fantasy characters; others still, such as [[John J. Muth]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', featured adaptations of literary stories or characters; and one, [[Sam Glanzman]]'s ''A Sailor's Story'', was a true-life, [[World War II]] [[U.S. Navy|naval]] tale.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Watchmencovers.png|frame|The 1987 U.S. (left) and 1995 U.S./UK/Canada (right) collected editions of ''Watchmen'', published by [[DC Comics]] and [[Titan Books]], respectively.]]
Cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Maus]]'' (1986), helped establish both the term and the concept of graphic novels in the minds of the mainstream public.&lt;ref name="Carelton" /&gt; Two [[DC Comics]] book reprints of self-contained miniseries did likewise, though they were not originally published as graphic novels: ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986), a collection of Frank Miller's four-part comic-book series featuring an older Batman faced with the problems of a [[dystopia]]n future; and ''[[Watchmen]]'' (1986-1987), a collection of [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] in which Moore notes he "set out to explore, amongst other things, the dynamics of power in a post-Hiroshima world".&lt;ref&gt;Moore letter, {{Cite comic | Title = Cerebus | Issue = 217 | date = April 1997 | Publisher = Aardvark Vanaheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works and others were reviewed in newspapers and magazines, leading to increased coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, Fritz.

=== European adoption of the term ===
Outside North America, Eisner's ''A Contract with God'' and Spiegelman's ''Maus'' led to the popularization of the expression "graphic novel" as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/aanvang/2000graphicnovel.htm|title=2000-2010 Graphic novels|website=www.lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, most European countries used neutral, descriptive terminology that referred to the form of the medium, and not the contents. In Francophone Europe for example, the expression ''bandes dessinées'' &amp;ndash; which literally translates as "drawn strips" &amp;ndash; is used, while the terms ''stripverhaal'' ("strip story") and ''tegneserie'' ("drawn series") are used by the Dutch/Flemish and Scandinavians respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Notable exceptions have become the German and Spanish speaking populaces who have adopted the US derived ''comic'' and ''cómicos'' respectively. The traditional Spanish term had previously been ''tebeo'' ("strip"). The likewise German expression ''Serienbilder'' ("serialized images") has, unlike its Spanish counterpart, become obsolete. The term "comic" is used in the other European countries as well, but exclusively to refer to the standard [[American comic book]] format.&lt;/ref&gt; European [[comics studies]] scholars have observed that Americans originally used "graphic novel" to describe everything that deviated from their standard, [[American comic book|32-page comic book]] format, meaning that all larger-sized, longer Franco-Belgian [[comic album]]s, regardless of their contents, fell under the heading.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

American comic critics occasionally refer to European graphic novels as "Eurocomics",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Amazing Heroes]]'', issue 160, March 1989, "Special European Issue!". Having fallen out of favor, the term "Eurocomics" might be misconstrued as derogatory in current understanding, due to its connotations with the popular slang expression "[[Eurotrash (term)|eurotrash]]" which ''is'' derogatory. However, quite the opposite was true at the time, as it was intended by American critics as a means to differentiate European comics from their American counterparts, underscoring the more mature qualities of the former. Graphic novel became the generally used expression for what once had been referred to as "eurocomic".&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts were made in the late 1980s to cross-fertilize the American market with these works. American publishers [[Catalan Communications]] and [[NBM Publishing]] released translated titles, predominantly from the backlog catalogs of Casterman and Les Humanoïdes Associés.

== Criticism of the term ==
Some in the comics community have objected to the term "graphic novel" on the grounds that it is unnecessary, or that its usage has been corrupted by commercial interests. Writer [[Alan Moore]] believes,
{{quote|It's a marketing term... that I never had any sympathy with. The term 'comic' does just as well for me&amp;nbsp;... The problem is that 'graphic novel' just came to mean 'expensive comic book' and so what you'd get is people like DC Comics or Marvel Comics—because 'graphic novels' were getting some attention, they'd stick six issues of whatever worthless piece of crap they happened to be publishing lately under a glossy cover and call it ''The [[She-Hulk]] Graphic Novel''&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Barry |last=Kavanagh |title=The Alan Moore Interview: Northampton / Graphic novel |publisher=Blather.net |date=October 17, 2000 |url=http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html |accessdate=2007-03-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226072653/http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html |archivedate=February 26, 2014 |df= }}. &lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|It's a perfect time to retire terms like "graphic novel" and "sequential art", which piggyback on the language of other, wholly separate mediums. What's more, both terms have their roots in the need to dissemble and justify, thus both exude a sense of desperation, a gnawing hunger to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2016/11/17/502422829/the-term-graphic-novel-has-had-a-good-run-we-dont-need-it-anymore|title=The Term 'Graphic Novel' Has Had A Good Run.

Author Daniel Raeburn wrote, 
{{quote|"I snicker at the [[neologism]] first for its insecure pretension—the literary equivalent of calling a [[garbage man]] a 'sanitation engineer'—and second because a 'graphic novel' is in fact the very thing it is ashamed to admit: a comic book, rather than a comic pamphlet or comic magazine."&lt;ref&gt;Raeburn, Daniel. ''Chris Ware'' (Monographics Series), [[Yale University]] Press, 2004, p. 110. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10291-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Writer [[Neil Gaiman]], responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels, said the commenter:
{{quote|"meant it as a compliment, I suppose. But all of a sudden I felt like someone who'd been informed that she wasn't actually a hooker; that in fact she was a lady of the evening."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bender | first1 = Hy | title = The Sandman Companion | publisher = [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-1-56389-644-6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Responding to writer [[Douglas Wolk]]'s quip that the difference between a graphic novel and a comic book is "the binding", ''[[Bone (comic)|Bone]]'' creator [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] said, "I kind of like that answer. Because 'graphic novel'&amp;nbsp;... I don't like that name. It's trying too hard. It is a comic book. But there is a difference. And the difference is, a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning, a middle and an end."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=148242 "Behind the Page: Jeff Smith, Part Two"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', February 26, 2008. [https://www.webcitation.org/5s406drEH?url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t%3D148242 WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' writer [[Giles Coren]] said, "To call them graphic novels is to presume that the novel is in some way 'higher' than the karmicbwurk (comic book), and that only by being thought of as a sort of novel can it be understood as an art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2012/12/not-graphic-and-not-novel/|title=Not graphic and not novel - The Spectator|date=1 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some alternative cartoonists have coined their own terms to describe extended comics narratives. The cover of [[Daniel Clowes]]' ''Ice Haven'' (2001) describes the book as "a comic-strip novel", with Clowes having noted that he "never saw anything wrong with the comic book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura |last=Bushell |title=Daniel Clowes Interview: The Ghost World Creator Does It Again |publisher=BBC – Collective |date=July 21, 2005 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A4500820 |accessdate=2006-06-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s40K0lmP?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A4500820 |archivedate=August 18, 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of [[Craig Thompson]]'s ''[[Blankets (graphic novel)|Blankets]]'' calls it "an illustrated novel".{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

'''Ideal Toy Company''' was an American toy company founded by [[Morris Michtom|Morris and Rose Michtom]]. During the [[post–World War II baby boom]] era, Ideal became the largest [[doll]]-making company in the [[United States]]. Their most popular dolls included [[Betsy Wetsy]],&lt;ref name=Hays&gt;Hays, Constance L. "Judith Albert, 59, Toy Designer Whose Doll Led to Buyer Frenzy," ''New York Times'' (Aug. 1, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Toni, Saucy Walker, [[Shirley Temple]], Miss Revlon, Patti Playpal, [[Tammy (doll)|Tammy]], [[Thumbelina]], Tiny Thumbelina, and [[Crissy]].&lt;ref name="izen" /&gt; Their last big hit was the [[Rubik's Cube]].

Morris and Rose Michtom founded the '''Ideal Novelty and Toy Company''' in Brooklyn when they invented the [[Teddy bear]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideal Toy Company Dolls|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/dolls/ideal|website=Collectors Weekly|publisher=Market Street Media LLC|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Michtom's death in 1938, the company changed its name to the '''Ideal Toy Company''',&lt;ref name=cwt&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideal Toy Company Toys|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/toys/ideal|website=Collectors Weekly|publisher=Market Street Media LLC|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Michtom's nephew Abraham Katz became chief executive.

During [[World War II]], the company's value rose from $2 million to $11 million.&lt;ref name=Sloane2 /&gt; The company's dolls were so popular during the [[post–World War II baby boom]] era, they began selling dolls under license in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Brazil]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Key Ideal employees during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s were Lionel A. Weintraub and Joseph C. Winkler. Weintraub, the son-in-law of Abraham Katz, joined the company in 1941 and rose to become president, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer. Winkler joined Ideal in 1956, rising to vice president by 1971.&lt;ref name=Sloane&gt;Sloane, Leonard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/business-people-ideal-toy-gets-a-new-president.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D "Business People: Ideal Toy Gets A New President,"] ''New York Times'' (May 27, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Ideal partnered with competitors the [[American Character Doll Company]] and the Alexander Doll Company to establish the United States-Israeli Toy and Plastic Corporation, designed to produce material for toys in Israel and the U.S. Ideal CEO Abraham Katz was named president of the new company.&lt;ref name=NYT1951&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/11/08/81777289.html?pageNumber=49 "PLANT IN TEL AVIV TO MAKE PLASTICS: New $1,000,000 Concern Plans Range of Products From Toys to Building Items To Make Plastic Parts,"] ''New York Times'' (November 8, 1951), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the [[American Character Doll Company]] filed for bankruptcy, and Ideal acquired the defunct company's dyes, patents, and trademarks,&lt;ref name=DR&gt;[http://dollreference.com/american_character_dolls.html "American Character Dolls 1919-1968,"] DollReference.com. Accessed Dec. 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as specific products like the "[[Tressy]]" Gro-Hair doll.

In late 1971, Ideal joined the [[New York Stock Exchange]]; valued at $71 million, it was one of the U.S.'s top three toy companies.&lt;ref name=Sloane2&gt;Sloan, Leonard. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/10/24/90699668.pdf  "Ideal Toy's Weintraub Tries to Create Fun Potential,"] ''New York Times'' (Oct. 24, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, Ideal had outgrown its manufacturing complex in [[Hollis, Queens]]. The company wanted to build a new plant in [[College Point, Queens]] (later the site of [[Shea Stadium]]), but was unable to strike a deal with the [[John Lindsay|Lindsay]] administration. Consequently, the company opened a new facility in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in the early 1970s, while continuing to operate its factory in Hollis.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/14/nyregion/ideal-toy-corp-moving-queens-offices-to-jersey.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D "Ideal Toy Corp.

Ideal had earnings of $3.7 million in fiscal year 1979-1980, but lost $15.5 million in fiscal year 1980-1981. (Sales both years averaged c. $150 million.)&lt;ref name=Sloane /&gt; Trying to maximize profits on the [[Rubik's Cube]] craze, in May 1981 Ideal filed [[civil suit]]s against dozens of distributors and retailers selling [[knockoff]] cubes.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Mark.

In May 1981, Joseph Winkler was named Ideal's president, succeeding Lionel Weintraub, who remained chairman and CEO.&lt;ref name=Sloane /&gt;

In 1982, the company moved its headquarters from [[Hollis, Queens]], to [[Harmon Meadow]], New Jersey. It was sold to [[CBS Toys]] later that year for c. $58 million.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In 1987, CBS sold Ideal to [[View-Master|Viewmaster International]], which renamed itself '''View-Master Ideal''' in the process.

In 1989, View-Master Ideal was bought by [[Tyco Toys]] of Mt. Laurel, [[New Jersey]], for $43.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/business/company-news-tyco-to-acquire-view-master-ideal.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22%7D "COMPANY NEWS; Tyco to Acquire View-Master Ideal,"] ''New York Times'' (May 24, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The Ideal line remained part of Tyco until Tyco’s merger with [[Mattel, Inc.]], in 1997.

Ideal's United Kingdom assets were sold to [[Hasbro]], which has since released [[Mouse Trap (game)|Mouse Trap]] and [[KerPlunk (game)|KerPlunk]] under its [[MB Games]] brand. Other toys that originated with Ideal continue to be marketed and sold by other companies, including [[Rubik's Cube]] by [[Hasbro]] and [[Magic 8-ball]] by [[Mattel]].

The Ideal brand was revived by Plaza Toys on its Fiddlestix building sticks products, but by January 2011 was a Poof-[[Slinky]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pollard|first1=Garland|title=Fiddlestix: The Ideal Toys Brand Resurfaces|url=http://www.brandlandusa.com/2011/01/21/fiddlestix-the-ideal-toys-brand-resurfaces/|accessdate=January 22, 2016|work=BrandlandUSA|publisher=Brand Conservancy LLC|date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Ideal brand became part of a new company, Alex Brands, after the May 2013 acquisition of Alex Toys by Propel Equity Partners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alexbrands.com/alex-toys-poof-slinky-and-zoob-come-together-under-new-collective-brand-identity/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products history===
Ideal began making dolls in 1907 to complement its line of [[teddy bear]]s. Their first doll was “Yellow Kid” from [[Richard Felton Outcault]]'s [[comic strip]] of the [[The Yellow Kid|same name]]. After that Ideal began making a line of baby and character dolls such as [[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]] (from the [[Victor Herbert]] operetta), and [[Admiral Dot]]. Ideal advertised their dolls as "unbreakable," since they were made of [[composition doll|composition]], a material made of sawdust and glue. Ideal produced over 200 variations of dolls throughout the composition era.&lt;ref name="izen"&gt;Izen, Judith. ''[http://www.dollsofourchildhood.com/idealbook3.html Collector's Guide to Ideal Dolls: Identification and Value Guide], 3rd Edition.'' Collector's Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding branding well, Ideal had a boy doll launched in 1914 named the Uneeda Kid, after a [[Uneeda Biscuit|biscuit company]].

One of Ideal's most lasting products was [[Betsy Wetsy]], introduced in 1934 and in production for more than 50 years. The doll was named after the daughter of Abraham Katz, the head of the company.&lt;ref name="izen" /&gt; Ideal, via the Betsy Wetsy doll, was also one of the first doll manufacturers to produce an [[African American]] version of a popular doll.&lt;ref name="Wagg"&gt;Waggoner, Susan. ''Under the Tree: the Toys and Treats That Made Christmas Special, 1930-1970''. Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Betsy Wetsy to its Century of Toys List, a compilation commemorating the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/miscellaneous-mfg-doll-toy-games-games/5673984-1.html |title=Toy Industry Association Announces Its Century of Toys List |work=Business Wire |date=21 January 2003 |accessdate=31 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319020509/http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/miscellaneous-mfg-doll-toy-games-games/5673984-1.html |archivedate=19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debuting in 1934, the [[Shirley Temple]] doll was their best-selling doll. Ideal follow up with licensed Disney dolls and a [[Judy Garland]] doll.&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;

Two cosmetics-based doll series were launched after World War II: Toni was introduced at the end of the 1940s, followed by the 1950s-dominating Miss [[Revlon]] series.&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;

Ideal had a hobby division in the 1950s, but shifted from that to games in 1962. By the early 1970s, 30% of the company's sales were games such as [[Mouse Trap (game)|Mouse Trap]] and Hands Down.&lt;ref name=Sloane2 /&gt;

Doll designer Judith Albert worked for Ideal Toy Company from 1960–1982.&lt;ref name=Hays /&gt; Master sculptor Vincent J. DeFilippo spent 27 years creating dolls for Ideal from 1963–1980{{check|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--That's 17 years not 27--&gt;. Some of the company's most popular dolls during this period were [[Tammy (doll)|Tammy]] (1962–1966), [[Flatsy doll]]s (1969–1973), [[Crissy]] (1969–1974), and [[Tressy]] (1970–1972).

Popular Ideal toys in the 1970s included a full line of [[Evel Knievel]] toys, [[Snoopy]] toys, and the Tuesday Taylor and Wake-up Thumbelina dolls.&lt;ref name=Hollie /&gt;

For a short time, the company had a huge seller with the [[Magic Cube]], which it imported from Hungary in 1980 and renamed [[Rubik's Cube]].&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, John (1994).

== History ==

As a way of exploring how informal digital video production involved not only the familiar functions of filming and editing, but also the dramatization of identity, drawing from [[film theory]] and [[multimodality]] theory, [[Andrew Burn (professor)|Andrew Burn]] and David Parker coined the term kineikonic in 2003 by combining the Greek words ''kinein'' meaning "to move" and ''eikon'' meaning "image".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burn|first1=Andrew|title=Making New Media: Creative Production and Digital Literacies|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;  Kineikonic analysis pays attention to how the modes of the moving image, such as speech, music, dramatic action, work together in kineikonic texts, be they film, video, videogame or animation, by observing both the modes within an individual frame and also how these modes work together throughout the temporal sequence of the text, both within and beyond the level of the shot.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burn|first1=Andrew|title=The Kineikonic Mode: Towards a Multimodal Approach to Moving Image Media|url=http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3085/|website=NCRM Working Paper.|publisher=NCRM, London, UK|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the kineikonic model disputes [[Metz]]'s proposal that there can be no grammar of film below the level of the shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz|first1=Christian|title=Film Language|date=1974|publisher=Chicago University Press|location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of 'mode' stems from multimodal theory, and refers to 'a set of socially and culturally shaped resources for making meaning. Mode classifies a ‘channel’ of representation or communication for which previously no overarching name had been proposed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Multimodal Terms|url=https://multimodalityglossary.wordpress.com/mode-2/|website=MODE NCRM node in multimodal research methods}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining modes, such as sound, movement, image, and gesture, analysts can understand how the meaning of a text is constructed across and between the signifying systems of these semiotic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kress|first1=Gunther|last2=Van Leeuwen|first2=Theo|title=Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design|date=2006 |edition=2nd |publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jewitt|first1=Carey|title=The Routledge Handbook of Multimodal Analysis|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The kineikonic mode ==

One can understand the kineikonic mode by examining each mode individually, such as tracing the rhythm, melody or harmonic patterns of the music in and across the shots of a film. However, a central proposition of the kineikonic is a theory of how the 'contributory' modes are organized by the 'orchestrating modes' of filming and editing: how they have been juxtaposed to work both through the space of the film (the frames), and through the timeline of the film, the movement through time of the images, as well as the time-based modes of language, music and sound.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbons|first1=Damiana|title=Tracing the Paths of Moving Artifacts in Youth Media Production|journal=English Teaching: Practice and Critique|date=2010|volume=9|issue=1|pages=8–21|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ890510.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The importance of the theory of the kineikonic mode ==
The kineikonic mode has been important in contemporary analyses of filmic text because it moves beyond the dominant emphasis in [[film studies]] on the processes of filming and editing to a common set of [[semiotic]] principles operating across all the modes involved. The kineikonic mode provides a language with which to analyze the elements within and throughout a film in a way that recognizes how all of the pieces of the film work both by themselves and together to create meaning.  In deploying a multimodal and social semiotic theory of communication, it also allows for a common analytical framework to be applied across the [[moving image]] text and its context, so that the text can be analysed in relation to the meanings created by different media of exhibition (projectors, the internet, mobile phones), and by their discursive surroundings (cinemas, YouTube, tablet interfaces), as well as in relation to their regimes of production and reception.

== Contemporary uses of the theory of the kineikonic mode ==

Since its coining in 2003, the theory of the kineikonic mode has been expanded in several ways. Some have examined how tracing the kineikonic mode can show how particular youth identities are represented in youth-produced videos, such as representing a Native self through the ways in which various modes are highlighted and put together.,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; or how primary school children use embodied modes of action and self-representation to invoke memory and construct identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=John|title='"This brings back a lot of memories": a Case Study in the analysis of video production by young learners'|journal=Education, Communication and Information|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another expansion of the theory is to examine in more detail how time works in the orchestration of the modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curwood|first1=Jenn Scott|last2=Gibbons|first2=Damiana|title='Just as I have felt': Multimodal Counternarratives in Youth-Produced Digital Media|journal=International Journal of Learning and Media|date=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=59–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gibbons, Damiana|author2=Drift, Téa|author3=Drift, Deanna|editor1-last=Fisherkeller|editor1-first=JoEllen|title=International Perspectives on Youth Media: Cultures of Production &amp; Education|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang Publishers|location=New York|pages=172–191|chapter=Whose Story Is It? Being Native and American: Crossing Borders, Hyphenated Selves}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Burn (professor)|Andrew Burn]] has expanded his own theory to discuss both this new temporal understanding of the kinekonic, but also by developing the idea of the ''metamodal kineikonic''. The metamodal kineikonic shows how modes "nest" in one another and how this nesting can be analysed at whatever level suits the purposes of the analyst, whether it be at the orchestrating level or at the smallest level of granularity, such as tonal contour in spoken language, or a lighting change.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The [[legend]] of '''Trentren Vilu and Caicai Vilu''' is a [[Mapuche]] [[flood myth]] that tells the story of a fierce battle between two mythical snakes, ''[[Ten Ten-Vilu|Trentren Vilu]]'' (trentren="related with the earth", vilu="snake") and ''[[Coi Coi-Vilu|Caicai Vilu]]'' (Caicai="related to water", vilu="snake").It explains how the south of [[Chile]] came to have its accidented geography.

== Myth ==
According to the Mapuche, these two snakes were originally the children of the most powerful [[Pillan|pillans]], who were converted into their animal forms as punishment.[[Peripillán]]'s son was turned into a huge snake that would be Caicai and [[Antu (Mapuche mythology)|Antu]]'s son turned into a huge snake that would be Tenten. They were to be enemies, just as Antu and Peripillán were. Caicai was sent to live in the sea to help care for it with the [[Ngen-ko]] (water spirits), and Tenten was sent to live on earth to help care for the earth with the other [[Ngen]], and to help humanity; thus these two snakes were used as an instrument through which the will of the ancient Mapuche spirits was fulfilled.

It is said that after Caicai awoke from his years-long slumber,he became enraged because of the ungratefulness that men showed for every gift given to them by the sea and thus used his fish-shaped tail to hit the water. With it began a great flood, since he had the desire to punish humanity and to incorporate all terrestrial life to its dominions. Caicai ordered the waters to flood the valleys and hills, and to bring all its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea.

Seeing Tenten, that both humans and animals were desperate and that men invoked her, and as by orders of her father, she was the one who had to provide them with wisdom and protection; she decided to help humanity. Thus she helped the inhabitants and the animals to escape by raising them on her back and taking them to the hills; and she transformed into birds those who were trapped by the waters, so they could escape by flying; those who were drowning into fish and marine mammals (one of them being the origin of the [[cahuelche]] (talking dolphin)), and those who had already drowned in [[sumpall]] (Mapuche [[Merman|mermen]] and [[mermaid]]s). Those who were immobilized by the terror they felt, were transformed into [[mankial]] (petrified). But as the sea continued to rise, Tenten had to order the hills to increase in height to counteract the power of Caicai. Angry, Caicai began to fight against Tenten in a titanic battle that lasted a long time, until both snakes were tired.Caicai was partially defeated as he wasn't able to flood all the land, however, the waters did not return completely to their old level, giving Chile its current geography.

According to [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] tradition,Caicai was satisfied with the portion of land that he had managed to flood, and delegated his functions pertaining to the sea to the great [[Millalobo]].

According to Mapuche tradition, after the cataclysm, everyone continued their quiet life; until one day it was Tenten who was angered by the attitude that men had, and made all the volcanoes erupt and the population had to move to other safer places. From that moment on, Tenten continues to manifest itself through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while Caicai causes tidal waves and floods when he rolls over during his sleep.

=== Similar myths ===
A variant of the myth tells that Caicai's anger against human beings began because a girl rejected her son, the [[Trauco]].

Some [[Huilliche people|Huilliche]] communities of Chiloé say that the battle originated because a daughter of the Trauco rejected the pillán Peripillán, and for this reason her son decided to take revenge.

In [[Argentina]] there are other later versions of the myth, which change the original parents of both mythical snakes, indicating that they would be brothers and/or sons of the gods [[Ngenechen|Nguenechèn]] and [[Kueyen]].

==The algorithm==

The input to the algorithm is a 2-player game ''G''.
''G'' is represented by two ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' game matrices A and B, containing
the payoffs for players 1 and 2 respectively, who have ''m'' and ''n'' pure strategies respectively.
In the following we assume that all payoffs are positive. (By rescaling, any
game can be transformed to a strategically equivalent game with positive payoffs.)

''G'' has two corresponding [[polytope]]s (called the ''best-response polytopes'')
P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in ''m'' dimensions and ''n'' dimensions respectively, defined as follows.

P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;; let {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;} denote the coordinates.
P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by ''m'' inequalities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,...,''m''},
and a further ''n'' inequalities
B&lt;sub&gt;1,''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+...+B&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1,
for all ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,...,''n''}.

P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;; let {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} denote the coordinates.
P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by ''n'' inequalities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0, for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,...,''n''},
and a further ''m'' inequalities
A&lt;sub&gt;''i'',1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;+...+A&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1,
for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,...,''m''}.

''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents the set of unnormalized probability distributions over player 1’s
''m'' pure strategies, such that player 2’s expected
payoff is at most 1. The first ''m'' constraints require the probabilities to be
non-negative, and the other ''n'' constraints require each of the ''n'' pure strategies of
player 2 to have an expected payoff of at most 1.
P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a similar meaning, reversing the roles of the players.

Each vertex ''v'' of P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is associated with a set of labels from the set
{1,...,''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''} as follows.
For ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''}, vertex ''v'' gets the label ''i'' if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 at vertex ''v''.
For ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, vertex ''v'' gets the label ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''j'' if ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1,''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.
Assuming that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is nondegenerate, each vertex is incident to ''m''
facets of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and has ''m'' labels.
Note that the origin, which is a vertex of P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, has the labels {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''}.

Each vertex ''w'' of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is associated with a set of labels from the set
{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''} as follows.
For ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, vertex ''w'' gets the label ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''j'' if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 at vertex&amp;nbsp;''w''.
For ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''}, vertex ''w'' gets the label ''i'' if
''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.
Assuming that P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is nondegenerate, each vertex is incident to ''n''
facets of P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and has ''n'' labels.
Note that the origin, which is a vertex of P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, has the labels {''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''}.

Consider pairs of vertices (''v'',''w''), ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
We say that (''v'',''w'') is ''completely labeled'' if the sets associated with ''v'' and ''w''
contain all labels {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''}. Note that if ''v'' and ''w'' are the origins of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
respectively, then (''v'',''w'') is completely labeled.
We say that (''v'',''w'') is ''almost completely labeled'' (with respect to some missing label ''g'')
if the sets associated with ''v'' and ''w''
contain all labels in {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''} other than ''g''.
Note that in this case, there will be a ''duplicate label'' that is associated with both
''v'' and ''w''.

A ''pivot operation'' consists of taking some pair (''v'',''w'') and replacing ''v'' with some
vertex adjacent to ''v'' in P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or alternatively replacing ''w'' with some
vertex adjacent to ''w'' in P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This has the effect (in the case that
''v'' is replaced) of replacing some label of ''v'' with some other label.
The replaced label is said to be ''dropped''. Given any label of ''v'', it is possible
to drop that label by moving to a vertex adjacent to ''v'' that does not contain the
hyperplane associated with that label.

The algorithm starts at the completely labeled pair (''v'',''w'') consisting of the pair of
origins. An arbitrary label ''g'' is dropped via a pivot operation, taking us to
an almost completely labeled pair (''v&amp;prime;'',''w&amp;prime;''). Any almost completely labeled pair
admits two pivot operations corresponding to dropping one or other copy of its
duplicated label, and each of these operations may result in another almost completely
labeled pair, or a completely labeled pair. Eventually the algorithm finds a
completely labeled pair (''v''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,''w''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;), which is not the origin.
(''v''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,''w''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) corresponds to a pair of unnormalised probability distributions
in which every strategy ''i'' of player 1 either pays that player 1, or pays less than 1 and is played
with probability 0 by that player (and a similar observation holds for
player 2). Normalizing these values to probability distributions, we have a Nash
equilibrium (whose payoffs to the players are the inverses of the normalization
factors).

==Properties of the algorithm==

The algorithm can find at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'' different Nash equilibria. Any choice of
initially-dropped label determines the equilibrium that is eventually found by
the algorithm.

The Lemke–Howson algorithm is equivalent to the following [[homotopy]]-based approach.
Modify ''G'' by selecting an arbitrary pure strategy ''g'', and giving the player who owns
that strategy, a large payment ''B'' to play it. In the modified game, that strategy ''g''
is played with probability 1, and the other player will play his best response
to ''g'' with probability 1. Consider the continuum of games in which ''B'' is
continuously reduced to 0. There exists a path of Nash equilibria connecting
the unique equilibrium of the modified game, to an equilibrium of ''G''.
The pure strategy ''g'' chosen to receive the bonus ''B'' corresponds to the
initially dropped label.

While the algorithm is efficient in practice, in the worst case the number
of pivot operations may need to be exponential in the number of pure strategies
in the game.

The '''MPEG Industry Forum''' ('''MPEGIF''') is a [[non-profit]] [[consortium]] dedicated to ''"further the adoption of [[MPEG]] Standards, by establishing them as well accepted and widely used standards among creators of content, developers, manufacturers, providers of services, and end users."''

The group is involved in many tasks, including promotion of [[MPEG]] standards (particularly [[MPEG-4]], [[MPEG-4 AVC]] / [[H.264]], [[MPEG-7]] and [[MPEG-21]]); developing MPEG certification for products; organising educational events; and collaborating on development of new ''[[de facto]]'' MPEG standards.

MPEGIF, founded in 2000,{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} has played a significant role in facilitating the widespread adoption and deployment of MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 as the industry’s standard video compression technology powering next generation television and most mainstream content delivery and consumption applications including packaged media.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} MPEGIF serves as a single point of information on technology, products and services for these standards, offers interoperability testing, a conformance program, marketing activities and is supporting over 50 international trade shows and conferences per year.

The key activities of the forum are structured via three main Committees:

* Technology &amp; Engineering
* Interoperability &amp; Compliance
* Marketing &amp; Communication

==2009–2010 focus areas==
* 3DTV
* Addressable advertising: extension and adoption of CableLabs SCTE-104 for all multimedia
* MPEG-4/Scalable Video Coding (SVC)
* Simplifying competitive licensing
* Quality of Experience / Quality of Service metrics
* Royalty free DRM initiatives
* Online Video / Internet Streaming
* IPTV ecosystem
* Ultra HD (7680x4320)
* MPEG/High-Performance Video Coding (HVC, H.265)
* MPEG-7 / MPEG-21

MPEGIF is also running the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080314162519/http://logo.mpegif.org/ MPEGIF Logo Qualification Program], which is designed to help guide interoperability among products and technology. The program, based on a self-certification process, is free of charge and open to all companies using MPEG technology, not just members of MPEGIF although, membership is encouraged. Qualified products have the right to display the MP4 Qualification Mark and also list their status in their documentation, literature, and advertising. They will also have their product listed in the MPEGIF Product Directory.

In June 2012 the MPEG Industry Forum officially "declared victory" and voted to close its operation and merge its remaining assets with that of the [[Open IPTV Forum]].

[[File:Marquise de Créquy.jpg|thumb|Victoire, marquise de Créquy]]
'''Renée-Caroline-''Victoire'' de Froulay de Tessé, marquise de Créquy de Heymont de Canaples d'Ambrières''' (1704–1803), was a French woman of letters, by marriage a member of the [[Créquy family]], which counted several distinguished public servants and prelates, particularly in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The ''Souvenirs de la Marquise de Créquy'' is attributed to her by university librarians.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/crequy/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ''Souvenirs'', which consists mainly of accurate noble genealogies and court gossip from the reigns of [[Louis XIV]], [[Louis XV]], [[Louis XVI]] and [[Napoleon]], there is a tale for which the author of the ''Souvenirs'' is the sole authority. This story, widely believed in France,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} is her statement, with a detailed story to back it up, that Britain's national anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]", was in fact written by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and sung by a French girls' school to greet Louis XIV.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The French author of ''Souvenirs'' further states that the tune was later plagiarized by [[Handel]] and sold to the British crown as their [[Royal anthem|anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/crequy/chap104.html#God_save_the_king ''Souvenirs'', Vol. I, Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is true, as some have claimed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} that the story about the sale of the anthem is actually from a much later tabloid, then this anachronism is a reason why the author of ''Souvenirs'' is sometimes placed in the company of forgers, alongside the authors of such works as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', ''[[De Situ Britanniae]]'', and [[Annio of Viterbo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} If, on the other hand, the French tabloids of the 1850s published Madame de Créquy's story based on her memoirs, it's possible she believed the story to be true, or that the story is true.

In July 2003, the company was acquired by Japanese advertising and marketing company firm [[Dentsu]] and renamed to '''Geneon Entertainment''', while its North American division, Pioneer Entertainment, was renamed to '''Geneon USA'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-07-21/dentsu-acquires-pioneer |title=Dentsu acquires Pioneer - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geneon USA===
Geneon had signed a deal with [[Viz Media]] (then known as Viz Communications) to release their properties to DVD such as ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Ranma ½]]'' before Viz began producing their own DVDs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} In November 2004, Geneon USA signed a deal with [[Toei Animation]] to distribute some of their titles into the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2004-11-11/geneon-entertainment-signs-distribution-agreement-with-toei-animation |title=Geneon Entertainment Signs Distribution Agreement with Toei Animation |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launching titles included ''[[Air Master]]'', [[Interlude (visual novel)|''Interlude'']], and ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]''. However, in late 2006, the deal ended and all of the released titles went out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-09-18/toei-dvds-cancelled |title=Toei DVDs Cancelled - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, Geneon became the exclusive North American distributor for [[Bandai Visual#Bandai Visual USA|Bandai Visual USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-05/bandai-visual-usa-new-licenses-and-distribution-deal |title=Bandai Visual USA new licenses and distribution deal - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, it was announced that [[A.D.

'''Oscar Chichoni''' (born July 14, 1957) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] illustrator of [[comic books]] and [[science fiction]] magazines and books.

==History==
Chichoni was born in a desolate hamlet in [[Corral de Bustos]], [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|province of Córdoba]], and is self-taught in art. He published his first comic books pictures at the age of 17 for the [[Argentina|Argentine]] publisher [[Editorial Record|Record]], and soon his work was paralleled to that of some famous authors like [[Alberto Breccia]], [[Juan Zanotto]] and [[Juan Giménez]].

Following this period as a comic book artist, Chichoni devoted himself to painting. He spent two times studying under the painter [[Álvaro Izurieta]], and began to draw book covers for several publishers, becoming soon renowned in all the world for his powerful and well-detailed anatomies.

In the second half of the 1980s he moved to [[Europe]], collaborating and winning various awards. His main collaboration is for the [[Italy|Italian]] editor [[Arnoldo Mondadori|Arnoldo Mondadori's]] science fiction series ''[[Urania (magazine)|Urania]]'' and its spin-offs.

Since 1995, Chichoni has been working as free-lance, mainly as ''conceptual creator'' for films. He collaborated on the graphic part of the videogames ''[[Starship Titanic]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]] and ''[[Broken Sword|Broken Sword 3]]''. He won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as art director for the film ''[[Restoration (1995 film)|Restoration]]'' by [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]]. In 2000 he published ''[[Mekanika]]'', his first collection of artworks.

Chichoni's best-known style combines mechanical intricacy and sensuality in a striking statement of Art Deco reborn. He is a man of many pencils, and is capable of countless other styles hard-edged, gothic, impressionist, almost anything that might fire the imagination.

Chichoni is currently living in [[London]], where he works in team with the architect [[Isabel Molina]].

The '''Prix Suzanne Bianchetti''' is an award in [[France|French]] cinema given annually since 1937 to the most promising young film actress.

The award was created by writer and actor [[René Jeanne]] (1887-1969) who served as the director of ''L'Etablissement Cinématographique des Armées''. When his wife, actress [[Suzanne Bianchetti]] died in 1936 at the age of 47, he established an award dedicated to her memory to be given annually to the most promising young actress.

The award was given for the first time in 1937 to actress [[Junie Astor]] for her performance in the film [[Women's Club (film)|Women's Club]]. The award comes in the form of a medallion engraved with Suzanne Bianchetti's image.

'''''RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] video game developed by Origin8 Technologies and published by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]]. The game combines features that were first seen in ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)|RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'' and ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 2]]'', which were both [[amusement park]] management simulators created by [[Chris Sawyer]] for the PC. The game was released worldwide for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2016, while a version for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] was released in September 2017.

==Gameplay==
{{main|RollerCoaster Tycoon#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in the ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' series}}
''Classic'' implements the same gameplay as the first two games in the ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' series. Played from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric view]], players are tasked with building or revitalizing an [[amusement park]] by adding rides, attractions, facilities, paths, landscaping, and staff to manage the park. In particular, the game allows players to plan out a wide array of custom [[roller coaster]]s and other rides using tracks, such as [[log flume (ride)|log flume]]s and [[go-kart]]s. The player also must manage the park's finances to make sure they bring in sufficient revenues from guests to cover the cost of running the park and installing new features.

==Development==
[[Chris Sawyer]] had developed the original ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'' and its sequel ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 2]]'', which released respectively in 1999 and 2002. The games had come out of his work developing a sequel to ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'', which he released in 1994.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt; Sawyer allowed [[Frontier Developments]] to develop ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'' while he worked on ''[[Chris Sawyer's Locomotion|Locomotion]]'', a 2004 [[spiritual successor]] to ''Transport Tycoon''.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt; Following this release, Sawyer had appeared to disappear from the games industry; according to Sawyer in a 2016 interview, he took this absence in part over the legal difficulties he had over securing unpaid royalties from [[Atari]], whom had acquired the rights to publish the ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' series through [[Infogrames]] purchase of [[Hasbro Interactive]]. He also stated that he was disappointed with the state of video games during this period which focused too much on violence.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt; 

Sawyer re-emerged in 2010 with the opening of 31X Ltd. a [[holding company]] for his ''Transport Tycoon'' [[intellectual property]]. However, he saw there was interest in a [[mobile game|mobile version]] of this game, and took 31X in a direction towards mobile development.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/196526/Chris_Sawyer_on_his_reentry_back_into_video_games.php | title =  Chris Sawyer on his reentry back into video games | first = Mike | last = Rose | date = July 19, 2013 | accessdate = September 28, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he announced the mobile version of ''Transport Tycoon'', developed with Origin8. With Origin8's help, Sawyer was able to convert the original ''Transport Tycoon'' code from a form that relied heavily on [[assembly code]] to transfer it into a more portable form.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt; The title was released in late 2013.  He considered the mobile release of ''Transport Tycoon'' a success, and that Origin8 was willing to continue to help port ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' into a similar mobile format. Sawyer also recognized that there was a demand for a game that used the more simple controls and graphics offered in the original ''Tycoon'' games, which worked well for mobile and touch-screen devices.&lt;ref name="eg interview"/&gt;  

In March 2016, Sawyer affirmed he had started work on ''RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic'' with Origin8, to be released for mobile devices.&lt;ref name="eg interview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yin-Poole|first1=Wesley|title=A big interview with Chris Sawyer, the creator of RollerCoaster Tycoon|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-03-a-big-interview-with-chris-sawyer-the-creator-of-rollercoaster-tycoon|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the rework of ''Transport Tycoon'', this required Sawyer and Origin8 to rework the assembly code from ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2'' into [[C (programming language)|C]]. They were also able to add new elements to the game during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zarrouk|first=Alexander|title=Chris Sawyer Interview anlässlich der Eröffnung von Klugheim im Phanatasialand - TALK ABOUT GAMES|url=http://www.talk-about-games.de/chris-sawyer-interview-anlaesslich-der-eroeffnung-von-klugheim-im-phanatasialand/|accessdate=July 24, 2016|date=July 15, 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the CEO of Atari stated that the game should appeal to both long-time fans, as well as new players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moscaritolo|first1=Angela|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Arrives on iOS, Android|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/350554/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-arrives-on-ios-android|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=PCMAG|date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television in New Zealand''' was [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1960]] as a state-run service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/baa19601960n34229/|title=Broadcasting Amendment Act 1960 (1960 No 34)|author=|date=|website=www.nzlii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcasting sector was deregulated in 1989, when the Government allowed competition to the state-owned [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ). There are currently three forms of broadcast television: a [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] ([[DVB-T]]) service provided by [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]]; [[Satellite television|satellite]] services provided nationwide by both Freeview and [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky]]; and an [[IPTV|internet television]] service delivered over cable and fibre broadband.

The first nationwide digital television service was launched in December 1998 by Sky, who had a monopoly on digital satellite television until the launch of Freeview's nationwide digital satellite service in May 2007. The Freeview digital terrestrial service launched on 14 April 2008. A pay digital terrestrial service was launched in 2012 by Igloo and closed in 2017; this was a joint venture between Sky and TVNZ and provided Freeview [[UHF]] aerial channels along with eleven Sky channels. Broadband television currently operates from [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]]. On July 2016, Sky announced that Igloo will be discontinued although Freeview channels will still be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/81909246/sky-tv-to-shut-down-igloo-in-march|title=Sky TV to shut down Igloo in March|author=|date=|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sky.co.nz/igloo-offer|title=Igloo Is Now Closed - SKY|author=|date=|website=sky.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vodafone service includes all Sky channels and Freeview channels.

The [[Digital changeover dates in New Zealand|digital changeover in New Zealand]] is now complete. It began on 30 September 2012, when [[Hawke's Bay]] and the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] (including parts of [[Tasman Region|Tasman]]) switched off analogue television transmission. The rest of the [[South Island]] switched off analogue television transmission on 28 April 2013, followed by the lower North Island on 29 September 2013. The upper North Island (including the Waikato, Auckland, Bay of Plenty and Northland) was the last region to cease analogue transmissions on 1 December 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== History ==
[[File:TV studios (26626656473).jpg|thumb|New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) filming in one of its studios, circa 1960s.]]
[[File:A Colour Television Test.jpg|thumb|A colour television test at the [[Mount Kaukau]] transmitting station in February 1970. Colour television was formally introduced to New Zealand in 1973-1975.]]
Full-time television broadcasting was first introduced in New Zealand in 1960 and transmitted from the NZBC's existing 1YA radio broadcasting facility at 74 Shortland Street in Auckland, now home to the [[University of Auckland]]'s [[Gus Fisher Gallery]]. The annual [[television licence fee]] was [[New Zealand pound|NZ£]]4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand's first official TV broadcast|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/first-official-tv-broadcast|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Walter Nash]] had made a surprise announcement (a surprise both to the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Service|NZBS]] and to other members of the [[Second Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]]) in London in November 1959 that New Zealand would have television within twelve months; the system was to be state-owned but to carry commercials, and would be introduced in stages in the four main centres. The first non-experimental programme was transmitted on Wednesday 1 June 1960.{{sfn| Horrocks &amp; Perry |2004|pp=52,53}}

Initially, programming was done on a regional basis, with different services broadcasting from the main cities, [[AKTV2]] in [[Auckland]], being the first on 1 June 1960, followed in 1961 by [[CHTV3]] in [[Christchurch]] on 1 June and [[WNTV1]] in [[Wellington]] on 1 July, and then [[DNTV2]] in [[Dunedin]] on 31 July 1962. Today, however, programming and scheduling is done in Auckland where all the major networks are now headquartered.

National won the [[New Zealand general election, 1960|1960 election]], and the new Minister of Broadcasting, [[Arthur Kinsella]] in the new [[Second National Government of New Zealand|National government]] rewrote the Broadcasting Act of 1936, and set up the state-owned [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] (NZBC) in 1962 to control public radio and television (although the party had been polarised between having a state-owned, private enterprise or mixed system). {{sfn| Horrocks &amp; Perry |2004|pp=53,54}}

The first [[broadcast relay station]]s were commissioned in 1963, extending television coverage to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Tauranga]] and [[Palmerston North]]. Coverage was further expanded to [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]-[[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] and [[Invercargill]] in 1964, [[Timaru]] in 1965, and [[Whangarei]] and [[New Plymouth]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |volume=351 |page=1394 |date= 28 June 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising was introduced to Aucklanders on 4 April 1961, and facilitated increasing transmission hours to twenty-eight per week. By 1962 there were 65,000 licences, by 1963 there were 80,000 licences and an estimated audience of 300,000 or one-eighth of the population, and by 1966 there were half a million licences. By the 1970s, almost every household had a set. {{sfn| Horrocks &amp; Perry |2004|pp=21,54,55}}

Initially, the hours of transmission were from 5pm until close at about 10pm, later extending, in 1966, to 2pm opening. A test pattern was transmitted from 9am to allow for adjustment of TV sets in homes by technicians.

It was not until 1969 that the four stations were networked; the NZBC's first live network news bulletin was read by [[Dougal Stevenson]] on Wednesday 5 November.

The NZBC had asked the Government for the approval of a second TV channel as early as 1964, but this was rejected as the Government considered increasing coverage of the existing TV service to be of greater priority. By 1971, however, two proposals for a second channel were under consideration: that of the NZBC for a non-commercial service; and a separate commercial channel to be operated by an Independent Television Corporation, headed by Gordon Dryden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-QjgclGkfVMC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=gordon+dryden+new+zealand+television&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qza8U4zHBsfwPL3IgeAJ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gordon%20dryden%20new%20zealand%20television&amp;f=false ''New Zealand Film and Television: Institution, Industry and Cultural Change''], Trisha Dunleavy, Hester Joyce, Intellect Books, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Broadcasting Authority had favoured the Independent Television Corporation bid, the incoming [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government favoured the NZBC's application and awarded it the licence without any formal hearings beforehand. (Eventually, Independent Television was awarded [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]50,000 in compensation.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=5Ti8U633MMPVOeiTgIgK&amp;id=kmkrAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=gordon+dryden+new+zealand+television&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=gordon+dryden+ ''Parliamentary Debates''], New Zealand. Parliament. House of Representatives 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday 31 October 1973, colour television using the [[Phase Alternating Line]] (PAL) system was introduced, in readiness for the [[1974 British Commonwealth Games]], which were to be held in Christchurch in January and February 1974. The final switchover for colour television was in December 1975.

=== Reorganisation ===
The introduction of a second TV channel (then called [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]]) on Monday 30 June 1975 also saw the reorganisation of broadcasting in New Zealand. The NZBC was dissolved in April of that year, with the two television channels, Television One and TV2, run separately from one another. TV2 was renamed [[South Pacific Television]] in 1976.

In 1978, the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ) was established, and in 1980, TV One and South Pacific (known once again as TV2) were merged into a single organisation, [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ).

=== Commercialisation ===
In 1988, following major economic reforms to the state sector, the BCNZ was dissolved. TVNZ and Radio New Zealand (RNZ) became separate "State-Owned Enterprises" (SOEs) which would have to compete commercially and return dividends to [[the Crown]].

Rather than continuing to be used to directly fund TVNZ and RNZ, the licence fee, now called the broadcasting fee, was to be used for local content production and the state funding for non-commercial broadcasting in radio and television on a contestable basis. As part of wide-ranging reforms in the broadcasting sector, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government of [[David Lange]] established the Broadcasting Commission, which became known as and finally called [[New Zealand on Air]].

Broadcasting in New Zealand was deregulated in 1989. Restrictions on television advertising were also revised in 1989, so that TVNZ channels could show advertisements anytime except Christmas Day, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday, and between 6am and noon on Anzac Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0025/latest/DLM158916.html|title=Broadcasting Act 1989 No 25 (as at 21 March 2017), Public Act 81 Advertising hours – New Zealand Legislation|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] became the first privately owned TV station in the country, finally ending the state monopoly. Restrictions on foreign ownership were also removed, and TV3 was subsequently sold to Canada's [[CanWest]]. Sky TV, in which TVNZ originally had a small stake, began broadcasting New Zealand's first pay TV service on three [[UHF]] channels.

Other free-to-air commercial television operators now include TV3's sister channel [[Four (New Zealand TV channel)|Four]] (previously known as [[C4 (TV channel)|C4]]) and [[Prime Television (New Zealand)|Prime TV]]. Sky TV remains the dominant pay-TV operator, now operating on [[satellite TV|satellite]], although [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]] also operates cable TV services.

Although TVNZ had to compete with its commercial rivals through the 1990s, it maintained a dominant market position and paid a significant amount of its profits to the Crown in dividends. By 1998–1999, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]–led coalition was moving to privatise TVNZ and announced that the broadcasting fee would be discontinued. Since the 1970s, the licence fee had been capped at NZ$100 a year, and was not allowed to increase with inflation. In real terms, this meant that public funding of broadcasting in New Zealand was greatly reduced by the time of the broadcasting fee's abolition.

However, the 1999 election saw a Labour-led coalition gain office. Over its next two terms, attempts were made to reintroduce public service functions to the sector. In 2003, TVNZ was restructured as a Crown-Owned Company with a public service Charter. The Charter, abolished by the Key National government in 2008, received a small amount of government subsidy, but TVNZ remains predominantly dependent on commercial revenue and is obliged to continue paying dividends to the Crown.

It can apply to NZ On Air (funded directly from the Government since 2000) for support in local content initiatives, such as drama and comedy, and funding of programming for minority groups such as gay, Christian and rural New Zealanders. The funding of Maori programming has since passed to [[Te Mangai Paho]], the Maori broadcasting commission.

In 2004, the [[Māori Television|Maori Television Service]] was established to promote Maori language and culture. MTS is funded partly through direct government funding and partly through commercial advertising, but is eligible for contestable programming funds from Te Mangai Paho.

In 2006, the Government announced the introduction of two new non-commercial digital television services operated by TVNZ, offering drama, arts, documentary and children's programming called [[TVNZ 6]] and [[TVNZ 7]]. However, after a change of Government, funding for the two channels was not renewed. In 2011, the children's channel, [[TVNZ 6]], was replaced by the commercial youth channel [[TVNZ U]], leaving New Zealand with no free to air children's television. [[TVNZ Kidzone|TVNZ Kidzone 24]] was subsequently established, but was only available behind a Sky TV pay wall before it ceased broadcasting in 2016. TVNZ 7 ceased broadcasting on 30 June 2012, with a number of its programs being picked up by other channels. In response, public broadcasting advocates announced plans to form a new lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/7521999/Today-in-politics-Wednesday-August-22|title=Today in politics: Wednesday, August 22|author=|date=|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freeview ==
{{main|Freeview (New Zealand)}}
Freeview is a non-profit organisation providing [[free-to-air]] [[digital television]] and [[digital radio]] to New Zealand. The Freeview service is available via [[satellite television|satellite]] throughout New Zealand. Freeview's terrestrial service is a [[high-definition television|high definition]] [[digital terrestrial television]] service available to 75 percent of the country's population, using [[DVB-S]] and [[DVB-T]] standards on government provided spectrum.

[[Digital television transition|Analogue switchoff]] in New Zealand was completed on 1 December 2013. A major benefit of digital television is the ability to overcome the poor reception caused by [[Geography of New Zealand|New Zealand's rugged topography]]. Digital TV offers more channels, better pictures and sound quality and new services such as on-screen programme guides.

It was estimated that on 31 December 2008, 198,938 Freeview certified [[set-top box]]es and [[Integrated Digital Television|IDTVs]] had been sold since the platform's launch (146,416 Satellite, 52,522 UHF). It is estimated that Freeview is in 12.6% of New Zealand homes (roughly 420,000 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freeviewnz.tv/images/uploads/pdfs/Freeview_Take-up_Release_26Jan09_Final.pdf |format=PDF |title= Freeview approaches the 200,000 homes mark |date= 6 October 2008 |accessdate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it New Zealand's third largest television platform, and New Zealand's second largest digital platform. Freeview-certified set-top boxes and [[Personal video recorder|PVR]]s are available at most major New Zealand retailers. Cheaper, uncertified equipment can also be used.

==Regional channels==
New Zealand's deregulated broadcasting environment has led to many regional stations (either non-commercial public service or privately owned) that broadcast only in one region or city. These stations mainly broadcast free to air on [[UHF]] frequencies, although some are carried on subscription TV. Content ranges from local news, access broadcasts, satellite sourced news, tourist information and Christian programming to music videos. Over a dozen regional television stations in New Zealand are grouped by the [http://www.regionaltv.co.nz/ Regional Broadcasters Association].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaltv.co.nz/|title=Regional Broadcasters Association|author=|date=|website=regionaltv.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free-to-air satellite channels==

{{see also|List of free-to-air TV channels in New Zealand#Satellite channels}}

Many digital channels are broadcast into New Zealand via satellite. These include Freeview, Sky Television, and many Australian and other channels. Most can be received using a standard [[FTA receiver#Blind scan|blind-scan]] capable set-top box in addition to the standard 60&amp;nbsp;cm satellite dish that is fitted to many houses.

== Pay television channels ==
New Zealand has a number of television channels that are, or have been, only available on pay television networks.

* Sky Network Television: In 1990, [[Sky Network Television]] (then, and again now,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Murdoch-to-sell-stake-in-Sky-TV/tabid/421/articleID/288859/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Murdoch to sell stake in Sky TV| date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrelated to its [[British Sky Broadcasting|UK namesake]]) launched three pay-TV channels offering movies, sport and news on UHF; these overtime expanded to five. In 1998 it launched a multichannel digital satellite TV service. 
* World TV: a Digital Broadcasting Media company, which broadcasts widely on Chinese TV and radio shows and some in Korean and Japanese in New Zealand. WTV signals can only be received by digital set-top boxes serviced by Sky TV.
* [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]]: currently operates a [[IPTV|Broadband TV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/tv/vodafone-tv|title=Vodafone TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; service delivered over cable and fibre broadband.

''The Greatest Story Never Told Chapter 2: Bread and Circuses'' was met with generally favorable reviews from [[music criticism|music critic]]s. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 69, based on 6 reviews, which indicates "positive reviews".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-greatest-story-never-told-chapter-2-bread-and-circuses/saigon The Greatest Story Never Told, Chapter 2: Bread And Circuses Reviews]. Metacritic. Retrieved on 2013-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Christgau]] of [[MSN Music]] found the album "slightly less militant and, as a direct result, stronger" than its predecessor and stated, "almost nothing here dips to ordinary. And beats or not, one reason is that the rapper's rough clarity is musical bedrock."&lt;ref name="Christgau"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=November 23, 2012|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=08173192-dc4c-4b73-b02a-bf54068df4b9|title=Saigon/Kendrick Lamar|publisher=[[MSN Music]].

Social conscience and political awareness are good, but occasionally they feel too much like he's making us eat our vegetables. "Brownsville Girl" comes across like an after-school special, while "Blown Away" is just straight-up ham-fisted in its tales of social injustice. These missteps aside, it's hard to argue with Bread and Circuses. It's not game changing, but Saigon's fanbase will love it, and sometimes it's better to stick with what you know."&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt; Amanda Bassa of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying "In true Sai-giddy fashion, he leaves his audience with some of his own lessons that he has learned in life. Rather than sounding preachy, he succeeds in leaving the impression that he simply wants other people to listen, understand, and take notes in hopes that children like his daughter won’t have to grow up in such a volatile environment (word to "Crazy World"). “Stocking Cap” Sai may be no more, but Saigon proves that he still hasn’t lost his touch on the mic."&lt;ref name=hiphopdx/&gt; 

Christopher Minaya of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave the album an XL, saying "In short, Saigon’s second LP offers a sizable amount of diversity over fitting instrumentals, exhibiting how much he has evolved as a rapper by personifying his bars to reflect his music and his life. The album is gratifying, surely enough to make those whom purchase the album to be happy with what they paid for."&lt;ref name=xxl/&gt; Steve Juon of RapReviews gave the album an eight out of ten, saying "As a sequel to "''The Greatest Story Never Told''" some people will feel that it's not as good as the original, but as for this reviewer Saigon is still that dude who has something to say that's worth hearing."&lt;ref name=rapreviews/&gt; David Jeffries of [[Allmusic]] gave the album four outr of five stars, saying "Still, the beats are as varied and well selected as the guest list which counts Styles P, Chamillionaire, Marsha Ambrosius, and Lecrae amongst its most desirable guest shots. A couple more albums this rich and Saigon might actually save the game, begging the question: then what will he rap about?"&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number 151 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, with first-week sales of 2,800 copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21872/title.hip-hop-album-sales-the-week-ending-11-4-2012 |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: The Week Ending 11/4/2012 |publisher=''HipHopDX'' |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toby Tolliver''' was a character in the "Toby and Susie Show," a long-running act in early 20th-century American theatrical [[tent show]]s.

Toby was largely a [[midwestern United States|Midwest product]]. His prototype is found everywhere in America, but is most closely identified with the tall corn and cotton country. He has been called by some the most enduring [[theater|theatrical]] figure in the [[Theater of the United States|American theatre]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Toby Tolliver is a [[rube]] in the grand tradition. His hair is bright as a fire truck, and he usually wears [[overalls]] that are likely as not held up by one strap. He speaks a low brand of [[English language|English]], and many [[etiquette|cultivated customs]] of society are beyond him.
 
Underneath Toby's country appearance and unsophisticated manner, there runs deep currents of native [[wit]], of cunning and resourcefulness. Unlike many rubes before him, Toby is True Blue. Sometimes he actually rises to the [[hero]]ic, though invariably he makes it appear accidental.

Toby is awkward, unlettered, boisterous, full of fun, with a great amount of [[common sense]]. He is the fellow in the play who says what the man in the audience wishes he could have thought of. Toby has been a [[show business]] character for a long time - some say since [[Shakespeare]]'s "[[Twelfth Night]]" first hit the "boards". For thirty-eight years, Toby and his counterpart Susie were the chief asset for Neil and Caroline, the [[Schaffner Players]]. They made the characters nationally famous by their appearance in their tent theatre, as [[radio]] stars and as features in countless national [[magazine]]s and network [[television]] appearances.

The '''UAAP Ballroom Formation Competition''' is a contest on [[Dancesport|dance sport]] among member-schools of the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]]. Its first edition was held on 3 September 2016 in UST Quadricentennial Pavilion Arena.&lt;ref name=upsweep&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/up-sweeps-inaugural-uaap-ballroom-formation-competition/65259|title=UP sweeps inaugural UAAP Ballroom Formation Competition|last=Valderrama|first=Aeron Paul|date=2016-09-03|work=Tiebreaker Times|access-date=2017-05-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2016/09/03/historic-opening-day-sets-motion-uaap-season-79-15134|title=Historic Opening Day sets in motion UAAP Season 79|last=Riego|first=Benjamin|date=2016-08-03|website=ABS-CBN SPORTS|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two categories: the Latin America division and the Standard division. The competition is only a demonstration sport; thus, it has no bearing in the overall standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/up/145093-up-sweeps-first-uaap-ballroom|title=UP sweeps first UAAP ballroom competition|last=Bracher|first=Jane|date=2016-08-03|work=Rappler|access-date=2017-05-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valentin Gneushev''' (born December 20, 1951) is a [[Russia]]n [[circus]] [[artistic director|director]] and [[choreographer]].

Gneushev was born in the city of [[Nizhny Tagil]] in the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Serdlovsk region]].
He studied to be a [[clown]] at the [[Moscow]] State Circus School and later graduated from the Russian Academy of Theatrical Arts as an artistic director.

The first circus act he worked on, the aerial group performance “Cranes” (1985), was an instant success. It was on tour in many countries and received various awards. 

In 1986, Gneushev’s "The Red Harlequin", performed by  Vladimir Tsarkov [http://www.veress.se/tsarkov.htm], was awarded the Gold Medal at the International Circus Festival in [[Paris]].

In 1989, he created an aerial act for Vladimir Kekhaial, who went on to work in [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s ''[[Nouvelle Expérience]]'' show and later became a star in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. 

In 1991 his show ''Cirk Valentin'' was performed at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The circus show, which used no animals and was designed for a theatrical stage, consisted entirely of acts created by Gneushev. An original music score for the show was written by [[composer]] [[Bobby Previte]].

[[Image:Evstafiev-circus-chimes.jpg|thumb|left|The "Chimes" aerial act that features a [[Cradle (circus act)|cradle]]. Photo by Mikhail Evstafiev]] 
Many of Valentin Gneushev’s acts have been used in different circuses, including the [[Moscow State Circus]], which often toured the [[United States]], the [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard]], Cirque du Soleil, which adopted them to their style, and in Las Vegas. 

His unique approach to creating circus acts has made him over the years one of the most influential directors in the contemporary circus and a regular invited guest of the prestigious annual [[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]].

In the 1990s Gneushev worked with the famous Russian clown [[Yuri Nikulin]] and was the artistic director of [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard|Nikulin’s Circus]] in Moscow.

Valentin Gneushev worked with prominent Russian film directors, such as [[Andrey Konchalovsky]], and theatre directors such as [[Roman Viktyuk]] and [[Konstantin Raikin]]. 

He also played in the 1977 [[USSR|Soviet]] children's [[fairy tale]] [[film]] [[The Scarlet Flower]] (Alenkiy Tsvetochek).

'''Vatican Radio's Belarusian Service''' is a structural department of the [[Vatican Radio]] broadcasting network in the [[Belarusian language]].

== History ==

=== Fr. Piotr Tatarynovich (1950-1970) ===

[[Vatican Radio|Lutheran Radio]] started regular broadcasting in the [[Belarusian language]] on January 6, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Catholic.by - Belarusian section of Vatican Radio marks its 60th anniversary (interview with Catholic.by)|url = http://catholic.by/2/en/news/home/belarus/34-belarus/101244-belarusian-section-of-vatican-radio-marks-its-60th-anniversary-interview-with-catholicby.html|website = catholic.by|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, on December 24, 1949, it transmitted [[Pope Pius XII]]'s message at Christmas and at the beginning of the Jubilee year in Belarusian. Roman Catholic priest Piotr Tatarynovich was the first editor-in-chief and for a long time the only staff member of the Belarusian Service.

Originally the programs were broadcast on a weekly basis and contained news from the Vatican, information on the Catholic church and the Belarusian diaspora, as well as catechesal and apologetic reflections. Later Fr. Kastus Maskalik joined the Service working mainly as an announcer. Bishop Ceslau Sipovich, Fr. Tamash Padzyava and some other Belarusian Catholic immigrants collaborated with the Service. After his retirement in 1970 Fr. Tatarynovich lived in Rome and was involved in publishing and translation activities.

=== Fr. Leu Garoshka (1970-1977) ===

Leu Garoshka, a Greek-Catholic priest, was in charge of the Vatican Radio's Belarusian Service from 1970 to 1977. By then, the number of programs had increased to five editions a week. Each edition lasted 14 minutes. Apart from the Vatican news, Fr. Garoshka focused on apologetic and Belarusian national themes. He developed a series of programmes on Christian aspects in the Belarusian literature, the history of [[Christianity in Belarus]], Belarusian religious figures and arguments for the existence of God by famous personalities, such as scientists, astronomers, composers.

=== Fr. Robert Tamushanski (1977-1996) ===

After Fr. Garoshka's death in 1977, the Service was headed by Fr. Robert Tamushansky. For the first time the staff included not only priests but also secular believers. In 1980, Pope John Paul II visited the Belarusian Service during his visit to the Vatican Radio. From 1988 to 1993, the Service produced a monthly newsletter on Christian and Belarusian national themes which was distributed by mail among Belarusian immigrants and believers. Live commentaries of solemn Vatican events were broadcast in the Belarusian language. With the opening of borders, the office of the Belarusian Service was visited by the Belarusian Catholic hierarchies, public and cultural figures: Vasyl Bykau, Rygor Baradulin, Anatol Hrytskevich, Adam Maldzis, Janka Zaprudnik, Vitaut Kipel, Fr. Jan Matusevich, Fr. Alexander Nadson, cardinal Kazimir Svyontek and others.

=== Fr. Claude Robinet (1996-2010) ===

In 1996, Belgian Jesuit Fr. Claude Robinet took charge. Contacts with the Belarusian Catholic Church increased during that period. Local correspondents started to send reports. The official website was launched.

== Fr. Aliaksandr Amialchenia (2010-) ==

Starting from 2010, the Belarusian Service was directed by Fr. Aliaksandr Amialchenia. During this period changes brought the Service up to modern broadcasting standards. In particular, the program structure was changed, focusing on relevance, timeliness and ease of comprehension. In April 2011, the Belarusian Service launched an Official Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Catholic.by - Belarusian editorial board of Vatican radio in Facebook|url = http://catholic.by/2/en/news/home/belarus/34-belarus/101530-belarusian-editorial-board-of-vatican-radio-in-facebook.html|website = catholic.by|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a week the Service prepares a weekly summary broadcast by the Belarusian radio’s First channel.

The Vatican Radio's Belarusian Service develops a daily 19-min. edition. Its first part includes a block of latest news updates, while the second part includes a thematic section.

== Frequencies ==

Daily editions are broadcast at 19:00 (Italian time; UTC+1:00) on short wave 49 meters and 6185&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency (winter time) or 25 meters and 11715&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency (summer time). The programs are replayed at 11:20 (Italian time; UTC+1:00) at FM 93.3&amp;nbsp;MHz (Rome area). On Sundays at 8:55 the Belarusian Radio’s First Channel broadcasts a five-minute news edition prepared by the Vatican Radio's Belarusian Service on the FM-range covering the whole territory of Belarus.

It took place on November 2, 2018, at [[King Saud University Stadium]] in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Corporate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2018/10-06-2018|title=WWE® CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH SET FOR CROWN JEWEL|work=WWE Corporate|date=October 6, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event hosted the first-ever WWE World Cup tournament "to determine the best in the world".&lt;ref name=WWE917 /&gt; It also marked the in-ring return of [[Shawn Michaels]], who retired in 2010, as well as the return of [[Hulk Hogan]]—who had not appeared on WWE television since a [[Hulk Hogan#Scandal and departure|2015 scandal]]—who served as the event's host.

The card comprised of twelve matches, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, [[D-Generation X]] ([[Triple H]] and Shawn Michaels) defeated [[The Brothers of Destruction]] ([[The Undertaker]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]). In the penultimate match, [[Shane McMahon]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]] to win the WWE World Cup after replacing [[The Miz]], who was ruled unable to compete after originally qualifying for the final. In other prominent matches,  [[The Bar (professional wrestling)|The Bar]] defended the [[SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], [[A.J. Styles|AJ Styles]] defeated [[Samoa Joe]] to retain the [[WWE Championship]], and [[Brock Lesnar]] defeated [[Braun Strowman]] to win the vacant [[WWE Universal Championship]] for a record second time.

Due to the controversy surrounding the [[killing of Jamal Khashoggi]], WWE faced harsh criticism for continuing on with the event despite the killing and was asked to stop its business ventures in Saudi Arabia by multiple parties. The controversy also led to the company's top [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]], [[John Cena]] and [[Daniel Bryan]], boycotting the show. The event itself was negatively received, in particular due to the Universal Title bout and the World Cup final.

Next, The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) (with Big Show) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) (with Xavier Woods). In the end, Sheamus countered a ''Big Ending'' from Big E and shoved Big E into Big Show, who was standing on the ring apron. Whilst the referee was distracted, Show performed a ''Knockout Punch'' on Big E and Sheamus performed a ''Brogue Kick'' on Big E to retain the title.&lt;ref name="CrownJewel"/&gt;

After that, The Miz faced Rey Mysterio in SmackDown's WWE World Cup semi-final match. Miz performed the ''Skull Crushing Finale'' on Mysterio for a nearfall. Mysterio performed the ''619'' on Miz. In the end, Miz countered a splash from Mysterio into a roll-up for the win to earn a spot in the finals.&lt;ref name="CrownJewel"/&gt;

Next, Seth Rollins faced Dolph Ziggler (with Drew McIntyre) in Raw's WWE World Cup semi-final match. Rollins and Ziggler exchanged a number of roll-ups for nearfalls. Rollins performed a ''Rip Cord Knee'' on Ziggler for a nearfall. Rollins performed a suicide dive on Ziggler. Ziggler performed a ''Famouser'' on Rollins for a nearfall. Ziggler countered a ''Falcon Arrow'' into a ''Zig-Zag'' on Rollins for a nearfall. In the end, as Rollins attempted a splash on Ziggler, McIntyre pushed Rollins and Ziggler performed a Superkick on Rollins to win the match to advance to the finals.

In the ninth match, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Samoa Joe. Joe dominated Styles early in the match and began to target Styles' knee. Joe performed a suicide dive on Styles outside the ring. In the end, Styles performed a ''Phenomenal Forearm'' on Joe to retain the title.&lt;ref name="CrownJewel"/&gt;

After that, Braun Strowman faced Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) for the vacant Universal Championship. Acting General Manager Baron Corbin came out to present the title to the winner. Before the match began, Corbin attacked Strowman with the title. Lesnar attacked Strowman with three ''F-5s'', however, all three resulted in nearfalls. Lesnar performed another ''F-5'' on Strowman, but to the outside of the ring, forcing Strowman to beat a countout. In the end, Lesnar performed a fifth ''F-5'' on Strowman to regain the title. With this win, Lesnar became the first two-time Universal Champion.&lt;ref name="CrownJewel"/&gt;

In the penultimate match, The Miz was originally supposed to face Dolph Ziggler (with Drew McIntyre) in the finals of the WWE World Cup. McIntyre was immediately ejected at ringside. As McIntyre headed to the back, Miz attacked Ziggler before the bell and threw him outside the ring. As Miz exited the ring, he tweaked his leg (kayfabe), which led to him unable to compete. This led to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon taking Miz's place in the match. As the match officially began, McMahon attacked Ziggler, however, Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin interfered only to get ejected himself. Ziggler performed a ''Zig-Zag'' on McMahon for a nearfall. In the end, McMahon performed a ''Coast to Coast'' on Ziggler to win the match and the WWE World Cup, and celebrated throughout the arena with the trophy.&lt;ref name="CrownJewel"/&gt;

===Main event===
In the main event, D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) in Michaels' first match since 2010, as well as the first time that the two tag teams ever faced each other in a tag team match. During the match, all four men brawled, leading to outside the ring where Kane put Triple H through an announce table. Michaels performed a moonsault from the top rope on Undertaker and Kane outside the ring. The end came when Michaels performed ''Sweet Chin Music'' on Kane, followed by a ''Pedigree'' from Triple H, who pinned Kane to win the match. During the match, Triple H was legitimately injured, suffering a torn [[pectoral muscle]].&lt;ref name="CrownJewel"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After his interference in the WWE Universal Championship title match, Braun Strowman sought revenge against Baron Corbin. After chasing him through the arena during the next ''Raw'' episode, [[Stephanie McMahon]] struck a bargain with him a week later: if he ceased attacking Corbin until after [[Survivor Series (2018)|2018]] [[Survivor Series]] and led "Team Raw" to victory, he would be granted a match against Corbin and another Universal Championship title match against Brock Lesnar, and could freely determine the stipulations in either match.&lt;ref name="11/5 Raw"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=11/05 Powell’s WWE Raw Live TV Review: Survivor Series developments, Raw Tag Title match, Riott Squad vs. Sasha Banks, Bayley, and Natalya, Dolph Ziggler vs. Elias, Nia Jax vs. Ember Moon, Bobby Lashley vs. Finn Balor|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/05/11-05-powells-wwe-raw-live-tv-review-survivor-series-developments-raw-tag-title-match-riott-squad-vs-sasha-banks-bayley-and-natalya-dolph-ziggler-vs-elias-nia-jax-vs-ember-moon-bobby-lash/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=November 5, 2018|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11/12 Raw"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=11/12 Powell’s WWE Raw Live TV Review: Brock Lesnar and Stephanie McMahon appear, Alexa Bliss names the women’s Team Raw, last two men announced for men’s Team Raw, final hype for WWE Survivor Series|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/12/11-12-powells-wwe-raw-live-tv-review-brock-lesnar-and-stephanie-mcmahon-appear-alexa-bliss-names-the-womens-team-raw-last-two-men-announced-for-mens-team-raw-final-hype-for-ww/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Survivor Series, Strowman eliminated 4 of the 5 members of "Team Smackdown" and led his team to a decisive victory.&lt;ref name="Survivor Series"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell’s WWE Survivor Series live review: WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar vs. WWE Champion Daniel Bryan, Raw Women’s Champion Ronda Rousey vs. Charlotte Flair in a non-title match, Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins vs. U.S. Champion Shinsuke Nakamura|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/18/powells-wwe-survivor-series-live-review-wwe-universal-champion-brock-lesnar-vs-wwe-champion-daniel-bryan-raw-womens-champion-ronda-rousey-vs-charlotte-flair-in-a-non-title-match/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=November 18, 2018|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following ''Raw'', he was granted his match against Corbin at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs (2018)|2018]] [[WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs]], which he stipulated to be a [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|namesake match]].

The involvement of Shane McMahon in the WWE World Cup final was used a build-up towards Survivor Series. It drew heavy criticism from various wrestlers on the ''Raw'' roster. Acting General Manager Baron Corbin accused McMahon of stealing the World Cup from ''Raw'' and of having massively abused his power. The same statements were reiterated by Dolph Ziggler, who called McMahon's actions a conspiracy, and his partner [[Drew McIntyre]]. Both wrestlers proclaimed Ziggler to be the "true best in the world". Furthermore, Stephanie McMahon called her brother's actions "an insult to the entire ''Raw'' locker room" and urged Braun Strownman to rectify this wrong by leading "Team Raw" to victory at Survivor Series.&lt;ref name="11/5 Raw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="11/12 Raw"/&gt; On the ''Smackdown Live'' episode following Crown Jewel, general manager [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] announced Shane McMahon as the "best in the world", drawing a negative crowd reaction. McMahon admitted that he is indeed not the best wrestler in the world, but saw it as his duty as the commissioner of ''Smackdown Live'' to assure that his brand won the WWE World Cup. As The Miz had originally qualified for the final, he took credit for McMahon's victory and subsequently demanded to captain "Team Smackdown", to which McMahon and Paige obliged, naming him co-captain along with Daniel Bryan. Bryan and Miz then named McMahon as part of "Team Smackdown" on the grounds of him winning the WWE World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnett|first=Jake|title=11/06 Barnett’s WWE Smackdown Live TV Review: Samoa Joe vs. Jeff Hardy for a spot on Team Smackdown, Becky Lynch faces a newcomer, New Day vs. The Usos with Survivor Series ramifications|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/06/11-06-barnetts-wwe-smackdown-live-tv-review-samoa-joe-vs-jeff-hardy-for-a-spot-on-team-smackdown-becky-lynch-faces-a-newcomer-new-day-vs-the-usos-with-survivor-series-ramifications/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=November 6, 2018|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the men's Survivor Series match, McMahon eliminated Ziggler, who kept on referring to himself as the "best in the world", but could not help his team overcome Braun Strowman, who almost single-handedly eliminated most of his team. Altogether, ''Smackdown Live'' suffered a clean sweep on the [[pay-per-view]], only winning the tag team match on the pre-show.&lt;ref name="Survivor Series"/&gt;

Furthermore, the Miz tried to convince Shane McMahon to form a tag team, again painting McMahon's win at the WWE World Cup as a team effort. However, their tag team, branded by Miz as "The Best Team in the World", lost its debut match to a duo of [[jobber|local competitors]] after a roll-up to Miz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnett|first=Jake|title=11/20 Barnett’s WWE Smackdown Live TV Review: Shane McMahon addresses Smackdown being swept at Survivor Series, Daniel Bryan and Charlotte explain their recent actions, New Day vs. Sheamus, Cesaro, and Big Show in a Thanksgiving Feast Fight|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/20/11-20-barnetts-wwe-smackdown-live-tv-review-shane-mcmahon-addresses-smackdown-being-swept-at-survivor-series-daniel-bryan-and-charlotte-explain-their-recent-actions-new-day-vs-sheamus-cesaro-a/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=November 20, 2018|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Killing of Jamal Khashoggi|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}
As had already been the case with their previous show in Saudi Arabia, [[WWE Greatest Royal Rumble|Greatest Royal Rumble]], WWE came under scrutiny for catering to a state [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|accused of severe human rights abuses]], leading a [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|war of attrition in Yemen]] and [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|suppressing women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=WWE's Saudi Arabia Nightmare|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/evw7va/wwes-saudi-arabia-nightmare|work=Vice|date=October 16, 2018|access-date=October 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to restrictions on women under Islamic law in Saudi Arabia, women have not been allowed to perform at WWE's events in Saudi Arabia, although female performer [[Renee Young]] did provide commentary at Crown Jewel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/renee-young-be-part-wwe-crown-jewel-announce-team-269096|title=Renee Young to be part of WWE Crown Jewel announce team|date=30 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the announcement of Crown Jewel, WWE announced its first-ever all-women's pay-per-view event, [[WWE Evolution]], which took place on October 28, 2018. [[Triple H|Paul "Triple H" Levesque]], WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative, denied that Evolution was intended to be a counterpoint for the all-male Saudi Arabia events, explaining that WWE's female performers "deserve[d] the opportunity" for such a showcase, and that it "was simply the right time for this to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/24177228/wwe-triple-h-stephanie-mcmahon-discuss-upcoming-all-women-evolution-pay-per-view|title=WWE announces all-women pay-per-view event, Evolution|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 25, 2018|quote="Let's take the Saudi Arabia show off the table, and let's just say it never happened -- would anybody question that they deserve this opportunity?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wake of the [[killing of Jamal Khashoggi]] at the hands of Saudi agents, WWE has faced calls to cancel the event, with prominent U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians criticizing the company's endeavors in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reed|first=Adam|title=Multimillion-dollar WWE pay-per-view deal in jeopardy due to Saudi Arabia tensions|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/multi-million-dollar-wwe-pay-per-view-deal-in-jeopardy-due-to-saudi-arabia-tensions.html|work=CNBC|date=October 12, 2018|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions were raised whether because of the position of [[Administrator of the Small Business Administration]] [[Linda McMahon]], who is the wife of WWE CEO [[Vince McMahon]] and a former WWE executive herself, WWE's endeavors in Saudi Arabia could still be viewed as a strictly private business enterprise.

== Reception ==
The show received generally negative to mixed reviews from critics. The conclusions to the World Cup tournament and Universal Championship match in particular received severe criticism.

[[CBS Sports]]' Adam Silverstein and Jack Jorgensen gave the event a "C-" rating, describing that the show "failed as a normal event but at least had enough to talk about afterward", while finding the booking and WWE's long-term plans questionable. The Universal Championship match received a "D+" rating, with Lesnar's "surprise" win being listed as a positive but being wholly outweighed by "no offense from Strowman". Five matches received a "C+" rating, including the Styles-Joe WWE Championship match for being "relatively slow", the WWE World Cup Final for being "creative though a bit confounding", and the main event tag match between DX and the Brothers of Destruction, which offered "effort and nostalgia ... but not much more" given the wrestlers' age resulting in them "operating at 50 percent of their prior capacity".&lt;ref name="CBSSports"&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE Crown Jewel results, recap, grades: Surprising new champion, World Cup winner crowned|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-crown-jewel-results-recap-grades-surprising-new-champion-world-cup-winner-crowned/|publisher=CBS Sports|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan Rose of the ''Wrestling Observer'' described Crown Jewel as a show that ended "mercifully" after a "very plodding, long" main event. Despite this, Rose noted that the tag team main event was better than the main event at [[WWE Super Show-Down|Super Show-Down]]. Of the WWE World Cup matches and the SmackDown tag title match, most were "paint by numbers" or "nothing special", with only Ziggler-Angle "decent" and Ziggler-Rollins "pretty good". Meanwhile, the matches of Ziggler-McMahon and Lesnar-Strowman "couldn't be more destructive towards people that need a boost the most", while a "McMahon winning [the WWE World Cup], which was to crown the best in the world, feels like an allegory for something." Lastly, Styles-Joe "was good while it lasted, but they’ve had better matches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Bryan|title=WWE Crown Jewel live results: HHH &amp; HBK vs. Undertaker &amp; Kane|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/wwe-crown-jewel-live-results-hhh-hbk-vs-undertaker-kane-269266|website=f4wonline.com|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Powell of ''Pro Wrestling Dot Net'', who viewed the event as a "cash grab" by WWE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=Stephanie McMahon says running WWE Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia is a business decision|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/10/30/stephanie-mcmahon-says-running-wwe-crown-jewel-in-saudi-arabia-is-a-business-decision/|website=prowrestling.net |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "Crown Jewel was gross for all the obvious reasons, including Vince McMahon doubling down on the controversy by bringing back Hulk Hogan." For the main event tag match, Powell wrote that despite their efforts, "everyone involved came up short regardless of how much gushing the broadcast team did afterward", and the four veterans were instead "stealing the spotlight from the deserving full-time stars of yet another generation". Powell felt that all the WWE World Cup tournament matches were "basic and brief", and that Shane McMahon (for some reason Powell could not understand) had become "yet another heel authority figure" in WWE. Powell did manage to find a few positives with the show, including the decision not to rush into giving Strowman a world title and a "quality Kickoff Show match" between Rusev and Nakamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=Powell’s WWE Crown Jewel Hit List: Undertaker and Kane vs. Shawn Michaels and Triple H, Brock Lesnar vs. Braun Strowman for the vacant WWE Universal Championship, AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe for the WWE Championship, World Cup tournament|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/03/powells-wwe-crown-jewel-hit-list-undertaker-and-kane-vs-shawn-michaels-and-triple-h-brock-lesnar-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-vacant-wwe-universal-championship-aj-styles-vs-samoa-joe-for-the-wwe/|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
