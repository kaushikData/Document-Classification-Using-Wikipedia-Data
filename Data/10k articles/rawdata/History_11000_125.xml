The [[September 11 attacks]] transformed [[George W. Bush's first term as President of the United States|the first term of President George W. Bush]] and led to what he has called the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]]. The accuracy of describing it as a "war" and the political motivations and consequences are the topic of strenuous debate. The US government increased military operations, economic measures and political pressure on groups it accused of being terrorists, as well as on governments and countries accused of sheltering them. October 2001 saw the first military action initiated by the US. Under this policy, the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|NATO invaded Afghanistan]] in order to remove the [[Taliban]] regime (which harbored [[al-Qaeda]]) and to capture al-Qaeda forces.

The war, however, is ongoing and has not been won. Critics point out that the Afghan conflict has contributed to the destabilization of neighbouring [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Coughlin |first=Con |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/concoughlin/4945286/If-we-win-the-war-in-Afghanistan-we-could-lose-a-battle-in-Pakistan.html |title=If we win the war in Afghanistan, we could lose a battle in Pakistan |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Afghanistan itself is far from at peace—[[Paddy Ashdown|Lord Ashdown]], British diplomat and former international [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], has gone as far as to describe the country as "a [[failed state]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7237373.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; Andrew Marr Show &amp;#124; Afghanistan 'is a failed state' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government has also [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|asserted that the US invasion of Iraq is connected to 9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;President Bush said "The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terrorism that began on September 11, 2001..." {{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/05/20030501-15.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024122431/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/05/20030501-15.html |archivedate=October 24, 2016 |df=mdy }}, and the disco dancer Vice President Dick Cheney suggested that Iraq was involved in the September 11 attacks during a "Meet the Press" interview: Iraq is "the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9-11" (Knight-Ridder October 3, 2003, archived at {{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1003-08.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108191131/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1003-08.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2006 |df=mdy }}). Also, the US government has continued to maintain that the war on Iraq is critical to the American "War on Terrorism". "In the war on terrorism, Iraq is now the central front..." said President Bush on December 14, 2005. {{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051214-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818211424/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051214-1.html |archivedate=August 18, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediate ==

===Rescue and recovery===
{{cleanup|section|date=September 2009}}
{{Main|Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center}}
Rescue and recovery efforts took months to complete. It took weeks simply to put out the fires burning in the rubble of the WTC, and the clean-up was not completed until May 2002. Many relief funds were immediately set up to assist victims of the attacks. The task of providing [[Financial assistance following the September 11, 2001 attacks|financial assistance]] to the [[Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks|survivors]] and the families of victims is still ongoing.

LiveLeak.com posted a video online showing a large military presence in New York City shortly after the attacks and US troops taking part in the clean-up operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cfd_1221132022|title=Military Presence During the Aftermath of 9/11|publisher=LiveLeak.com|accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of survivors and surprisingly few intact victims' remains were found in the rubble of the WTC. The forces unleashed by the towers' disintegration were so great that many of those trapped in the buildings were pulverized in the collapse. Some victims had to be identified by a few scraps of flesh or individual teeth. Most bodies were never found, presumably because the heat of the fires incinerated them. On January 18, 2002, the last hospitalized survivor of the World Trade Center attack was released from the hospital. As late as April 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060414/ap_on_re_us/attacks_remains_3] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; small fragments of human remains were still being found on adjacent buildings in New York.
[[File:US Navy 010914-N-1350W-002 fires burning amidst WTC rubble.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fires burned amidst the rubble of the World Trade Center for weeks after the attack.]]
Over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million tons of debris produced by the collapse of the WTC posed unique problems for the cleanup effort. A fully occupied skyscraper had never collapsed before, and the environmental and health consequences of such an event were unknown. About 100 tons of [[asbestos]] used in the construction of the WTC had not yet been fully removed. The attacks released dense clouds of dust containing pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, and other airborne contaminants.

By 2004, nearly half of more than 1,000 screened rescue-and-recovery workers and volunteers reported new and persistent respiratory problems, and more than half reported persistent psychological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r040909.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306141148/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r040909.htm|archivedate=March 6, 2005|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2005-05-15|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the long latency period between exposure and development of asbestos-related diseases, exposed [[Manhattan]] residents, especially rescue-and-recovery workers, may suffer future adverse health effects. The January 6, 2006 death of NYPD [[James Zadroga]] was ruled by a New Jersey coroner as directly due to clean-up at the WTC site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/66893.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911165419/http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/66893.htm|date=September 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was unequivocally rejected in October 2007 by the New York City Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles Hirsch, and Medical Examiner Michele Slone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071018/ap_on_re_us/attacks_health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028153610/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071018/ap_on_re_us/attacks_health|date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the attack, the 1.5&amp;nbsp;million tons of debris had been removed from the WTC site, and work continued below ground level, despite concerns that the [[slurry wall]] encompassing the site foundation—known as [[the Bathtub]]—might collapse. Ceremonies marking the completion of debris removal took place at the end of May 2002.

==Domestic==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}

=== Security ===
{{See also|Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks}}
The September 11 attacks also precipitated a focus on domestic security issues and the creation of a new cabinet-level federal agency, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. The [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of 2001 was passed soon after the attacks, giving law enforcement agencies sweeping search and [[surveillance]] powers over US citizens without a warrant. This led to the creation in 2002 of the [[Information Awareness Office]] (IAO), led by [[John Poindexter]]. The IAO has initiated a program called Total Information Awareness, amended in May 2003 to Terrorist Information Awareness (TIA), with the aim of developing technology that would enable it to collect and process massive amounts of information about every individual in the United States, and trace patterns of behavior that could help predict terrorist activities. The information the IAO would gather includes Internet activity, credit card purchase histories, airline ticket purchases, car rentals, medical records, [[transcript (education)|educational transcripts]], [[driver's license]]s, utility bills, tax returns, and other available data. Critics of the IAO believe it goes too far in the sacrifice of [[civil liberties]] and [[privacy]], putting in place an [[Orwellian]] infrastructure prone to abuse. Many major events the United States has hosted since September 11, 2001 have been designated [[National Special Security Event]]s (NSSE), because of concerns of terrorism. [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] [[Police chief|Chief]] [[Charles H. Ramsey|Charles Ramsey]] made the point clear before the [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|state funeral of former US president Ronald Reagan]]: "In a post 9/11 world we have to be very concerned about that and aware of the potential for something to happen."

In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States and other countries around the world were placed on a high state of alert against potential follow-up attacks. Civilian air travel across the US and Canada was—for the first time ever—almost completely suspended for three days with numerous locations and events affected by [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11, 2001 attacks|closures, postponements, cancellations, and evacuations]]. 

===US public reaction===
[[Image:WTC-remnant highres.jpg|200px|thumb|right|September 13, 2001: A New York City firefighter looks up at what remains of the South Tower.]]
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, George W. Bush's job approval rating soared to 86%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001/09/16/poll.htm|title=Poll finds a united nation|author=Benedetto, Richard and Patrick O'Driscoll|date=September 16, 2001|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2001, the president spoke before the nation and a joint-session of [[United States Congress|Congress]], regarding the events of that day, the intervening nine days of rescue and recovery efforts, and his intent in response to those events in going after the terrorists who orchestrated the attacks. In the speech, he characterized the speech itself as being akin to the President's customary State of the Union address.

The attacks also had immediate and overwhelming effects upon the United States population. People began rallying around the popularized phrase, "United We Stand," in hopes of being resilient and keeping the American spirit alive in the face of a devastating attack. The majority of the US population rallied behind President Bush and the federal government in widespread support to the recovery and the expectant reaction to the attacks. Many people joined together to help the victims. Gratitude toward uniformed public-safety workers, and especially toward firefighters, was widely expressed in light of both the drama of the risks taken on the scene and the high death toll among the workers. Many people paid tribute to the police officers and fire fighters who died during the attacks by wearing NYPD and FDNY hats. The number of casualties among the emergency service personnel was unprecedented. The highly visible role played by [[Rudy Giuliani]], the Mayor of New York City, won him high praise nationally and in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rudolph Giuliani Rudy the Rock|date=September 22, 2001|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] by ''[[TIME|Time]]'' magazine for 2001, and at times had a higher profile in the US than President [[George W. Bush]].

[[Blood donation]]s saw a surge in the weeks after 9/11. According to a report by the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], "...the number of blood donations in the weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks was markedly greater than in the corresponding weeks of 2000 (2.5 times greater in the first week after the attacks; 1.3–1.4 times greater in the second to fourth weeks after the attack)."&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, Simone A. "[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/17/2246?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1119520325357_713&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;volume=289&amp;firstpage=2246&amp;journalcode=jama Effect of a National Disaster on Blood Supply and Safety: The September 11 Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201083415/http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/17/2246?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1119520325357_713&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;volume=289&amp;firstpage=2246&amp;journalcode=jama|date=December 1, 2010}}." ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', '''289''', 2246–2253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major public reactions to the attacks were a surge of public expressions of patriotism not seen since World War II, marked most often by displays of the American flag; and an unprecedented level of respect, sympathy, and admiration for New York City and New Yorkers as a group by Americans in other parts of the United States. Some criticized this particular reaction, noting that not everyone who died was from New York City (for example, some of the passengers on the planes), and that the [[Arlington, Virginia]] community also suffered in the attacks. At the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] that took place in New York in February 2002, a tribute was paid to the search and rescue dogs who not only assisted in locating survivors and bodies from the rubble, but were also inside the World Trade Center buildings before they collapsed.

====Backlash and hate crimes====

{{see also|Islamophobia}}
In the weeks following the attacks, there was a surge in incidents of harassment and hate crimes against [[South Asia]]ns, Middle Easterners, and anyone thought to be "Middle Eastern-looking" people—particularly [[Sikh]]s, because Sikh males usually wear [[turban]]s, which are [[racism|stereotypically]] associated with Muslims by many Americans. [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a Sikh man, was one of the first victims of this [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]]; he was shot dead on September 15 at the gas station he owned in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. In many cities there were reports of vandalism against mosques and other Islamic institutions, including some cases of arson.&lt;ref name="Hate crime reports up in wake of terrorist attacks"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/gen.hate.crimes/|title=Hate crime reports up in wake of terrorist attacks|date=September 17, 2001|accessdate=2011-07-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620204632/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/gen.hate.crimes/|archivedate=June 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|publisher=CNN|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0,1370,-1019-12850,00.html|title=Many minority groups were victims of hate crimes after 9-11|date=October 9, 2003|publisher=[[Ball State University]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723050203/http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0%2C1370%2C-1019-12850%2C00.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-07-21|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saalt.org/attachments/1/American%20Backlash%20report.pdf|title=American Backlash: Terrorists Bring War Home in More Ways Than One|year=2003|publisher=SAALT|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140832/http://static.911digitalarchive.org/REPOSITORY/OTHER_OBJECTS/6object.pdf|archivedate=December 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-07-21|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79281024.html|title=645 racial incidents reported in week after September 11|last=Thayil|first=Jeet|date=October 12, 2001|newspaper=India Abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year after the attack, anti-Muslim hate crimes jumped 1,600 percent and this is further aggravated by a climate of prejudice that manifests in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pre-Post-Racial America: Spiritual Stories from the Front Lines|last=Jha|first=Sandhya Rani|publisher=Chalice Press|year=2015|isbn=9780827244931|location=St. Louis|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only death officially recorded as a homicide in New York City on September 11 was [[Henryk Siwiak homicide|Henryk Siwiak]], a [[Polish American|Polish immigrant]] who was shot in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]]. While he had taken a wrong turn on his way to a new job onto a street known for high rates of robbery and drug dealing, his family has theorized he may have been the victim of a hate crime in the wake of the attacks, since he was wearing camouflage clothing, had dark hair and spoke imperfect, heavily accented English—all of which may have led someone to believe he had something to do with the attackers.&lt;ref name="Henryk Siwiak"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/lone-slaying-sept-11-mystery-article-1.932180|title=Lone Slaying from Sept. 11 is a Mystery|last1=Siemaszko|first1=Corky|date=October 5, 2001|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=September 6, 2015|last2=Marzulli|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains unsolved; police are open to the family's theory but have not classified the killing as a bias crime.&lt;ref name="NYT Siwiak article"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/nyregion/brooklyn-murder-on-sept-11-2001-remains-unsolved.html?_r=0|title=Killed on Sept. 11, 2001, but Destined to Be Mourned Only Quietly, Only by a Few|last=Wilson|first=Michael|date=September 9, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayoumi maintains deportation of Arabs and Arab-Americans significantly increased following 9/11, often at short notice, saying in one case a man was deported without his clothes.

====Effects on children====
{{cleanup|section|date=September 2009}}
The attacks were regarded by some as particularly disturbing to children, in part because of the frequency with which the images were replayed on television. Many schools closed early, especially those with children whose parents worked in Washington, D.C. and NYC.

In Sarasota, Florida, [[Emma E. Booker Elementary School]] became a part of history because President [[George W. Bush]] was reading to a classroom of children when the attacks happened.

When asked for her thoughts on the attacks, the then [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], [[Laura Bush]], a former school librarian, gave a very strong warning to parents: don't let your children see the pictures over and over, especially young children. She felt it was too frightening for them and warned parents to turn off the televisions so that children don't see the replays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/13/se.54.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|date=2001-09-13|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave the warning based on how children reacted to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. She also composed open letters to children, which she distributed through state education officials. A "Dear Students" letter went to middle and high school students,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/letter1.html|title=Middle and High School Students|publisher=Web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010915022318/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/letter1.html|archivedate=2001-09-15|accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elementary school students received one beginning "Dear Children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/letter2.html|title=Elementary School Letter|publisher=Web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010915022321/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/letter2.html|archivedate=2001-09-15|accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years after the attacks, legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system.

====Claims====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
The attack on the World Trade Center led to huge insurance claims, with many insurance companies throughout the world having to disclose the impact of the attack in their [[financial statements]]. In April 2004, a jury of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] rejected claims by World Trade Center leaseholder [[Larry Silverstein]] that two planes hitting the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|Twin Towers]] should, within the terms of his insurance policies, be considered two separate incidents, which would have entitled him to $7&amp;nbsp;billion in insurance reimbursements. The insurers, Swiss Reinsurance Co. and others, initially argued successfully that the attacks in New York were one incident and that Silverstein was only entitled to $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion. In December 2004, a federal jury decided that the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center was, for insurance purposes, two occurrences, which means that Silverstein stood to collect up to $4.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/09/01/rich_stevens/index.html|title=Guru of the Unix gurus|last=Chalmers|first=Rachel|publisher=Dir.salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301021744/http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/09/01/rich_stevens/index.html|archivedate=March 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Judge [[Alvin Hellerstein]] of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed to hear a consolidated master case against three airlines, ICTS International NV and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]]'s airport security firms, the World Trade Center owners, and [[Boeing]] Co., the aircraft manufacturer. The case was brought by people injured in the attacks, representatives of those who died, and entities that suffered property damage. In September 2004, just before the three-year statute of limitations expired, the insurers for the World Trade Center filed suit against [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], and Pinkerton's airport security firm, alleging their negligence allowed the planes to be hijacked. Because the Air Transportation Act, which was passed after September 11, limits the liability of airlines [[aircraft manufacturer]]s, and airports to the amount of their insurance coverage, this case will likely be combined with the consolidated master case filed in 2003.

===Economic===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
The attacks had significant economic repercussions for the United States and world markets. The [[New York Stock Exchange]], the [[American Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]] did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17. New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) facilities and remote data processing sites were not damaged by the attack, but member firms, customers and markets were unable to communicate due to major damage to the telephone exchange facility near the World Trade Center. When the stock markets reopened on September 17, 2001, after the longest closure since the [[Great Depression]] in 1933, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (“DJIA”) stock market index fell 684 points, or 7.1%, to 8920, its biggest-ever one-day point decline, which would not be matched until the [[Financial Crisis of 2007–2009]] where on September 29, 2008 it lost 777 points or 7.0%. By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1369.7 points (14.3%), its largest one-week point drop in history. US stocks lost $1.2&amp;nbsp;trillion in value for the week.

====Market activity investigations====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Put option]] --&gt;
The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the "9/11 Commission") investigated these rumors and found that although some unusual (and initially seemingly suspicious) trading activity did occur in the days prior to September 11, it was all coincidentally innocuous and not the result of [[insider trading]] by parties with foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks:

{{Quote|
Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of [[put option]]s—instruments that pay off only when a stock drops in price—surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10—highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single US-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific US-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.

The prayer space for the Muslim community will accommodate 1,000–2,000 people.&lt;ref name="nydailynews2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="park51facilities"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://blog.park51.org/?page_id=23|title=Proposed Facilities for the Community Center at Park51|home=Blog.Park51.org|accessdate=September 13, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911074717/http://blog.park51.org/?page_id=23|archivedate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Reactions to the September 11 attacks}}

The attacks had major worldwide political effects. Many other countries introduced tough anti-terrorism legislation and took action to cut off terrorist finances, including the freezing of [[bank account]]s suspected of being used to fund terrorism. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies stepped up cooperation to arrest terrorist suspects and break up suspected terrorist cells around the world.

The attack prompted numerous [[September 11, 2001 attack memorials and services|memorials and services]] all over the world with many countries, along with the United States, declaring a [[national day of mourning]]. In Berlin, 200,000 [[Germany|Germans]] marched to show their solidarity with America. The French newspaper of record, ''[[Le Monde]]'', ran a front-page headline reading "''Nous sommes tous Américains''", or "We are all Americans". In London, the US national anthem was played at the [[Guard Mounting|Changing of the Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. (To mark the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Golden Jubilee]], New York City lit the Empire State Building in purple and gold, to say "thank you" for this action.) In the immediate aftermath, support for the United States' right to defend itself was expressed across the world, and by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/2001/4899.htm UN Security Council Resolution 1368 (2001)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519200413/http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/2001/4899.htm |date=May 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Prime Minister]], [[John Howard]], was in Washington D.C. at the time of the attacks and invoked the [[ANZUS]] military alliance as a pledge of Australian assistance to the U.S.

Reaction to the attacks in the Muslim world was mixed. Also, shortly after the attack, the media picked up on a number of celebrations of the attacks in the Middle East with images of these celebrations being broadcast on television and published in print. Less publicized were public displays of sympathy, including candlelight vigils in countries like Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.colgate.edu/aarislam/response.htm Scholars of Islam &amp; the Tragedy of Sept. 11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825181502/http://groups.colgate.edu/aarislam/response.htm |date=August 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate crime===
An increase in racial tensions was seen in countries such as [[England]], with a number of violent crimes linked to the September 11th attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1551868.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217222719/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1551868.stm |archivedate=February 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe example was seen in [[Peterborough]], where teenager [[Murder of Ross Parker|Ross Parker was murdered]] by a gang of up to ten Muslims of [[Pakistani]] background who had sought a white male to attack.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite news|last= Reville|first= Alan |title= Murdered Ross Parker remembered 10 years on |work= Peterborough Evening Telegraph |url= http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/murdered_ross_parker_remembered_10_years_on_1_3077380 |date= 22 September 2011 |accessdate= 27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HMCourts&gt;{{Citation|last=Her Majesty's Court Service |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/144_13295.htm |title=Minimum Terms, High Court setting of minimum terms for mandatory life sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 |date=24 November 2006 |accessdate=27 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125042/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/144_13295.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;

On the other hand, hate crimes against Muslims also increased around the world. For example, Canada experienced a 16-fold increase in anti-Muslim attacks immediately a year after 9/11.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hate Crimes, Volume 3|last=Perry|first=Barbara|last2=Levin|first2=Brian|last3=Iganski|first3=Paul|last4=Blazak|first4=Randy|last5=Lawrence|first5=Frederick|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9780275995690|location=Westport, CT|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year leading to the attack, there were only 11 reported crimes but a year following 9/11, there were 173 hate crime cases reported.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same also happened in the United Kingdom and Australia. In the latter's case, a study conducted in Sydney and Melbourne revealed an overwhelming majority of Muslim residents who experienced racism or racist violence since the attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another study claimed that hate crimes "increased for all Muslims after 9/11, although the relative risk was much higher for those individuals living in countries with smaller Muslim populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Vulnerability to Disasters, Second Edition|last=Thomas|first=Deborah|last2=Phillips|first2=Brenda|last3=Lovekamp|first3=William|last4=Fothergill|first4=Alice|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=9781466516380|location=Boca Raton|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2336">[[Friar]] '''Albert of [[Stade]], [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]]''', was a 13th-century [[chronicler]], born before the end of the 12th century, most likely about 1187.
[[File:StadeJohanniskloster.JPG|thumb|right|The building of secularised St. John's Friary, Stade, housing a memorial plaque and a small exhibition on Albert of Stade, background: Tower of [[St. Cosmae et Damiani (Stade)|Sts. Cosmas et Damian]]]]

==Biography==
Albert became the [[abbot]] of the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] St. John's [[Friary]] in [[Stade]], near [[Hamburg]], in 1232. When in 1236 he failed to change the rule in his abbey from the regular [[Benedictine]] observance to that of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] reform, he determined to leave the [[monastic life]]. By 1240 he had joined the community of [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan friars]] in the city.

That same year, he began writing his [[chronicle]], which begins at [[Creation myth|creation]] and ends in 1256. He is also possibly the author of the continuations to 1265. The early portions appear to have been based on [[Bede]]'s ''Libellus de Sex Aetatibus Mundi'' and [[Ekkehard of Aura|Ekkehard]]'s ''Chronicle''. As he approaches his own time, Albert becomes, like most medieval chroniclers, both fuller and more reliable.

Albert is also credited with the authorship of a work called ''Troilus'', a [[Latin]] epic in 5,320 lines about the [[Trojan War]].

'''''Alcmaeon in Psophis''''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλκμαίων ὁ διὰ Ψωφῖδος}}, ''Alkmaiōn ho dia Psophidos'') is a play by [[Athens|Athenian]] playwright [[Euripides]]. The play has been lost except for a few surviving fragments. It was first produced in 438 BCE in a [[tetralogy]] that also included the extant ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' and the lost ''[[Cretan Women]]'' and ''[[Telephus (play)|Telephus]]''.

An '''assemblage''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] term meaning a group of different [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s found in [[archaeological association|association]] with one another, that is, in the same [[Archaeological context|context]]. As defined by one of the standard contemporary archaeological textbooks (Renfrew and Bahn), an ''assemblage'' is a "group of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] recurring together at a particular time and place, and representing the sum of human activities."&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew &amp; Bahn 2008: 578&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined in the archaeology text ''Linking to the Past'' (Feder), "One can speak of the artifact assemblage for a particular site and by that mean all the artifacts. One can also refer to a specific type of artifact. For example, one can refer to the stone tool assemblage or ceramic assemblage, that is, the array of stone tools or ceramic objects found at a site, in a region, or dating to a particular time period."

Assemblages of sites being destroyed was an issue in early archaeology. Archaeologists, being funded by rich donors or governments, would remove artifacts from their sites and bring them back to the archaeologist's country. By removing the artifact from the site the assemblage was destroyed because the artifact was being taken out of its context. Some pieces would even become parts of private collections, which would completely remove them from the public eye. If the artifact is looked at as a scientific component of its site it can be seen that the overall scientific understanding of the site would be compromised. As a whole, artifacts, or scientific components, can shed light on the behaviors of a particular place and time. An example of this is the tomb of Tutankhamen and the Egyptian government requiring that artifacts found within the tomb stay in Egypt. The government wanted each artifact to stay within the country, and therefore with its assemblage, instead of being removed and shown in museums or stored in private collections."&lt;ref&gt;Feder 2008: 93&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously accepted that assemblages represent cultures when they are found within a limited time period and area, but it is not as accepted anymore. Archaeologists know that it is nearly impossible to distinguish cultures and ethnic differences based on assemblages alone. Assemblages can be used to identify cultures, but they are not the most reliable indicators by themselves. Where the content of the assemblages relates only to one product, they are more correctly termed an [[archaeological industry|industry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8926">'''Balthassar Jozef Paul "Bas" van Bavel''' (born 24 June 1964) is a Dutch historian. He has held the chair of Transitions of Economy and Society at [[Utrecht University]] since 2011, and has been professor of Economic and Social History since 2007. His research has mostly focused on pre-industrial Northwestern Europe.

==Career==
Van Bavel was born on 24 June 1964 in [[Breda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://profs.library.uu.nl/index.php/profrec/getprofdata/112/2/3/0 |title=Prof.dr.

He then worked as a research fellow at the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] until 1998. In 1999 he returned to the University of Amsterdam as postdoctoral researcher funded by the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO). Between 2001 and 2008 he led a research project on 'The organisation of markets in late medieval Holland', and between 2007 and 2012 he led a project on 'Economic growth and stagnation in the pre-industrial era: Iraq, Italy and the Low Countries, 600-1700', both at Utrecht University and funded by the NWO.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; He was appointed as professor of Economic and Social History of the Middle Ages by Utrecht University in 2007. Furthermore, in 2007 he became the academic coordinator for the Utrecht University focus area “Origins and Impacts of Institutions”, which developed into the Utrecht University strategic theme Institutions for Open Societies in 2012, for which he became the programme director. Between 2011 and 2014 he served as head of the section Economic and Social History of the Department of History. In 2014 he was appointed as professor Transitions of Economy and Society and started directing a research team for the project 'Coordinating for life. Success and failure of Western European societies in coping with rural hazards and disasters, 1300–1800'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/BJPvanBavel/0 |title=CV prof. dr. Bas van Bavel |publisher=Utrecht University |date= |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The majority of van Bavel's research has focused on pre-industrial Northwestern Europe especially on the divergent development of societies and the influence of [[Institution|institutions]] on this process. In more recent research he has also included other parts of Europe and the Middle East, while also including more recent history.&lt;ref name=onderzoek&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/BJPvanBavel/0 |title=Onderzoek prof. dr. Bas van Bavel |publisher=Utrecht University |date= |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Van Bavel has argued that [[gross domestic product]] is a subjective manner of representing economic growth and strength, and is not an objective analysis. He also criticizes using it, as it only shows a partial view of the quality of life experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bas van Bavel |url=http://www.socialevraagstukken.nl/economische-groei-is-meer-dan-een-getal/ |title=Meet eens de lengte van mensen in plaats van de economische groei |language=Dutch |publisher=Sociale Vraagstukken |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued for the encompassing of social factors - such as equity and welfare, and the resilience to shocks and disasters - and ecological factors - such as sustainable use of resources.&lt;ref name="onderzoek" /&gt;

In an article published in ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'' in 2009, van Bavel and [[Oscar Gelderblom]] disagreed with British historian [[Simon Schama]] on the origins of historic Dutch cleanliness. While Schama argued that it was founded in [[Calvinism]] and patriotism, van Bavel and Gelderblom argued that it originated for economic reasons, hygiene being necessary for the production of cheese and butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dirk Vlasblom |url=http://vorige.nrc.nl//international/article2440882.ece/Cheese_making_made_the_Dutch_cleanest_people_of_Europe |title=Cheese making made the Dutch cleanest people of Europe |publisher=''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Boz''' (died {{circa}} 380) was the king of the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], an [[Early Slavs|early Slavic people]] that lived in parts of present-day [[Ukraine]]. His story is mentioned by [[Jordanes]] in the ''[[Getica]]'' (550–551); in the preceding years, the [[Ostrogoths]] under [[Ermanaric]] had conquered a large number of tribes in Central Europe (see [[Oium]]), including the Antes. Some years after the Ostrogothic defeat by the invading [[Huns]], a king named [[Vinitharius]], Ermanaric's great-nephew, marched against the Antes of Boz and defeated them. Vinitharius condemned Boz, his sons, and seventy of his nobles, to [[crucifixion]], in order to terrorize the Antes. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.

==History==

===Background===
Byzantine historian [[Jordanes]] wrote in his ''[[Getica|De origine actibusque Getarum]]'' (or "Getica", written in 550 or 551{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=39}}) that King [[Ermanaric]] ({{floruit}} 370s) of the [[Greuthungi]] (a Gothic tribe, most likely the same as the later [[Ostrogoths]]), member of the [[Amali dynasty]], managed to subdue a large number of tribes in Europe ([[Cassiodorus]] called him "ruler of all nations of [[Scythia]] and [[Germania]]"), and he is said to have lastly subjugated the ''[[Wends]]'' (Slavs).{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=24–25}} Jordanes noted that the Gothic tribes regularly made raids into Slavic territory.{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=24–25}}

Jordanes mentioned three tribes of the same origin, that constituted the Slavs: Wends ([[West Slavs]]), Antes ([[East Slavs]]) and Sklaveni ([[South Slavs]]), and stated that the Antes were the bravest and strongest among these.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=39}}; {{harvnb|AUGB|1962|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that the Antes' rule was hereditary,{{sfn|Chirovsky|1976|p=85}} while [[Procopius]] maintained that the Sklaveni and Antes "are not ruled by one man, but they have lived from old under a democracy".{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=115}} According to Ukrainian scholar [[Roman Smal-Stocki]] (1893–1969), the Antes received a strong ruling power and military organization over time from the Gothic influence.{{sfn|Smal-Stocki|1950|p=67}} They inhabited the area between the [[Dniester]] and [[Dnieper]],{{sfn|Smal-Stocki|1950|p=67}} most likely in the region extending from the [[Vistula]] to the [[Danube]] mouth and eastwards to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]].{{sfn|AUGB|1962|p=35}} The tribal union of the Antes probably included some neighbouring West Slavic tribes.{{sfn|Smal-Stocki|1950|p=67}} The Antes seem to have attempted to form their own state in the frontiers of, or even within, the Gothic state, judging by Jordanes' naming Boz as "king".{{sfn|Kobylinski|2005|p=530}}

===Story of Boz===
 [[File:Ostrogoths, Antes, Huns and Alans in 380.jpg|thumb|Approximate location of the Ostrogoths, Antes, Huns and Alans in {{circa}} 380.]]
The [[Huns]], accompanied by the [[Alani]] whom they had just conquered, invaded Ermanaric's territories.&lt;ref name="Ammianus"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]|translator=J. C. Rolfe|journal=Loeb Classical Library edition|volume=3|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html#3|title=Book XXXI|chapter=3|editor=Thayer, Bill|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ermanaric, who feared devastation, took his own life.&lt;ref name="Ammianus"/&gt; In the years following Ermanaric's death, there was a war between the section of the Ostrogoths who remained under Hun rule, and the Antes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Hrushevsky|1997|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked being under Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes in order to defeat them and to show his courage.{{sfn|Hrushevsky|1997|p=124}} This took place in the last quarter of the 4th century,&lt;ref name=Hrushevsky-134--281&gt;{{harvnb|Hrushevsky|1997|pp=134, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly around 380.{{sfn|AUGB|1962|p=35}} Boz, the king of the Antes (''[[rex (title)|rex]] Antorum''), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes,{{sfn|AUGB|1962|p=35}} and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (''primates'').&lt;ref name=Hrushevsky-134--281/&gt;&lt;ref name=Geary-101-102&gt;{{harvnb|Geary|2010|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered.&lt;ref name=Geary-101-102/&gt; These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Instytut Zachodni|authorlink=Western Institute|title=Polish Western affairs|volume=29|publisher=Instytut Zachodni|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4PloAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Booz|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===

Afterwards, the Alans (according to contemporary [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Marcellinus]], though Jordanes said it was Huns) rushed to rescue their kin, with a decisive battle fought against the Ostrogoths at the river Erak (now called [[Tylihul River|Tylihul]]), in which the Ostrogoths were defeated and pushed west.&lt;ref name=Vernadsky-72&gt;{{cite book|author=George Vernadsky|title=The Origins of Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPHTAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ostrogoths eventually reached the lower Danube shores.&lt;ref name=Vernadsky-72/&gt;

==Assessment==

Jordanes wrote his name in [[Late Latin]] as ''Boz'' ("''Boz nomine''"), though several manuscripts of the ''Getica'' use ''Box'' or ''Booz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bartłomiej Szymon Szmoniewski|title=The Antes: Eastern 'Brothers' of the Sclavenes?|date=January 2010|work=Neglected Barbarians, pp. 53–82|isbn=978-2-503-53125-0|doi=10.1484/M.SEM-EB.3.5085|quote=All efforts to etymologize King Boz's name assume that that (Boz) was truly his name. However, several manuscripts of Jordanes's Getica give slightly different spellings (box or even booz), which leaves room for many other possible interpretations.&amp;nbsp;... }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various theories in etymological studies regarding the name.

The name has been rendered in the [[Slavic languages]] as ''Bož'' ({{Slavonic|cu|Бож}}, {{Slavonic|cu|Божь}}; [[Romanization|transliterated]] as ''Bozh''). One theory is that it derives from the Slavic word ''bog'', "[[God]]", interpreted as "God's",{{sfn|JIES|1985|p=204}} "Godly".{{sfn|Lukaszewicz|1998|p=130}} Polish linguist [[Stanisław Urbańczyk]] (1909–2000) mentioned ''*Božь'' (divine), ''*Vo(d)žь'' (chief), and ''*Bosь'' (barefooted) as possibilites.{{sfn|Struminskyj|1980|p=788–789}} Polish [[papyrologist]] {{ill|Adam Łukaszewicz|pl}} noted that "chief" was a possibility as it corresponded to the circumstances.{{sfn|Lukaszewicz|1998|p=130}} Polish linguist [[Stanisław Rospond]] (1906–1982) concluded that ''Bos'', "barefooted", was his name, and that the other etymologies put forward by Urbańczyk were less probable; he supported this by connecting Boz with ''Bus'' ({{Slavonic|cu|Боусь}}) of ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', as {{ill|Omeljan Ohonovskyj|ru|Огоновский, Емельян Михайлович}} (1833–1894) had first done in 1876.{{sfn|Struminskyj|1980|p=788–789}} Ukrainian scholar [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] (1866–1934) speculated that his name was "perhaps [[Bozhko]], [[Bozhydar]], [[Bogdan|Bohdan]]".{{sfn|Hrushevsky|1997|p=134}} Ukrainian historian Bohdan Struminsky stressed that as the first palatalizations (gь &gt; žь, etc.) had not yet occurred in Slavic at the time of Boz, ''*Božь'' was unconvincing and ''*Vo(d)žь'' "even less acceptable". Although supporting the connection with ''Bus'', he assumed that it was Gothic, as ''*Bōs'', found in similar variants as West Gothic ''Bōsō'', of uncertain date, "probably meaning 'Sorcerer'", and Anglo-Saxon ''Bōsa'', from the 7th century.{{sfn|Struminskyj|1980|p=789}} Others have theorized an Iranian etymology (''Bwzrmyhr'' or ''Burzmipuhr'').{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=25}} German historian [[F. Altheim]] (1898–1976) treated the Hunnic name ''Bozos'' as derived from ''buxs'', a short form of Iranian ''bagabuxsa''.{{sfn|Lukaszewicz|1998|p=130}}

His title, ''[[rex (title)|rex]] Antorum'', translates to "King of the Antes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Hrushevsky|1997|pp=134, 281}}; {{harvnb|JIES|1985|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian historian {{ill|Mykola Andrusiak|uk|Андрусяк Микола Григорович}} (1902–1985) assumed, as Jordanes used ''[[rex (title)|rex]]'' for both Germanic rulers and the ruler of the Antes, that the Eastern Slavs had adopted "*kuning-" from the Goths and Slavicized it into "kǔnędzǐ" ([[knyaz]]), translated by Jordanes as "rex".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Andrusiak|first=Mykola|title=Kings of Kiev and Galicia|year=1955|work=[[The Slavonic and East European Review]] Vol. 33, No. 81 (Jun., 1955), pp. 342–349|publisher=[[Modern Humanities Research Association|MHRA]]|jstor=4204660|page=342|quote=Jordanes used the title "rex" for both Germanic "kuning" and the ruler of the Antes. It is fair to assume that already at that time the Eastern Slavs had taken from the Goths the title "*kuning-" for a ruler and had slavicised it to "kǔnędzǐ" (Ukr. ''knyaz''); consequently, the Old Church Slavonic "kǔnędzǐ" was translated by Jordanes as "rex".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Florin Curta]] believes that Jordanes' account regarding Boz and Vinitharius possibly originated in the Gothic oral tradition, given the narrative pattern of the story.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=41}} He views of Boz as "quasi-legendary", as he is the only Slavic leader mentioned by Jordanes, while no leader is mentioned by Procopius.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=117–118}}

Some historians have tried to identify Boz with Bus mentioned in the ''[[Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'',{{sfn|Hrushevsky|1997|p=134}} in which [[boyars]] tell [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] (r. 945–972) of "Gothic maidens&amp;nbsp;... singing about the time of Bus",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous|editor=Rzhevsky, Nicholas|title=An Anthology Of Russian Literature From Earliest Writings To Modern Fiction: Introduction To A Culture|chapter=The Tale of Igor|year=2005|origyear=1996|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1775x5B1eioC&amp;pg=PA15|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Hrushevsky|1997|p=134}}; {{harvnb|Zupanič|1961|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first to connect the two was O. Ohonovskyj in 1876. He was later supported by S. Rospond.{{sfn|Struminskyj|1980|p=789}}

==Names==
Bukhara was known as ''Bokhara'' in 19th- and early-20th-century English publications and as ''Buhe/Puhe''（捕喝) in [[Han Chinese#Names|Tang]] Chinese.&lt;ref name="umid"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/General_Info/general_info.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010126042500/http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/General_Info/general_info.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2001-01-26| title=General Info| author="UMID" Foundation, Uzbekistan| accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Encyclopædia Iranica]] the name Bukhara is possibly derived from the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''βuxārak'' ("Place of Good Fortune")&lt;ref&gt;Richard N Frye, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bukhara-i 'Bukhara i. In pre-Islamic times'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102200523/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v4f5/v4f5a028.html |date=January 2, 2009 }}, [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Narshakhi|Muhammad ibn Jafar Narshakhi]] in his ''History of Bukhara'' (completed 943-44 CE) mentions: {{quote|text=Bukhara has many names. One of its name was Numijkat. It has also been called "Bumiskat". It has 2 names in Arabic. One is "Madinat al Sufriya" meaning—"the copper city" and another is "Madinat Al Tujjar" meaning—"The city of Merchants". But, the name Bukhara is more known than all the other names. In [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], there is no other city with so many names.&lt;ref&gt;Narshaki, Richard Nelson Fyre, ''The History of Bukhara'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Since the Middle Ages, the city has been known as ''Buḫārā'' / بخارا in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] sources. The modern [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] spelling is ''Buxoro''.

The city's name was mythologized as ''[[Albracca]]'' in the Italian epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' published in 1483 by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orlando Innamorato'' translated by Charles Stanley Ross, Parlor Press LLC, 2004, p. 593. (Albraca is first mentioned in Book I, Canto VI, stanza 42, on p. 60.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Bukhara}}
[[File:Suzani, Bukhara pre-1850.jpg|thumb|[[Suzani textile]]s from Bukhara are famous worldwide. This one was made before 1850|upright]]
The history of Bukhara stretches back millennia. It is now the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Bukhara Region]] ([[Wilayah|viloyat]]) of [[Uzbekistan]]. Located on the [[Silk Road]], the city has long been a center of trade, scholarship, culture, and religion. During the golden age of the [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]],&lt;ref name="samanidsperiodlink"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.people-travels.com/uzbekistan-cities/bukhara/| title=Information about Bukhara| accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bukhara became a major intellectual center of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], second only to [[Baghdad]]. The historic center of Bukhara, which contains numerous [[mosque]]s and [[madrassa]]s, has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].

Bukhara has been one of the main centres of world civilisation from its early days in 6th century BCE. From the 6th century CE, Turkic speakers gradually moved in. Its architecture and archaeological sites form one of the pillars of Central Asian history and art. The region of Bukhara was a part of the [[Persian Empire]] for a long time. The origin of many of its current inhabitants goes back to the period of [[Aryan]] immigration into the region.

The [[Samanid Empire]] seized Bukhara, the capital of [[Greater Khorasan]], in 903 CE.&lt;ref name="sen2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genghis Khan]] [[Mongol_conquest_of_Khwarezmia#Bukhara|besieged Bukhara]] for fifteen days in 1220 CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire – The Brake on Islam" at [http://mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/hotw/temujin-genghis-khan-pax-mongolica-mongol-empire-islam/ ''History of the World''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813074018/https://mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/hotw/temujin-genghis-khan-pax-mongolica-mongol-empire-islam/ |date=2018-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=141,313}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an important trading centre, Bukhara was home to a community of medieval Indian merchants from the city of [[Multan]] (modern-day [[Pakistan]]) who were noted to own land in the city.&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levi|first1=Scott|title=Caravans: Punjabi Khatri Merchants on the Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uviBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=multani+caravanserai&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB5dvOzp3TAhVLzFQKHTS3B6kQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=multan&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 April 2017|agency=Penguin UK|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fires in Bukhara 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Bukhara under siege by Red Army troops and burning, September 1, 1920|upright]]

Bukhara was the last capital of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and was besieged by the Red Army during the [[Russian Civil War]]. During [[Bukhara operation (1920)|the Bukhara operation of 1920]], an army of well-disciplined and well equipped [[Red Army]] troops under the command of Bolshevik general [[Mikhail Frunze]] attacked the city of Bukhara. On 31 August 1920, the Emir [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Alim Khan]] fled to [[Dushanbe]] in Eastern Bukhara (later he escaped from Dushanbe to [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]). On 2 September 1920, after four days of fighting, the emir's citadel (the ''Ark'') was destroyed, the red flag was raised from the top of [[Po-i-Kalyan|Kalyan Minaret]]. On 14 September 1920, the All-Bukharan Revolutionary Committee was set up, headed by A. Mukhitdinov. The government—the Council of People's Nazirs ([[Government of the Soviet Union|Commissars]])—was presided over by [[Fayzulla Khodzhayev|Faizullah Khojaev]].

The [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic]] existed from 1920 to 1925 when the city was integrated into the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], then a young diplomat in the British Embassy in Moscow, made a surreptitious visit to Bokhara in 1938, sight-seeing and sleeping in parks.  In his memoir ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', he judged it an "enchanted city" with buildings that rivalled "the finest architecture of the [[Italian Renaissance]]". In the latter half of the 20th century, the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistani Civil War|civil war in Tajikistan]] brought Dari- and Tajik-speaking refugees into Bukhara and Samarkand. After integrating themselves into the local Tajik population, these cities face a movement for annexation into [[Tajikistan]] with which the cities have no common border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Formation of the Uzbek Nation-State: A Study in Transition|first=Anita|last=Sengupta|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2003|pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex===
* '''[[Po-i-Kalyan]] complex'''
The title '''Po-i Kalan''' (also '''Poi Kalân''', Persian پای کلان meaning the "Grand Foundation"), belongs to the architectural complex located at the base of the great [[minaret]] Kalân.

'''[[Kalyan minaret]]'''. More properly, Minâra-i Kalân, (Persian/Tajik for the "Grand Minaret"). Also known as the Tower of Death, as according to legend it is the site where criminals were executed by being thrown off the top for centuries. The [[minaret]] is most famed part of the ensemble, and dominates over historical center of the city. The role of the minaret is largely for traditional and decorative purposes—its dimension exceeds the bounds of the main function of the minaret, which is to provide a vantage point from which the muezzin can call out people to prayer. For this purpose it was enough to ascend to a roof of mosque. This practice was common in initial years of Islam. The word "minaret" derives from the Arabic word "minara" ("lighthouse", or more literally "a place where something burn"). The minarets of the region were possible adaptations of "fire-towers" or lighthouses of previous Zoroastrian eras.&lt;ref name="Kalan"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Kalyan_Minaret.htm| title=Kalyan Minaret| author=Dmitriy Page| accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, whose name was simply Bako, designed the minaret in the form of a circular-pillar brick tower, narrowing upwards. The diameter of the base is {{convert|9|m||abbr=off|sp=us}}, while at the top it is {{convert|6|m||abbr=on}}. The tower is {{convert|45.6|m||abbr=on}} high, and can be seen from vast distances over the flat plains of Central Asia. There is a brick spiral staircase that twists up inside around the pillar, leading to the landing in sixteen-arched rotunda and skylight, upon which is based a magnificently designed stalactite cornice (or "sharif").&lt;ref&gt;"Бухоро Bukhara Бухара" На узбекском, английском и русском языках.

'''Kalân Mosque''' (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably completed in 1514, is equal to the [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]] in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate twelve thousand people. Although Kalyan Mosque and Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Samarkand are of the same type of building, they are different in terms of art of building. Two hundred and eighty-eight monumental pylons serve as a support for the multi-domed roofing of the galleries encircling the courtyard of Kalyan Mosque. The longitudinal axis of the courtyard ends up with a portal to the main chamber (maksura) with a cruciform hall, topped with a massive blue cupola on a mosaic drum. The edifice keeps many architectural curiosities, for example, a hole in one of domes. Through this hole one can see foundation of Kalyan Minaret. Then moving back step by step, one can count all belts of brickwork of the minaret to the rotunda.&lt;ref&gt;"В.Г. Сааков Архитектурные шедевры Бухары.

'''Mir-i Arab Madrassah (1535–1536)'''. The construction of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah (Miri Arab Madrasah) is ascribed to Sheikh Abdullah Yamani of Yemen—called Mir-i-Arab—the spiritual mentor of Ubaidullah-khan and his son Abdul-Aziz-khan. Ubaidullah-khan waged permanent successful war with Iran. At least three times his troops seized Herat. Each of such plundering raids on Iran was accompanied by capture of great many captives. They say that Ubaidullah-khan had invested money gained from redemption of more than three thousand Persian captives into construction of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah. Ubaidullah-khan was very religious. He had been nurtured in high respect for Islam in the spirit of Sufism. His father named him in honor of prominent sheikh of the 15th century Ubaidullah al-Ahrar (1404–1490), by origin from Tashkent Region. By the thirties of the 16th century the time, when sovereigns erected splendid mausoleums for themselves and for their relatives, was over. Khans of [[Muhammad Shaybani|Shaibanid dynasty]] were standard-bearers of Koran traditions. The significance of religion was so great that even such famed khan as Ubaidullah was conveyed to earth close by his mentor in his madrasah. In the middle of the vault (gurhana) in Mir-i-Arab Madrasah is situated the wooden tomb of Ubaidullah-khan. At his head is wrapped in the moulds his mentor, Mir-i-Arab. Muhammad Kasim, mudarris (a senior teacher) of the madrasah (died in 1047 hijra) is also interred near by here. The portal of Miri Arab Madrasah is situated on one axis with the portal of the Kalyan Mosque. However, because of some lowering of the square to the east it was necessary to raise a little an edifice of the madrasah on a platform.&lt;ref name="Mir-i-Arab"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Miri_Arab.htm| title=Mir-i-Arab| author=Dmitriy Page| accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Lyab-i Hauz|Lab-i Hauz]]'''

[[File:Nasruddin Hodja.JPG|thumb|[[Nasreddin|Nasruddin]] Hodja]]
The '''Lab-i Hauz''' (or Lab-e hauz, Persian: لب حوض, meaning ''by the pond'') Ensemble (1568–1622) is the name of the area surrounding one of the few remaining ''hauz'', or pond, in the city of Bukhara. Several such ponds existed in Bukhara prior to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. The ponds acted as the city's principal source of water, but were also notorious for spreading disease, and thus were mostly filled in during the 1920s and 1930s by the Soviets. The Lab-i Hauz survived owing to its role as the centerpiece of an architectural ensemble dating back to the 16th to 17th centuries. The Lab-i Hauz ensemble consists of the 16th-century Kukeldash Madrasah,&lt;ref name="pagetour1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Kukeldash.htm| title=Kukeldash Madrasah| author=Dmitriy Page| accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest in the city, along the north side of the pond.&lt;ref name="pagetour2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Khanaka.htm| title=Nadir Divan-Begi Khanaka| author=Dmitriy Page| accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eastern and western sides of the pond are a 17th-century lodging-house for itinerant [[Sufism|Sufis]], and a 17th-century madrasah.&lt;ref name="pagetour3"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Nadir_Divan_Begi.htm| title=Nadir Divan-Begi Madrasah| author=Dmitriy Page| accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a metal sculpture of [[Nasreddin|Nasruddin Hodja]], the quick-witted and warm-hearted man, who forms the central character of many children's folk stories in Central Asian, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, sitting atop his mule with one hand on his heart and the other with an 'All OK' sign above his head.

*'''[[Bahoutdin Architectural Complex]]'''
Bahoutdin Architectural Complex is a necropolis commemorating [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Shaykh Baha-ud-Din or Bohoutdin]], the founder of [[Naqshbandi]] order. The complex includes the ''dahma'' (gravestone) of Bahoutdin, Khakim Kushbegi mosque, Muzaffarkan mosque, and Abdul-Lazizkhan khanqah. The site is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site tentative list on January 18, 2008.

===Fortress===
[[File:Ark fortress in Bukhara.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wall of the Bukhara Fortress, the Ark]]
*'''Bukhara Fortress, the Ark'''
{{main|Ark of Bukhara}}
===Mausoleum===
*'''[[Chashma-Ayub Mausoleum]]'''
Chashma-Ayub, or ''[[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]'s spring,'' is located near the Samani mausoleum. Its name is said to reflect a legend that states the prophet Job ("Ayub" in the [[Quran]]) visited this place and brought forth a spring of water by the blow of his staff on the ground. The water of this well is said to be exceptionally pure, and is regarded for its supposed "healing qualities." The current edifice at the site was constructed during the reign of [[Timur]], and features a Khwarazm-style conical dome that is otherwise uncommon in the region.

*'''[[Samanid Mausoleum|Ismail Samani mausoleum]]'''
The Ismail Samani mausoleum (9th–10th centuries), is one of the most highly esteemed work of [[Central Asia]]n architecture. It was built in the 9th century (between 892 and 943) as the resting-place of [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad|Ismail Samani]]—the founder of the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid dynasty]], which was the last native Persian dynasty to rule the region in the 9th to 10th centuries, after the Samanids established virtual independence from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in [[Baghdad]].

The site is unique for its architectural style which combines both Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs. The building's facade is covered in intricately decorated brick work, which features circular patterns reminiscent of the sun—a common image in Zoroastrian art from the region at that time which is reminiscent of the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, who is typically represented by fire and light. The building's shape is cuboid, and reminiscent of the Ka'aba in Makkah, while the domed roof is a typical feature of mosque architecture. The syncretic style of the shrine is reflective of the 9th to 10th centuries—a time when the region still had large populations of Zoroastrians who had begun to convert to Islam around that time.

The shrine is also regarded as one of the oldest monuments in the Bukhara region. At the time of Genghis Khan's invasion, the shrine was said to have already been buried in mud from flooding. Thus, when the Mongol hordes reached Bukhara, the shrine was spared from their destruction.

The mausoleum of Pakistan's founding father, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], known as the [[Mazar-e-Quaid]] in [[Karachi]], was modeled after the shrine.

===Mosque===
*'''[[Bolo Haouz Mosque]]'''
Built in 1712, on the opposite side of the citadel of Ark in Registan district, Bolo Haouz Mosque is inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list along with the other parts of the historic city. It served as a Friday mosque during the time when the [[Bukhara Khanate|emir of Bukhara]] was being subjugated under the [[Bolshevik Russia]]n rule in 1920s.

*'''[[Chor Minor|Char Minar]]'''
[[File:Chor minor from southwest.jpg|right|thumb|Char Minar]]
Char Minor (alternatively spelled '''Chor Minor''', and also alternatively known as the '''Madrasah of Khalif Niyaz-kul''') is a building tucked away in a lane northeast of the Lyabi Hauz complex. The structure was built by Khalif Niyaz-kul, a wealthy Bukharan of Turkmen origin in the 19th century under the rule of the [[Khanate of Bukhara#Janids|Janid dynasty]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;О.А.Сухарева КВАРТАЛЬНАЯ ОБЩИНА ПОЗДНЕФЕОДАЛЬНОГО ГОРОДА БУХАРЫ (в

редакция восточной литературы Москва 1976 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-towered structure is sometimes mistaken for a gate to the madras that once existed behind the structure; however, the Char-Minar is actually a complex of buildings with two functions, ritual and shelter.

The main edifice is a mosque. In spite of its unusual outward shape, the building has a typical interior for a Central Asian mosque. Owing to the buildings cupola, the room has good acoustic properties and therefore takes on special significance of 'dhikr-hana'—a place for ritualized 'dhikr' ceremonies of [[Sufism|Sufi]], the liturgy of which often include recitation, singing, and instrumental music.

On either side of the central edifice are located dwelling rooms, some of which have collapsed, leaving only their foundations visible. Consequently, for full functioning of [[madrasah]] only of classroom and some utility rooms is lacking. However, it was common practice that so-called madrasahs had no lecture rooms or, even if they had, no lectures had been given in them. These madrasahs were employed as student hospices.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Each of the four towers has different decorational motifs. Some say that elements of decoration reflect the four religions known to Central Asians. One can find elements reminiscent of a cross, a Christian fish motif, and a Buddhist praying-wheel, in addition to Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs.&lt;ref name="pagetour4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Char_Minar.htm| title=Char Minar Madrasah| author=Dmitriy Page| accessdate=October 14, 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1995, due to an underground brook,  one of the four towers collapsed &lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/2149 UNESCO World Heritage Centre - State of Conservation (SOC 1997) Historic Centre of Bukhara (Uzbekistan)]&lt;/ref&gt; and emergency assistance  was applied for and granted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Fund]]. Although the collapse resulted in destabilizing the entire structure, the authorities were anxious to keep awareness of the disaster to a minimum. Without explanation the building disappeared from the list of sights and after hurried reconstruction of the tower "using non-traditional building material, such as poor quality cement and steel"&lt;ref&gt; [http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/2149UNESCO World Heritage Centre - State of Conservation (SOC 1997) Historic Centre of Bukhara (Uzbekistan)]&lt;/ref&gt; Char Minar returned as one of the most popular sights of the city, yet  the event has been kept secret ever since. 

On the esplanade to the right from Char-Minar is a pool, likely of the same age as the rest of the building complex. Char Minar is now surrounded mainly by small houses and shops along its perimeter.

*'''[[Magok-i-Attari Mosque]]'''
[[File:Magoki-Attari.JPG|thumb|The Magoki-Attari mosque (south façade)]]
The former Magoki Attori mosque was constructed in the 9th century on the remains of what may have been an older Zoroastrian temple. The mosque was destroyed and rebuilt more than once, and the oldest part now remaining is the south façade, which dates from the 12th century—making it one of the oldest surviving structures in Bukhara, and one of few which survived the onslaught of Genghis Khan. Lower than the surrounding ground level, the mosque was excavated in 1935. It no longer functions as a mosque, but, rather, houses a carpet museum.

*'''Mosque of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani'''
In Bukhara there is a mosque which is said to be that of [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]], the patron saint of Kashmiri Muslims in the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley of Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffer Badakshi in Khasatul Munakib reference by Jeelani Allaie&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
[[File:Bukhara train.jpg|thumb|150px|Bukhara train station]]
[[Bukhara International Airport]] has regularly scheduled flights to cities in Uzbekistan and Russia. The [[M37 highway (Turkmenistan)|M37 highway]] connects the city to most of the major cities in [[Turkmenistan]] including [[Ashgabat]]. The city is also served by railroad links with the rest of Uzbekistan, and is a hub for roadways leading to all major cities in Uzbekistan and beyond.

==Demographics==
[[File:Boukhara 4654a.jpg|thumb|left|upright.0|Uzbekistan, Bukhara, Spices and silk festival]]
According to the official statistics, the city's population is 82% [[Uzbeks]], 6% [[Russians]], 4% [[Tajiks]], 3% [[Tatars]], 1% [[Koreans]], 1% [[Turkmens]], 1% [[Ukrainians]],  2% of other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buxoro.uz/post/buxoro-shahri-76019|title=Viloyat haqida - Shahar va tumanlar (About the province - Cities and districts)|language=Uzbek|accessdate=March 4, 2014|publisher=Buxoro Region administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, official Uzbek numbers have for long been criticized and refuted by various observers and Western sources&lt;ref&gt;Karl Cordell: Ethnicity and Democratisation in the New Europe, Routledge, 1998. Pg. 201: ''"… Consequently, the number of citizens who regard themselves as Tajiks is difficult to determine. […] Samarkand State University (SamGU) academic and international commentators suggest that there may be between six and seven million Tajiks in Uzbekistan, constituting 30% of the republic's 22 million population, rather than the official figure of 4.7% (Foltz 1996;213; Carlisle 1995:88)…"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PB"&gt;[[Paul Bergne]]: ''The Birth of Tajikistan. National Identity and the Origins of the Republic''. International Library of Central Asia Studies. [[I.B. Tauris]]. 2007. Pg. 8 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely assumed that the population of the city consists mainly of [[Tajik language|Tajik-speaking]] Tajiks, with ethnic Uzbeks forming a growing minority.&lt;ref name="diss"&gt;B. Rezvani: "Ethno-territorial conflict and coexistence in the Caucasus, Central Asia and
Fereydan. Appendix 4: Tajik population in Uzbekistan" ([http://dare.uva.nl/document/469926]). Dissertation. Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, [[University of Amsterdam]]. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Exact figures are difficult to evaluate, since many people in Uzbekistan either identify as "Uzbek" even though they speak Tajik as their first language, or because they are registered as Uzbeks by the central government despite their Tajik language and identity. According to Soviet estimates in the early 20th century (based on numbers from 1913 and 1917), the Tajiks formed the overwhelming majority of city.&lt;ref name="PB" /&gt;
Until the 20th century, Bukhara was also home to the [[Bukharan Jews]], whose language ([[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]]) is a dialect of Tajiki. Their ancestors settled in the city during Roman times. Most Bukharan Jews left the city [[Aliyah|between 1925 and 2000]] and [[Israeli settlement|settled]] in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]].

[[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] defines the name Bukhara itself as meaning "full of knowledge", referring to the fact that in antiquity, Bukhara was a scientific and scholarship powerhouse.
In the Italian romantic [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], Bukhara is called [[Albracca]] and described as a major city of [[Cathay]]. There, within its walled city and fortress, [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] and the knights she has befriended make their stand when attacked by [[Agrican]], emperor of [[Tartary]]. As described, this siege by Agrican resembles the historic siege by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1220.&lt;ref&gt;Boiardo: ''Orlando innamorato'', verse translation by Charles Stanley Ross (Oxford University Press, 1995), Book I, Cantos 10-19 and Explanatory Notes, pp. 401–402. {{ISBN|0-19-282438-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Castine Hoard''' (also known as ''The Castine Deposit''&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.coinworld.com/insights/voices/cobs-of-early-america.html|title=Cobs of early America|publisher=[[Coin World]]|author=John Kraljevich Jr.|date=July 13, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given to a [[treasure trove]] of 500–2,000 North American colonial coins that were found in [[Castine, Maine]]. The coins were from various countries, and were buried sometime in the late 1600s. In the early 1840s the coins were discovered on a farm owned by the Grindle family.

==Origin==
The coins were thought to have been a secret stash belonging to Baron [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]]. Jean Vincent moved from France to the new world, becoming a [[battalion]] leader and later a baron following the death of his father. Jean eventually fell in love with the trading post of [[Pentagoet]], and moved there once his army duties had been complete. While in Pentagoet he became more than friendly with the Indians, eventually becoming a local chief. Jean later married the daughter of another chief, and they had a daughter.

In 1704, British forces led by Major Church stormed and captured the village of [[Pentagoet]]. Fearing the British would discover her father's stash, Jean's daughter buried the coins in a safer spot. Within an hour though she was captured, and never returned to take the money for herself. Baron Jean Vincent, who was away on family business, died in France a few days after his daughter's capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOal2tZzqFYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=castine+hoard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XuOMe2c5tY&amp;sig=giVEh6TFdZQp7LngNjKLlBUrnV4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwC2oVChMIt6jCj_zRxwIVSRo-Ch0CyQCL#v=onepage&amp;q=castine%20hoard&amp;f=false|title=Buried Treasures of the Atlantic Coast|author=W. C. Jameson|year=1998|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hoard==

The coins were discovered in 1840 by Captain [[Stephen Grindle]] and his son Samuel who unearthed the coins on their farm located near the [[Bagaduce River]]. Between 1840 and 1841 hundreds of coins were unearthed; no record exists of a total figure but between 500 and 2,000 were believed to have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide Book of United States Coins|author=R.S. Yeoman and Kenneth Bressett|publisher=[[Whitman Publishing]]|year=2016|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, a paper that was originally written by [[Joseph Williamson (Maine politician)|Joseph Williamson]] was published posthumously in which he describes the coins; "Most of the coins were French crowns, half-crowns, and quarters, all of the reigns of [[Louis XIII]] and [[Louis XIV]], and bore various dates, from 1642 to 1682."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.wilsonmuseum.org/bulletins/summer2003.html|title=CASTINE; AND THE OLD COINS FOUND THERE.|publisher=Maine Historical Society|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coin hoard was later found to contain coins from Spain, and included a large quantity of [[Spanish dollar|Spanish Cobbs]]. Also found were [[Massachusetts pound|Pine tree shillings]] dating from 1652, as well as various coins from other countries. The earliest coin found was from the reign of [[John IV of Portugal|King John IV]], while the most recent coins dated no later than 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HG8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=castine+maine+coins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wdKId4disz&amp;sig=bDCR4Z27Pf4kecy4ma6BZxHRYCI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCWoVChMI1JOg2PDRxwIVgY8NCh2WcwO3#v=onepage&amp;q=castine%20maine%20coins&amp;f=false|title=Historical Collections of the Essex Institute, Volume 2|author=Essex Institute|year=1860|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins were dispersed over time after their discovery, and by 1942 the [[Maine Historical Society]] had 26 of the coins remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ansmagazine.com/Spring05/Prefed|title=Titles within the Numismatic Notes and Monographs Series Pertaining to Pre-Federal America|author=Philip Mossman|publisher=[[American Numismatic Society|ANS]]|accessdate=August 31, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102022631/http://ansmagazine.com/Spring05/Prefed|archivedate=November 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More coins are thought to exist, but none have since been found.

'''Cinema of Europe''' refers to the [[Film industry|film industries]] and [[film]]s produced in the continent of [[Europe]].

Europeans were the pioneers of the motion picture industry, with several innovative engineers and artists making an impact especially at the end of the 19th century. [[Louis Le Prince]] became famous for his 1888 [[Roundhay Garden Scene]], the first known celluloid film recorded. The [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] from [[Berlin]] used their "Bioscop" to amaze the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Wintergarten theatre]] audience with the first film show ever, from November 1 through 31, 1895. The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière Brothers]] established the [[Cinematograph]]; which initiated the [[silent film]] era, a period where European cinema was a major commercial success. It remained so until the art-hostile environment of [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/188908/Cinema-Europe-The-Other-Hollywood-Part-1-Where-it-All-Began/overview| work= Rovi | publisher= The New York Times| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable European early film movements include [[German Expressionism]] (1920s), [[Soviet Montage]] (1920s), [[French Impressionist Cinema]] (1920s), [[Poetic realism]] (1930s), and [[Italian neorealism]] (1940s); it was a period now seen in retrospect as [[Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood|"The Other Hollywood"]]. The first large-scale film studio was also established in Europe, with the [[Babelsberg Studio]] near Berlin in 1912.

Post [[World War II]] movements include [[Free Cinema]] (1950s), [[French New Wave]] (1950s&amp;ndash;60s), [[Polish Film School]] (1950s&amp;ndash;60s), [[Czechoslovak New Wave]] (1960s), [[New German Cinema]] (1960s&amp;ndash;80s), [[British New Wave]] (1950s&amp;ndash;60s), [[Spaghetti Western]] (1960s) and [[Cinema of Portugal#1960s|Novo Cinema]] (1960s&amp;ndash;70s).  The turn of the 21st century has seen movements such as [[Dogme 95]], [[New French Extremity]] and the [[Romanian New Wave]].

==History==
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|The [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world (founded 1912) and still produces international movies every year.]]

===19th century===
[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Antoine Lumière]] realized, on 28 December 1895, the first projection, with the [[Cinematograph]], in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ December 28, 1895.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sadoul, ''Histoire du cinéma mondial, des origines à nos jours'', Flammarion, Paris, 1968, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/patrimoinelumiere/premiereseance.html Institut Lumière.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105021719/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/patrimoinelumiere/premiereseance.html |date=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1897, [[Georges Méliès]] established the first cinema studio on a rooftop property in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], near Paris.

===20th century===
According to one study, "In the 1900s the European film industry was in good shape. European film companies pioneered both technological innovations such as projection, colour processes, and talking pictures, and content innovations such as the weekly newsreel, the cartoon, the serial, and the feature film. They held a large share of the US market, which at times reached 60 per cent. The French film companies were quick in setting up foreign production and distribution subsidiaries in European countries and the USA, and dominated international film distribution before the mid-1910s... By the early 1920s, all this had changed. The European film industry only held a marginal share of the US market, and a small share of its home markets. Most large European companies sold their foreign subsidiaries and exited from film production at home, while the emerging Hollywood studios built their foreign distribution networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Gerben|date=2005-05-01|title=The decline and fall of the European film industry: sunk costs, market size, and market structure, 1890–19271|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00306.x/abstract|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=58|issue=2|pages=310–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00306.x|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Film Academy]] was founded in 1988 to celebrate European cinema through the [[European Film Awards]] annually.

Philippe Binant realised, on 2 February 2000, the first [[digital cinema]] projection in [[Europe]], with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]], in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', n°hors-série, Paris, April 2000, p. 32 (''cf.'' also [http://academiecine.tv/files/8113/7674/5261/Histoire_communications.pdf ''Histoire des communications'', 2011, p. 10.]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/motion/uploadedFiles/FR_plugins_acrobat_fr_motion_action_actions29.pdf ''Cf.''

Founded in 1992 with funding from the MEDIA programme [[Creative Europe]] and from the Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée [[CNC, France]], Europa Cinemas is the first film theatre network focusing on European films. 
Its objective is to provide operational and financial support to cinemas that commit themselves to screen a significant number of European non-national films, to offer events and initiatives as well as promotional activities targeted at Young Audiences.
Thanks to the support of [[Eurimages]] and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the influence of Europa Cinemas extends to Eastern European countries, to the Balkans, to Russia and to Turkey.

'''David S. Stuart''' (born 1965) is an archaeologist and epigrapher specializing in the study of ancient Mesoamerica, especially Maya civilization. He is widely recognized for his work in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs and interpreting Maya art and iconography, starting at an early age. He is the youngest person ever to receive a MacArthur Fellowship, at age 18. He is currently the Schele Professor of Mesoamerican Art and Writing in the Department of Art and Art History at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

==Early life==
He is the son of the archaeologist George E. Stuart III&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/george-e-stuart-iii-79-a-national-geographic-staff-archeologist-and-magazine-editor-dies/2014/06/23/7bb0231a-faf2-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7f8ff3f91fa5&lt;/ref&gt; and the writer Gene Strickland Stuart,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/george-e-stuart-iii-79-a-national-geographic-staff-archeologist-and-magazine-editor-dies/2014/06/23/7bb0231a-faf2-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.91e39fb2480c&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom wrote extensively for the National Geographic Society. He spent much of his childhood accompanying his parents on archaeological digs and expeditions in Mexico and Guatemala. He developed a deep interest in Maya hieroglyphs and decipherment in the mid 1970s, reading scholarly works beginning at age 10. Shortly thereafter he made original contributions to the field and began working closely with the noted Mayanist [[Linda Schele]]. He gave his first scholarly paper at the age of 12 at the 1978 Mesa Redonda de Palenque, an international conference of Mesoamerican scholars.

==Career==
Stuart's work on the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs led to a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1984. He is the youngest-ever recipient of that award. Stuart has continued to make major contributions in the field of [[epigraphy]], particularly related to the decipherment of the [[Maya script]] used by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. See for example Coe (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;231 et seq. His insights into the structure and content of Maya hieroglyphic writing was highlighted in the award-winning documentary film "Breaking the Maya Code" (Night Fire Films, 2008).

After completing his B.A. in Art and Archaeology at [[Princeton University]] in 1989, Stuart received his Ph.D in Anthropology from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1995. At that time he was appointed the Bartlett Curator of Maya Hieroglyphs at the Peabody Museum at [[Harvard University]], and was a Senior Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Anthropology before beginning at the University of Texas at Austin in 2004. Over the years Stuart has conducted field research at numerous archaeological sites, including Coba, Palenque, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, Copan, Dos Pilas, La Corona, Calakmul, San Bartolo and Xultun. His work often focuses on the documentation of Maya sculpture and inscriptions. He remains actively engaged as a member of several excavation projects at ancient Maya sites in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.

His many publications include ''Ten Phonetic Syllables'' (1987), which laid much of the groundwork for the now-accepted methodology of Maya hieroglyphic decipherment. In 2003 he published a volume in the ongoing ''Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions'' series (Peabody Museum, Harvard University), devoted to drawings and photographs of sculpture from [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], Guatemala. He co-authored ''Palenque: Eternal City of the Maya'' (Thames and Hudson, 2008) with his father, George Stuart. His most recent work, ''The Order of Days '' (Random House - Harmony, 2011) explores the important role of time and cosmology classic Maya civilization, while also debunking the [[2012 phenomenon]] claim that the Maya viewed the year 2012 as the end of their elaborate calendar. At present he is completing a new book which will offer a detailed analysis of the three temples of the Cross Group complex at Palenque.

Stuart is currently the Director of The Mesoamerica Center at The University of Texas at Austin, which fosters multi-disciplinary studies on ancient American art and culture. He also oversees the activities of the Casa Herrera, UT's academic research center in Antigua, Guatemala, devoted to studies in the art, archaeology and culture of Mesoamerica.

'''Edson Da Costa''' was a 25-year-old Black Portuguese man who died in police custody on 21 June 2017 after being arrested on 15 June on Tollgate Road in [[Beckton]], [[London]].  The unclear circumstances of his death led to protests.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Edson Da Costa: Young black father dies after being detained by London police using force|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-police-force-cs-spray-edir-london-black-man-father-dead-newham-beckton-a7805646.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Edir Frederico Da Costa was born in [[Portugal]] and had lived in the United Kingdom since 1996.  He had a one- year-old son and was expecting his second child, due in January 2018.

===Arrest and death===
At about 10 pm on 15 June, Da Costa and two friends were stopped in their car on Tollgate Road in the Beckton neighbourhood in London . According to Da Costa's father, police suspected that the car had been involved in a robbery.  During the stop, Da Costa was detained and was subdued with [[CS spray]], a kind of tear gas.  Da Costa apparently had an adverse reaction to the spray, and was taken to a hospital and treated.  He died on 21 June.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

According to a 2000 study completed for the [[US Office of Special Counse]]l, following the [[Waco Siege]] in the United States, there had been no human deaths to that time attributed to CS spray, but it was thought to have potentially lethal effects depending on circumstances.&lt;ref name="teargas"&gt;[http://www.veritagiustizia.it/docs/gas_cs/CS_Effects_Waco.pdf Dr. Uwe Heinrich, ''Possible lethal effects of CS tear gas on Branch Davidians during the FBI raid ...'' pp. 6-7; accessed 17 February 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1989 review published in [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] found that CS can cause severe pulmonary damage and can also significantly damage the heart and liver.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
According to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC), police subdued Da Costa with CS gas, to which he had a severely adverse reaction. He died about one week later. A postmortem examination did not establish a cause of death, but said there was no evidence of excess force being used against Da Costa.

However, Da Costa's family and friends have alleged that he suffered several serious injuries, including a ruptured bladder, collapsed lungs, and fallen diaphragm and had lost his eyesight from the gas.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--based on what? second autopsy?  --&gt; They have also stated that a witness to the arrest told them that an officer had put his foot on Da Costa's throat after he had fallen to the ground.  They believe Da Costa went into [[cardiac arrest]] at the scene of the arrest.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

==Protests==
On 25 June, friends and family of Da Costa organised a protest outside of the [[Forest Gate]] police station.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;  Later that day, protests turned violent, with protesters throwing bricks ripped from a wall at police and lighting fires near the [[Stratford bus station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protesters confront Met Police over man's death|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-40401221|website=bbc.com|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourteen police officers were injured and four people were arrested for charges including disorder, arson and criminal damage.  Some of the protesters carried signs reading "[[Black Lives Matter]]", referring to a movement that had been started in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Gate clashes: Six police officers injured in London amid protests in Stratford over black man's death|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/25/protesters-clash-police-25-year-old-died-days-stopped-police/|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Symeon|title=Police injured in protests following Edson Da Costa death|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/police-injured-in-protests-following-edson-da-costa-death|website=channel4.com|publisher=Channel4|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archaeology]], '''excavation '''is the exposure, processing and recording of archaeological remains. An excavation site or "dig" is a site being studied. Such a site excavation concerns itself with a specific archaeological site or a connected series of sites, and may be conducted over as little as several weeks to over a number of years.

Numerous specialized techniques each with its particular features are used. Resources and other practical issues do not allow archaeologists to carry out excavations whenever and wherever they choose. These constraints mean many known sites have been deliberately left unexcavated. This is with the intention of preserving them for future generations as well as recognising the role they serve in the communities that live near them.

Excavation involves the recovery of several types of data from a site.  These data include [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (objects made or modified by humans), features (modifications to the site itself such as post molds, burials, and hearths), [[ecofact]]s (evidence for the local environment and resources being used such as snail shells, seeds, and butchered bones) and, most importantly, [[archaeological context]] (relationships among the other types of data).  Ideally, data from the excavation should suffice to reconstruct the site completely in three-dimensional space.

The presence or absence of archaeological remains can often be suggested by [[remote sensing]], such as [[ground-penetrating radar]].  Indeed, grosser information about the development of the site may be drawn from this work but the understanding of finer features usually requires excavation though appropriate use of [[auger (drill)|auger]]ing.

==Historical development==
Excavation techniques have developed over the years from a treasure hunting process to one which seeks to fully understand the sequence of human activity on a given site and that site's relationship with other sites and with the landscape in which it is set.

The history of excavation began with a crude search for treasure and for artifacts which fell into the category of '[[wikt:curio|curio]]'. These curios were the subject of interest of [[antiquarian]]s. It was later appreciated that digging on a site destroyed the evidence of earlier people's lives which it had contained. Once the curio had been removed from its context, most of the information it held was lost. It was from this realization that antiquarianism began to be replaced by archaeology, a process still being perfected.

==Site formation==
Archaeological material tends to accumulate in events. A gardener swept a pile of soil into a corner, laid a gravel path or planted a bush in a hole. A builder built a wall and back-filled the trench. Years later, someone built a pigsty onto it and drained the pigsty into the nettle patch. Later still, the original wall blew over and so on. Each event, which may have taken a short or long time to accomplish, leaves a [[Archaeological context|context]]. This layer cake of events is often referred to as the [[archaeological sequence]] or [[archaeological record|record]]. It is by analysis of this sequence or record that excavation is intended to permit interpretation, which should lead to discussion and understanding.

The prominent [[processual archaeology|processual archaeologist]] [[Lewis Binford]] highlighted the fact that the archaeological evidence left at a site may not be entirely indicative of the historical events that actually took place there. Using an [[ethnoarchaeology|ethnoarchaeological]] comparison, he looked at how hunters amongst the [[Nunamiut]] [[Iñupiat]] of north central [[Alaska]] spent a great deal of time in a certain area simply waiting for prey to arrive there, and that during this period, they undertook other tasks to pass the time, such as the carving of various objects, including a wooden mould for a mask, a horn spoon and an ivory needle, as well as repairing a skin pouch and a pair of caribou skin socks. Binford notes that all of these activities would have left evidence in the archaeological record, but that none of them would provide evidence for the primary reason that the hunters were in the area; to wait for prey. As he remarked, waiting for animals to hunt "represented 24% of the total man-hours of activity recorded; yet there is no recognisable archaeological consequences of this behaviour. No tools left on the site were used, and there were no immediate material "byproducts" of the "primary" activity. All of the other activities conducted at the site were essentially boredom reducers."&lt;ref&gt;Binford, Lewis (1978). "Dimensional analysis of behaviour &amp; site structure: learning from an Eskimo hunting stand". ''American Antiquity''. 40: 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Basic types===
There are two basic types of modern archaeological excavation:

#Research excavation - when time and resources are available to excavate the site fully and at a leisurely pace. These are now almost exclusively the preserve of academics or private societies who can muster enough volunteer labour and funds. The size of the excavation can also be decided by the director as it goes on.
#Development-led excavation - undertaken by professional archaeologists when the site is threatened by building development. Normally funded by the developer meaning that time is more of a factor as well as its being focused only on areas to be affected by building. The workforce is generally more skilled however and pre-development excavations also provide a comprehensive record of the areas investigated. [[Rescue archaeology]] is sometimes thought of as a separate type of excavation but in practice tends to be a similar form of development-led practice. Various new forms of excavation terminology have appeared in recent years such as [[Strip map and sample]] some of which have been criticized within the profession as jargon created to cover up for falling standards of practice.

==== Development led archaeology ====
There are two main types of trial excavation in professional archaeology both commonly associated with development-led excavation: the test pit or trench and the watching brief. The purpose of trial excavations is to determine the extent and characteristics of archaeological potential in a given area before extensive excavation work is undertaken. This is usually conducted in development-led excavations as part of [[Project management]] planning. the main difference between [[Trial trenching]] and [[watching brief]]s is that trial trenches are actively dug for the purpose of revealing archaeological potential whereas [[watching brief]]s are cursory examination of trenches where the primary function of the trench is something other than archaeology, for example a trench cut for a gas pipe in a road. In the US, a method of evaluation called a [[Shovel test pit]] is used which is a specified half meter square line of  trial trenches dug by hand.

==Concepts==

=== Stratification ===
[[File:1555 - Keramikos archaeological area, Athens - Stratigraphy - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 12 2009.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|[[Stratigraphy]] in the excavation area in the [[Kerameikos]] Cemetery ([[Athens]]).]]
In archaeology, especially in excavating, [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] is a fundamental concept. It is largely based on the [[Law of Superposition]]. When archaeological finds are below the surface of the ground (as is most commonly the case), the identification of the context of each find is vital to enable the archaeologist to draw conclusions about the site and the nature and date of its occupation. It is the archaeologist's role to attempt to discover what contexts exist and how they came to be created. Archaeological stratification or sequence is the dynamic superimposition of single units of stratigraphy or contexts.  The '''context''' (physical location) of a discovery can be of major significance. More precisely, an archaeological context is an event in time which has been preserved in the archaeological record. The cutting of a pit or ditch in the past is a context, whilst the material filling it will be another. Multiple fills seen in [[Archaeological section|section]] would mean multiple contexts. Structural features, natural deposits and [[inhumation]]s are also contexts.

By separating a site into these basic, discrete units, archaeologists are able to create a chronology for activity on a site and describe and interpret it. Stratigraphic [[Relationship (archaeology)|relationships]] are the relationships created between contexts in time representing the chronological order they were created. An example would be a ditch and the back-fill of said ditch. The relationship of "the fill" context to the ditch "cut" context is "the fill" occurred later in the sequence, i.e., you have to dig a ditch first before you can back-fill it.  A relationship that is later in the sequence is sometimes referred to as "higher" in the sequence and a relationship that is earlier "lower" though the term ''higher'' or ''lower'' does not itself imply a context needs to be physically higher or lower. It is more useful to think of this ''higher'' or ''lower'' term as it relates to the contexts position in a [[Harris matrix]], which is a two-dimensional representation of a site's formation in space and time.

=== Combining stratigraphic contexts for interpretation===
Understanding a site in modern archaeology is a process of grouping single contexts together in ever larger groups by virtue of their relationships. The terminology of these larger clusters varies depending on practitioner but the terms interface, sub-group, group and land use are common. An example of a sub-group could be the three contexts that make up a burial; the grave cut, the body and the back-filled earth on top of the body. In turn sub-groups can be clustered together with other sub-groups by virtue of their stratigraphic relationship to form groups which in turn form "[[Archaeological phase|phases]]". A sub-group burial could cluster with other sub group burials to form a cemetery or burial group which in turn could be clustered with a building such as church to produce a "phase". A less rigorously defined combination of one or more contexts is sometimes called a [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]].

===Phase and phasing===
[[File:Romano celtic temple004.png|thumb|Excavation in phase has reduced this site to the occupation level of a [[Celtic polytheism|Romano-Celtic]] temple]]
[[File:Romano celtic temple003.png|thumb|The same Romano-Celtic temple reduced in phase to the construction level immediately after the building of the inner wall and before the construction of the outer wall to the left of picture. Note reduction in phase has produced detailed information concerning the exact sequence of temple construction]]
Phase is the most easily understood grouping for the layman as it implies a near contemporaneous [[Archaeological horizon]] representing "what you would see if you went back to a specific point in time". Often but not always a phase implies the identification of an occupation surface "old ground level" that existed at some earlier time.
The production of phase interpretations is one of the first goals of stratigraphic interpretation and excavation. Digging "in phase" is not quite the same as phasing a site. Phasing a site represents reducing the site either in excavation or [[Post excavation|post-excavation]] to contemporaneous horizons whereas "digging in phase" is the process of stratigraphic removal of archaeological remains so as not to remove contexts that are earlier in time "lower in the sequence" '''before''' other contexts that have a latter physical stratigraphic relationship to them as defined by the [[law of superposition]]. The process of interpretation in practice will have a bearing on excavation strategies on site so "phasing" a site is actively pursued during excavation where at all possible, and is considered good practice.

===Introduction===
Excavation initially involves the removal of any topsoil overburden by machine. This material may be examined by [[metal detector]] for stray [[Small finds|finds]] but unless the site has remained untouched since its abandonment there is invariably a layer of modern material on the surface of limited archaeological interest. In rural areas, any features are often visible beneath the surface as opposed to urban areas where there may be thick layers of human deposits and only the uppermost contexts will be initially visible and definable through isolation from other contexts. A strategy for sampling the contexts and features is formulated which may involve total excavation of each feature or only portions. It is preferred goal of excavation to remove all archaeological deposits and features in the reverse order they were created and construct a Harris matrix as a chronological record or "sequence" of the site. This Harris matrix is used for interpretation and combining contexts into ever larger units of understanding. This stratigraphic removal of the site is crucial for understanding the chronology of events on site. It is perhaps easier to think of this as  "archaeological deposits should leave the site in the reverse order they arrived". A grid is usually set up, dividing the site into 5 m squares to better aid the positioning of the features and contexts on the overall site plan. This grid is usually tied into a national [[Geomatics|geomatic]] database such as the [[Ordnance Survey]] in the UK.  In [[urban archaeology]] this grid becomes invaluable for implementing single context recording.

===Single context recording system===
[[Single context recording]] was developed in the 1970s by the [[museum of London]] (as well as earlier in Winchester and York) and has become the de facto recording system in many parts of the world and is especially suited to the complexities of deep [[urban archaeology]] and the process of [[Stratification (archaeology)|Stratification]].
Each excavated context is given a unique "context number" and is recorded by type on a context sheet and perhaps being drawn on a [[archaeological plan|plan]] and/or a [[Archaeological section|section]]. Depending on time constraints and importance contexts may also be photographed, but in this case a grouping of contexts and their associations are the purpose of the photography. [[Small finds|Finds]] from each context are bagged and labeled with their context number and site code for later cross reference work carried out post-excavation. The height above sea level of pertinent points on a context, such as the top and bottom of a wall are taken and added to plans sections and context sheets. Heights are recorded with a [[dumpy level]] or total station by relation to the site ''' temporary [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]]''' (abbr. T.B.M). Samples of deposits from contexts are sometimes also taken, for later environmental analysis or for [[Chronological dating|scientific dating]].

===Stratigraphic excavation in practice===
[[File:Late roman pit.PNG|thumb|Slumped top fill revealing edges of a Saxon sunken featured building]]
[[Best practice]] of stratigraphic excavation in its basic sense involves a cyclical process of cleaning or "troweling back" the surface of the site and isolating contexts and edges which are definable in their entirety or part as either
#Discrete discernible "edges" that form an enclosed area completely visible in plan and therefore stratigraphically later than the surrounding surface or
#Discrete, discernible "edges" that are formed by being completely separated from the surrounding surface as in 1 and have boundaries dictated by the limit of excavation.
Following this preliminary process of defining the context, the context is then assessed in relation to the wider understanding of the site, for considerations of reduction of the site in phases, and then removed and recorded by various methods.
Often, owing to practical considerations or error, the process of defining the edges of contexts is not followed and contexts are removed out of sequence and un-stratigraphically. This is called "digging out of phase". It is not good practice.
After removing a context or if practical a set of contexts such as the case would be for features, the "isolate and dig" procedure is repeated until no man made remains are left on site and the site is reduced to [[Archaeological natural|natural]].

===Physical methodology of excavation===
The process of excavation is achieved in many ways depending on the nature of the deposits to be removed and time constraints. In the main, deposits are lifted by [[trowel]] and [[mattock]] and shovelled or carried from the site by wheel barrow and bucket. The use of many other tools including fine trowels such as the plaster's leaf trowel and brushes of various grades are used on delicate items such as human bone and decayed timber. When removing material from the archaeological record some basic guidelines are often observed.
# '''Work from the known to the unknown'''. This means that, if one is unsure of the stratigraphic boundaries of the material in question, the removal of material should start from an area where the sequence is better understood rather than less.
# '''Work from the top to the bottom'''. As well as working from the known to the unknown, also as far as possible, remove material at the physically highest level in the context and work towards the lowest. This is best practice because loose spoil will not then fall onto and contaminate the surface being worked on. In this way blurring detail that might have been instructive to the excavator is avoided.
# '''In archaeology,  we use our eyes'''. Excavation of contexts correctly often relies on detailed observations of minute differences.
# '''If in doubt, bash it out'''. This rather cavalier-sounding maxim is a concise way of expressing the need to progress. There is always more to be done on a site, than there is time in which to do it. At times the next feature or context to be removed in the sequence is not clear even to an experienced archaeologist. When it is not possible to proceed in an ideal manner, the excavation must be continued in a more arbitrary way, with temporary sections, until discernible stratigraphy is again encountered. An area of the site is reduced leaving arbitrary, temporary sections as a form of [[Archaeological section#Stratigraphic control|stratigraphic control]] to provide early warning of  "digging out of phase".  If the arbitrary area for excavation is wisely chosen, the sequence should be revealed and excavation can return to a truly stratigraphic method. It is important to realize that "bash it out" is not a totally random act but a best guess based on logical deductions, observation and experience.

===Common errors===
Common errors during excavation fall into two basic categories and one or the other is almost inevitable because excavation is a destructive process that removes the information it seeks to record in real time and mistakes cannot be rectified easily.
#'''Under-cutting'''. Under cutting occurs where contexts are not excavated fully and some remainder of the context is left in situ masking the nature of the underlying contexts. This is especially common among inexperienced archaeologists who have a tendency to be timid. The consequences of undercutting are quite serious as the nature of the archaeological sequence is obscured and subsequent recording and excavation is based on a flawed reading of the deposits on site. Unchecked, what follows from under-cutting is the production of false data often from the failure to spot [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)#Residual and intrusive finds|intrusive finds]] and in turn, serious ramifications for the ability to interpret the sequence post-excavation. Entire sites can be "thrown out of phase" where relationships recorded in the Harris matrix bear no genuine association with any understandable phase of occupation. If a regime of under-cutting is allowed to progress its effects multiply as the site is reduced.
# '''Over-cutting.''' Over-cutting occurs when contexts are unintentionally removed along with material from other deposits and contexts. Heavy over-cutting represents reckless removal of the sequence. However some degree of over-cutting is almost impossible to avoid and is certainly preferable to unchecked under-cutting even though over-cutting represents a loss of information.

Over-cutting represents the loss of information whereas undercutting represents false information. One role of an archaeologist is to avoid false information and minimize the loss of information.

===Finds and artifact retrieval===
[[File:Sållning i Bagarstugan - Skällviks borg.webm|thumb|Screening during an excavation.]]
Finds and artifacts that survive in the archaeological record are retrieved in the main by hand and observation as the context they survive in is excavated. Several other techniques are available depending on suitability and time constraints. Sieving and [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] is used to maximize the recovery of small items such as small shards of pottery or flint flakes. The use of sieving is more common on research based excavations where more time is available. Some success has been achieved with the use of cement mixers and bulk sieving. This method allows the quick removal of context by shovel and mattock yet allows for a high retrieval rate. Spoil is shovelled into cement mixers and water added to form a slurry which is then poured through a large screen mesh. Flotation is a process of retrieval that works by passing spoil onto the surface of water and separating finds that float from the spoil  which sinks, this is especially suited to the recovery of environmental data such as seeds and small bones. Not all finds retrieval is done during excavation and some especially flotation may take place post-excavation from samples taken during excavation.

One important role of finds retrieval during excavation is the role of specialists to provide [[spot dating]] information on the contexts being removed from the archaeological record. This can provide advance warning of potential discoveries to come by virtue of [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)#Residual and intrusive finds|residual finds]] redeposited in contexts higher in the [[sequence (archaeological)|sequence]] (which should be coming offsite earlier than contexts from early eras and phases). Spot dating also forms part of a confirmation process, of assessing the validity of the working hypothesis on the phasing of site during excavation. For example, the presence of an anomalous [[medieval]] pottery [[sherd]] in what was thought to be an Iron Age ditch feature could radically alter onsite thinking on the correct strategy for digging a site and save a lot of information being lost due to incorrect assumptions about the nature of the deposits which will be destroyed by the excavation process and in turn, limit the sites potential for revealing information for post-excavation specialists. Or anomalous information could show up errors in excavation such as "undercutting". [[Chronological dating|Dating methodology]] in part relies on accurate excavation and in this sense the two activities become interdependent.

===Digital recording===
Archaeological excavation is an unrepeatable process, since the same area of the ground cannot be excavated twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barker | date=1982 | title=Techniques of Archaeological Excavation
 | edition = 2nd | location=London| publisher=Batsford | isbn=0713427388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, archaeology is often known as a destructive science, where you must destroy the original evidence in order to make observations.  To mitigate this, highly accurate and precise digital methods can be used to record the excavation process and its results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Roosevelt | last2=Cobb | last3=Moss | last4=Olson | last5=Ünlüsoy | date=2015 | title =Excavation is {{strikethrough|Destruction}} Digitization: Advances in Archaeological Practice | journal=Journal of Field Archaeology | pages=325–346 | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/2042458215Y.0000000004 | doi=10.1179/2042458215Y.0000000004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital tools used by field archaeologists during excavation include [[GPS]], [[tablet computers]], [[relational databases]], [[digital cameras]], 3d [[laser scanner]]s, and [[unmanned aerial vehicles]]. After high quality digital data have been recorded, these data can then be shared over the internet for [[open access]] and use by the public and archaeological researchers.
Digital imaging or digital image acquisition is [[digital photography]], such as of a physical scene or of the interior structure of an object.  The term is often assumed to imply or include the processing, compression, storage, printing, and display of the images.

===Mechanical excavation===
[[File:Harzhorn Grabungsschnitt von unten 1.jpg|thumb|Excavation at the site of the [[Battle at the Harzhorn]] (Germany)]]
This describes the use in excavations of various types and sizes of machines from small [[backhoe]]s to heavy duty earth-moving machinery. Machines are often used in what is called salvage or rescue archaeology in developer-led excavation when there are financial or time pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Horn|first=D.M. |author2=J. R. Murray |author3=R. S. White|title=Some Techniques for Mechanical Excavation in Salvage Archaeology|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1986|volume=13|issue=2|pages=239–244|doi=10.1179/jfa.1986.13.2.239}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Using a mechanical excavator is the quickest method to remove soil and debris and to prepare the surface for excavation by hand, taking care to avoid damaging archaeological deposits by accident or to make it difficult to identify later precisely where finds were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to dig?|url=http://www.pastperfect.org.uk/archaeology/how2dig.html|work=Past Perfect|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such machinery is often routine (as it is for instance with the British archaeological television series ''[[Time Team]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS' Time Team America to Debut July 8 with Dig on Roanoke Island|url=http://www.firstcolonyfoundation.org/news/2009_time_team.aspx|publisher=First Colony Foundation|accessdate=10 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017110828/http://www.firstcolonyfoundation.org/news/2009_time_team.aspx|archive-date=17 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be controversial as it can result in less discrimination in how the archaeological sequence on a site is recorded. One of the earliest uses of earth-moving machinery was at [[Durrington Walls]] in 1967. An old road through the henge was to be straightened and improved and was going to cause considerable damage to the archaeology. Rosemary Hill describes how [[Geoffrey Wainwright (archaeologist)|Geoffrey Wainwright]] "oversaw large, high-speed excavations, taking bulldozers to the site in a manner that shocked some of his colleagues but yielded valuable if tantalising information about what Durrington had looked like and how it might have been used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Rosemary|title=Stonehenge|year=2009|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1861978806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vWrImYK8K0C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=bulldozers+archaeology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J2lVUsvcHaey0QWYxYHACw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBDhQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bulldozers%20%20&amp;f=false|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machines are used primarily to remove modern [[overburden]] and for the control of [[Spoil (archaeology)|spoil]]. In [[British archaeology]] mechanical diggers are sometimes nicknamed "big yellow trowels".

===Organisation of workforce===
A group of archaeological excavators will generally work for a supervisor who reports to the site director or project manager. The director will have ultimate responsibility for interpreting the site and writing the final report. Most excavations are eventually published in professional journals although this process can take years. This process takes place post-excavation and involves a myriad of other specialists.

'''Filmmaking in [[Colonial Nigeria]]''' generally refers to an era in [[Nigerian cinema]], usually spanning the 1900s through to the 1950s, when film production and exhibition or distribution were controlled by the [[British Empire|British colonial Government]]. The history of cinema in Nigeria dates back to as early as the [[history of film]] itself; notably in the late 19th century, with the use of [[Kinetoscope|peephole viewing of motion picture devices]].&lt;ref name="Modern Ghana"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.modernghana.com/movie/5681/3/x-raying-nigerian-entertainment-industry-at-49.html | title=X-raying Nigerian Entertainment Industry At 49 | publisher=Modern Ghana | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were soon replaced in the early 20th century with improved motion picture exhibition devices, with the first set of films screened at the Glover Memorial Hall in [[Lagos]] from 12 to 22 August 1903.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olubomehin|first1=Oladipo O.|title=CINEMA BUSINESS IN LAGOS, NIGERIA SINCE 1903|journal=Historical Research Letter|date=2012|volume=3|issn=2224-3178}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmakers started producing films for local audiences within Nigeria since the 1920s, mostly employing the [[mobile cinema]] as a means of exhibition;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/production-company/nigerian-film-unit | title=Nigerian Film Unit | publisher=Colonial Film | accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest feature film made in Nigeria is the 1926's ''[[Palaver (1926 film)|Palaver]]'' produced by [[Geoffrey Barkas]].

As at 1954, mobile cinema vans played to at least 3.5 million people in Nigeria, and films being produced by the Nigerian Film Unit were screened for free at the 44 available cinemas. The first film entirely copyrighted to the Nigerian Film unit is ''[[Fincho]]'' (1957) by Sam Zebba; which is also the first Nigerian film to be [[Color motion picture film|shot in colour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/ng/de/lag/ver.cfm?fuseaction=events.detail&amp;event_id=11586033 | title=Lights, Camera, Africa!!! | publisher=Goethe Institute | accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also regarded as a transitional film into the [[Golden Age of Nigerian cinema|Golden era]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==History==
Film as a medium first arrived Nigeria in the late 19th century, [[Kinetoscope|peephole viewing of motion picture devices]].&lt;ref name="Modern Ghana"/&gt; These were soon replaced in the early 20th century with improved motion picture exhibition devices; the first set of films shown in Nigerian theatres were [[Western world|Western]] films, with the first film screened at Glover Memorial Hall in [[Lagos]] from 12 to 22 August 1903.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.ccsu.edu/afstudy/upd11-2.html | title=Editorial: Nigerian Film Industry | publisher=Africa Update Vol. XI, Issue 2 | work=Central Connecticut State University | date=Spring 2004| accessdate=16 July 2014 | author=Emeagwali, Gloria }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olubomehin|first1=Oladipo O.|title=CINEMA BUSINESS IN LAGOS, NIGERIA SINCE 1903|journal=Historical Research Letter|date=2012|volume=3|issn=2224-3178}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, [[Herbert Macaulay]] had invited to Nigeria, the ''Balboa and Company'', [[Spain]] to organize an exhibition tour of [[silent films]] in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transcampus.org/JORINDV10Jun2012/Jorind%20Vol10%20No2%20Jun%20Chapter32.pdf |last1=Nnabuko|first1=J.O. |last2=Anatsui |first2=Tina C.|title= NOLLYWOOD MOVIES AND NIGERIAN YOUTHS-AN EVALUATION |journal= JORIND 10|date=June 2012|volume=10 |issue=2|accessdate=18 February 2015|issn=1596-8308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mr Balboa later closed his
Exhibition in Lagos, while he continued showing films in other [[West Africa]]n countries, the success of his exhibition led to a European merchant, Stanley Jones, to begin showing films in the same Glover Memorial Hall, starting from November 1903. This brought about the influx of more European film exhibitors to Nigeria.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The first film hit in this early period came on 3 August 1904, when the documentary on the visit of ''Alake of [[Abeokuta]]'' to England was screened. Filmmakers started producing films for local audiences within Nigeria since the 1920s, mostly employing the [[mobile cinema]] as a means of exhibition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; During the [[First World War]], Colonial Government used cinemas as means of raising fund for war relief and for the [[Red Cross]]. The Government was also interested in producing and using documentary films to "brainwash the colonies and to propagate British ideals". As of 1921, there were four other halls showing films twice a week in [[Lagos Mainland]] and one hall each in [[Ebute Metta]] and [[Oshodi-Isolo|Oshodi]]. By this time, cinema had become popular in Lagos with crowds of young and old people usually waiting at the doors of theatre halls. Religion also aided in the expansion of cinema culture as the Christian missionaries used cinemas for religious propaganda.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

The earliest feature film made in Nigeria is the 1926's ''[[Palaver (1926 film)|Palaver]]'' produced by [[Geoffrey Barkas]]. It was also the first film to feature Nigerian actors in a speaking role; Nigerian film actors features in ''Palaver'' include Dawiya and Yilkuba. The film was shot amongst the Sura and Angas people of the present day [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]] and [[Plateau State]]s in [[Northern Nigeria]], and narrates the rivalry between a British District Officer and a tin miner which leads to a war.&lt;ref name="Ekenyerengozi, Michael Chima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colonial Film"/&gt; Also in this era there were several films set in Nigeria, one of the most notable being the 1935's ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' by [[Zoltán Korda]], featuring Nigerian actor [[Orlando Martins]]. Martins also featured in other notable films including ''[[The Man from Morocco]]'' (1945), ''[[Men of Two Worlds]]'' (1946) and so on, and this established Martins as one of the recognized Nigerian actors of his time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200909300422.html | title=Nigeria: X-Raying The Country's Entertainment Industry at 49 | publisher=allAfrica.com | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=29 March 2015 | author=Soyingbe, Anthonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As cinemas became a common feature of the social life in the then emerging city of Lagos, the late 1930s through 1940s marked the beginning of the establishment of big commercial cinema houses with branches in strategic parts of the country. One of the earliest cinema operators in Lagos was the "West African Pictures Company" owned by Mr. S. Khalil, a member of the Syrian community in Lagos. He established the Rex Cinema in Ebute Metta, Regal Cinema and Royal Cinema. Other popular cinema chains include: Capitol Cinema, Casino Cinema, Kings Cinema, Central Cinema, Rialto Cinema, Corona Cinema, Odeon Cinema, Road House Cinema, Ikeja Arms Cinema and Glover Hall. In 1937, the colonial government set up a Board of Censorship to handle matters relating to the establishment and operations of cinema houses in the colony.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Nigerian content in films made and shown in Nigerian cinemas during this period were however virtually non-existent as the production and distribution were controlled by foreigners. Motion picture entertainment was as a result complemented by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] travel theatre groups, which emerged in the 1930s through 1940s; One of the most were the Agbegijo and Alarinjo theatre groups, which featured theatre actors such as Duro Ladipo, Ishola Ogunmola, Lere Paimo, Oyin Adejobi, amongst others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nificon.org/about/history-of-nollywood/ | title=History of Nollywood | publisher=Nificon | accessdate=15 October 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326105136/http://www.nificon.org/about/history-of-nollywood/ | archivedate=26 March 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/4731908/The_Blossoming_of_the_Nigerian_Video_Film_Industry | title=The Blossoming of the Nigerian Video Film Industry | publisher=Academia | accessdate=7 April 2015 | author=Obiaya, Ikechukwu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the Nigerian Film Unit was established as part of the plan to decentralize colonial film production. This unit was later reorganised into regional units in accordance with the constitutional changes in Nigeria in 1954. The Colonial Film Unit, throughout the decade, exhibited health and educational films to local audiences through its mobile cinema vans. It also produced newsreels and short documentaries, depicting celebrations and colonial achievements to domestic and overseas audiences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

In the 1950s, the state of affairs changed a bit, with more Nigerian contents being exhibited in cinemas,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; with a purported drive to "Africanize" film production.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; There became a major increase cinema audiences as a result, with an estimated annual 3.5 million audience as of 1951. As the film industry became grouped as a unit in the information department of the "Ministry of Information" in 1954, the film unit functions primarily to produce documentary films and newsreels on local events of great importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Mass Communication in Nigeria | publisher=Spectrum Books Limited | author=Sambe, J.

'''Gaetano Milanesi''' (1813-1895) was an Italian scholar and writer on the [[history of art]].

==Biography==
Milanesi was born at [[Siena]], where he studied law, and in 1838 he obtained an appointment in the public library.

In 1856 he was elected member of the [[Accademia della Crusca]], in which capacity he took part in the compilation of its famous but still unfinished dictionary, and two years later was appointed assistant keeper of the Tuscan archives, in [[Florence]]; then he took charge of the famous [[Medici]] archives, whence he collected a vast body of material on the history of Italian art, not all of which is yet published. In 1889 he became director of the archives, but retired in 1892, and died three years later.

His most important publication is his edition of [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]]'s works in nine volumes, with copious and valuable notes (Florence, 1878 1885). Of his other writings the following may be mentioned:
*''Il diario inedito di Alessandro Sozzini'' (in the Archivio storico Italiano, 1842)
*''Documenti per la storia dell' arte senese'', 3 vols. (Siena, 1854-1856)
*''Discorsi sulla storia civile et artistica di Siena'' (Siena, 1862)
He also edited a number of Italian classics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">'''Hacienda Grande''' is a culture that flourished in [[Puerto Rico]] from 250 BC to 300 AD. The main site in which Hacienda Grande culture was studied was in [[Loíza]].  Similar to the [[Saladoid]] culture, out of [[Venezuela]], the Hacienda Grande culture was known primarily for its [[ceramic]] works. Ceramic techniques include vessel forms, such as [[zoomorphic]] [[effigy]] vessels, platters, jars and bowls with D-shaped strap handles, and many other types of vessels. These potters decorated their vessels with [[polychrome]] designs mainly utilizing white-on-red, black paint, and negative-painted designs. These pottery findings, which are considered some of the best in [[Puerto Rico]], represent the "earliest immigration of pottery-making Indians into the island."  Similar 'white-on-red' pottery has been found in the [[Virgin Islands]], the [[Lesser Antilles]], [[Trinidad]], and the [[Orinoco]] region of [[Venezuela]].

Though much of what we know about this culture is based on their ceramics, we do know that a principal part of not only their diet, but their society, was crab.  The fact that an abundance of crab remains were discovered along with the pottery, combined with the fact that shell and shell artifacts are so rare, points directly to this site corresponding with what [[Froelich Rainey]] called "Crab culture."

Though this distinct style of pottery was found elsewhere, it did not travel any farther north or west than [[Puerto Rico]].  Evidence suggests that the [[Igneri]] immigration into the [[Greater Antilles]] was stopped due to a new group of invaders from [[South America]].  This theory is further supported by the fact that, rather than a slow shift from one ceramic style to another, the Hacienda Grande style of pottery and a diet based almost entirely on crabmeat abruptly stops, and with it, the Hacienda Grande culture as a whole.&lt;ref name=books-google&gt;{{cite book|title=The Peoples of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archeology and ...|url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=XNbqUR_IoOMC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=haciendas+grande+culture+puerto+rico&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KDABDRQO3N&amp;sig=x8nkGbbCNhweyua7XGnawbrNFz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nQcHU--kJYmSrgfB5YCIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=haciendas%20grande%20culture%20puerto%20rico&amp;f=false|publisher=books.google.com.np|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latinamericanstudies&gt;{{cite web|last=ALEGRIA|first=RICARDO E.|title=ON PUERTO RICAN ARCHAEOLOGY|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/ancient/Alegria-1965.pdf|publisher=latinamericanstudies.org|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cr-nps&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistory of the Caribbean Culture Area|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/seac/research/fp/fp00012/caribpre.htm|publisher=cr.nps.gov|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enciclopediapr&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Archaeology: Prehistory of Puerto Rico|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=06102004&amp;page=2|publisher=enciclopediapr.org|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Handbook of North American Indians''''' is a [[monographic series]] of edited scholarly and reference volumes in Americanist studies, published by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] beginning in 1978. Planning for the Handbook series began in the late 1960's, and work was initiated following a special congressional appropriation in fiscal year 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

To date, 15 volumes have been published. Each volume addresses a sub-topic of Americanist research, and contains a number of articles or chapters by individual specialists in the field coordinated and edited by a volume editor. The overall series of twenty volumes is planned and coordinated by a general or series editor. Until the series was suspended, mainly owing to lack of funds, the series editor was [[William C. Sturtevant]], who died in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2641">A '''historical region''' are geographic areas which at some point in time had a cultural, [[Ethnic group|ethnic]], linguistic or political basis, regardless of present-day borders. They are used as delimitations for studying and analysing social development of [[List of time periods|period]]-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations.&lt;ref&gt;p. 332, Kotlyakov, Komarova (entry 2781)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;p. 151, Tägil&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Definitions of regions vary,&lt;ref name="xiii, Tägil"&gt;xiii, Tägil&lt;/ref&gt; and regions can include [[macroregion]]s such as Europe, territories of traditional [[Sovereign state|states]] or smaller [[microregion]]al areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a [[regionalism (politics)|regional identity]].&lt;ref name="xiii, Tägil"/&gt; In Europe, the regional identities are often derived from the [[Migration Period]] but for the contemporary perspective are often related to the [[World War I#Aftermath|1918–1920 time of territorial transformation]], and another in the [[Revolutions of 1989|post-Cold War period]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 82. Lehti, Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regions are entirely invented, such as the [[Middle East]] in 1902 by a [[military strategist]], [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], to refer to the area of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;p. 65, Lewis, Wigen&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hélène Carrère d'Encausse''' (born '''Hélène Zourabichvili'''; 6 July 1929) is a French political historian of [[Georgians in France|Georgian origin]], specializing in [[History of Russia|Russian history]]. She was elected to [[List of members of the Académie française#Seat_14|seat 14]] of the [[Académie française]] in 1990 and became the Perpetual Secretary of the Académie in October 1999.

She was a [[member of the European Parliament]] between 1994 and 1999 for the right wing Conservative party [[Rally for the Republic|RPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1994/04/28/la-preparation-des-elections-europeennes-mme-carrere-d-encausse-representera-le-rpr-derriere-m-baudis_3826435_1819218.html|title=La préparation des élections européennes Mme Carrère d'Encausse représentera le RPR derrière M. Baudis|website=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrère d'Encausse was awarded the [[Lomonosov Gold Medal]] and Grand Cross with Star of the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland]] in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

== Early life and career ==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 24 October 2000-1.jpg|thumb|Carrère d'Encausse with [[Vladimir Putin]] in October 2000|300px]]Carrère d'Encausse graduated from [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]. She was elected to seat 14 of the Académie française in 1990, and her academician's sword was made by the sculptor [[Goudji]]. She became permanent secretary on 21 October 1999. Her son, [[Emmanuel Carrère]] (born 1957), is an author, screenwriter and director.

Considered one of the most eminent historians of France, joined other French politicians in identifying [[polygamy]] as one of the causes of the [[2005 civil unrest in France]] in a November 2005 interview given to Russian television channel [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Why can't their parents buy an apartment? It's clear why. Many of these Africans, I tell you, are polygamous. In an apartment, there are three or four wives and 25 children.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/18/international/europe/18france.html|title= Immigrant Polygamy Is a Factor in French Unrest, a Gaullist Says|last1= Sciolino|first1= Elaine|date= 18 November 2005|website= New York Times|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These and similar remarks by others, including [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Bernard Accoyer]], were disputed by the antiracist group [[MRAP (NGO)|MRAP]], which blamed the unrest on French racism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Russian scholarship==
The bulk of Carrère d'Encausse's work has been on Russia and the [[Soviet Union]].  She has had over two dozen books published in French on the Eurasian giant, many of which have been translated into English.  Her most notable book may be 1978's ''L'empire éclaté: La révolte des nations en U.R.S.S'' (English version, ''Decline of an Empire: The Soviet Socialist Republics in Revolt'') in which she made the then ridiculed suggestion that the Soviet Union was destined to break up along the lines of its 15 constituent republics, an event which transpired in 1991.

In commenting on current Russian affairs, Carrère d'Encausse has warned against applying Western yardsticks to Russian democracy and has said that she regrets the "excessive diabolization" of the regime of [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="Figaro Interview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=de Villers |first1=Vincent Tremolet |title=Il ne faut pas juger le pouvoir autoritaire de Poutine à l'aune de nos seuls critères |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/2018/03/16/31002-20180316ARTFIG00308-il-ne-faut-pas-juger-le-pouvoir-autoritaire-de-poutine-a-l-aune-de-nos-seuls-criteres.php |accessdate=27 October 2018 |publisher=Le Figaro |date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Internet History Sourcebooks Project''' is located at the [[Fordham University]] History Department and Center for Medieval Studies. It is a web site with modern, medieval and ancient primary source documents, maps, secondary sources, bibliographies, images and music. [[Paul Halsall]] is the editor, with [[Jerome Arkenberg|Jerome S. Arkenberg]] as the contributing editor.  It was first created in 1996, and is used extensively by teachers as an alternative to textbooks.

==Internet Medieval Sourcebook==
The '''Internet Medieval Sourcebook''' or '''IMS''' is a web site with Medieval source documents, maps, secondary sources, bibliographies, images and music.  It is located at the [[Fordham University]] Center for Medieval Studies.

Because most translations are under copyright, a large number of the documents on IMS are older copyright-expired versions from the 19th and early 20th century, and other more recent and perhaps readable translations exist for sale through book sellers. However, IMS also has a section of "recently translated texts" which have been translated just for IMS. In fact, IMS claims it "contains more newly-translated texts than any available published collection of medieval sources."

==Internet Ancient Sourcebook==

==Other Sourcebooks==
In addition to the large collections in the Medieval, Ancient, and Modern Sourcebooks, the Internet History Sourcebooks Project also includes Sourcebooks on African, East Asian, Global, Indian, Islamic, Jewish, Lesbian and Gay, Science, and Women's History.

'''John H. Bryden''' (born July 15, 1943 in [[Dundas, Ontario]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, journalist, and historian.

==Education==

He received an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in English and History from [[McMaster University]] in 1966, and a Masters of Philosophy in English from the [[University of Leeds]] in 1968.

==Early career==

From 1969 to 1989, Bryden held a number of positions as a journalist at several Canadian newspapers including the ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.

==Political career==
Bryden was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] during the Liberal sweep of Ontario in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]].

He was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 election]] for the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Wentworth-Burlington]], and again in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], in the riding of [[Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Aldershot]].

He supported Deputy Prime Minister [[John Manley]] to succeed the retiring [[Jean Chrétien]]. This brought an end to his political career, as Manley was unable to make much headway against front runner [[Paul Martin]], who not only had a large lead in polls but also controlled much of the party machinery. Apparently in retaliation, Bryden's renomination was not guaranteed and his electoral district was abolished, forcing him into an uphill battle against a Martin loyalist. In February 2004, he left the Liberal Party to join the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], citing disagreement with the actions and policies of the newly chosen Liberal leader Martin, notably criticizing Martin's vindictiveness and blaming him for triggering the [[Sponsorship scandal]], which proved politically disastrous for the Liberal Party. Bryden was unable to gain the Conservative nomination for his riding of [[Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], and he retired from politics.

==As a writer==
To date, his books have focused on World War II, including the area of chemical and biological warfare (''Deadly Allies''), signal intelligence (''Best Kept Secret'') and German secret intelligence (''Fighting To Lose''). His writing career was interrupted by his political career after his first two books. He subsequently published ''Fighting To Lose'' in 2014.

===Publications include===

*''Deadly Allies: Canada's Secret War 1937-1947'', Diane Books Publishing Company, 1989. {{ISBN|0-7710-1724-3}}

In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the [[Nawab of Bengal]] under [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[suzerainty]]. After the Nawab granted the [[East India Company]] a trading [[licence]] in 1690,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dutta|first=K.|last2=Desai|first2=A.|date=April 2008|title=Calcutta: a cultural history|publisher=Interlink Books|location=Northampton, Massachusetts, US|pages=9–10|isbn=978-1-56656-721-3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area was developed by the Company into [[Fort William, India|an increasingly fortified trading post]]. Nawab [[Siraj ud-Daulah]] occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and [[Permanent Settlement|assumed full sovereignty]] of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the [[British Raj]], Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in [[Bengal]], led to a shift of the capital to [[New Delhi]]. Calcutta was the centre for the [[Indian independence movement]]; it remains a hotbed of [[Politics of West Bengal|contemporary state politics]]. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.

As a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century [[Bengal Renaissance]] and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India, Kolkata has local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature. Many [[List of people from Kolkata|people from Kolkata]]—among them several Nobel laureates—have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. [[Kolkata culture]] features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively [[Para (Bengali)|close-knit neighbourhoods]] (''paras'') and [[Adda (South Asian)|freestyle intellectual exchanges]] (''adda''). West Bengal's share of the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta|Academy of Fine Arts]], the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]], the [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]], the [[Indian Museum]] and the [[National Library of India]]. Among professional scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the [[Agri Horticultural Society of India]], the [[Geological Survey of India]], the [[Botanical Survey of India]], the [[Calcutta Mathematical Society]], the [[Indian Science Congress Association]], the [[Zoological Survey of India]], the [[Institution of Engineers (India)|Institution of Engineers]], the [[Anthropological Survey of India]] and the [[Indian Public Health Association]]. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities [[Football in Kolkata|by giving importance]] to [[association football]] and other sports.

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Kolkata}}
The word ''Kolkata'' derives from the Bengali term ''[[Kalikata|Kôlikata]]'' ({{Lang-bn|কলিকাতা}}) [ˈkɔlikat̪a], the name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British, in the area where the city eventually was to be established; the other two villages were [[Sutanuti]] and [[Gobindapur, Kolkata|Govindapur]].&lt;ref name="spatialchange"&gt;{{cite book |title= Globalizing cities: a new spatial order?|last=Chakravorty|first=Sanjoy|editor1-last=Marcuse |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Kempen |editor2-first=Ronald van |chapter=From colonial city to global city? The far-from-complete spatial transformation of Calcutta|year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-631-21290-6 |pages= 56–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several explanations about the etymology of this name:
* The term ''Kolikata'' is thought to be a variation of ''Kalikkhetrô'' [ˈkalikʰːet̪rɔ] ({{Lang-bn|কালীক্ষেত্র}}), meaning "Field of [the goddess] [[Kali]]". Similarly, it can be a variation of 'Kalikshetra' ([[Sanskrit]]: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. "area of Goddess Kali").
* Another theory is that the name derives from [[Kalighat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kalighattemple.com/|title=Kalighat Kali Temple|website=kalighattemple.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134630/http://kalighattemple.com/|archivedate=17 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term ''kilkila'' ({{lang-bn|কিলকিলা}}), or "flat area".&lt;ref name="chatterjeename"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water resources, conservation and management |last=Chatterjee |first=S.N. |year=2008 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distributors |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-269-0868-4 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619194712/http://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name may have its origin in the words ''khal'' [ˈkʰal] ({{lang-bn|খাল}}) meaning "canal", followed by ''kaṭa'' [ˈkata] ({{lang-bn|কাটা}}), which may mean "dug".&lt;ref name="Nair"&gt;{{Cite book
|last = Nair|first=P. Thankappan |title = Calcutta in the 17th century |pages=54–58|publisher = Firma KLM |location=Kolkata|year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] or ''koli chun'' [ˈkɔlitɕun] ({{lang-bn|কলি চুন}}) and coir or ''kata'' [ˈkat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কাতা}}); hence, it was called ''Kolikata'' [ˈkɔlikat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কলিকাতা}}).&lt;ref name="chatterjeename" /&gt; 
Although the city's name has always been pronounced ''Kolkata'' [ˈkolkat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কলকাতা}}) or ''Kôlikata'' [ˈkɔlikat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কলিকাতা}}) in Bengali, the anglicised form ''Calcutta'' was the official name until 2001, when it [[Renaming of cities in India|was changed]] to ''Kolkata'' in order to match Bengali pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/papers/india.html |title= The politics of name changes in India|accessdate=26 January 2012|last=Easwaran|first= Kenny|publisher=Open Computing Facility, University of California at Berkeley

Kolkata is administered by several government agencies. The [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]], or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 15&amp;nbsp;boroughs, which together encompass 141&amp;nbsp;wards.&lt;ref name="kmcbasicstat" /&gt; Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets.&lt;ref name="kmcfunction" /&gt; As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC.&lt;ref name="kmcstructure"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/downloads/structure.pdf |title= Legislative structure |format= PDF |publisher= Kolkata Municipal Corporation |accessdate= 3 December 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6AatulFEl?url=https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/downloads/structure.pdf |archivedate= 11 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.&lt;ref name="kmcfunction"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/jsp/KMCFunctions.jsp |title=KMC functions |publisher=Kolkata Municipal Corporation |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120104184545/https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/jsp/KMCFunctions.jsp |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lazăr Șăineanu''' ({{IPAc-ro|lang|pron|'|l|a|z|ă|r|_|ș|ă|i|'|n|ea|n|U}}, also spelled '''Șeineanu''', born '''Eliezer Schein''';&lt;ref name="jl383"&gt;Leopold, p.383, 417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francization|Francisized]] '''Lazare Sainéan''', {{IPA-fr|lazaʁ sa.ine.ɑ̃}},&lt;ref name="amturcita"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru Mușina]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ara_turcit "Țara turcită"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 19/2003&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Sainéanu'''; April 23, 1859 – May 11, 1934) was a [[Romania]]n-born [[Philology|philologist]], [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] and cultural historian. A specialist in [[Oriental studies|Oriental]] and [[Romance studies]], as well as a [[German studies|Germanist]], he was primarily known for his contribution to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] philology, his work in [[evolutionary linguistics]], and his activity as a [[Comparative literature|literary]] and [[Comparative linguistics|philological comparatist]]. Șăineanu also had innovative contributions to the investigation and anthologizing of [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]], placed in relation to [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[East Central Europe]]an traditions, as well as to the [[History of the Romanian language|historical evolution]] of Romanian in a larger Balkan context, and was a celebrated early contributor to Romanian [[lexicography]]. His main initiatives in these fields are a large corpus of collected [[fairy tale]]s and the 1896 ''Dicționarul universal al limbii române'' ("The Universal Dictionary of the Romanian Language"), which have endured among the most popular Romanian scientific works.

A member of the [[Jewish Emancipation|non-emancipated]] [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian community]], Lazăr Șăineanu stood for the ''[[Haskalah]]'' ideas, and opted in favor of [[Jewish assimilation]] into the Romanian mainstream. His repeated requests for [[naturalization]] were eventually unsuccessful, but propelled him to the center of a political conflict which opposed the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] current to the advocates of tolerance. In 1901, Șăineanu and his family quit the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and resettled in [[France]], where the scholar lived until his death. Becoming known for his pioneering work to the study of [[Middle French]] and his investigations into the origins of [[argot]], as well as for his critical essays on 16th century writer [[François Rabelais]], he was a recipient of the [[Institut de France]]'s [[Volney Prize]] for 1908. The son in law of publisher [[Ralian Samitca]], Șăineanu was survived by his brother [[Constantin Șăineanu|Constantin]], a noted lexicographer, journalist and polemicist.

===Early life===
Eliezer Schein (whose name was originally rendered in Romanian as ''Lazăr Șain''&lt;ref name="idlsain"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iordan Datcu, [http://www.romlit.ro/lazr_ineanu "Lazăr Șăineanu"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728052348/http://www.romlit.ro/lazr_ineanu |date=2011-07-28 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 15/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], "Un savant călcat în picioare (I)", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 151, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Shain'')&lt;ref name="jewishro"&gt;{{ro icon}} A.

His father, Moisi, was a house painter and amateur artist, who, by the time his son was sixteen, had left to work in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; Eliezer studied with private tutors from the age of 5, and was admitted into regular school at the age of 10, when he entered second grade.&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; Moisi Schein died shortly after returning to Romania, leaving Eliezer the sole provider for his mother and six siblings.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsain9"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He was however able to pass his [[Romanian Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]], with a thesis on writer and theorist [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]: ''Ioan Eliad Rădulescu ca grămătic și filolog'' ("Ioan Eliad Rădulescu as a Grammarian and Philologist").&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;

By 1881, having been exempted from his compulsory term in the [[Romanian Land Forces]] as the eldest son of a widow,&lt;ref name="lsain9"/&gt; the young man went on to study at the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Letters.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.383; Nastasă, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; Taught and regarded with admiration by academic [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]],&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Șăineanu was primarily a student of [[etymology]], [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]] and [[semantics]] (which formed the basis of his first three studies, published in 1882 and 1887).&lt;ref name="jl383"/&gt; He published his first study, the 1883 ''Câteva specimene de etimologie populară română'' ("A Few Samples of Romanian Folk Etymology"), in Hasdeu's magazine ''Columna lui Traian''.&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; By then, Șăineanu had begun contributing to ''Anuar pentru Israeliți'' ("The Yearbook for [[Israelites]]"), the Hebraist magazine edited by his friends and fellow scholars [[Moses Gaster]] and [[Moses Schwartzfeld]], which mainly published articles on [[Jewish history]] and espoused a moderate [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] agenda (''[[Haskalah]]'').&lt;ref name="mshask"&gt;Măriuca Stanciu, [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/2-4.htm "A Promoter of the Haskala in Romania–Moses Gaster"], in the [[University of Bucharest]]'s [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/ ''Studia Hebraica I''], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Gaster also sent Șăineanu's various studies on folklore and linguistics also published in ''Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie'', a review founded and led by Romanian historian [[Grigore Tocilescu]].&lt;ref name="mshask"/&gt; The direct contacts between the two scholars ended in 1885, when Gaster was expelled from Romania for protesting against the antisemitic measures condoned by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] cabinet of [[Ion Brătianu]].&lt;ref name="lasavant2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], "Un savant călcat în picioare (II)", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 152, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1887 ''Încercare asupra semasiologiei române'' ("Essay on Romanian [[Semasiology]]"), presented by Schein as his graduation paper,&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsain1"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; was retrospectively commended by [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] Iordan Datcu for its innovative value, and argued by the same commentator to have attracted universally positive reactions from "objective critics".&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; According to Șăineanu's account, it followed closely after semasiology itself had been established as an independent branch by the French academic [[Michel Bréal]].&lt;ref name="lsain1"/&gt; It reportedly earned him the praise of a future adversary the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Innovation (Romania)|Education Minister]] and National Liberal politician [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], who allegedly recommended him to study abroad, reassuring him that, unlike in Gaster's case, "we will receive you back with open arms."&lt;ref name="lsain1"/&gt; Printed by the [[Romanian Academy]]'s press and prefaced by Hasdeu,&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; ''Încercare'' earned Șăineanu the [[Manoah Hillel]] [[scholarship]], amounting to 5,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] in gold.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;

Using this grant,&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; he furthered his studies in France, at the [[University of Paris]], under Bréal, [[Gaston Paris]] and [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]], and later at the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|École Spéciale des Langues Orientales]], where he specialized in the study of Oriental languages.&lt;ref name="jl383"/&gt; He received his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Leipzig]], in the [[German Empire]],&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.105, 203; Sainéan (1901), p.2, 9, 30&lt;/ref&gt; his dissertation receiving an award from the [[Institut de France]].&lt;ref name="jl383"/&gt; According to historian Lucian Nastasă, the scholar's choice was confirming a common practice of Romanians, who opted to bridge the gap between [[Francophilia]] and [[Germanophilia]] by frequenting venues in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.105, 203&lt;/ref&gt; As Șăineanu wrote to Gaster, he had decided in favor of the "intellectual center" [[Leipzig]] because [[Karl Brugmann]], "the leading representative of present-day linguistics", worked and taught there.&lt;ref name="ln203"&gt;Nastasă, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; He studied with both Brugmann and [[August Leskien]], earning much praise for his work and the right to take his diploma under special circumstances (which took into consideration his previous works, and did not require him to research a full-sized new thesis).&lt;ref name="ln203"/&gt; Șăineanu was pleased with the scientific rigor of his German teachers, but believed the system to suffer greatly in the matter of [[pedagogy]], and considered French academics much more talented in this respect.&lt;ref name="ln203"/&gt; The young scholar published two works during the interval: ''Legenda Meșterului Manole la grecii moderni'' ("The ''[[Meșterul Manole]]'' Legend among the Modern [[Greeks]]") and his Ph.D. thesis on [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]],&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; ''Les Jours d'emprunt ou les jours de la vieille'' ("The Borrowed Days or The Old Woman's Days").&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsain2"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was hosted by Gaston Paris' journal ''Romania''.&lt;ref name="lsain2"/&gt;

===Beginnings as a teacher===
He returned to Romania as a teacher of [[Latin]] and Romanian, pursuing a career path which eventually earned him a position at Bucharest University.&lt;ref name="jl383"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.2sqq&lt;/ref&gt; He was given employment as a high school teacher, and obtained an unpaid university position as assistant to Hasdeu, head of the Department of Letters.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.105, 203; Sainéan (1901), p.2-3, 7, 17, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Nastasă, who notes Șăineanu's enthusiasm for his work, writes: "His opening lecture for the Comparative Philology course—like all of his work—is a proof of erudition more or less unparalleled within the areas of Romania."&lt;ref name="ln105"&gt;Nastasă, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his qualifications, Șăineanu was unable to advance professionally because of his non-citizen status.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; The young researcher was also appointed substitute teacher of Latin in [[Bucharest]] [[Gheorghe Lazăr National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Lazăr High School]] by an administrative decision of the Education Ministry, taken despite the antisemitic protestations of Undersecretary [[Ștefan Michăilescu]].&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; His assignment to the post followed the intercession of his friend and former teacher, the writer and archeologist [[Alexandru Odobescu]],&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.105; Sainéan (1901), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and inaugurated a short period during which Șăineanu focused on writing textbooks.&lt;ref name="lsain3"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative]] Minister [[Titu Maiorescu]], leader of the influential literary club ''[[Junimea]]'' and himself one of Lazăr Șăineanu's former professors,&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; appointed him to a position at the University, within the History and Literature Department of [[V. A. Urechia]].&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.106, 203; Sainéan (1901), p.4-7&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, an outspoken antisemite and prominent member of the opposition National Liberal group, reacted strongly against the measure, launching that claim that, unlike an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]], a Jew "could never awaken in the mind and heart of the young generation the image of our past laden with lessons for the future".&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; According to Șăineanu's own recollection, he had not himself asked for the university appointment, and suspected that it was offered to him in the first place so that the Gheorghe Lazăr position would be assigned to "a favorite of the day, the former tutor of [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Prince Ferdinand]]."&lt;ref name="lsain5"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.5&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless noted that Urechia had a [[conflict of interest]] when opposing his appointment, given that he had designed the department around his own chairmanship, and that, with the aid of [[University of Iași]] academic [[Alexandru D. Xenopol]], he had set in motion a set of "miserable intrigues" to maintain his hold on the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Șăineanu also commented on the alleged oscillations of Tocilescu, who, after agreeing to lead the History section upon its recommended division, and supporting his Jewish colleague for chairmanship of the Letters section, threw his support behind Urechia.&lt;ref name="lsain7"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Nastasă, who mentions the scheming on the part of Urechia and Tocilescu, cites Moses Gaster's letter to Șăineanu, which defined Tocilescu as a double-crosser, "a filthy twicer and a bloodsucker".&lt;ref name="ln106"&gt;Nastasă, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; The complications eventually led Șăineanu to present his resignation, and Maiorescu to accept it.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsain7"/&gt; He recalled: "Every reasonable man would doubtlessly assume that [...] the resentment Mr. Urechia held against this unfortunate nomination would have been appeased. To assume thus would mean not to know the person or the Romanian social environment well enough, for barely two months had passed before grandiose [[patriotism]] again displayed the effects of its hatred."&lt;ref name="lsain7"/&gt;

The young linguist also contributed to ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', a magazine edited by ''Junimea''. It was there that, in 1887, he published his study on the [[Khazars]]' possible presence in Romanian folklore: ''Jidovii sau Tătarii sau Uriașii'' ("The Jews or the [[Tatars]] or the ''[[Uriași]]''").&lt;ref name="amkhazar"&gt;Adrian Majuru, [http://www.icr.ro/bucuresti/the-continent-of-romania-romania-s-national-minorities-27-2006/khazar-jews-romanian-history-and-ethnography.html "Khazar Jews. Romanian History and Ethnography" (excerpts)], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 27/2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.18-21&lt;/ref&gt; Produced on the basis of folkloric surveys in [[Muntenia]]n and [[Oltenia]]n localities such as [[Dragoslavele]], [[Schitu Golești]] and [[Radomir, Dolj|Radomir]], the study was later used against him by his political adversaries, who resented the implications it seemed to carry for the traditional relations between Jews and Romanians.&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt;

===Scholarly prominence and early naturalization efforts===
[[Image:Lazar Saineanu - prima pagina - Elemente turcesti in limba romana.png|thumb|230px|First page of ''Elemente turcești în limba română'', 1885]]
By that moment in his career, Șăineanu was also publishing several books on comparative linguistics. Initially, he focused on assessing the impact of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] on the mainly [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[Aromanian language]], producing the 1885 study {{lang|ro|Elemente turcești în limba aromână}} ("[[Turkish vocabulary|Turkish Elements]] in the Aromanian Language").&lt;ref name="dg356"&gt;Daniel Gunar, ''Contact des langues et bilinguisme en Europe orientale: bibliographie analytique'', [[Presses Université Laval]], Quebec, 1979, p.356.  {{ISBN|2-7637-6806-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, he published his innovative work on the links between [[German language|German]] and Yiddish, {{lang|ro|Studiu dialectologic asupra graiului evreo-german}} ("A [[Dialectology|Dialectologic]] Study on Judeo-German Speech").&lt;ref name="ngjdgl"&gt;Neil G. Jacobs, [[Dagmar C. G. Lorenz]], "If I Were King of the Jews: ''Germanistik'' and the ''Judaistikfrage''", in Dagmar C. G. Lorenz, Renate S. Posthofen (eds.), ''Transforming the Center, Eroding the Margins: Essays on Ethnic and Cultural Boundaries in German-speaking Countries'', Camden House ([[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]), Columbia, 1998, p.192.  {{ISBN|1-57113-171-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recognized field of expertise, Nastasă notes, was by then the widest in Romania, comprising not just Yiddish and Romance linguistics, but also the study [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] and various other languages and dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.105-106&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1889, Șăineanu applied for [[naturalization]], which, according to the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]], a Jew could only receive by special act of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] and in exchange for exceptional merits.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsain8sqq"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.8sqq&lt;/ref&gt; The effort, which consumed some 12 years of his life, pitted him against the antisemitic current in politics and the scientific community: among the most vocal adversaries of his naturalization were two prominent National Liberals, Urechia and Sturdza, both of whom had a following among [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sections of the electorate.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsain8sqq"/&gt; As head of the parliamentary commission on legal integration, Sturdza signed a recommendation to reject the proposed law, which had been previously approved by [[Ministry of Justice and Citizenship Freedoms (Romania)|Justice Minister]] [[George D. Vernescu]], on grounds that Șăineanu lacked qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.9-15&lt;/ref&gt; Their campaign, which depicted Șăineanu as an adversary of Romania, culminated when [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] voted 79 to 2 against the naturalization request.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The resistance to his application was a surprise for Șăineanu, who wrote: "I was not aware that this path [...] is the more thorny as the [person's] merits are more real."&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; He also accused the political establishment of endemic [[Political corruption|corruption]], writing: "any banker who demanded naturalization received it without the least of difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; During the following interval, Șăineanu's cause reportedly won the support of [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], Conservative [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Lascăr Catargiu]]&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.16-18&lt;/ref&gt; and moderate National Liberal politico [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]].&lt;ref name="lsain16"&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the situation, Șăineanu cited an unusual incident in neighboring [[Austria–Hungary]], where local Romanians were demanding increased [[group rights]] as part of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum|Memorandum]]'' movement. Their arguments about cultural repression were met with the reply of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] intellectuals, who cited the Șăineanu issue as proof that Austria–Hungary had more to offer than Romania: "He had all of Romania on his case, but he had rendered [the country] as many services as most Romanian demigods."&lt;ref name="lsain16"/&gt; In 1893, the naturalization request came before the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|lower chamber]], resulting in a vote of 76 in favor to 20 against.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; According to the scholar's recollections, his only adversary in this forum was his former ''Convorbiri Literare'' colleague, writer [[Iacob Negruzzi]], who reportedly stated the unsupported claim that Șăineanu had campaigned against Romania "in English" (Șăineanu believed that this was "doubtlessly" stated "because [English] was completely unfamiliar to the majority of Chamber members").&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his involvement in a political scandal, Lazăr Șăineanu did not interrupt his work in linguistics. His 1891 book, {{lang|ro|Raporturile între gramatică și logică}} ("The Relations between [[Grammar]] and [[Logic]]"), written on the basis of his university lectures,&lt;ref name="ln105"/&gt; comprised his thoughts on the [[origin of language]] and was among volumes pioneering the study of logical aspects within [[natural language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sorin Stati]], "Discourse Correspondence between Argumentative and Grammatical Sequences", in Frans H. van Eemeren, J. Anthony Blair, [[Charles Arthur Willard]], A. Francisca Snoeck Henkemans (eds.), ''Anyone Who Has a View: Theoretical Contributions to the Study of Argumentation'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], Dordrecht, 2003, p.189.  {{ISBN|1-4020-1456-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Datcu notes this contribution, alongside the 1892 ''Istoria filologiei române'' ("History of Romanian Philology"), for the "up to date information" provided.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; The latter was explained by the author as "destined to encourage the new generation to work, and come to its aid through useful advice."&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The two volumes were accompanied by a printed expansion of his earliest thesis on Heliade Rădulescu.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;

In 1895, Șăineanu completed work on one of his major contributions to folkloristics in general and the study of [[Folklore of Romania|Romania folklore]] in particular: ''Basmele române în comparațiune cu legendele antice clasice și în legătură cu basmele popoarelor învecinate și ale tuturor popoarelor romanice'' ("Romanian Fairy Tales as Compared to the [[Classical mythology|Legends of Classical Antiquity]] and Those of All [[Romance-speaking Europe|Romance Peoples]]").&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; An exhaustive [[monograph]], it comprised some 1,000 pages of main text and 100 pages of [[Index (publishing)|index]].&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; The volume was presented anonymously to the Romanian Academy (in accordance with its regulations), and received its Heliade Rădulescu Award. Consternation ensued once the author revealed his name, prompting Sturdza and Negruzzi to ask, unsuccessfully, for the Academy's decision to be overturned.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion, Urechia (himself an Academy member) publicly stated that his adversary had purchased the award, but, Șăineanu noted, never presented proof for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the matter of his citizenship was returned to the Senate. By then, Șăineanu's file had been further enriched with the award certificate, a guarantee of good conduct from [[Mayor of Bucharest|Bucharest City Hall]], and several favorable reports from Hasdeu (an exception to the latter's own antisemitic discourse).&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; Hasdeu also arranged him interviews with [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] [[Patriarch of All Romania|Metropolitan]] [[Ghenadie Petrescu|Ghenadie]] (who was also president of the commission on naturalization), while [[Alexandru Odobescu]] brought the case to the attention of [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]], the Conservative [[President of the Senate of Romania|President of the Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.28-29&lt;/ref&gt; There followed a major Senate debate, during which Urechia stood out for his repeated criticism of his former competitor, likening him to a [[Trojan Horse]] and demanding from fellow parliamentarians not to let "a foreigner" slide into "the Romanian citadel" (statements to which many responded with applause).&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; Listing his various claims alongside his and Hasdeu's replies, the Jewish scholar himself recounted that Urechia eventually came to state, at the Senate tribune, that "Mr. Șăineanu did not publish anything against the country, but neither did he write in favor of the national question".&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The early vote gave 33 to 26 against Șăineanu's naturalization, short of the [[supermajority]] required, but a second take resulted in 61 against to 12 in favor.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.30-32&lt;/ref&gt; The antisemitic segment of the board celebrated this victory with loud cheers, as witnessed by Odobescu, who recorded feeling himself confronted with the image of "[[cannibal]]s who rejoiced like beasts over having slashed and devoured a civilized man".&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.353"&gt;Călinescu, p.353&lt;/ref&gt; Another voice from academia to speak unfavorably of the opposition met by Șăineanu was [[Alexandru Philippide]], who wrote: "I am not [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitic]], but if there ever was a kike deserving of naturalization, that would be Șăineanu."&lt;ref name="ln106"/&gt; Shortly after this incident, the new National Liberal Minister [[Spiru Haret]] reshuffled the teaching posts, and Șăineanu, who was holding a new teacher's position at Bucharest's [[Școala Normală Superioară]], found himself unemployed, and opted to seek employment outside Romania, in [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Without ceasing to publish works for the ''Junimea'' periodical ''Convorbiri Literare'', Șăineanu continued to frequent its adversary Hasdeu, and contributed some of his other essays to Hasdeu's magazine ''Revista Nouă''.&lt;ref name="tv240-241"&gt;[[Tudor Vianu]], ''Scriitori români'', Vol. II, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1970, p.240-241. {{OCLC|7431692}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Basmele române'' was followed in 1896 by ''Studii folclorice'' ("Studies in Folklore"), a collection of short writings on [[comparative mythology]].&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; That same year, he completed his fundamental work in lexicography, ''Dicționarul universal al limbii române'', which codified the [[Romanian lexis]] from [[archaism]]s and [[Romanian dialects|dialectical varieties]] to [[neologism]]s and modern [[jargon]],&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; comprising around 30,000 entries and 80,000 definitions.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; The first extensive project of its kind in the history of the local philological school,&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; it was to prove his most popular contribution from its first edition, circumstances themselves described by writer [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] as a phenomenon in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]]. Caragiale, who deemed Lazăr Șăineanu "a genuine talent in popularization", opined on the book's originality: "[Șăineanu] sought to embrace the entire manifestations in the life of a modern people [...]. Therefore, this universal dictionary provides a reduced, but precise image of our present-day culture, as it is reflected in the language."&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; In contrast to this positive appraisal, nationalists such as Urechia's son [[Alceu Urechia|Alceu]] publicly mocked the book and claimed that it lacked merit.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;

In parallel, the volume consecrated Șăineanu's collaboration with the [[Craiova]]-based printing house of Jewish entrepreneur [[Iosif Samitca]] ([[Institutul Samitca]]), where the scholar also published ''Mitologia clasică'' ("Classical Mythology"), the 1895 [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] anthology ''Autori români moderni. Bucăți alese în versuri și proză din principalii scriitori ai sec. al XIX-lea'' ("Modern Romanian Authors. Verse and Prose Samples Collected from the Main Writers of the 19th Century"), and an 1897 biographical essay on [[England|English]] author [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; The business connection turned into family relations, after Șăineanu married the daughter of [[Ralian Samitca]], Iosif's son, associate and eventual successor.&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; They had a daughter, Elisabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Dedication page, in Sainéan (1901)&lt;/ref&gt;

Șăineanu followed up with a comprehensive study regarding [[Levant]]ine presences in the vocabulary and society alike, published by [[Editura Socec]] in 1900 (as {{lang|ro|Influența orientală asupra limbii și culturii române}}, "The Oriental Influence on Romanian Language and Culture") and being made into a [[French language|French-language]] edition in 1901.&lt;ref name="dg356"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jl89, 383"&gt;Leopold, p.89, 383&lt;/ref&gt; It received attention from the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]], and consequently a nomination for the Institut de France's [[Volney Prize]].&lt;ref name="jl89, 383"/&gt; However, in what has been seen as proof of the author's isolation in Romania, it was ignored by the Romanian Academy, which presented its prize for that year to a volume on the history of horses.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; The book was also a cause for conflict between Șăineanu and [[Nicolae Iorga]], an established historian and nationalist politician. The heated debate, carried out in [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s periodical ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', was sparked by Iorga's review, which claimed to provide some necessary amends.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; Șăineanu found the objections outlined by Iorga frivolous, and the overall text, in which his opponent had cited himself some 15 times, egocentric.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;

This reaction was met with a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: "[Șăineanu wrote] about many things that he does not comprehend. He was crafting with his clumsy hands manuals, grammars, anthologies, dictionaries for speculative profit. I however had an explanation for such defects. We all know that Mr. Șăineanu is not a Romanian, and we know that which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I had been telling myself, are in his blood; he could never get rid of them. I wish to talk about the passion for high praise and multiple earnings, without much investment".&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; In 1907, Iorga and his ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'' journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for Șăineanu, calling Caragiale one who "deals with the Jews", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Voicu]], [http://www.euro.ubbcluj.ro/studiaj/sj2007/12.THE%20-JUDAISATION-%20OF%20THE%20ENEMY%20IN%20THE%20ROMANIAN%20POLITICAL%20CULTURE%20AT%20THE%20BEGINNING%20OF%20THE%2020TH%20CENTURY%20-%20GEORGE%20VOICU.pdf "The 'Judaisation' of the Enemy in the Romanian Political Culture at the Beginning of the 20th Century"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224003608/http://www.euro.ubbcluj.ro/studiaj/sj2007/12.THE%20-JUDAISATION-%20OF%20THE%20ENEMY%20IN%20THE%20ROMANIAN%20POLITICAL%20CULTURE%20AT%20THE%20BEGINNING%20OF%20THE%2020TH%20CENTURY%20-%20GEORGE%20VOICU.pdf |date=2012-02-24 }}, in the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]]'s ''[http://www.euro.ubbcluj.ro/studiaj/ Studia Judaica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329033014/http://www.euro.ubbcluj.ro/studiaj/ |date=2010-03-29 }}'', 2007, p.148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

===1899 parliamentary vote and self-exile===
In order to facilitate the naturalization procedures, Lazăr Șăineanu eventually renounced [[Judaism]] and accepted baptism in the Romanian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.383-384&lt;/ref&gt; His [[godparent|godfather]] was [[Take Ionescu]], at the time a rising figure within the Conservative Party ranks.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; Ionescu himself served as Minister of Education, appreciating the scholar's insight and enjoying his company before taking his distance from him for reasons unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.39-40, 43-47&lt;/ref&gt; Șăineanu's case was again presented for Senate approval in December 1899, this time with a favorable review from the special parliamentary commission, and the motion for his naturalization was carried with 37 to 2 votes&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; (or, according to Șăineanu, a 39-vote unanimity).&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Although the result was positive, the scientist was informed that a new procedure had just been passed with support from across the floor, specifying that naturalization could only be enforced by vote in a common session of the two chambers.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.41-43, 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; The dossier was therefore submitted to another vote, on the last session of 1899, which again enlisted attacks from the antisemitic groups, before being canceled due to lack of [[quorum]].&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the early result, which had left him "submerged into complete happiness", and on the new vote, which he believed was a mere technicality introduced on purpose by Justice Minister [[Constantin Dissescu]], he recalled: "for 24 hours I was ''politically'' [Șăineanu's italics] within the Romanian nationhood!"&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled having been received by King Carol, who reportedly agreed with his belief that the action was abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.43, 46&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Șăineanu also lost the support of Hasdeu, who, like Take Ionescu, gave his approval to a restructuring of the University, which stripped the Jewish scholar of his honorary position.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.44-45&lt;/ref&gt; He sought instead backing from [[Petre P. Carp]], the Conservative doyen, who reportedly answered his request with the ambiguous Latin adage ''Gutta cavat lapidem'' ("The water drop will drill through stone").&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the divide, the attacks on Șăineanu had come to be led by the antisemitic paper ''[[Apărarea Națională]]'', whose articles, the scholar argued, "reached the summit of stupidity and ridiculousness".&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 1900, the issue of Lazăr Șăineanu's naturalization was also revisited by the lower chamber, and the proposal defeated with 44 votes to 31 (from an insufficient quorum of 75), followed by a definitive vote on December 15, at which 48 out of 95 deputies voted against.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; This outcome was celebrated by ''Apărarea Națională'', which published editorial comments such as "All Romanian hearts have jumped up with immense glee" and "Our ancestors have shuddered with joy in their graves".&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who expressed condemnation of the decision were ''[[La Roumanie]]'' journal and aristocrat [[Alexandru Bibescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, frustrated by the political reaction and feeling uncomfortable in Romania, the scholar and his family resettled in Paris, where he primarily used a [[Francization]] of his Romanian name, signing as ''Lazare Sainéan''.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jl384"&gt;Leopold, p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

===French career and final years===
[[File:1907 Sainean, Argot ancien.JPG|thumb|200px|Title page of ''L'Argot ancien'' in its 1907 edition]]
His main interest for the following period were the theories of [[evolutionary linguistics]], with focus on the [[Neogrammarian]] approach, [[ethnolinguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]].&lt;ref name="jl384"/&gt; He also added to his interests the groundbreaking investigation of French [[argot]],&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jl384"/&gt; and published a short [[memoir]] (''Une carrière philologique en Roumanie'', "A Philologist's Career in Romania"). Șăineanu's studies also focused on a comparative research of building rituals as found in Balkan literature, and notably the Romanian ''[[Meșterul Manole]]'' myth (the book saw print in French, as the 1902 ''Les rites de la construction d'après la poésie populaire de l'Europe Orientale'').&lt;ref name="jnmcp273"&gt;John Neubauer, [[Marcel Cornis-Pope]], "Introduction: Folklore and National Awakening", in Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer (eds.), ''History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe'', Vol. 3, [[John Benjamins]], Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, 2004, p.273.  {{ISBN|9027234523}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he was in correspondence with fellow linguist [[Alfred Landau]], with whom he discussed the history of Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Frankes, p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

Șăineanu's parallel investigations into the [[history of French]] included his 1905-1907 ''La Création métaphorique en français et en roman: images tirées du monde des animaux domestiques'' ("The Metaphoric Creation in French and Romance Languages: Images from the World of Domestic Animals"), which was structured into several tomes, respectively dedicated to the principal household companions. He also began work on major syntheses on French vocabulary, ''L'Argot ancien'' ("Ancient Argot") and its companion ''Les Sources de l'argot ancien'' ("The Sources of Ancient Argot", 1907). The former earned him the [[Volney Prize]] for 1908. Writing in 1999, historian Joan Leopold argued that this was a significant achievement, since the Volney Commission "seemed to fear direct competition by foreigners"—other exceptions to this rule being [[Liu Bannong]], [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] and [[Marie-Louise Sjoestedt]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leopold, Șăineanu was among the Volney prizewinners, "particularly foreigners", who "were never elected to an affiliation with the [[French art salons and academies|French Académies]]."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also notes that "there were no titles honored [during 1900-1909] which are now remembered as significant in the history of linguistics".&lt;ref name="jl97"&gt;Leopold, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; She places the fact that Șăineanu "did not achieve major university positions in France" in connection with a tendency of awarding the prize to scholars who mainly did field work (Schmidt, [[Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski]], [[George Abraham Grierson]], [[Leo Reinisch]] and others).&lt;ref name="jl97"/&gt; Literary critic [[Laszlo Alexandru]] passed a similar judgment: "Lazăr Șăineanu's disappearance from the Romanian cultural space was received with an almost unanimous silence; but the emergence of Lazare Sainéan in Parisian scientific research would not itself result, for the rest of his days, in the much coveted and entirely deserved university chair."&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;

Between 1912 and 1922, Șăineanu worked with the ''Société des Études rabelaisiennes'' on publishing the annotated edition of Rabelais' complete works.&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; His career was not interrupted by [[World War I]], and, in 1915, he published a report on the special language of French soldiers entrenched on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] (''L'Argot des tranchés'', "Trench Argot").&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; His 1920 volume on the evolution of argot in [[Standard French|Parisian French]] ({{lang|fr|Le Langage parisien au XIXe siècle}}, "Parisian Language in the 19th Century"), was again nominated for a Volney Prize.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.96, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Șăineanu published ''Manuel de phonétique latin'' ("Manual of [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|Latin Phonetics]]"), the last of his contributions to be shortlisted for a Volney.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he had also become interested in researching the work of [[French Renaissance]] author [[François Rabelais]], primarily focusing on his use of [[Middle French]]—an account published between 1920 and 1923 as ''La Langue de Rabelais'' ("Rabelais' Language").&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mb185"&gt;Bakhtin, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1925 and 1930, he published the volumes of a large-scale project, ''Les Sources indigènes de l'étymologie française'' ("The Indigenous Sources of French Etymology"), which was reputedly the result of three decades in specialized research.&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt; In 1930, Șăineanu followed up with another book on Rabelais, mainly dedicated to his critical reception and cultural legacy (''L'Influence et la réputation de Rabelais'', "Rabelais' Influence and Reputation").&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, p.60, 61&lt;/ref&gt; He died four years later at a hospital in Paris, after complications from surgery.&lt;ref name="jewishro"/&gt;

==Work==

===Background and tenets===
[[File:Saineanu Florea Marian 1886.jpg|thumb|220px|Șăineanu's letter to fellow folklorist [[Simion Florea Marian]] (November 1886)]]
The diverse cultural background on which Lazăr Șăineanu relied and his early familiarity with several traditions are occasionally credited as sources for his scholarly achievements. Joan Leopold noted that the Romanian-born scholar was among the fourteen or fifteen Jews of various nationalities whose work was taken into consideration by the Volney Committee during the 19th century, pointing to the legacy of "[[Talmud]]ic and [Jewish] philological traditions" within modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; His Jewish identity, literary historian [[George Călinescu]] noted in 1933, went in tandem with an exceptional familiarity with Romanian language and culture; like other of his fellow Jewish Romanian intellectuals (among whom Călinescu cited philologists Gaster and [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and dramatist [[Ronetti Roman]]), Șăineanu possessed "an amazingly rich [[Romanian lexis]]".&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;

During his time in Romania, the scientist was involved in cultural debates surrounding the Romanian [[ethos]]. As a disciple of [[Moses Gaster]] and contributor to ''Anuar pentru Israeliți'', Șăineanu implicitly stood for a ''[[Haskalah]]'' ideology, supporting Jewish integration into the cultural mainstream, and favored the scientific approach to [[Jewish history]] akin to the ''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]'' methods.&lt;ref name="mshask"/&gt; Laszlo Alexandru refers to his "fundamental program" as being "the assimilationist thesis", and explains that, for this reason, the scholar changed ''Schein'' to ''Șăineanu''.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; The same commentator notes that Șăineanu disregarded [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]'s publicized antisemitism when he became a "fervent disciple" of Hasdeu in scholarly matters.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; In reference to his own [[Patriotism|patriotic]] sentiment, Șăineanu once defined the country as "twice sacred to my eyes—the land where I was born and where my parents sleep their eternal slumber."&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; After his departure to France, he further stated that he bore "not even the shadow of a grudge" on the Romanian people as a whole.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; According to literary historian [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the scholar's subsequent correspondence stands as "proof of sincere adherence, prolonged over decades and perils, to his country of origin".&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; However, according to one account, when Șăineanu happened to meet [[Nicolae Iorga]] in Paris some decades after their polemic, he made a point of addressing him in French, which was interpreted as a statement of disgust with the Romanian cultural environment.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;

Șăineanu also made himself known for the points of view which he expressed in relation to the debates over the [[Romanian alphabet|Latin alphabet and orthography]], within the context of [[History of the Romanian language|linguistic evolution]]. Overall, Șăineanu argued that early [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] as taught in his lifetime was better covered by philologists, since, before the time of [[Michael the Brave]], it had "more of an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and philological character".&lt;ref name="lsain5"/&gt; He reacted against the politicization of research and accusations that his own works did not support popular views of "the national question".&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.35-37&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic version]] had been discarded but the new spelling was still largely unregulated, he joined the outspoken critics of attempts to modify the shape of words so as to suggest their Latin origins.&lt;ref name="an192"&gt;Alexandru Niculescu, "Histoire de la réflexion sur les langues romanes: le roumain / Geschichte der Reflexion über die romanischen Sprachen: Rumänisch", in Gerhard Ernst, Martin-Dietrich Gleßgen, Christian Schmitt, Wolfgang Schweickard (eds.), ''Histoire linguistique de la Romania / Romanische Sprachgeschichte'', Vol. 1, [[Walter de Gruyter]], Berlin, 2003, p.192.  {{ISBN|3-11-014694-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Latinist" approach, experimented in the lexicographic work of [[I. C. Massim]] and [[August Treboniu Laurian]] and originating with the [[Transylvanian School]], was favored for a while by the [[Romanian Academy]], but had become widely ridiculed by the 1880s.&lt;ref name="an192"/&gt; According to the scholar's own words, "Latinomaniac tendencies" were nevertheless present with National Liberals such as Sturdza, and formed a background theme in the party's conflict with Moses Gaster.&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.2, 24&lt;/ref&gt; While approaching the ''[[Junimea]]'' society's tenets on this matter, Șăineanu also shared [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]'s criticism of ''Junimist'' [[Germanophilia]]. In 1897, the two scholars published ''Eine Trilogie'' ([[German language|German]] for "A Trilogy"), criticizing a perceived Conservative and ''Junimist'' monopoly on the [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literary scene]] in general, and, in particular, the officially condoned historical overview by [[Wilhelm Rudow]], [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]] and [[Iacob Negruzzi]], which seemed to omit mention of any politically inconvenient literary contribution.&lt;ref name="tv240-241"/&gt;

===Work in Romanian folklore===
Much of Lazăr Șăineanu earliest contributions connected his linguistic research with his interest in [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]]. Aiming to be "a genuine corpus of Romanian oral literature", ''Basmele române'' aimed at introducing the major themes in local [[Oral tradition|spoken tradition]], listing and transcribing some 500 stories.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; Lazăr Șăineanu took additional care in preserving the integrity of the [[Oral literature|oral level]] of Romanian literature in printed versions, and urged other folklorists interviewing storytellers to keep notes on the latter's special talents.&lt;ref name="ld46"&gt;Dégh, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Such preoccupations in preserving context were also found in his lexicographic work; according to Caragiale, ''Dicționarul universal'' was groundbreaking because its author took care "to support with authentic testimonies the words and the nuances of meanings."&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;

A special section of Șăineanu's research in the same area was dedicated to [[comparative mythology]]. His contributions have led folklorist [[Linda Dégh]] to deem him "one of the pioneers in classifying folktales according to their types".&lt;ref name="ld46"/&gt; This method was employed in ''Basmele române'', whose content was structured into both types and "cycles".&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; In ''Basmele române'', arguing in favor of applying the principles introduced by Hasdeu, Șăineanu analyzed Romanian folktales in their native and national content.&lt;ref&gt;Ene, p.XXV&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he followed the conclusions of other folklorists on the universality of folklore, suggesting that the world's entire folkloric literature was structured into some tens of groups.&lt;ref name="vexxiv"&gt;Ene, p.XXIV&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Studii folclorice'', the researcher tested an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] investigation into the characteristics and supposed origins of each myth, in particular ''[[Meșterul Manole]]'', ''[[Baba Dochia]]'' and the ''[[iele]]'' creatures.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; In ''Les rites de la construction'', Șăineanu focused on a set of [[ballad]]s with a similar construction- and [[immurement]]-related subject, present throughout [[East Central Europe|East Central]] or [[Eastern Europe]], likening the Romanian ''Meșterul Manole'' legend to its counterparts in [[Serbian folklore|Serbian]] (''[[Zidanje Skadra]]''), [[Hungarian mythology|Hungarian]] (''[[Kőműves Kelemen]]'') and other regional folkloric traditions.&lt;ref name="jnmcp273"/&gt; According to critics John Neubauer and [[Marcel Cornis-Pope]], he was "the first author to attempt a synthetic treatment of the immurement motif in Eastern Europe".&lt;ref name="jnmcp273"/&gt; The two also note that Șăineanu, who believed that the motif reached its potential significance only in Eastern Europe, stayed clear of the controversy surrounding the geographic and ethnic sources of the ballad (while specifying his belief that the Hungarian version followed a Romanian source), and discussed ''Zidanje Skadra'' and ''Meșterul Manole'' as the most crafted variants of the myth.&lt;ref name="jnmcp273"/&gt;

One portion of Șăineanu's studies in Romanian folklore bordered on his investigation of Jewish history. The scholar noticed recurring characteristic among [[antagonist]]s in Romanian fairy tales, particularly the ''[[uriași]]''—occasionally known as ''jidovi'', "Jews", or ''tătari'', "[[Tatars]]".&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt; He attributed such traits to a possible conflictual encounter, taking place at some point in the [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], between Romanians (or [[Vlachs]]) and the [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribe that had adopted Judaism.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt; His interpretation, as paraphrased by the scholar himself, concluded: "Was there in the past a people about which one could claim with certainty that it was both Tatar and Jewish at the same time? My answer to this question is that such a people existed, and it is known in history under the name of Khazars [...]. After spreading its domination over Eastern Europe, these Jewish-Tatars suddenly disappeared from the stage of history. What became of them? A part of these Khazars will have looked early on for a shelter in [[Transylvania]], from where they crossed to the [[Danubian Principalities|Danubian countries]], especially in [[Muntenia]], particularly in [[Muscel County|Muscel]] and [[Romanați County|Romanați]] districts where the traditional memories regarding them seem to be concentrated. [...] The settlements and their dwellings left important traces that took on colossal proportions in people's imagination. People of a supernatural size seemed to have lived [...] in an ancient time, which the old can hardly remember, and our peasants call those giant people Jews or Tatars."&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.18-19&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar referred to various constants in folkloric accounts: peasants' testimonies which attributed large stone ruins to the Jews (whom they occasionally referred to as giants or supernaturally powerful people) and the "red" [[antagonist]]s in fairy tales such as [[Ion Creangă]]'s ''[[Harap Alb]]'' (the "Red Emperor", the "Red Man" and people with red-colored facial markings, all placed by Șăineanu in connection to the "[[Red Jews]]" myth).&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt; Șăineanu's political adversaries, including [[V. A. Urechia]], saw in this theory evidence of a Jewish historiographical attempt at overriding the Romanian presence in the area&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.8, 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;—an interpretation since defined as "in bad faith" and "slanderous" by Laszlo Alexandru.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt;

===Yiddish and Romanian linguistics===

The scholar earned much recognition for his parallel work in Yiddish linguistics. According to [[United States|American]] researcher Jerold C. Frakes, he is one of the "major scholars of the late nineteenth century" to have studied the Yiddish language, his contribution ranking him alongside [[Maks Erik]], [[Solomon Birnbaum]], [[Chone Shmeruk]], [[Max Weinreich|Max]] and [[Uriel Weinreich]].&lt;ref&gt;Frakes, p.xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hebraist Robert D. King, such contributions rank Șăineanu, [[Alfred Landau]] and [[Matisyohu Mieses]] "among the first scholars to take Yiddish seriously, to ''force others'' [King's italics] to take it seriously, to move conceptually beyond the stupid position that Yiddish was 'bad German' or 'jargon', a second-rate excuse of a language."&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. King, "The Czernowitz Conference in Retrospect", in [[Dov-Ber Kerler]] (ed.), ''Politics of Yiddish: Studies in Language, Literature, and Society'', Altamira Press, Walnut Creek etc., 1998, p.42.  {{ISBN|0-7619-9025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inquiry into medieval structures connecting Yiddish and German is seen by Germanists [[Dagmar C. G. Lorenz]] and Neil G. Jacobs as a substantial discovery, Șăineanu being the first to indicate "that the German component of Yiddish traces back to [[Middle High German]] sources" (meaning that "Yiddish was no longer to be evaluated in terms of [[New High German]]").&lt;ref name="ngjdgl"/&gt; The scholar was also reportedly the discoverer of a direct link between Yiddish and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]; this allowed the conclusion that the Jewish German dialect originated among Aramaic-speaking and pre-[[Ashkenazi Jews]], who originally settled further east than the Askhenazi home in the [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Katz, "Hebrew, Aramaic and the Rise of Yiddish", in [[Joshua Fishman]] (ed.), ''Readings in the Sociology of Jewish Languages'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 1985, p.99-100.  {{ISBN|90-04-07237-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his studies of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] borrowings into the Romanian lexis, Lazăr Șăineanu looked back on historical events leading back to the [[Age of Migrations]], such as in highlighting the possible [[Pecheneg language|Pecheneg]] origin of relatively common Romanian words such as ''buzdugan'' ("mace"), ''duium'' ("multitude"), ''dușman'' ("enemy"), ''caia'' ("horseshoe nail"), ''colibă'' ("hut") and ''fotă'' ("skirt").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioan Marian Țiplic, [http://istorie.ulbsibiu.ro/documents/Tiplic.pdf "Contribuția pecenegilor, secuilor și sașilor la constituirea frontierei de sud a Transilvaniei (sec. XI-XIII)"], in the [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]]'s [http://istorie.ulbsibiu.ro/Site.html ''Studia Universitatis Cibiniensis. Series Historica''], Vol. I, 2004, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of his primary focuses was on [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as a mediator between Romanian and other languages: the Romanian word ''giuvaier'' ("jewel"), borrowed from the Turkish ''cevahir'', but originating with a [[Persian language|Persian]] source; ''trampă'' ("barter"), taken from the Turkish ''trampa'', but sourced to the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tramutare'' ("to transform"); ''talaz'' ("high wave"), identical to the Turkish intermediary, and through it borrowed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Θάλασσα (''[[Thalassa (mythology)|thalassa]]'', "sea").&lt;ref&gt;Suciu, p.1674&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the scholar documented the distant impression of [[Levant]]ine territories, as first introduced through [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman culture]]—as illustrated by the original references to [[Egypt]] as ''Misir'', from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] مصر (''Miṣr''), as opposed to the more modern {{lang|ro|Egipt}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Ardelean, [http://istorie.ulbsibiu.ro/documents/Ardelean.pdf "Banatul, Ardealul și restul lumii sau geografie și etnografie la Mihail Halici-tatăl"], in the [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]]'s [http://istorie.ulbsibiu.ro/Site.html ''Studia Universitatis Cibiniensis. Series Historica''], Vol. II, 2005, p.177, 180&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the professional [[suffix]]es ''-giu'' and ''-angiu'', both of Turkish origin and present in words borrowed during the [[Early Modern Romania|early modern]] and [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] eras.&lt;ref name="amturcita"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rzclipangiu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Rodica Zafiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/clipangiu "Clipangiu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Main examples include ''barcagiu'' ("boater" or "ferryman"), ''bragagiu'' ("[[boza]] maker"), ''geamgiu'' ("window fitter"), ''toptangiu'' ("wholesale vendor") etc., but the suffix is also applied ironically in various other contexts—for example, ''mahalagiu'' ("inhabitant of the ''[[mahala]]''", "suburbanite" or "uncouth person") and ''duelgiu'' ("dueler").&lt;ref name="rzclipangiu"/&gt; Șăineanu's texts followed the evolutions of similar words ending in ''-liu'' (such as ''hazliu'', "funny", from ''haz'', "laughter"), of popular [[figures of speech]] directly translated from their Turkish original (''a bea tutun'', "to drink tobacco", or the question ''în ce ape te scalzi?'', "what waters do you bathe in?", figurative for "how are you feeling?"), and of [[Romanian profanity|strong obscenities]] reflecting Oriental sources.&lt;ref name="amturcita"/&gt; In general, Șăineanu concluded, such appropriation from an area mediated by [[Islam]] and [[Islamic culture]] was not present in areas directed related to [[History of Christianity in Romania|Christian practice]] and intellectual life.&lt;ref&gt;Suciu, p.1673&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in his {{lang|ro|Influența orientală asupra limbii și culturii române}}, Șăineanu evidenced the spread of Turkish borrowings throughout the Balkans, and concluded that they had a more significant presence in Aromanian than in Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Suciu, p.1675&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, philologist [[Vasile Bogrea]], referred to the volume as a "[[Bible]] of Oriental elements in Romanian",&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; while the author himself deemed it a "supreme testimony of my love for the Romanian language and people".&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sainéan (1901), p.49&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer and critic [[Alexandru Mușina]], Șăineanu was foremost among the linguists who challenged a linear take on the [[origin of the Romanians]], evidencing, like [[Alexandru Philippide]] and [[Alexandru Cihac]], the "[[Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]], [[Multilingualism|plurilingual]] and [[multicultural]] character of our [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanity]]", with the underlying "processes of [[acculturation]]".&lt;ref name="amturcita"/&gt; In particular, Mușina notes, it was Șăineanu's study of Turkish words and expressions settled in the everyday language that uncovered "a ''forma mentis'', common Oriental, Turco-Romanian mentality."&lt;ref name="amturcita"/&gt;

===Studies of French language and civilization===
[[File:Herring monger.jpg|thumb|220px|A herring monger and her ''[[Cris de Paris|cri de Paris]]'', as depicted in a hand-colored engraving (ca. 1500)]]
With ''La Création métaphorique'', the researcher inventoried the representations of animals in the late medieval imaginary: lions and cocks as representations of courage, [[hunting dog]]s as icons of arrogance, pigs as symbols of gluttony etc.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Cohen, "Animals in Medieval Perceptions: The Image of the Ubiquitous Other", in [[Aubrey Manning]], James Serpell (eds.), ''Animals and Human Society: Changing Perspectives'', [[Routledge]], London, 1994, p.63.  {{ISBN|0-415-09155-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books notably showed the traditional semantic parallelisms between cats, monkeys and apes, as codified in several [[Romance languages]], and investigated the animals' respective roles within popular [[demonology]] and metaphors of drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Masson, "Cats and Bugs: Some Remarks about Semantic Parallelisms", in Martine Vanhove (ed.), ''From Polysemy to Semantic Change: Towards a Typology of Lexical Semantic Associations'', [[John Benjamins]], Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, 2008, p.372-376, 382.  {{ISBN|978-90-272-0573-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Les Sources indigènes de l'étymologie française'', Șăineanu offered clues on the obscure origin of various French words. Șăineanu thus sourced the French and English ''[[harlequin]]'' beyond the [[Italian language|Italian-language]] ''arlechino'' in ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', and back to a medieval legend in [[Middle French]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Louis Duchartre, ''The Italian Comedy: The Improvisation, Scenarios, Lives, Attributes, Portraits, and Masks of the Illustrious Characters of the Commedia dell'arte'', [[Dover Publications]], New York City, 1966, p.138-139.  {{ISBN|0-486-21679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Șăineanu's texts focused on the language patterns covered by "argot" and the original meaning of "jargon", in relation to French and [[History of Paris|Parisian social history]], discussing the language of the ''gueux'' (marginalized and destitute migrants), the obscene nature of some medieval performances, the linguistic codes used by brigands during the [[Hundred Years' War]], and the impact of argot in the work of poet [[François Villon]] or other [[French Renaissance]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;R. Anthony Lodge, ''A Sociolinguistic History of Parisian French'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2004, p.111, 238, 240-243.  {{ISBN|0-521-82179-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|fr|Le Langage parisien au XIXe siècle}} discussed in part the emergence of what Șăineanu himself defined as {{lang|fr|le bas langage parisien}} ("the lowly Parisian language"), a mix of argots emerging from 19th century [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Lay, "''Réflecs d'un gniaff'': On Emile Pouget and ''Le Père Peinard''", in Dean De la Motte, Jeannene M. Przyblyski (eds.), ''Making the News: Modernity &amp; the Mass Press in Nineteenth-century France'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], Amherst, 1999, p.129.  {{ISBN|1-55849-177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies in the area were part of a phenomenon in French linguistics: at roughly the same time as Șăineanu, argot studies were becoming the main subject of works by researchers such as [[Arnold van Gennep]] and [[Raoul De La Grasserie]].&lt;ref&gt;Calvet, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; A disagreement occurred between Șăineanu and Gennep over the origins and age of argot: Gennep criticized his colleague's claim that "no European argot has sources beyond the 15th century", arguing that such statements were not verifiable, and that they presumed "some kind of spontaneous generation".&lt;ref name="ljc60"&gt;Calvet, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Gennep, Șăineanu was among those [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] scholars who offered a "[[Teratology|teratological]]" view of argot as an "aberrant creation".&lt;ref name="ljc60"/&gt;

As part of his efforts to advance the study of Middle French, Șăineanu dedicated himself to an applied study of [[François Rabelais]] and his role in [[French literature]]. Called "remarkable and abundantly documented" by [[Russia]]n [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]],&lt;ref name="mb185"/&gt; ''La Langue de Rabelais'' outlines the use, context and origin of some 3,770 individual words in Rabelaisian vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban T. Holmes Jr.]], Alexander H. Schutz, ''A History of the French Language'', Biblio and Tannen, New York City, n.d., p.75.  {{ISBN|0-8196-0191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was especially noted for its details on various contributions to Rabelais' means of expression, including staples of [[French folklore]] such as the so-called ''[[Cris de Paris]]'' (chants traditionally produced by Parisian street vendors).&lt;ref name="mb185"/&gt; Some of his other contributions to the study of Rabelais' work, as described by Bakhtin, include the inventory of culinary metaphors found throughout ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', and evidence that Rabelais had an unitigated familiarity with the maritime trade.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, p.185, 193, 455&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Langue de Rabelais'' also offered clues into 16th-century views of [[homosexuality]], discussing the origin of archaisms such as ''bardachiser'' ("to sodomize") or the link between Rabelais' maritime terminology and medieval reactions to [[homoeroticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Randy Conner, "''Les Molles et Les Chausses''. Mapping the Isle of Hermaphrodites in Premodern France", in [[Anna Livia Julian Brawn|Anna Livia]], [[Kira Hall]] (eds.), ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford etc., 1997, p.134, 137-140.  {{ISBN|0-19-510471-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on the subject, Șăineanu also stood out as one of those rejecting the notion that Rabelais' writings have a special [[Anticlericalism|anticlerical]] meaning, arguing instead that his mockery of clerical society was merely a rendition of common and folkloric attitudes—a conclusion quoted in agreement by [[Annales School]] historian [[Lucien Febvre]] in his own ''The Problem of Unbelief in the Sixteenth Century''.&lt;ref&gt;Febvre, p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Also cited by Febvre are Șăineanu's views on [[Islam]]ic and "[[Saracen]]" echos in ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' (such as the depiction of [[Fierabras]]), as well as on Rabelais' references to miraculous cures as being borrowed from earlier [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Febvre, p.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel series of articles, the Romanian scholar also discussed the link between [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] thinker [[Pliny the Elder]] and the Renaissance writer, commenting on the similarity between Rabelais' description of medical practices and statements found in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Fred Chappell, ''The Enigma of Rabelais: An Essay in Interpretation'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1924, p.114.  {{OCLC|6521897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite the antisemitic campaigns and the voluntary expatriation, Șăineanu's reputation with the Romanian public was largely unharmed, and his works went through new Romanian-language editions: ''Dicționarul universal'' alone was reissued a total of nine times before 2009,&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; and was allegedly a primary target for [[plagiarism]] from the moment of its publication.&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; In tandem, Șăineanu's request that his peers publish details on the individual storytellers providing the folkloric accounts was respected by some, including Alexandru Vasiliu, collector of ''Povești și legende'' ("Stories and Legends", 1928).&lt;ref&gt;Dégh, p.46, 369&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after Șăineanu's death, his brother [[Constantin Șăineanu|Constantin]] collected and edited his correspondence, publishing it in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="jl384"/&gt;

Much interest in Șăineanu's work was sparked during the [[interwar period]], shortly before and after the scholar's death, when new generations of critics came to reclaim his work as an important contribution to the field of science. Outside of Romania and France, Șăineanu's contribution of Rabelais left an observable trace in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', a 1939 [[Modernist literature|modernist]] novel by [[Ireland|Irish]] novelist [[James Joyce]]: while Joyce's text holds transparent allusions to Rabelais' writings, the writer himself claimed to have never read the originals, and to have instead relied solely on a scientific study (in turn identified by research Claude Jacquet as ''La Langue de Rabelais'').&lt;ref&gt;Sam Slote, "''Après mot, le déluge'' 1: Critical Response to Joyce in France", in Geert Lernout, Wim Van Mierlo (eds.), ''The Reception of James Joyce in Europe'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London, p.375-376. {{ISBN|0-8264-5825-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interwar Romanian intellectuals, primarily George Călinescu and Eugen Lovinescu, played a part in reevaluating and bringing to attention Șăineanu's contribution within its Romanian and international context. Șăineanu's correspondence was itself a topic of controversy between the two rival critics: after Lovinescu showed himself impressed by a letter in which Șăineanu stated ''E. Lovinescu m'impose'' ("E. Lovinescu impresses me"), Călinescu noted that his competitor had a tendency to quote "all things flattering him, no matter how cheap."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.353"/&gt; During the same decade, the maverick writer [[Panait Istrati]], himself a voluntary exile to France, explained that ''Dicționarul universal'' was "the holy book" of his Romanian adolescence.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; However, Lucian Nastasă notes, the antisemitic background beyond Șăineanu's rejection (as well as the similar affair involving [[Solomon Schechter]]) continued to make itself felt throughout those years, with other Jewish scholars ([[Leon Feraru]] or [[Alexandru Graur]]) being actively prevented from seeking employment in their field.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.449-450&lt;/ref&gt; Braving the violently antisemitic and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], in place during most of [[World War II]], Călinescu commented favorably on the contributions of Jewish figures to Romanian cultural life in his main synthesis, the 1941 ''History of Romanian Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Istorie și mit în conștiința românească'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1997, p.259.  {{ISBN|973-50-0055-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a reference to Jewish linguists Șăineanu, Gaster, [[Ion Aurel Candrea]], as scholars whose merits would be "regrettable to deny".&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.976&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Romanian [[far right]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] groups continued to regard Șăineanu's marginalization as justified. The 1930s witnessed a controversy which, according to Laszlo Alexandru, recalled the confrontation between Hasdeu and Lazăr Șăineanu: Hasdeu's place was held by academic [[Nae Ionescu]], who moved toward fascism and antisemitism, while Șăineanu's position was assumed by Ionescu's Jewish disciple, writer [[Mihail Sebastian]].&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; Writing for ''[[Azi (Romanian newspaper)|Azi]]'' during the Sebastian scandal of 1934, journalist N. Roșu, an affiliate of the fascist [[Iron Guard]], claimed that "Romanian culture will go on living" irrespective of Jewish absences such as Șăineanu and Gaster, that one's creativity depended on one's "Romanianness", and that philology studies reflected one's "sensitivity".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.410&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, a Guardist named Vasile Gârcineanu called ''Dicționarul universal'' "a characteristically Jewish work, superficially and poorly crafted".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.411&lt;/ref&gt; While cultivating an ambiguous relationship with fascism, which eventually brought him into the ranks of the Iron Guard, philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]], one of Ionescu's other known disciples, publicly deplored Șăineanu's social relegation and Gaster's expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.135, 410-411&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Romania|communist period]] witnessed a long hiatus in respect to the critical assessment of Șăineanu's work: in 1962, linguist [[Dumitru Macrea]] referred to his predecessor as an "all but forgotten" figure, and none of Șăineanu's volumes were printed between the 1947 edition of his dictionary and the 1978 version of ''Basmele române''.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; This reticence was however contrasted by the appreciation of various academics: [[Iorgu Iordan]] commented on his "extraordinary erudition", recommended his disciples to study his work, and referred to his repudiation by the Romanian state as "a real stain on our public life of the late [19th] century".&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; During that time, Iordan and his colleagues [[Perpessicius]]&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vexxiv"/&gt; and [[Alexandru Rosetti]] published renewed commentary on Șăineanu's work, being later joined by philosopher [[Constantin Noica]], folklorist [[Ovidiu Bârlea]] and various other intellectuals.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;

A new edition of ''Dicționarul universal'' saw print after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] and the end of communism. According to writer and researcher Rodica Marian, this reissue "without interventions" constitutes proof of a return to the "past parameters" of lexicography, at the end of a deterioration of standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna104.pdf "Ancheta: Știința dicționarului la români"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029030611/http://revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna104.pdf |date=2007-10-29 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 104, January 2007, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by several other initiatives, which notably resulted in reprints of ''Studii folclorice'' and ''Încercare asupra semasiologiei române''.&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt; Writing in 2003, [[Alexandru Mușina]] referred to Șăineanu as a "great", "mistreated" and "unrecognized" linguist, defining {{lang|ro|Influența orientală asupra limbii și culturii române}} as "his valuable work, as yet unchallenged and still relevant".&lt;ref name="amturcita"/&gt; In 2008, the case surrounding Șăineanu's naturalization bid was the subject of a biographical study, written by historian [[George Voicu]] and published by the [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]].&lt;ref name="idlsain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasavant1"/&gt; Șăineanu's works have also been the subject of reprints in France, and have continued to be recommended secondary sources by academic institutions in the [[United States]] more than a century after they were first published.&lt;ref name="lasavant2"/&gt; His posthumously published writings include a 1991 edition of ''Une carrière philologique en Roumanie''.&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">[[Image:Hezekiah - Manasseh - Amon.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''Hezekiah-Manasseh-Amon''.  Traditionally Manasseh is the man on the right and Amon is the child on the left.]]
'''Matthew 1:10''' is the tenth verse of [[Matthew 1]] of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[Bible]]. The verse is part of the section where the [[genealogy]] of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the father of [[Jesus]], is listed.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And [[Hezekiah|Ezekias]] begat [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasses]]; 
:and Manasses begat [[Amon of Judah|Amon]]; 
:and Amon begat [[Josiah|Josias]];

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. 
:Manasseh became the father of Amon. 
:Amon became the father of Josiah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=1:10&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 1:10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
This part of the list coincides with the list of the [[Kings of Judah]] in a number of other parts of the [[Bible]]. Unlike other parts of Matthew's genealogy this list is fully in keeping with the other sources. According to [[William F. Albright]], [[Hezekiah]] ruled from 715 BC to 687 BC. His son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] ruled from his father's death until 642 BC, while Manasseh's son [[Amon of Judah|Amon]] ruled from 642 BC to 640 BC.  [[Josiah]] ruled from 640 BC to 609 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Manasseh was widely regarded as the most wicked king of Judah, so why he appears in this genealogy when other discreditable ancestors have been left out is an important question. [[W. D. Davies]] and [[Dale Allison]] note that the portrayal of Manasseh in the literature of the period was divided. While some sources represented him as a purely wicked figure, others represented him as man who eventually found repentance for his deeds. The author of Matthew may have been more acquainted with the later school and thus left him in.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W.D. and Dale C. Allison, Jr. ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew''. Edinburgh : T. &amp; T. Clark, 1988-1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical scholar [[Robert H. Gundry]] points out that the author of Matthew actually wrote ''Amos'', rather than Amon.  He argues the name might have been changed to link the minor [[Amos (prophet)|prophet Amos]] who made predictions concerning the [[messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jalving worked as a commentator for ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'' and wrote as the newspaper's most widely read blogger, until 2009 when he was hired by ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reseke|first=Louise|title=Mikael Jalving går fra Berlingske til Jyllands-Posten|url=http://mediawatch.dk/Migrerede_artikler/article5163711.ece|work=MediaWatch|date=19 February 2009|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in history from the [[European University Institute]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jalving|first=Mikael|title=De uborgerlige|url=http://jalving.blogs.berlingske.dk/2008/02/04/de-uborgerlige/|work=Berlingske|date=4 February 2008|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jalving has described himself as politically being [[National liberalism|national-liberal]], [[Social conservatism|social conservative]], and more [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] than all parties represented in the [[Folketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Læserne spørger: Mikael Jalving|url=http://www.information.dk/510895|work=Information|date=27 September 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caught attention in [[Sweden]] in 2011 for his book ''Absolut Sverige'', which according to ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' describes a land of "self-righteous Swedes, treacherously lulled into a social democratic dystopia of control and political correctness".&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Linder|first=Lars|title=Mikael Jalving: "Absolut Sverige.

During the month of July 2014, Jalving hosted a limited daily radio show called ''Danmarks Röst'' ("Voice of Denmark", inspired by [[Cold War]]-era ''[[Voice of America]]''), which aimed to transmit debate to Swedish listeners about subjects perceived to be taboo in Swedish public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Radio24syv laver program til svenskerne|url=http://journalisten.dk/radio24syv-laver-program-til-svenskerne|work=Journalisten.dk|date=16 June 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Danmarks Röst|url=http://www.radio24syv.dk/programmer/danmarks-roest/|work=Radio24syv|language=Danish, Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jalving was criticised by an [[Islam]] researcher at the [[University of Copenhagen]] for misinforming about a muslim's replies about '[[sharia]]' in a questioner that did not mention sharia, but rules in the [[Quran]], while sharia are based on other texts.&lt;ref&gt;Karoline Rahbek Juncker &amp; Jakob Bang Schmidt 26.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1381">'''Moral evil''' is the result of any morally negative event caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent, such as a person. An example of a moral evil might be [[murder]], or any other [[evil]] event for which someone can be held responsible or culpable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil." BBC News. BBC, n.d. Web. 13 Sept. 2014. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml Christianity: good and evil]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be contrasted with [[natural evil]], in which a bad event occurs naturally, without the intervention of an agent. The dividing line between natural and moral evil is not absolutely clear however, as some behaviour can be unintentional yet morally significant and some natural events (for example, global warming) can be caused by intentional actions.

The distinction of evil from 'bad' is complex. Evil is more than simply 'negative' or 'bad' (i.e. undesired or inhibiting good) as evil is on its own, and without reference to any other event, morally incorrect. The validity of 'moral evil' as a term, therefore, rests on the validity of morals in [[ethics]].

[[File:David Self Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Jacobin]] [[Jacques-Louis David]]; self-portrait in jail in 1794]]

The term '''Muscadin''' ({{IPA-fr|myskadɛ̃|lang}}), meaning "wearing [[musk]] perfume", came to refer to mobs of young men, relatively well-off and dressed in a [[dandy]]ish manner, who were the street fighters of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] in Paris in the [[French Revolution]]. After the coup against [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the Jacobins of 9 [[Thermidor]] Year II, or 27 July 1794, they took on the remaining [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and [[sans-culottes]], and largely succeeded in suppressing them over the next year or two. In prints they are often seen carrying large wooden clubs, which they liked to call "constitutions". They were supposedly organized by the politician and journalist [[Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron]], and eventually numbered 2,000-3,000. They in fact seem to have mostly consisted of the lower middle classes, the sons of "minor officials and small shopkeepers",&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, 3&lt;/ref&gt; and were quietly encouraged by the shaky new government, who had good reason to fear Jacobin mobs, and wider unrest as the hard winter of 1794-5 saw increasing hunger among the Parisian working class. The Muscadins are considered to be part of the [[First White Terror]] in response to the preceding [[Reign of Terror]] of the Jacobins.

The "''jeunesse dorée''" came to have a considerable influence on the [[National Convention]], and after the Jacobin revolt of 12 Germinal, Year III (April 1, 1795), are held to have forced the arrest of the four main "ringleaders" remaining from the Jacobin regime: [[Bertrand Barère]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne]], who were all threatened with transportation to [[French Guiana]] (though only the latter two were eventually sent there).&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, 84&lt;/ref&gt; After they had succeeded in suppressing the sans-culottes, their usefulness to the government was over, and they began to pose a threat. After the "whiff of grapeshot" in the crisis of [[13 Vendémiaire]] they ceased to be a significant factor in Parisian politics.

==The term==
The term "Muscadin" existed well before the post-Thermidor gangs, who are also referred to as the "jeunesse dorée" ("gilded youth") or simply ''les jeunes gens'' ("the young people"). The term had long been current in [[Lyon]], used by the working class of "white-collar" domestic servants, shop boys and clerks of the merchants. An element of effeminacy was implied. In 1789, at the start of the Revolution, a royalist militia was raised in Lyon, with the encouragement of the city elite, and containing many of their employees, and their revolutionary opponents started to call them the "muscadins". Perfumed or not, they were an effective military force in the area for nearly a year, before being disbanded after it was clear that national events had overtaken them. Their equipment, and nickname, were transferred to the local [[Garde Nationale]], and when Lyon was besieged by Jacobin armies in 1793, the term became known in Paris.

In that year the term was used in the battle between the Jacobin publications ''[[Le Père Duchesne]]'', written by [[Jacques Hébert]], and ''[[Le Vieux Cordelier]]'', written by [[Camille Desmoulins]], with Hébert using it in criticising Desmoulins. The split among the Jacobins was to be resolved the next year by the execution of both men with many of their respective factions; in the meeting of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] that moved against the "Hébertistes" in March 1794, Barère complained that Muscadins, along with foreigners and deserters, were seen to "congregate at the theatre, dressed with ridiculous ostentation, and ... show themselves with dirty stockings, large moustaches, and long sabres, threatening the good citizens, and especially the people's representatives" – he saw them as supporting the ultra-radical "Hébertistes".&lt;ref&gt;Coward and Swann, 246, with quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costume==
The costumes of the Muscadins are less well-recorded than those of their successors, the [[Incroyables]], but appear to have been similar to these. Characteristics include tightly-cut coats with extravagantly large lapels, typically in a different colour, with large and elaborately knotted [[cravat]]s and perhaps sashes round the waist. Colours are bright and violently contrasting, with stripes very popular – perhaps a parody of the ''[[sans-culottes]]'', for whom stripes were also characteristic. However, more muted versions of some of these characteristics can be seen in the self-portrait painted in jail in 1794 by [[Jacques-Louis David]] after the fall of the [[Jacobin]]s; the Muscadins took to extremes elements of the shared fashions of the day. Their walking sticks, clubs or [[Club (weapon)|bludgeons]] are often thick twisted pieces of wood, perhaps artificially grown in that style; they are supposed to have referred to these as "constitutions".

His main research is in the history of [[media art]], [[immersion (virtual reality)]], and emotions, as well as the history, idea and culture of [[telepresence]] and [[artificial life]].

===Immersion research===

Grau's book ''Virtual Art'', which received more than 70 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/imperia/md/content/studium/kultur/zbw/rezensionen_virtual_art.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; offered for the first time a historic comparison in image-viewer theory of immersion as well as a systematic analysis of the triad of artist, work and viewer on conditions of [[digital art]]. The research is linked to the novel model of an evolutionary history of illusionistic  which results on the one hand from a relative dependence on new sensual potentials of suggestion and on the other hand from the variable strength of alienation of the viewer (media competence)(Grau 2000).

Using an interdisciplinary approach Grau also analysed methods which elicit or heighten the impression of immersion in digital image spaces for the viewer. He found that this is primarily induced by interaction; reaction of the images in real-time to the viewer’s movements (Grau 1999–2007), the utilisation of evolutionary image processes — for example, genetic algorithms — (Grau 1997 and 2001), haptic feedback, the natural design of the interface (Grau 2002), the impression of telematic presence (Grau 2000), and particularly the dimensions and design of the image display, which must fill the viewer’s field of vision completely and extend up to 360° both horizontally and vertically (Grau 2001 and 2003). These studies sought to transcend customary single media approaches in research on perceptual illusions and to introduce concepts such as polysensuality, suggestive potential, image space, disposition of the individual observer, and evolution of the visual media as well as to expand the theoretical work on distance by Ernst Cassirer and Erwin Panofsky, amongst others. In addition Grau undertook studies of innovative linkages of architecture and immersive moving images (Grau 2003,etc.), as well as of immersion in the history of film (Grau 2006 and 2007). The majority of these publications resulted from two research projects of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG — German Research Foundation): Art History and Media Theories of Virtual Reality, 1998–2002, and Immersive Art, 2002–2005.

===Emotion research===

Several research projects conducted at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the German Academyof Sciences Leopoldina and two summer academies supported by the Volkswagen Foundation gave rise to an interdisciplinary study on the history of managing feelings through images and sound (Grau 2005). Building on the work of Antonio Damasio, Joseph LeDoux, and Wolf Singer, and using the examples of Matthias Grünewald’s Isenheimer Altarpiece, Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will, and the computer game “America’s Army”, it was demonstrated how emotional experiences with images can forge a sense of community; in this way a contribution was made to research on a problematic key concept of image science.

===Media Art Histories and Image Science===

Since 2002 Grau has initiated interdisciplinary meetings and world conferences of scholars working on media art and its history (cf. Grau 2007); the first conference on the history of media art was held in Banff, Canada, in 2005. Further conferences were organised in Berlin (2007), Melbourne (2009), Liverpool (2011), Riga (2013), Montreal (2015), Krems, [[Göttweig Abbey]] and Vienna (2017), the series continues with a conference in Aalborg in 2019. His volume "Imagery in the 21st Century", MIT-Press 2011 expanded the context of Image Science.

===Digital Humanities / Image Science===

Grau conceived new scientific tools for image science and directed the project "Immersive Art" of the German Research Foundation (DFG) developing the first international Archive for Digital Art (ADA, since 1999), which is being continued at the Danube University Krems as an open source project. ADA is the first online archive that, since 2000, has regularly streamed video documentations. Since 2005 Grau also manages the database of the Graphic Art Collection of Göttweig Abbey, the largest private graphic collection in Austria, which contains over 30,000 works, from Albrecht Dürer to Gustav Klimt, and is accessible online since 2007.

Grau has conceived new scientific tools for the humanities/[[digital humanities]], he managed the project "Immersive Art" of The [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG) whose team started developing in 1998 the first international archive for [[digital art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualart.at/ Database of Virtual Art], Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; written on an open source platform at the Danube-University Krems and has since been followed up by a number of spin-off projects. Since 2000 the DVA was the first online archive to regularly stream video documentations. Since 2005 Grau is head of the database of Goettweigs Graphic Collection, Austria's largest private graphic collection that contains 30,000 works, ranging from [[Albrecht Dürer]] to [[Gustav Klimt]].

==Teaching==

Grau developed new international curricula for image sciences: MediaArtHistories MA, academic expert programmes in Digital Collection Management and Exhibit Design, Visual Competencies and the masters course in Image Science.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Image Science: http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/de/department/bildwissenschaft/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with the Danube Telelectures a new interactive format of lectures and debates came into being that is streamed worldwide.

After his studies in [[Hamburg]], [[Siena]] and [[Berlin]] and his [[Doctorate|doctoral work]], Grau lectured at the [[Humboldt University Berlin]], was a guest researcher in several research labs in Japan and USA and following his post doctoral lecture qualification ([[habilitation]]) in 2003, he worked as professor at different international universities. He has acted as adviser for international professional journals and different associations. Grau manages different conferences.&lt;ref&gt;* First International Conference on the Histories of Media Art, Science and Technology: http://www.mediaarthistory.org/refresh/index.html
* Second International conference on image science: http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/department/bildwissenschaft/veranstaltungen/id/11969/index.php
&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 Grau tried to bring together the research on media art and its history which is dispersed over many fields and therefore was founding director of Refresh! First International Conference on the History of Media Art, Science and Technology, [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] 2005 (2007 [[Berlin]], 2009 [[Melbourne]], 2011 [[Liverpool]], 2013 [[Riga]], 2015 [[Montreal]], 2017 [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]], Göttweig Abbey and [[Vienna]]). O. Grau: MediaArtHistories, MIT-Press 2007 and the online text archive mediaarthistory.org result from the world conference series.

==Awards and distinctions==

Awards among other things: 2001 voted into Young Academy of the Berlin-Brandenburgischen Scientific Academy and the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Leopoldina]]; 2002 InterNations/Goethe Institute; 2003 Book of the Month, [[Scientific American]]; 2003 Research Scholarship from the German-Italian Center Villa Vigoni; 2004 Media Award of the Humboldt University Society. 2014 he received an honorary doctorate and in 2015 he was elected into the Academia Europaea.

'''Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison''' (born 19 September 1960), is a French [[historian]] and author whose work chiefly centres on [[colonialism]]. He is best known for his book ''Coloniser, Exterminer - Sur la guerre et l'Etat colonial''.

Le Cour Grandmaison is a professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Évry Val d'Essonne|Évry-Val d'Essonne University]], and a teacher at the [[Collège International de Philosophie]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He is president of the October&amp;nbsp;17,&amp;nbsp;1961&amp;nbsp;Association Against Oblivion, which advocates official recognition for the crimes committed by the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] during the [[Paris massacre of 1961|1961 Paris massacre]].{{citation needed lead|date=May 2013}}

== ''Coloniser, Exterminer'' ==
In his book ''Coloniser, Exterminer'' (2005) Le Cour Grandmaison states that techniques and concepts used during the period of late 19th-century [[New Imperialism]] were later used during the [[Holocaust]]. He points to both [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] and [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] who spoke of "extermination" during the colonization of the [[Western United States]] and the removal of [[Indian removal|Native American tribes]].&lt;ref name="Negationnism"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison | title=Le négationnisme colonial | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | date=2 February 2005 | url=http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=491 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228040334/http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=491 |archivedate=28 February 2006 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes Tocqueville's 1841 comment on [[French rule in Algeria|French conquest of Algeria]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept... I believe the laws of war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks"&lt;ref name=TortureInAlgeria&gt;{{Cite news | author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison | title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France - Liberty, Equality and Colony | publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] | date=June 2001 | url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}} (quoting Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Travail sur l’Algérie'' in ''Œuvres complètes'', Paris, Gallimard, Bibliothèque de [[la Pléiade]], 1991, pp 704 and 705.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Whatever the case, continued Tocqueville, we may say in a general manner that all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison | title=Tocqueville et la conquête de l'Algérie | year=2001 | publisher=La Mazarine | url=http://perso.wanadoo.fr/felina/doc/alg/olcg.htm|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LeCour Grandmaison, "De Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France’s position in the world, and, second, changes in French society."&lt;ref name="Monde diplomatique"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison | title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France - Liberty, Equality and Colony | publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] | date=June 2001 | url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tocqueville, who despised the [[July monarchy]] (1830–1848), believed that war and colonization would "restore national pride, threatened, he believed, by "the gradual softening of social mores" in the middle classes. Their taste for "material pleasures" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it "an example of weakness and egotism". Applauding the methods of [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], Tocqueville went as far as saying that "war in Africa" had become a "science":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science".&lt;ref name="Monde diplomatique"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

LeCour Grandmaison states that techniques employed by the French army during the 1954-62 [[Algerian War]] were rooted in history. He believes the history of [[war]]fare should be not limited to the technical progress of weapons, but should encompass the "judicial, administrative and conceptual arsenal" which accompanies it: "We can only understand the extreme the violence of the 1848 civil war - which much of the time qualifies as "bloody repression" - if we place them in a longer genealogy, by the way exterior, and brought back to what was experimented before,{{clarify|date=May 2013}} most notably during the Algerian war [the 1830 invasion of Algeria]" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=L’art militaire dans tous ses états | date=18 January 2006 | publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-01-18/2006-01-18-822136|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview,{{which|date=May 2013}} LeCour Grandmaison, distinguishes between the criticisms of colonial abuse and those of the principle of colonization itself, basing his arguments on [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Lamartine]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[André Gide]], [[Albert Londres]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] and [[Joseph Conrad]]. He states how [[Marx]], [[Engels]] and their contemporaries were not immune to 19th-century [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial ideology]], as they too considered colonization as inevitable and justified, and non-European people as "primitives" and "barbarians". It wasn't until the [[Third International]] that the [[socialist]] movement opposed colonialism and supported [[national liberation]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Les guerres et l’État colonial français | date=28 December 2004 | publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2004-12-28/2004-12-28-453736|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State racism ==
Following the views of Michel Foucault, LeCour Grandmaison spoke of a "state racism" under the [[French Third Republic]], notable by the example of the 1881 Indigenous Code applied in Algeria. Replying to the question{{by whom|date=May 2013}} "Isn't it excessive to talk about a state racism under the Third Republic?", he replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "No, if we can recognize "state racism" as the vote and implementation of discriminatory measures, grounded on a combination of racial, religious and cultural criteria, in those territories. The 1881 Indigenous Code is a monument of this genre! Considered by contemporary prestigious jurists as a "juridical monstruosity", this code planned special offenses and penalties for "Arabs". It was then extended to other territories of the empire. On one hand, a state of rule of law for a minority of French and Europeans located in the colonies. On the other hand, a permanent state of exception for the "indigenous" people. This situation lasted until 1945." &lt;ref name="Negationnism"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== 23 February 2005 law ==
Olivier LeCour Grandmaison was one of a number of historians who criticized the [[French law on colonialism|February 23, 2005 law]], instituted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), which required that teachers promote "positive values" of French presence abroad, "in particular in North Africa". The law was not only accused of interfering with the autonomy of Universities within the state, but also of being an obvious case of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison | title=Le colonialisme a la peau dure | publisher=[[Libération]] | date=30 March 2005 | accessdate=2006-05-01 | url=http://multitudes.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=1951|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was repealed by president [[Jacques Chirac]] in 2006 following criticisms in France from historians and the left-wing, and from abroad, including Algerian president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] and ''[[Négritude]]'' writer [[Aimé Césaire]].

[[File:Osterland 1250.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Osterland in the 13th century.]]

'''Osterland''' (''terra orientalis'') is a historical region in [[Germany]]. It was situated between the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers to the north of [[Pleissnerland]] which it later absorbed and it included the city of [[Leipzig]]. The name derives from the previous name of the territory, ''[[Saxon Ostmark|Ostmark]]'', meaning "eastern [[marches|march]]."

Today, the area belongs to the German states of [[Thuringia]] and [[Saxony]].

==Early life==
Sands was born in London on 17 October 1960. He was educated at [[University College School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/feb/14/highereducationprofile.highereducation|title=Philippe Sands: Weapon of mass instruction|last=Crace|first=John|date=13 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hampstead, London and read law at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] attaining a B.A. in 1982 and going on to achieve a first class honours in the LLM course a year later. After completing his postgraduate studies at Cambridge, Sands spent a year as a visiting scholar at [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Academic career==
From 1984 to 1988 Sands was a Research Fellow at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] and the Cambridge University Research Centre for International Law (now the [[Lauterpacht Centre for International Law]]). He has also held academic positions at [[King's College London|Kings College London]] (1988-1993) and [[SOAS, University of London|SOAS]] (1993-2001). He was a Global Professor of Law at [[New York University School of Law|New York University Law School]] (1993-2003) and has held visiting positions at [[Paris-Sorbonne University|Paris I (Sorbonne)]], [[University of Melbourne]], the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]], [[Indiana University Bloomington]], [[University of Toronto]], [[Boston College Law School]] and [[Lviv University]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Legal career==
Sands was called to the [[Bar of England and Wales]] in 1985. In 2000 he was a founding member of [[Matrix Chambers]] and was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sands was elected a Bencher of [[Middle Temple]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.middletemple.org.uk/bencher-persons-view?cid=33685|title=Middle Temple|website=middletemple.org.uk|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sands has acted as counsel and advocate in cases that span a wide range of subject areas, including:
* maritime boundary disputes (in the Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans);
* claims relating to natural resources, pollution and environmental assessment;
* international trade disputes;
* issues relating to the immunity of serving and former heads of State from the jurisdiction of national and international courts;
* claims under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]; 
* claims relating to the use of force, allegations of torture, genocide, self-determination and other violations of human rights;
* claims relating to violations of international criminal law.
Sands has acted as counsel in more than a dozen cases at the [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]], including the ''Nuclear Weapons'' Advisory Opinion (counsel for the Solomon Islands);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;k=e1&amp;case=95&amp;code=unan&amp;p3=0|title=Advisory Proceedings International Court of Justice|website=icj-cij.org|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Georgia v. Russia'' dispute (counsel for Georgia)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;code=GR&amp;case=140&amp;k=4d&amp;p3=0|title=Contentious Cases International Court of Justice|website=icj-cij.org|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case concerning ''Whaling in the Antarctic'' (counsel for Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;code=aj&amp;case=148&amp;k=64&amp;p3=0|title=Contentious Cases International Court of Justice|website=icj-cij.org|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been instructed in inter-State arbitrations, including the ''[[Chagos Marine Protected Area]]'' Arbitration (counsel for [[Mauritius]]) and the [[dispute between the Philippines and China]] over [[maritime jurisdiction in the South China Sea]] (counsel for the Philippines).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcacases.com/web/view/7|title=Case view|website=pcacases.com|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to accepting appointments as [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] arbitrator (since 2007), Sands acted as counsel in [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] and other investment cases (including ''Tradex, Waste Management'' and ''Vivendi'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSID/_layouts/FormServer.aspx?XmlLocation=/apps/icsid/icsid%20arbitrator/philippe%20sands.xml|title=ICSID Profile: Arbitrator Professor Philippe Sands QC], icsid.worldbank.org; accessed 18 April 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sands now sits as arbitrator in investment disputes and in sports disputes ([[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Philippe-Sands-QC.pdf|title=Philippe Sands CV (Matrix Chambers)|website=matrixlaw.co.uk|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Sands’ book ''[[Lawless World]]'' catalysed legal and public debate in the UK on the legality of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq War]]. The book addresses a range of topics including the [[Pinochet trial]] in London, the creation of the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[War on Terror]] and the establishment of the detention camp at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]]. In the second edition of ''[[Lawless World]]'' (2006) Sands revealed that the then UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] had told President [[George W. Bush]] that he would support US plans to invade Iraq before he had sought legal advice about the invasion’s legality. Sands exposed a memorandum dated 31 January 2003 that described a two-hour meeting between Blair and Bush, during which Bush discussed the possibility of luring [[Saddam Hussein]]’s forces to shoot down a [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance aircraft, an act that would cause Iraq to be in breach of UN [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] Resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/03/iraq.usa|title=Blair-Bush deal before Iraq war revealed in secret memo|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|date=3 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo disclosed that Blair told Bush that he would support US plans to go to war in the absence of a second UN [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] Resolution, apparently contradicting an assurance given by Blair in the UK Parliament shortly afterwards on 25 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030225/debtext/30225-05.htm#30225-05_spmin1|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 25 February 2003 (pt 5)|website=publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sands has maintained the view that there was no basis in international law for military action in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraqinquirydigest.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PS-letter-to-Chilcot.pdf Philippe Sands' Letter to the Chilcot Inquiry (10 September 2010)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512055312/http://www.iraqinquirydigest.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PS-letter-to-Chilcot.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}; accessed 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sands' 2008 book ''Torture Team'' sets out in detail the role of senior lawyers in the Bush administration in authorising torture (including so-called ‘[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]’ at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]]). As a result of his work on ''Torture Team'', Sands was invited to give oral and written evidence to the UK and Dutch Parliaments, as well as to the US House of Representatives and the US Senate:
* UK House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs (1 June 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmfaff/441/4060805.htm|title=House of Commons - Foreign Affairs - Minutes of Evidence|website=publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dutch Parliamentary Inquiry: Davids Commission (September 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2010/01/12/rapport-commissie-davids|title=Rapport Commissie-Davids|website=rijksoverheid.nl|language=nl|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Jane Mayer]] reported in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on Sands’ reaction to news that Spanish jurist [[Baltazar Garzon]] had received motions requesting that six former Bush officials might be charged with war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/04/13/the-bush-six|title=The Bush Six|last=Mayer|first=Jane|date=13 April 2009|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2012, he served as a Commissioner on the UK Government Commission on a Bill of Human Rights. The Commission’s Report was published in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128112038/http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/cbr/uk-bill-rights-vol-1.pdf A UK Bill of Rights? The Choice Before Us], nationalarchives.gov.uk; accessed 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Sands and [[Helena Kennedy, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws|Baroness Kennedy]] disagreed with the majority, and their dissent ("''In Defence of Rights''") was published in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n01/philippe-sands/in-defence-of-rights|title=In Defence of Rights|first=Philippe |last=Sands |first2=Helena|last2=Kennedy|date=3 January 2013|newspaper=London Review of Books|pages=19–22|issn=0260-9592|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sands and Kennedy expressed concern that support for a [[Proposed British Bill of Rights|UK Bill of Rights]] was motivated by a desire for the UK to withdraw from the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention of Human Rights]]. Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in May 2015, Sands argued that plans for a British Bill of Rights could leave some people in the UK with more rights than others and that this would be "inconsistent with the very notion of fundamental human rights, in which every human being has basic minimum rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/14/british-bill-rights-could-end-uk|title=This British bill of rights could end the UK|date=14 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2015 Sands gave a public lecture at the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] entitled "Climate Change and the Rule of Law: Adjudicating the Future in International Law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/law/newsevents/climate-courts/assets/CLIMATE-CHANGE-INT-COURTS-17-Sept.pdf Climate Change and the Rule of Law: Adjudicating the Future in international Law], kcl.ac.uk, 17 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the view that a ruling by an international judicial body, such as the [[International Court of Justice]], could help resolve the scientific dispute on climate change and be authoritative and legally dispositive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/world-court-should-rule-on-climate-science-quash-sceptics-philippe-sands?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco|title=World court should rule on climate science to quash sceptics, says Philippe Sands|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|date=18 September 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Sands (and two colleagues at [[Matrix Chambers]]) drafted a Legal Opinion on the legality of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia for [[Amnesty International]], [[Oxfam]] and [[Saferworld]]. The Opinion concluded that by authorising the transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the UK government was acting in breach of its obligations under the [[Arms Trade Treaty]], the EU Common Position on Arms Exports and the UK's Consolidated Criteria on Arms Exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/12/uk-government-breaking-the-law-supplying-arms-to-saudi-arabia|title=UK Government breaking the law supplying arms to Saudi Arabia, say leading lawyers|website=amnesty.org|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2018, Sands co-authored a piece in [[The Times]] in which it is argued that the UK had no established legal basis for the [[2018 missile strikes against Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uk-had-no-established-legal-basis-for-syria-air-strikes-w5z9rb6dh&lt;/ref&gt;

Sands wrote the script and appears in the film alongside two sons of prominent Nazi officials, [[Niklas Frank]] (the son of [[Hans Frank]], the Governor-General of occupied Poland) and Horst von Wächter (the son of [[Otto Wächter]], the Governor of Kraków in Poland and Galicia in Ukraine).

The '''Pliezhausen brooch''' (also known as the '''Pliezhausen disc''', '''Pliezhausen bracteate''' or '''Pliezhausen disc brooch''') ({{lang-de|Reiterscheibe von Pliezhausen}}) is a gold disc decorated with figures that was discovered in 1928 during excavations in [[Pliezhausen]], in the county of [[Reutlingen]] in [[Germany]], in the grave of a wealthy [[Alemanni]]c woman dating to the early 7th century and which was the front of a [[disc fibula]]. It is one of the few artifacts of the [[Early Middle Ages]] which portrays the figures of people.

== Discovery ==
During construction work in the vicinity of the street known as ''Pliezhauser Alamannenstraße'', graves from an Alemannian [[grave field]] kept coming to light. In 1928, during the excavation of what became designated as Grave 1, that of a wealthy woman, the Pliezhausen equestrian brooch was discovered as part of the [[grave goods]]. The disc, made from a thin gold plate, was the ornamental cover for a [[disc fibula]] with a bronze pin as the fastener. Other grave goods included a bronze ring, fragments of bronze wire and 13 pearls.

The Pliezhausen brooch is displayed in the [[Württemberg State Museum]] in the Alter Schloss in [[Stuttgart]].

== Beschreibung ==
Die Reiterscheibe von Pliezhausen hat einen Durchmesser von etwa 69 mm und besteht aus dünnen Goldblech. Das Motiv wurde über ein [[Model (Form)|Model]] in das Blech gepresst, außen weist die Scheibe einem umlaufenden Perlrand auf.

Im oberen Abschnitt der Scheibe sind zwei sich mit aufgerissenen Mäulern anspringende vierfüßige Tiere dargestellt. Beide Tiere sind stark stilisiert, nach ihrer ausgeprägten Halsmähne werden sie als Löwen interpretiert.

Darunter ist ein nach rechts reitender Krieger dargestellt, der in seiner linken Hand eine [[Lanze]] führt. Der langhaarige Reiter ist mit einem Kaftan bekleidet und hält in seiner Rechten einen kleinen [[Schild (Waffe)|Rundschild]]. Hinter dem Reiter ist, ebenfalls auf dem Rücken des Pferdes, eine kleine menschliche Figur abgebildet, die ebenfalls mit linken Hand den Speer des Reiters führt und in der rechten Hand einen kleinen Rundschild trägt; die Figur wird als ''Sieghelfer'' gedeutet. Das Pferd ist gezäumt und geschirrt. Vor und unter dem Pferd wird ein strauchelnder Krieger gerade von diesem überrannt. Der unterlegene Krieger greift mit seiner rechten Hand in die Zügel des Pferdes und stößt mit seiner Linken seine [[Spatha (Schwert)|Spatha]] (Schwert) in die Brust des Tieres. Bemerkenswert ist die Verknotung des Kriegers mit den Vorderextremitäten des Pferdes.

Genauere Untersuchungen im [[Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum|Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum]] in Mainz ergaben, dass die Scheibe ursprünglich einen größeren Durchmesser hatte, da eine ehedem vorhandene, umlaufende Riefe teilweise beschnitten wurde, um die Scheibe auf der Trägerplatte der Scheibenfibel montieren zu können. Vergleichsfunde legen nahe, dass die Scheibe ursprünglich auf einem Riemenverteiler ([[Phalerae]]) einer repräsentativen Schirrung für ein Reitpferd montiert war und erst in Zweitverwendung zur Schauseite einer Schmuckfibel umgearbeitet wurde.

== Vergleichbare Bildmotive ==
[[Bild:Brit Mus 17sept 087.jpg|thumb|Identisches Motiv auf der Rekonstruktion des [[Helm von Sutton Hoo|Helmes von Sutton Hoo]] im British Museum]]
Zu dem Bildmotiv der Reiterscheibe von Pliezhausen sind mehrere Vergleichsfunde aus dem frühen Mittelalters überliefert, wie aus den reichen [[Schiffsgrab|Schiffsgräbern]] von [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[England]] sowie [[Vendel (Schweden)|Vendel]] und [[Valsgärde]] in [[Schweden]]. Die Scheibe aus Sutton Hoo stimmt mit Ausnahme der spiegelbildlichen Anordnung am genauesten mit der Pliezhausener Scheibe überein. Sie ist eine der wenigen naturalistischen und figürlichen Darstellungen, die aus dem [[Frühmittelalter|frühen Mittelalter]] überliefert sind und liefert wertvolle Hinweise zur mythischen und religiösen Vorstellungswelt der [[Kontinentalgermanische Mythologie|heidnischen Alamannen]] am Übergang zum [[Christentum]].

He worked for the ''[[Ketchikan Daily News]]'', the ''[[Juneau Empire]]'' and other publications in covering the Alaska Territorial Legislature.  DeArmond was a prolific history writer for regional publications.  Over 700 of his columns were put in the online [[Digital Bob]] project,&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; sponsored by the [[Juneau-Douglas City Museum]], beginning in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juneau.org/parkrec/museum/forms/digitalbob/bobabout.php A Few Words about the Project and Bob].

'''Wilson's Arch''' is the modern name for the ancient stone arch whose top is still visible today, where it is supported against the Northeast corner of [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]], so that it appears on the left to visitors facing the Wall. It once spanned {{convert|42|ft|m}}, supporting a road that continued for {{convert|75|ft|m}} and allowed access to a gate that was level with the surface of the [[Temple Mount]] during the [[Second Temple period]].&lt;ref name="Jer101"&gt;[http://www.generationword.com/jerusalem101/41-wilson-arch.html Jerusalem 101], accessed March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The arch was identified in 1864 by 19th-century explorer and surveyor [[Charles William Wilson]], for whom it is now named.&lt;ref name="Jer101"/&gt; Wilson had joined the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1864, continuing to participate in the city surveying project that was established to improve the city's water system. The [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (PEF) later commissioned him to survey Western Palestine, as well.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.archpark.org.il/excavations2.shtml|work=Arch Park|place=IL|title=Excavations|accessdate = March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the arch is named for Wilson, there is a claim that Swiss physician [[Titus Tobler]] had earlier discovered and identified the structure as part of the bridge between the Temple Mount and the Upper City in his 1845/46 writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Article about Filming the Excavators of Jerusalem |url=http://www.biblicalproductions.com/articles-dynamic-inner.asp?item_id=18 |website=Biblical Productions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234931/http://www.biblicalproductions.com/articles-dynamic-inner.asp?item_id=18 |archive-date=March 27, 2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, Tobler passed on information about the arch to Wilson, whose name was linked to the arch because he was the one who publicized the find.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.welcometohosanna.com/JERUSALEM_TOUR/herodian2.htm|publisher=Welcome to Hosanna|section= Jerusalem tour|title=Herodian|accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and purpose==
The Arch was "rediscovered" in 1963 by [[Duke University]] archeologist Dr. D. F. Stinespring, Professor of Old Testament and Semitics at the Duke Divinity School, who continued his exploration of the "hidden tunnels" associated with the ancient Temple during the university's summer breaks.&lt;ref name="duke"&gt;{{citation |title=Duke Researcher Finds Ancient Hall of Greeks |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y3RAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N1cMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7208,5230545&amp;dq=wilson%27s-arch&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Robesonian |date=September 26, 1966 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of its original construction is disputed, as some scholars date it to before the destruction of Herod's temple in AD 70, while others place it much later, to the Arab [[Umayyad|Umayyad Period]], 651–750.&lt;ref name="photos"&gt;[http://www.holylandphotos.org/browse.asp?s=1,2,6,19,48&amp;img=IJNTRT01 HolyLandPhotos.org], retrieved March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Stinesbring believed that the Arch had not been rebuilt, believing that the way it was bonded to the wall around the Temple indicated it was part of the plan during Herod's time: "a definitive part of the ancient Temple structure."&lt;ref name="duke"/&gt;  Today, scholars do agree that the site of this current arch was the beginning of a series of arches that spanned the central valley, connecting the Temple Mount to Jerusalem's western hills.&lt;ref name="photos"/&gt; It is believed by those who date the arch to the later period that it was a replacement for an earlier arch erected during the [[Second Temple]] period.&lt;ref name="construction"&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=64 TheKotel.org, Wilson's Arch], retrieved March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars who now date the arch's construction to the period under Arab rule during the seventh and eighth centuries AD base their conclusions on what they see as evidence from the period of excavation after the [[Six-Day War]], when Israel's [[Ministry of Religious Services|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] began to excavate the area of the Western Wall still unexposed, and dig a tunnel beneath the existing structures above. During much of the time of these excavations, which went on 1968–82 and was restarted in 1985, the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]]'s (IAA) District Archeologist for Jerusalem was [[Dan Bahat]], who became the archaeologist of the site after resigning from IAA. In his book, ''[http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=21&amp;Issue=6&amp;ArticleID=2 Jerusalem Down Under: Tunneling Along Herod's Temple Mount Wall]'', he writes that the evidence found was enough to convince him that despite earlier beliefs that the arch was built during Herod's time, the later dating is correct.&lt;ref name= "bas"&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/newsletter/library-explorer-10-07-10.html Bib-Arch.org], retrieved March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the evidence of the excavations, the arch once spanned {{convert|42|ft|m}}, and although it once was {{convert|75|ft|m}} high, carrying a road over the valley and the pavement constructed during the time of [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s rule, only a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} portion is visible today.&lt;ref name="Jer101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="follow"&gt;[http://www.followtherabbi.com/Brix?pageID=4998 FollowTheRabbi.com], accessed March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact dimensions of the bridge over the arch that was heavily used during the Second Temple Period are impossible to determine, it is believed that it was destroyed by Jewish rebels during the revolt against the Romans, to help prevent their taking of the Temple Mount. After the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem, the walls surrounding the mountain were renovated and the arches of the "Great Bridge" were rebuilt.&lt;ref name="construction"/&gt;

According to the writings of [[Josephus]], the arch was a part of a bridge that connected the Temple Mount to the Upper City on the Western Hill, and carried water by aqueduct from [[Solomon's Pools]] to the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name="Jer101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3211052 Jstor.org], retrieved March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings include mention of the bridge during the 63 BC attack by [[Pompey]], "Aristobulus's party was worsted, and retired into the Temple, and cut off the communication between the Temple and the city, by breaking down the bridge that joined them together," and during [[Titus]]'s attack in 70 AD, "...a bridge that connected the Upper City to the Temple."&lt;ref name="walks"&gt;[http://www.biblewallks.com/Sites/SecondTempleGates.html Biblewalks.com], retrieved March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Along with [[Robinson's Arch]] (the arch on the opposite side of that portion of the Western Wall used for Jewish prayers today, named for [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]], the explorer who identified it in the 19th century), it was one of the largest free-standing masonry arches in the world during the time it was constructed and utilized.&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt; The "majestic size and the enormous stones testify to Herod's magnificent aspirations."&lt;ref name="follow"/&gt;

The arch is located below the Chain Road leading to today's Chain Gate,&lt;ref name="planet"&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/jerusalem/wilsons-arch-isr-jr-jwa.htm Planetware.com], accessed March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and a square shaft cut down under the arch allows sighting of the wall's original massive foundations, "with fourteen courses of dressed stone below the present ground level."&lt;ref name="planet"/&gt; Over the prayer hall area within the Arch is the large building known as the "Makhkama" or "Tankiziah," that includes a porch looking over the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name="goren"&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=63 TheKotel.org, Makhama], retrieved March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Former Chief Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] used to use that porch to recite special "Kinot" prayers on the night of [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref name="goren"/&gt;

===The Western Stone===
The [[Western Stone]], located in the north section of the Arch, is a [[Monolithic architecture|monolithic]] stone block forming part of the lower level of the Western Wall. Weighing 570 [[tonnes]] (628 [[ton]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title= The Story of the Kotel: Facts and Figures – The Western Wall Tunnels

| publisher = Western Wall Heritage Foundation
}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of [[List of largest monoliths in the world|the largest building blocks in the world]]. The stone is 13.6 meters (44.6&amp;nbsp;ft) long, 4.5 meters (15&amp;nbsp;ft) wide and has an estimated height of 3.5 meters (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft).  It is considered to be one of the heaviest objects ever lifted by human beings without powered machines.  It is the largest building stone found in Israel and second in the world. It is only partially intact, the rest was destroyed in 70 CE during the Roman siege of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[Touching the Stones of our Heritage by Prof. Dan Bahat],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation and restoration==
In 1968, only a few months after the [[Six-Day War]], Israel began excavations to uncover the portion of the Western Wall that was not exposed.&lt;ref name="digs"&gt;Avrahami, Avner, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/the-eternal-rock-for-nis-18-1.129530 "The Eternal Rock for NIS 18," ''Haaretz'', July 26, 2004], retrieved March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the excavations continued, the opening to the arch was uncovered, and rubble began to be removed.&lt;ref name="digs" /&gt; It would take 17 years, until 1985, until the entire length of the wall would be cleared.&lt;ref name="digs" /&gt;

In 2005, the [[Western Wall Heritage Foundation]] initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi Rabinovich, then-rabbi of the wall ("Rabbi of the Kotel," as the title is usually referenced, using the Hebrew word for the Wall).&lt;ref name="kotel"&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=3 English.thekotel.org], retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaa-conservation.org.il/Projects_Item_eng.asp?id=49&amp;subject_id=10&amp;site_id=3 iaa-conservation.org], retrieved March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]]i workers renovated and restored the area for three years, strengthening the arch in preparation for access for visitors and use for prayer.&lt;ref name="kotel" /&gt; Scaffolding remained in place for over a year to allow workers to remove cement that had been applied as patches over the stone.&lt;ref name="kotel" /&gt;

The restoration included additions to the men's section included a [[Torah ark]] that can house over one hundred [[Torah scroll]]s, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, and heating for the winter and air conditioning for the summer.&lt;ref name="kotel" /&gt; There is also a new room built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall.&lt;ref name="kotel" /&gt;

New construction also included a women's section and gallery, which was dedicated on May 25, 2006, a little more than two months after the March dedication ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=803&amp;CatId=2 The Kotel, note about May 25, 2006.], retrieved March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This addition creates a woman's section to allow separate seating during worship services and special events conducted within the Wilson's Arch prayer area, including Bar Mitzvah ceremonies, and advertisements for special programs such as the middle-of-the-night prayers climaxing the six-week "Shoavim" period have made a point of reminding women that this new area exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130020 IsraelNationalNews.com], retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/roncoleman/377540109/in/photostream Flickr.com photo of women's gallery], retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, this new construction allows women for the first time to "take part in the services held inside under the Arch."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=628&amp;CatId=4 English.TheKotel.org], retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2008, United States [[First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]] visited the new women's section during her visit to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=1954&amp;CatId=2 English.thekotel.org "today" section], retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2010, a [[Ner Tamid]], an oil-burning "eternal light," was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall.&lt;ref name="ner"&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=2715&amp;CatId=4 Thekotel.org, note for July 25, 2010], retrieved March 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests have been made for many years that "an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple, especially in the closest place to where they used to stand."&lt;ref name="ner" /&gt;

==Special events==
[[File:USNAVY Kotel Service.jpg|thumb|right|1983 interfaith service.]]
In 1983, a highly unusual interfaith service was conducted in the area under Wilson's Arch—the first interfaith service ever to be conducted at the Western Wall since it came under Israeli control.  Attended by both men and women who were allowed to sit together, it was conducted under the supervision of the Israel [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Israel)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]], and led by U.S. Navy Chaplain (Rabbi) [[Arnold Resnicoff]]. Ministry of Affairs representative Yonatan Yuval was present, responding to press queries that this service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Post'', Sep 5, 1983, and ''Jerusalem Post'' International Edition, Sep 11–17, 1983, "U.S. Navy Chaplain Conducts Western Wall Interfaith Litany"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnf.org/about-jnf/in-your-area/speakers/perspectives-on-israel/rabbi-arnold-e-resnicoff.html JNF.org], retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-day-in-1983-when-the-israeli-government-gave-its-blessing-to-a-mixed-gender-prayer-service-at-the-western-wall Borschel-Dan, Amanda, "The Day Israel Gave Its Blessing to Egalitarian Prayer at Western Wall," The Times of Israel, Jun 30, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the restoration, a growing number of worship events have been scheduled in the area, to take advantage of the cover and temperature control, especially for services at night that are traditionally recited at the Wall.&lt;ref name="night"&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=131&amp;CatId=4 The Kotel.org, note on February 3, 2006.], retrieved March 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Tikkun Chatzot," a [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] midnight prayer for redemption has been conducted there, with a number of public figures in attendance.&lt;ref name="night"/&gt;

The area has also been utilized during times when security concerns make it difficult to allow the use of the outdoor prayer plaza, such as the March 19, 2009 visit of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to the Wall and Temple Mount.&lt;ref name="pope"&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=80 TheKotel.org, Lag B'omer 2009], retrieved March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the Pope's visit coincided with the Jewish festival of [[Lag B'Omer]], the decision had been made to close the Wall and not allow services, but at the request of the Wall's rabbi, [[Shmuel Rabinowitz]], the government allowed worship to be conducted in the area within the Arch.&lt;ref name="pope"/&gt; The original decision to close the entire prayer area to Jewish worship had begun to elicit negative reaction as soon as the decision was announced, between one and two months before the visit.&lt;ref name="ynews"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3693590,00.html 'Pope's visit won't stop us from praying at Western Wall'], YnetNews.com, retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Rabinowitz, protesting the decision, was quoted as saying that "It's inconceivable that the pope's visit would hurt worshippers at the Western Wall, some of whom have been praying there daily."&lt;ref name="ynews"/&gt; Part of the reaction was a threat to assemble and protest on the part of some Israelis, saying the police would have to "drag" them out of the area.&lt;ref name="ynews"/&gt; News articles quoted one comment that, "Just like the visit of a chief rabbi at the Vatican doesn't cause the Vatican to shut down, we expect the same approach when the pope visits a place holy to the Jewish people."&lt;ref name="ynews"/&gt; The decision to utilize the prayer area within Wilson's Arch, allowing worship during the Pope's visit, was eventually announced by the [[Israel Police]] and the Israel Security Agency ([[Shin Bet|ISA/Shin Bet]]).&lt;ref name="isa"&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/131159 IsraelNationalNews.com], retrieved March 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Worshippers were allowed into the main plaza during the hours prior to the Pope's scheduled arrival, but moved into the enclosed Wilson's Arch prayer before his actual arrival.&lt;ref name="isa"/&gt;

Video and audio streaming of some special events are available online from the "Wilson's Arch camera" ([[webcam]]).&lt;ref name="night"/&gt; It does not operate on [[Shabbat]], the Jewish Sabbath, or on those [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holy days]] when photography is prohibited by Jewish [[halakha|religious law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=178 The kotel.org, Events], retrieved March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">The '''World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company''' was created by [[New York City]] with funding from the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) in July 2004, as directed by Public Law 108-7.  The law provides up to $1 billion to create an insurance company to cover the risks assumed by the city and its contractors working without commercial insurance coverage, in claims resulting from work done subsequent to the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_08-21_Jun08.pdf "A Review of the World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company", [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], OIG-08-21, June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

WTC Captive has been criticized by Congressman [[Jerrold Nadler]] for spending $103,700,734 on legal fees while paying out only $320,936 in medical claims.

On June 10, 2010, a new settlement was announced giving plaintiffs $712.5 million and reducing payouts to lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/nyregion/11zero.html "New Ground Zero Deal Gives Plaintiffs $712.5 Million", By A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">'''Þorri''' ({{IPA-is|ˈθɔrːi}}) is the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name of the personification of [[frost]] or [[winter]] in [[Norse mythology]], and also the name of the fourth winter month (mid January to mid February) in the [[Icelandic calendar]].

In the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'' (written in the 13th century), Þorri (often written '''Thorri''' in English) is a [[legendary king|legendary Nordic king]], the son of  [[Snær]] ('Snow') the Old, a descendant of [[Fornjót]]. Þorri was father of two sons named [[Nór]] and Gór and a daughter named Gói ('thin snow, track-snow').

The saga ''[[Hversu Noregr byggðist]]'' ("How Norway was settled", written in the 12th century) states that Þorri was an ancient king of Finland (which until the 17th century CE referred only to [[Finland Proper]], the southwesternmost part of Finland), [[Kvenland|Kænlandi]] (which according to the sources was located just north of Finland Proper, i.e. in [[Satakunta]]) and [[Gotland]], and that the "Kænir" offered a yearly sacrifice to Þorri, at [[mid-winter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/HversuNoregrDasent.html English translation of "How Norway was settled" by Dasent 1894]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikko Heikkilä (2012), [http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2012/Heikkila.pdf On the Etymology of Certain Names in Finnic Mythology] (also based on Dasent translation of "How Norway was settled"), SKY Journal of Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both the month name and the name of the midwinter sacrifice, [[Þorrablót]], are derived from the personal name Þorri. ''Orkneyinga saga'' by contrast states that the Þorrablót was established ''by'' Þorri.

The name Þorri has long been identified with that of  [[Þór]], the name of the Norse thunder god, or [[thunder]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Friedrich Creuzer, Franz Joseph Mone, ''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen'', Heyer und Leske, 1822, p. 275.
&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the Þorrablót was in origin a sacrifice dedicated to Þór himself, and the figure of Þorri is a secondary [[etymology]] derived from the name of the sacrifice. Nilsson thinks that the personification of Þorri "frost" and Goi "track-snow" was particular to Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Primitive Time-Reckoning; A Study in the Origins and First Development of the Art of Counting Time'' (1920), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pagan sacrifice of Þorrablót disappeared with the [[Christianisation of Iceland]], but in the 19th century, a midwinter festival called Þorrablót was introduced in [[Romantic nationalism]], and is still popular in contemporary Iceland, since the 1960s associated with a selection of traditional food, called [[Þorramatur]]. Regardless of actual etymology, it is a [[folk etymology|popular explanation]] of the name Þorri to take it as a diminutive of Þór&lt;ref&gt;Árni Björnsson, Icelandic feasts and holidays, 1980, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains common practice to toast Þór as part of the modern celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Evans, Iceland, Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84162-215-6}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
